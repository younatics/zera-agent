THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News! It's June 2nd. And in our penultimate program of the school year, we're starting things off on Wall Street. First Up: Headlines . AZUZ: Talking about the stock market, and yesterday was not a good one. Experts use the Dow Jones Industrial Average to get an idea of how the whole market is doing. The Dow dropped 280 points yesterday. That is the worst drop since last August. Next up today, northern Africa, where Libyan Leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces are fighting against rebels in a civil war. Other countries are involved in this, too. The U.S., Britain, France: They're part of a military coalition that's being led by NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The goal of that coalition is to protect Libya's civilians during this civil war, and NATO says it's extending that mission for another 90 days. A lot of what the coalition's been doing is carrying out air strikes, like these. They're targeting Colonel Gadhafi's forces, his compounds, and trying to limit his military resources. The conflict in Libya has been going on since February. Recently, several top officials have left Gadhafi's government. That includes some generals in the Libyan army. One official who left the government yesterday said that it's in shambles. Debt Ceiling Debate . AZUZ: Turning to the U.S. government now, where a big topic on Capitol Hill is the country's debt ceiling. That is the amount of debt that the government is allowed to have. President Obama wants the ceiling raised. Republicans in Congress say they won't do that unless the government makes some cuts in spending. In fact, on Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted against the idea of raising the debt ceiling without making spending cuts. Christine Romans is here to help us get a better picture of what's going on. Christine, let's start off with the question, what exactly is the debt ceiling? (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR: It's basically America's credit limit. Congress sets the cap on how much money the country can spend to pay its bills and to pay our interest payments. The debt ceiling is sort of like the credit limit on your credit card bill, only much, much bigger. And think of it this way: if you're running a $3,000 balance on a $10,000 credit limit, the U.S. government, we run right up to our credit limit over and over again. And instead of paying it off, we just raise the debt limit. How big is this pile of debt? $14.3 trillion. More precisely, $14,293,975,000,000. This is money the government has already spent. Stacked on top of each other -- this is just to give you an illustration -- $14 trillion would reach from the Earth to the moon more than four times. Your share of this pile of debt: about $47,000 for every man, woman and child in America. We hit our debt ceiling, the debt limit, on May 16th. How are we operating now? The treasury secretary is juggling the bills that are coming in to keep the country from defaulting. He says we can go until August 2nd. After that, the situation, he says, is critical. Secretary Geithner says not raising the debt limit so America can pay its bills would be ""catastrophic."" It's like being, he says, a homeowner with only enough money to pay some of the bills. You either pay the mortgage or you pay the credit card bills. Which one are you going to pick? The government would like to pick and choose, would have to pick and choose what to pay. Geithner says some bills won't get paid. Checks to millions of Americans, like Social Security, perhaps, would have to stop. Republicans say he's wrong. The U.S. won't default so long as we keep making interest payments on our bonds. All of it, a big political debate now. But here you go, you guys: Congress has raised the debt ceiling 74 times since 1962; 10 times just since 2001. This is the first time it's been so critical politically and turned into such a big ideological fight. For more information and complete coverage of the debt ceiling debate, you can check out more at CNNMoney.com. (END VIDEO) Political Check . AZUZ: Thank you, Christine. November 6, 2012 might sound like a ways away, but some people are working toward something that's going to happen on that day: the U.S. presidential election. Campaign season is here, and before we head off for the summer, we want to give you an idea of where things stand. On the Democratic side, President Obama has announced that he's running for another term in office. But whom will he be running against? That will get decided through primary elections. Those start happening once we get to 2012, and several Republicans have announced their candidacy. That includes former CEO and talk show host Herman Cain, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, U.S. Representative Ron Paul and former governors Gary Johnson and Tim Pawlenty. Another name you might know -- former governor Mitt Romney - is expected to announce his candidacy today. Some other big names have already said they won't be running, and there's always the possibility that more candidates will join the field. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Shimasaki's social studies classes at Valley High School in Santa Ana, California. What do these signal flags mean? You know what to do. Is it: A) Diver down, B) Stop immediately, C) Hurricane warning or D) Man overboard? You've got three seconds -- GO! This double flag is the signal for a hurricane warning. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Hurricane Season . AZUZ: Hurricane season is on! In the Atlantic Ocean, it lasts from June through November. That's not the only time hurricanes can form, it's just the time when they're most likely to form. Forecasters who make predictions about how many hurricanes might form say this year is likely to be an above-average season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, is predicting 12 to 18 named storms. It expects six to 10 of those to become hurricanes, with three to six strengthening into major hurricanes. Last year, zero hurricanes made landfall in the U.S., but experts say it's always important to be prepared. Shuttle Program . AZUZ: Coming in for a final landing: the space shuttle Endeavour touched down at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Wednesday morning. It was the shuttle's 25th and last mission. And this is the crew that did it: Endeavour's astronauts, led by shuttle commander Mark Kelly, who said it was sad to see Endeavour land for the last time. As that ship heads into retirement, this is the one that will close out NASA's space shuttle program: Atlantis, waiting on the launch pad, scheduled to go up on July 8th in the last shuttle mission. Profits into Food . AZUZ: In Charlotte, North Carolina, there's a restaurant that works on a kind of ""pay it forward"" concept. When you buy a meal there, you're also paying to help feed other people who are in need. Tom Foreman looks at the ingredients that make up this unique story. (BEGIN VIDEO) TOM FOREMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In busy downtown Charlotte, by lunchtime folks have built up an appetite. So at the King's Kitchen Restaurant, that's when the real building begins, because Chef Jim Noble's goal every day is to help his diners help their community. CHEF JIM NOBLE, KING'S KITCHEN: And I think everybody wants to help. They just don't know how. FOREMAN: Noble is one of the state's most renowned chefs and deeply religious. So, he opened the King's Kitchen a year and a half ago as a non-profit restaurant. The money made here goes to programs that feed the poor throughout the community. Last year, $50,000. Mindful of recessionary pitfalls that could derail this effort, the chef started by raising enough donations to open without any loans. NOBLE: This is not the best time in the world to get in debt in a restaurant, you know. So, we wanted to do this debt-free. Number five. And what does that say? FOREMAN: The restaurant also offers job training for jobless people, folks such as Philip Lewis, who joined the program less than two months ago when he heard about it at church. PHILIP LEWIS, KING'S KITCHEN: I've got more than I've asked for here. Faith, finances, everything I needed this place has given me. It's a life-changing place. No matter where you are in your life, it will bring something positive to it that wasn't there before. FOREMAN: Sure, this non-profit restaurant competes with Chef Noble's for-profit places, but he has faith there is room for all. NOBLE: Sometimes in life, you have to make a distinction between success and significance. FOREMAN: And for him, the significance lies in knowing every plate that goes out of the kitchen here means poor people are being fed all over town. Tom Foreman, CNN, Charlotte, North Carolina. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, when the weather's not fit for man nor beast, I guess you could send this out. It's called the Big Dog. And it's an all-terrain robot that can run, climb and carry heavy loads. It's also designed to absorb shock. The guy's not being mean; he's just showing off the Big Dog's stability. It handled the kick all right. Maybe not quite so stable on the ice. Someone could invent artificial little creatures that attack the Big Dog. Goodbye .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- New NATO airstrikes shook Tripoli into early Tuesday after the alliance's secretary-general dismissed complaints that the allied campaign against longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi had fallen into a stalemate. At least three rounds of explosions echoed across the Libyan capital in a three-hour span that began late Monday, and the roar of jets could be heard overhead. Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told CNN that the warplanes hit administrative buildings in central Tripoli, and that a nearby hospital was ""indirectly"" affected. ""Tonight was an exceptional night in Tripoli,"" Ibrahim said, noting that the strikes followed ""an extended period of calm."" ""It is very sad,"" he said. ""We are losing people every day on both sides. We think it is time to sit down and talk."" NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi's forces and government installations since March 31 as Gadhafi attempts to put down a nearly three-month-old revolt against his rule. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN on Monday that Gadhafi and his regime ""have no future,"" but refused to predict how long the Libyan leader could hold on. Rasmussen denied that the situation in Libya had devolved into a ""stalemate,"" insisting that NATO was ""making progress"" and had ""taken out"" a substantial part of Gadhafi's military capability. He said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end, but ""It's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as Gadhafi remains in power."" Despite the ongoing bombardment, Gadhafi's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of Misrata, survivors there have told CNN. Misrata is the only city in western Libya held by the rebels, and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones, burns and amputations. ""They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods. It has become an operation of revenge, not just taking over the city of Misrata,"" said Ibrahim al-Neairy, a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to Benghazi. Mostafa Bozen, a spokesman for the rebels, said fighters attacked Gadhafi's forces about 22 kilometers (14 miles) from Tripoli, killing 12 and hitting a tank. The situation in Misrata ""is at the forefront"" of U.N. concerns about Libya's civilian population, Valerie Amos, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council on Monday. Two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city's port has prevented aid ships from docking there, and between 150 and 300 non-Libyans are still waiting to be evacuated, she said. ""Some people are running short of food, water and other basics,"" she said. ""Medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel."" The Security Council voted in March to authorize the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi's regime. Nearly 750,000 people have fled the country, another 58,000 are displaced within Libya and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into Libya, Tunisia and Niger, Amos said. For those who remain, Amos said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on Gadhafi and his allies have caused ""a severe disruption of supply lines within the country."" The results have been ""shortages of fuel, difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs, medicines and other essential goods, and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country."" Western Libya has about three months' supply of food remaining; the mostly rebel-held east has about two months, she said. Fuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many Libyans ""are running out,"" she added. There have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time. As time wears on, though, human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged Libyans in Misrata. The wounded arriving in Benghazi, the rebel hub city, painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in Misrata. Hanan Muhammad, who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the International Organization for Migration, was wounded when a missile struck near her home. ""I was in my house praying when the first missile landed. Shortly after, more missiles, one after another started hitting our neighborhood,"" said Muhammad, who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds. ""Terror. Fear. People are scared every moment of the day no matter their age,"" she said. ""Oh God, it's like a horror movie."" Al-Neairy, who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds, said he does not regret fighting. ""The price for freedom is high and it (is) necessary to be liberated from this regime,"" he said. Amnesty International has said Gadhafi's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes. A report issued last week by the monitoring group accused pro-Gadhafi forces of the ""unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks, including use of heavy artillery, rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents."" ""I'm not going to guess about a timeline. I want a solution sooner rather than later,"" Rasmussen said. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Sara Sidner and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO jets hit Tripoli late Monday and early Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is playing defense against brain injuries for student athletes. Christie signed a bill into law Tuesday requiring public and private school coaches to remove any athlete from play who shows signs of a concussion. Students who suffer a concussion will also need clearance from a physician before they can compete again. All New Jersey public and private school districts are required to develop policies to handle head injuries. ""This is not about someone not willing to play hard in whatever sport they're in,"" Christie said. ""This is about protecting someone's long-term health from being overwhelmed by the sense of competition we sometimes feel in our country."" Christie signed the bill at the New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. He was joined by National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell, New York Jets Chairman and CEO Woody Johnson, and several former New York Giants defensive players. New guidelines for diagnosing concussions . Calvin Lowe is the starting quarterback for Timber High School football team in Erial, New Jersey. He suffered a concussion during last year's state championship game. Following a successful recovery, he continues to play football as his parents cheer him on from the sidelines. Considering many of the same mandates already occur at Timber Creek High School, the new law is a ""good thing,"" said Curtis Lowe, Calvin's father. ""In a lot of cases state law overreacts, but when it comes to the mental health of a child, it's a good thing,"" Lowe said. ""Most parents don't know what happens."" Concussions are generally caused by a blow to the head and can lead to long-term neurological problems. Scrutiny of concussions among professional and student athletes alike comes in the wake of the NFL becoming more vigilant about ejecting and/or suspending players who have made flagrant hits, and in the aftermath of an incident in which Rutgers defensive end Eric LeGrand was paralyzed from the neck down after his tackle on an Army player during a kickoff return. Concussions extra dangerous for teen brains . Concussions among student athletes at Timber Creek prompted the south Jersey school to be proactive when it comes to players. ""We're been more cautious than most schools,"" said Robert Hinson, head football coach at Timber Creek. ""I'd be really surprised if after this a coach doesn't pull a kid out it he suspects any concussion-related effect."" Student athletes at Timber Creek are required to take an ImPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) computerized evaluation prior to starting the season, to establish a baseline for their neurocognitive assessment, Hinson said. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 3.8 million sports- and recreation-related concussions occur every year. Experts say the vast majority of concussions are suffered at the high school level, but few schools have rules governing how concussion is treated, and few coaches are trained to identify it. Calvin Lowe's father welcomes the attention. ""It's a good thing to get educated and to sit out,"" Curtis Lowe said. ""My son had a favorable outcome but some other parents the results were different.""","The law requires school coaches to pull players if there are concussion signs .

"(CNN) -- Spanish motorcyclist Dani Pedrosa won the German Grand Prix on Sunday to leave the MotoGP championship battle finely poised going into the second half of the 2011 season. Titleholder Jorge Lorenzo reduced Casey Stoner's overall lead to just 15 points after nine races, with the Spaniard overtaking Pedrosa's Repsol Honda teammate at the last corner to claim second place. Pedrosa missed three races with a broken collarbone, but last year's championship runner-up has now climbed to fifth -- 74 points behind Stoner -- with his third victory at the Sachsenring circuit in motorcycling's elite class and fifth overall, having placed eighth on his return in Italy. Underlining his reputation as one of the fastest starters in the sport, the 25-year-old surged ahead of pole-sitter Stoner as the race developed into a battle between the three main protagonists. Stoner claims pole for German MotoGP . Each of them held the lead, but Pedrosa made the decisive move on lap 21 of 30 when he powered past Lorenzo's Yamaha. Andrea Dovizioso retained third place overall, 36 points behind Australian teammate Stoner, as he came home fourth ahead of American Ben Spies and fellow Italian Marco Simoncelli. Spanish rider Alvaro Bautista gave Suzuki a notable seventh place as he headed off the Ducatis of former world champions Nicky Hayden and Valentino Rossi. Rossi, seven times the sport's No. 1 rider but struggling in his first season with his home team, is still fourth overall -- four points ahead of Pedrosa and 13 clear of Hayden. Meanwhile, Stoner and Lorenzo have revealed that they will not take part in the rescheduled Japanese Grand Prix in October. Both ride for Japanese teams, but do not want to take part at the Motegi circuit -- which is some 100 kilometers from the Fukushima nuclear plant damaged during March's earthquake and tsunami. ""I will not go and most riders have the same opinion,"" Stoner said at a press conference on Saturday. ""That's my opinion and I've had it for some time. Not as long as Jorge. I took more time to make my decision, but I will not go there. I guess it's up to the organizers to figure out what's going to happen. ""If a similar thing happened near my home in Australia I wouldn't be going back there. It'd be the same situation."" Lorenzo said he was not interested in negotiations with MotoGP officials about the matter. ""I took this decision not to go to Japan a long time ago,"" the 24-year-old said. ""So I am not active in the ongoing discussions about going to Japan because I have already made my decision. ""I think if we can help Japan in another way we will, but I think going there is not real support.""","Dani Pedrosa triumphs in his second race back after a broken collarbone .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A summer with budget-busting gasoline prices seems like the worst time to launch a cross-country road trip from California to Georgia, but this one is different: We're road-testing alternative fuel that might help reduce pollution and break the nation's reliance on foreign oil. CNN.com's Cody McCloy, left, and co-pilot Brian Hardy set out on their biofuel experiment on July 28. The gasoline alternative is called biodiesel, and it's made by chemically modifying vegetable oil. The resulting biodiesel is nontoxic, biodegradable and can be blended at any level with regular diesel. Most diesel cars can run on it, and it can be found in more and more places around the country. Watch Web developer Brian Hardy and I make a two-week journey from California's San Francisco Bay area to Atlanta, Georgia, on CNN.com Live. During our road trip, we're blogging and reporting about what kind of mileage we're getting with biodiesel fuel and how easy it is to find places that sell it.  See Cody's road trip photos » . Biodiesel is just one of several biofuels powering more and more U.S. cars and trucks. Mesa, Arizona, for example, has switched its fleet of 1,000 municipal vehicles such as fire engines and street sweepers to biodiesel and other green fuels such as ethanol, and compressed natural gas.  Watch a quick tour of Cody's vehicle » . Some biofuels are less expensive per gallon than gasoline -- cutting the average cost of gas by 20 to 35 cents per gallon, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. An average American family can save up to $300 per year by using ethanol, according to the DOE Web site. Biodiesel fuel, however, is not always cheaper than gasoline -- although it is made using renewable resources, such as vegetable oil or used cooking oil.  The pros and cons of alternative fuels » . Atlanta-area biodiesel dealer Rob Del Bueno says -- if you really think about it -- it's amazing how something as simple as a gallon of fuel can move a heavy multi-ton vehicle down the road. ""We think fuel is expensive, but for what you get, the price that you pay at the pump is so insignificant to what's really going on."" But Department of Energy chemical engineer John Scahill warns that the price of petroleum -- now at about $125 per barrel -- will become ""prohibitively expensive within our lifetime."" About $333 billion exited the United States in 2007 due to the purchase of oil, according to Scahill, illustrating the high cost of importing foreign energy. Biofuel is produced and sold in the United States -- which keeps money from those transactions circulating inside the U.S. economy. ""About 140 billion gallons of gasoline per year are used for transportation in the United States,"" said Scahill, ""and we can save about a third of that if we maximize our use of biofuels."" Our biodiesel vehicle is a 1978 International Harvester Scout that we purchased in San Jose, California, just for this adventure. We trust this all-terrain classic will serve us well on our trip.

"Moscow (CNN) -- ""Putin's Army,"" a new group of female fans loyal to Russia's prime minister, is calling upon all ""young, smart and beautiful"" women in the country who ardently support Vladimir Putin to produce amateur video clips that show how far they would go to express their affection for him. The community, which was launched in Russia's popular social networking sites VKontakte and LiveJournal, claims to have united some 800 followers behind the idea of Putin running in the March 2012 presidential election. It is not clear who exactly is behind this initiative, but the first video posted features a glamorous blonde who describes herself as student named Diana. ""I'm crazy about the person who has changed our country. He is a prominent politician and an awesome man. His name is Vladimir Putin. Millions of people adore and trust him,"" Diana says in the narrative accompanying the video. ""We are launching a contest with very simple rules. Shoot your own video as you tear up something -- or someone -- in the name of Putin. Then post your video in the VKontakte group. Those of you who produce the most original video will become the owner of an iPad 2. Tell us what YOU would do for your president,"" Diana says. Putin -- who already served two terms as the country's president from 2000 to 2008 -- has not announced yet whether he or his protege, incumbent Dmitry Medvedev, would run for the top office post again next year. On numerous occasions in the past few years, both Putin and Medvedev said they would sit down together and decide that soon. In the video sequence, which features club music in the background, Diana walks along Moscow streets in high heels and a black suit. As she struts with an iPhone in hand, the camera occasionally focuses on her chest. Diana joins a pair of Putin-loving friends basking under the sun by the Moscow River. The young women then look at the ""Putin's Army"" web page together on a laptop before Diana scribbles ""I will tear off for Putin"" on a white tank top in red lipstick. Wearing that top in the closing shot, Diana tears it, briefly revealing an undergarment. The provocative video has netted hundreds of thousands of hits online since it was first posted Wednesday, and several parodies of the clip have already appeared on the Internet. ""Putin's Army"" promised that its future activities would rock the whole country, and that every girl participating in the contest would become an Internet star. The video contest will last until August 26, the group announced. The effort isn't the first public display of affection for the Russian premier. Last week, dozens of Putin supporters formed a flash mob in front of the main government building in Moscow and sang ""Blueberry Hill"" -- a song Putin performed at a charity gala concert in December. And last October, a group of female journalism students from Moscow State University posed in bikinis for a calendar -- a birthday gift to Putin. Putin has denounced attempts at glorifying his image or using his name in advertisements. Over the years, he has disassociated himself from various paintings, sculptures and songs that where devoted to him, saying such fuss deeply embarrasses him. But some Russian analysts say these kinds of spectacles could be attempts to grab the attention of politically indifferent young voters before an important election season. Russia's parliamentary elections will take place in December, and the presidential election will take place in March 2012.","Female Putin supporters who participate in an online video contest can win an iPad 2 .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesians headed to the polls Thursday to choose legislators for the world's most populous Muslim nation, a vote that will also determine which parties can field candidates for July's presidential election. A woman shows her finger after voting at a polling booth on Thursday in Jakarta. By noon, the balloting was proceeding peacefully. However, the country's Papua province was hit by violence early Thursday, when about 80 separatist rebels, armed with machetes and firearms, attacked a police station and burned down part of a university, police said. Both incidents happened in Jayapura in Papua, where a separatist movement has simmered for years. Thursday's vote is only the second direct election since the authoritarian regime of Suharto fell in 1998, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. Some 12,000 candidates from 38 parties are vying for parliament's 700 seats in a nation that for now is a largely moderate and democratic one.  Watch more about the vote » . Some analysts have pointed to signs that indicate Indonesia is on the path to becoming a conservative and fundamentalist nation. But Islamist parties are not expected to fare well this time around, partly because most voters are more concerned about economic issues, rather than religious or moral ones.  Watch what's at stake in the elections » . Current polls forecast that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's Democratic Party will be the only one to garner the necessary 20 percent of the 550 lower parliamentary seats -- or 25 percent of the national vote -- to nominate a presidential candidate. Other parties will likely form coalitions to put forward a candidate in the presidential race. That includes Golkar, the ruling party during Suharto's regime and the party of current Vice President Jusuf Kalla. The elections will also determine the makeup of Indonesia's 132-member Regional Representatives Council, as well as its provincial, county and city assemblies. More than 70 percent of Indonesia's 238 million people are expected to cast ballots. But even before the votes are cast, there are serious concerns about the legitimacy of the legislative election. The voting process is complicated: For the first time, Indonesians can vote for an individual within a party and not just for the party. New voting mechanisms are causing confusion and could lead to an increased number of invalid ballots. There are allegations of fraudulent voter lists as well. Several Indonesian students, and first-time voters, have voiced their disillusionment with the current parties and candidates. ""I choose not to vote,"" said Shohib, a student at State Islamic University in Jakarta. ""I am disappointed with the leaders."" ""I want someone who could lead Indonesia to be better ... who would hear people's aspirations and actually do something about it,"" said 18-year-old Wiendy Pranoto, a senior at Pesantran Al-Hamidiyah -- an Islamic school outside Jakarta. Analysts warn that if the elections are viewed as illegitimate, voters will lose confidence, and anger that lingers below the surface could erupt. Adding to the trouble is Indonesia's status as one of the most corrupt nations in the world, according to Transparency International. Those factors -- corruption and the economy -- are what experts say are allowing a conservative Muslim movement to gain momentum. That movement says the current government's lack of piety is causing the nation's problems. ""The prize for the global conservative movement is Indonesia,"" said political analyst Jeffery Winters. ""If Indonesia were to move in a direction of becoming a much more conservative Islamic state, it would trigger a number of consequences."" Most political parties have been running on a platform of anti-corruption. The governing Democratic Party has been taking action on corruption and is trying to capitalize on those gains. Analysts say that, barring a major crisis, Yudhoyono -- who is known as ""Mr. Clean"" because of his anti-corruption efforts and who is lauded for his handling of the 2004 tsunami recovery and leading an anti-terrorism fight -- will probably win a second term.

"(CNN) -- Unfancied Belarus once again frustrated France in Euro 2012 qualifying action on Friday, earning a 1-1 draw at home to the Group D leaders. The French won four successive games following September's 1-0 defeat to the East Europeans in Paris, but conceded a goal for the first time since then when defender Eric Abidal put through his own net in the 20th minute under pressure from Maksim Bordachev after a free-kick. However, Chelsea forward Florent Malouda equalized two minutes later after being set up by Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema as Les Bleus remained four points clear of their second-placed hosts. Belarus can close the gap by beating bottom nation Luxembourg on Tuesday, while Laurent Blanc's France team face Euro 2012 co-hosts Poland and Ukraine next week. Romania closed to within a point of Belarus with a 3-0 win at home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, with Adrian Mutu netting the opener and Ciprian Marica scoring twice before Cristian Sapunaru missed a penalty deep into injury-time. Germany notched a sixth win from six games in Group A as striker Mario Gomez scored both goals in a 2-1 win away to neighbors Austria. Gomez, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, scored late in each half with Austria leveling through Arne Friedrich's 50th-minute own goal. The Bayern Munich star pounced just before the break after clubmate Toni Kroos's corner was flicked on by Friedrich into his path. Friedrich turned David Alaba's cross  into his own net, but Gomez denied Austria -- seeking a first competitive win over their rivals since the 1978 World Cup -- when he headed in Philipp Lahm's last-minute cross. That put Joachim Low's team seven points clear of second-placed Belgium ahead of Tuesday's trip to Azerbaijan. Belgium, who have played an extra game, drew 1-1 with third-placed Turkey as Axel Witsel missed a second-half penalty in Brussels. Marvin Ogunjimi gave the hosts an early lead before Burak Y?lmaz leveled on 22, but Witsel blazed over the bar with 15 minutes left to keep Turkey's playoff hopes alive with Guus Hiddink's team one point back with a game in hand. Bottom side Kazakhstan beat Azerbaijan 2-1 in a result that left both nations on three points with one win each. Italy stayed five points clear in Group C with a 3-0 win at home to Estonia. Strikers Giuseppe Rossi and Antonio Cassano scored in the first half, while the latter's second-half replacement Giampaolo Pazzini wrapped up the Azzurri's fifth win from six matches. Second-placed Slovenia won 2-0 away to the Faroe Islands despite having Marko Suler sent off after only 25 minutes, but have played an extra game. Tim Matavz put the visitors ahead shortly after Suler's red card for a professional foul, adding to his hat-trick in October's home fixture, while Rogvi Baldvinsson headed into his own net just after halftime. Croatia went top of Group F with a 2-1 win at home to Georgia, moving two points clear of Greece. Georgia won the reverse fixture in March, and took the lead again through Jaba Kankava in the 17th minute. But goals from Mario Mandzukic and Nikola Kalinic in the final 15 minutes gave Slaven Bilic's team a welcome win, having earlier hit the woodwork three times. Greece can reclaim top spot by beating Malta on Saturday. Sweden boosted their hopes of finishing second in Group E by winning 4-1 away to Moldova, as striker Johan Elmander scored twice. The second-placed Swedes now trail unbeaten leaders the Netherlands by six points, having played one fewer game. Finland claimed a second win in five games to be on six points, winning 1-0 away to bottom nation San Marino thanks to striker Mikael Forssell's first-half winner. Group I's bottom side Liechtenstein picked up a 2-0 win at home to Lithuania for the principality's first points in five games.","France lead Group D by four points despite 1-1 draw with Belarus in Minsk .

"(CNN) -- Actress Angelina Jolie, a longtime goodwill ambassador for the United Nations' refugee agency, will be headed to Turkey this week to visit Syrian refugees, Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Jolie is expected to arrive in Istanbul and head to Hatay on Friday, according to the ministry, which accepted an application for her visit on Wednesday. More than 8,000 Syrians have fled their country for Turkey to escape violence, including a military offensive in the Jisr al-Shugur area.

"(CNN) -- Dead men tell no tales, but the sea does, as shown Friday when an anchor was recovered from the wreckage of pirate Blackbeard's flagship. An expedition off the North Carolina coast hoisted the nearly 3,000-pound anchor, one of three belonging to the Queen Anne's Revenge. Crews were working in just 20 feet of water, according to the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources. The Queen Anne's Revenge is believed to have run aground in the shallow waters off Beaufort in 1718. The ship was discovered in 1996, with piecemeal recovery of artifacts intensifying only a few years ago. Beachcomber stumbles upon historic shipwreck . Staff from the department's Underwater Archaeology Branch are focused on ""conducting a detailed assessment of the main mound to determine strategies for dis-assembly and recovery,"" according to the Queen Anne's Revenge website. Conservation of the anchor may take four years. The expedition is trying to score a trove of 18th-century goods, which will be used to educate the public and raise awareness of underwater preservation efforts. The site has already yielded more than 250,000 artifacts, including cannons, gold, platters, glass, beads, shackles and rope, according to the state. The largest exhibit of fully conserved artifacts from the shipwreck will open at the N.C. Maritime Museum in Beaufort on June 11, the Department of Cultural Resources said in a statement. Captain Kidd was funded by London's elite . An article published in March on the Smithsonian website said the Queen Anne's Revenge was found to have about 225,000 pieces of lead shot and at least 25 cannons, many of them still loaded. Romanticized in history books as a notorious ruffian, Blackbeard, born in Britain as Edward Teach, terrorized Atlantic seafarers from the shores of the American colonies to the Caribbean. In November 1718, the captain, believed to be in his late 30s, died in combat against British naval forces. He was on board another vessel, Adventure.","Wreckage of Queen Anne's Revenge lies off Beaufort, North Carolina .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's mid-June, a perfect time to visit the beach to watch porpoises play in the surf or seagulls strut the sand -- or you could watch a formation of Marine Corps warplanes darting over the shore at hundreds of miles per hour. But don't worry -- the United States hasn't declared war on your family's beach house. It's just part of a major Marine Corps exercise called Exercise Mailed Fist (translation: armored fist). The exercise is designed to test the capability of every type of Marine Corps aircraft, including MV-22 Ospreys and F/A 18 Hornets, as well as some Navy ships and Air Force planes. The drill will stretch from Quantico Marine Base in northern Virginia to the Navy's Pinecastle Bombing Range in Florida. With thousands of Marines and other service members involved, it's the biggest such drill ever on the U.S. East Coast. ""Exercise Mailed Fist is the first exercise of its specific kind and the largest 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing exercise conducted in recent history,"" said Staff Sgt. Roman J. Yurek, Marine Corps spokesman. ""In the past, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing units had to deploy to the West Coast to conduct this type of training."" Mailed Fist was not originally supposed to be one big exercise. But the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing's commander, Maj. Gen. Jon Davis, decided to combine several smaller drills into one big exercise. Not only do the Marines train closer to home, the Pentagon saves money. Most of the exercises will take place in the skies above or near Marine bases along the North and South Carolina coast. From Monday until Friday, vacationers ""who are located near the bases ... will see an increase in air and ground traffic at various times throughout the week, but there should be minimal impact on activity near beaches other than occasional fly-overs at relatively high altitudes,"" the spokesman said.","The largest Marine Corps exercise on the East Coast will begin Monday .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters made inroads into the massive wildfire in eastern Arizona Sunday, as authorities said the threat of spreading flames had decreased enough to allow thousands of residents in some of the hardest-hit areas to return home. ""After consulting with fire officials, it has been determined that the fire risk has diminished enough that it will no longer be a threat to the citizens of the towns,"" said Cmdr. Webb Hogle of the Apache County Sheriff's Office. But he said smoke from the wildfire ""still poses serious health hazards"" in Springerville, Eagar and South Fork, where authorities expect thousands to return home after evacuating. ""If they return, they do so at their own risk,"" he added. The 15-day-old blaze in eastern Arizona was 10% contained, fire officials said Sunday evening, up from 6% late Saturday. Still, the wildfire inched closer to becoming the worst fire in the state's history. The second-largest blaze had scorched 443,989 acres, firefighters said Sunday, an area bigger than most of the largest cities in the United States. The so-called Wallow fire is 24,649 acres shy of matching the Rodeo/Chediski wildfire of 2002, Arizona's biggest. Firefighters said they are making progress as they dig trenches, set their own fires to take away natural fuels from the advancing blaze and dump retardants from the air on the flames. It ""has been chasing us around, but after today we're feeling very optimistic,"" Jerome MacDonald, operations chief for the Southwest Interagency Incident Management team fighting the fire, told reporters late Saturday. The fire broke out May 29 in the Apache National Forest. Air quality for much of New Mexico and eastern Arizona was expected to worsen because of wildfires, the New Mexico health and environment officials said. Heavy smoke could affect those in sensitive groups, including children, pregnant woman, asthma sufferers and people with lung and heart diseases, the New Mexico Environment Department said. The National Weather Service said smoke plumes from Arizona wildfires will continue moving toward Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Heavy smoke has permeated communities around the Arizona blaze. ""We have not seen the sun clearly for several days,"" said Rita Baysinger, a spokeswoman for the Southwest Interagency Incident Management team. MacDonald said changing winds are likely to start clearing out the smoke. ""All the smoke from the fire has basically been funneling through Eagar in the valley and it settles there in the morning,"" MacDonald said. ""I don't expect the same kind of smoky conditions over the next couple of days."" At least 9,114 people were evacuated from Springerville, Eagar, Nutrioso, Alpine, Greer and surrounding areas. The wildfire has consumed 29 homes, 22 of them in the evacuated city of Greer.

"Seroe Colorado, Aruba (CNN) -- Police in Aruba launched a new search Monday for missing U.S. woman Robyn Gardner, but no body and no new clues were found, Aruban authorities said. The search area, a rugged terrain on the Dutch Caribbean Island, is covered with cactus and other treacherous desert plants. It included a section next to the Correctional Institute of Aruba, where the only suspect connected to the case is being held. The area was selected as a result of information authorities gained after interrogating Gary Giordano, and other information, said Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein. Police would not go into detail about ""other information"" they had obtained. Search teams, including approximately 45 police officers, cadets and Red Cross volunteers, spread out in long lines and walked an area north of the Seroe Colorado lighthouse, just a few miles from Baby Beach and Nanki Point, where Giordano says Gardner disappeared while snorkeling. Along the way firefighters drove their fire trucks down dirt paths and through thick undergrowth into areas where searchers found old well holes. They lowered themselves down ladders and ropes to search for any sign of Gardner. Giordano, 50, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, has told investigators that he went snorkeling with Gardner on August 2 and that she failed to return to shore with him. According to a transcript, obtained exclusively by CNN, Giordano told police that he feared for his life when he signaled for Gardner to turn back and didn't look for her as he swam for shore. ""I only looked back when I hit a rock,"" the document quotes Giordano as telling investigators. ""Before that, I did not look back. I was only busy saving my life."" Gardner had been snorkeling before and was a comfortable swimmer, he said. He showed police scrapes on his legs, but he said he did not know how they happened. Stein said police have interviewed several witnesses in the case, but would not confirm or deny new reports suggesting a fisherman saw the couple leave the beach together. Police have previously said no one saw Gardner and Giordano snorkeling. Giordano and Gardner flew to Aruba on July 31. A judge ordered last Monday that Giordano could be held until August 31 in connection with Gardner's disappearance. On Thursday, police said that both Giordano and Gardner had their own travel insurance policies worth $1.5 million each. Giordano's mother is the beneficiary on his policy, Stein said, and authorities have not said who is the beneficiary on Gardner's policy. It was Giordano himself who told authorities about the travel insurance, Stein said. The transcript shows that Giordano said his mother was the beneficiary on his policy, and that he was not asked who was named on Gardner's. The FBI brought copies of the policy to Aruba late last week. Giordano's lawyer, Michael Lopez, has not returned repeated calls for comment regarding the policy. Other evidence in the case includes a camera that Giordano had been using while in Aruba with Gardner. Based on his own conversations with Aruban law enforcement officials, Stein described the photos found on Giordano's camera as ""explicit."" Richard Forester of Maryland, who describes himself as Gardner's boyfriend, brushed aside reports of the pictures Monday and said his focus was squarely on locating Gardner. ""There's a lost American woman there who I love very much and we need to find her,"" he told HLN's ""Issues With Jane Velez-Mitchell."" ""I'm not going to let this go until we find her."" ""I can get millions of eyes and ears on this. Maybe it'll touch the right person, who knows somebody, who knows somebody, who saw something,"" Forester said. DNA tests have been taken from Giordano and sent to Holland for processing, Stein said Thursday. No time was given as to when those results could be expected. CNN's Martin Savidge and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I'm not going to let this go until we find her,"" Richard Forester says .

"(CNN) -- Shark attacks on humans were at the lowest levels in half a decade last year, and a Florida researcher says hard economic times may be to blame. Fewer people in the water means less chance for sharks to attack, ichthyologist George Burgess says. Sharks attacked 59 people in 2008, the lowest number of attacks since 57 in 2003, according to George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, part of the Florida Museum of Natural History on the University of Florida campus in Gainesville. There were 71 attacks in 2007. ""One can't help but think that the downturn in the economy played a part in it,"" Burgess said. Fewer people, especially outside of the United States, have the resources to go to the beach, he said. ""To have a shark attack, you have to have humans and sharks in the water at the same time,"" Burgess said. ""If you have a reduction in the number of people in the water, you're going to have a reduction in the opportunities for people and sharks to get together."" ""We noticed similar declines during the recession that followed the events of 2001, despite the fact that human populations continued to rise,"" the ichthyologist said. Sharks killed four people in 2008, Burgess said: one in California, one in Australia and two in Mexico. Forty-one of the 59 attacks worldwide came in the United States, and 32 of those occurred in Florida. Surfers accounted for 57 percent of shark attacks, swimmers and waders were the targets in 36 percent of the attacks, and divers the rest, he said. Burgess said the U.S. tends to see more attacks because of a large number of surfers, who are a favorite target of sharks. And neither the economy nor the attacks tend to keep American surfers from practicing their sport. ""All they have to do is drive to the beach with the board and get into the water, and the rest is free,"" he said. And while an attack may make them a bit more wary, he said, ""I've yet to find a surfer who says he or she won't go back into the water after a bite or a nip."" When the economy improves, shark attack numbers are likely to go up again, according to Burgess, predicting the number of attacks in the next decade will surpass those of the past 10 years. ""We're putting so many people in the water that humans are dictating the shark attack situation,"" he said.","Sharks attacked 59 people worldwide in 2008, Florida researcher reports .

"(CNN) -- Legendary Formula One team Ferrari will celebrate its 800th Grands Prix in Turkey this weekend. The oldest surviving outfit in motorsport's elite class since starting out in 1948, the Italian marque will parade special logos on the vehicles of drivers Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa. ""Eight-hundred Formula One Grands Prix represents a milestone in the life of Ferrari, which fills us with satisfaction and pride,"" chairman Luca di Montezemolo told the official Formula One Web site. ""I want to share our delight in this achievement with all the drivers who have driven our cars in the world championship, and with our fans. It is nice to look back and see what we have done together, aware we are part of a story that is without equal and is ongoing."" Blog: Is America interested in Formula One? The 62-year-old has been involved in 359 races since joining Ferrari as sporting director in 1973. He has seen Ferrari set a record of 15 drivers' championships, 16 constructors' titles, 211 race victories, 632 podium finishes, 203 pole positions and 221 fastest race laps. Ferrari also holds the record for most consecutive race wins (14 in 1952-53) and wins in a season for one driver (13 for Michael Schumacher in 2004). The seven-time world champion German's 19 consecutive podium finishes in 2001-02 and 24 successive points placings in 2001-03 are also F1 records. Ferrari's first race victory came in 1951, the second championship season of Formula One, and its most recent was registered in March this year by Alonso on his team debut in Bahrain. Ferrari lies second behind Red Bull in the teams' standings going into the seventh race of 2010 in Istanbul as it seeks to bounce back from a disappointing 2009 season that saw Massa sidelined for the second half with a horrific head injury. Two-time world champion Alonso is third in the drivers' standings behind Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber, with Brazil's Massa fifth. ""It's a great pleasure for me to be a small part of these 800 Grands Prix for Ferrari,"" said Massa, who is seeking his fourth victory at the circuit amid speculation that he will not be retained by the team next year. ""I will try my best to go to Turkey to fight for the victory, to have also a nice celebration about these 800 Grands Prix. It's a fantastic feeling to be inside this nice story."" Alonso is looking forward to a long association with Ferrari following his move from Renault. ""Hopefully, I can celebrate a hundred races with Ferrari! When I joined the team it seemed even better than I had expected, and I think it still has a huge potential in terms of the current car's performance, given that the facilities in Maranello are maybe the best,"" the Spaniard told the Ferrari Web site.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A brazen insurgent attack inside a provincial council building in Baquba killed at least 12 people Tuesday, Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said. Also Tuesday,  gunmen used pistols equipped with silencers and shot dead Ahmed Hassan, the head of the legal department in Baghdad's provincial government, Interior Ministry officials said. The attackers intercepted Hassan's car Tuesday morning as he was driving to work in the al-Alawi area in central Baghdad. In Baquba, the militants were shooting randomly from the roof of the Diyala provincial council building at Iraqi security forces who surrounded the structure, said the officials, who did not want to be named because they are not authorized to release information to media. The assault began with a suicide blast at the checkpoint to the compound, followed by a car bomb a few feet away, the officials said. When security forces rushed to the scene to help the wounded, four insurgents forced themselves into the building and held people hostage. By Tuesday afternoon, however, security forces regained control of the building and the hostages were freed. U.S. troops, who were on routine patrol in the area, assisted with an initial search of the building at the request of Iraqi police and later assisted with security, said spokeswoman Maj. Angela Funaro. U.S. helicopters scanned the area and provided information to the Iraqis. Funaro said a number of U.S. tactical vehicles were also in the area but they were part of the routine convoy and were not called in as a response force. The 12 fatalities included four attackers; at least 28 others were wounded in the incident, officials said. Baquba, in ethically mixed Diyala province, is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Baghdad. ""It's a tragic incident,"" said Hasan al-Saneid, who chairs a security committee in parliament, speaking with Iraqiya state television. ""All terrorist sleeper cells must be eliminated and the security plan in the province must be reviewed again,"" he said, adding that Tuesday's attack ""bears the hallmark of al Qaeda"" but cautioned that no conclusions be drawn until an investigation is completed. Diyala was a stronghold of al Qaeda during the peak of Iraq's sectarian violence between 2005 and 2007. In March, armed militants took over a government building in Tikrit in northern Iraq and held hostages. At least 56 people died and 98 others were wounded in that attack, which also ended after Iraqi forces launched a raid to take back the building. Overall violence in Iraq has plunged over the past three years, and the insurgency there has received devastating blows. But the assaults Tuesday and in March are evidence of the instability that still plagues the nation. The latest wave of violence raises concerns over the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces as U.S troops prepare to leave the country by the end of 2011 under the terms of a bilateral security agreement. A new Iraqi government was formed in December but key positions that oversee security forces remain vacant amid political wrangling.","NEW: A government official is shot dead in Baghdad .

"(CNN)  -- Liverpool won the first heavyweight clash of the English Premier League season as an Aaron Ramsey own goal and a late strike from substitute Luis Suarez gave Kenny Dalglish's men a 2-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium Saturday. The opener after 78 minutes owed much to good fortune as Uruguay international Suarez was attempting to flick the ball back and it cannoned off the young Welsh international Ramsey and into the net. Moments before, Arsenal had been reduced to 10 men as Emmanuel Frimpong was shown red for a second yellow card, the second dismissal of the campaign for Arsene Wenger's men with Gervinho going in the 0-0 draw at Newcastle last week. Blog: What now for Arsenal and Fabregas? A man short and with 12 minutes remaining, Arsenal were finally sunk as Raul  Meireles set up his fellow replacement Suarez for an easy tap-in. In a game of few chances, Pepe Reina in the Liverpool goal was rarely tested, but had to save sharply from Frimpong in the first half and from Robin van Persie midway through the second half. Liverpool striker Andy Carroll had a shot that glanced the woodwork, while Stewart Downing tested home keeper Wojciech Szczesny. Defeat capped a miserable week for the Gunners, who have seen star midfielder Cesc Fabregas depart to Barcelona, while Samir Nasri, who started against Liverpool, is linked with a move to Manchester City. But for Dalglish, it has been an excellent start to the season. ""Obviously we are delighted it is a very difficult place to come that everyone knows about,"" he told Sky Sports. Blog: When will Wenger end this transfer insanity? ""I thought it was a fantastic game of football -- we are delighted to have won, we probably just about deserved it. We never lost a goal which is good for a start."" Chelsea's 2-1 home win over West Bromwich Albion was the other highlight of Saturday's action, their first win under new manager Andre Villas-Boas. His team trailed to a shock early goal from Shane Long and WBA might have been further ahead at halftime. But the Blues responded after the break and goals from French pair Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda gave them the three points. In the other lunchtime kickoff, Newcastle continued their encouraging start to the campaign with a 1-0 win over Sunderland in a north-east derby. Ryan Taylor's 62nd minute goal from a free kick was enough to give Alan Pardew's team local bragging rights and to rub salt into the wound home defender Phil Bardsley was sent off in the last minute for a foul on Fabricio Coloccini. Later in the afternoon, Aston Villa beat Blackburn 3-1 at Villa Park and QPR hit back after their opening day defeat to win 1-0 at Everton.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called Monday for political will from both parties to fix what he described as the country's ""eminently solvable"" economic problems in the wake of last week's downgrade of its credit rating by Standard & Poor's. In remarks to reporters that were added to his daily schedule, Obama noted the Friday downgrade from AAA to AA+ occurred because ""they doubted our political system's ability to act"" following the grueling negotiations with congressional leaders that preceded last week's agreement on a debt ceiling increase. Now it will take political will on the part of Democrats and Republicans, the president said, calling on all involved to stop refusing ""to put what's best for the country ahead of self-interest or party or ideology."" ""We knew from the outset that a prolonged debate over the debt ceiling, a debate where the threat of default was used as a bargaining chip, could do enormous damage to our economy and the world's,"" Obama said on a day the Dow plunged 634 points in reaction to the S&P downgrade. ""That threat, coming after a string of economic disruptions in Europe, Japan and the Middle East, has now roiled the markets and dampened consumer confidence and slowed the pace of recovery."" he said. Calling the situation a ""legitimate source of concern,"" Obama said the ""good news"" is that ""our problems are eminently solvable. And we know what we have to do to solve them. Later at a Democratic fund-raiser, Obama said he inherited the nation's economic problems. ""Look, we do have a serious problem in terms of debt and deficit, and much of it I inherited when I showed up,"" he said. ""And because of the financial crisis, it got worse. So there's no doubt that we've got to fix our long-term finances."" The nation needs to tackle its budget deficits over the long term, he told reporters earlier, adding that he will be presenting his ideas for how to proceed in coming weeks as a special congressional committee set up under the debt-ceiling agreement begins its work. Obama offered no details of his plan, and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also provided no additional information when questioned later by reporters. In his remarks, Obama said the issue of the most immediate concern to most Americans and to financial markets was the slow pace of recovery from economic recession. He renewed his call for Congress to extend into next year the payroll tax cut that took effect in January as well as funding for unemployment insurance benefits, saying both steps would spur economic activity by putting money into the hands of consumers. Noting public concerns about the economy, Obama declared: ""Markets will rise and fall, but this is the United States of America. No matter what some agency may say, we've always been and always will be a triple-A country."" To tackle the mounting federal deficits and national debt, Obama has called for a comprehensive agreement that would cut spending, reform entitlement programs and increase tax revenue. ""What it requires is that those of us who have the capacity can pay our fair share when it comes to taxes, like we did just as recently as 2000, when Bill Clinton was president, and requires us to make some modest adjustments in programs like Medicare that allow us to get a better bang for our buck on health care,"" Obama said at the evening fund-raiser. ""And if we did those things over the course of 20, 30 years, because this is a 20- or 30-year problem, then the problem would be solved,"" he said. ""It's not rocket science. And it doesn't require us to decimate the things that we know are going to help us grow and become competitive."" Republicans oppose any kind of tax increase, and many reject increased tax revenue even if the tax rates remain the same or are lowered. The tax revenue issue, as well as the scope of entitlement reforms, have been the main stumbling blocks to a major deficit reduction deal. ""Over the next several months, there will be tremendous pressure on Congress to prove that S&P's analysis of the inability of the political parties to bridge our differences is wrong,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said in a memo to GOP members. ""In short, there will be pressure to compromise on tax increases,"" he said. ""We will be told that there is no other way forward. I respectfully disagree."" The special congressional committee set up under a debt ceiling deal will comprise 12 members -- six Democrats and six Republicans -- from the House and Senate. It must present its recommended package of deficit reduction steps by November 23, and Congress must vote on the package with no amendments by December 23. Congressional leaders have until August 16 to appoint members to the special committee.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- That bar of soap you used once or twice during your last hotel stay might now be helping poor children fight disease. Derreck Kayongo and his Atlanta-based Global Soap Project collect used hotel soap from across the United States. Instead of ending up in landfills, the soaps are cleaned and reprocessed for shipment to impoverished nations such as Haiti, Uganda, Kenya and Swaziland. ""I was shocked just to know how much (soap) at the end of the day was thrown away,"" Kayongo said. Each year, hundreds of millions of soap bars are discarded in North America alone. ""Are we really throwing away that much soap at the expense of other people who don't have anything? It just doesn't sound right."" Kayongo, a Uganda native, thought of the idea in the early 1990s, when he first arrived to the U.S. and stayed at a hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He noticed that his bathroom was replenished with new soap bars every day, even though they were only slightly used. ""I tried to return the new soap to the concierge since I thought they were charging me for it,"" Kayongo said. ""When I was told it was just hotel policy to provide new soap every day, I couldn't believe it."" Kayongo called his father -- a former soap maker in Uganda -- and shared the experience. ""My dad said people in America can afford to throw it away. But I just started to think, 'What if we took some of this soap and recycled it, made brand new soap from it and then sent it home to people who couldn't afford soap?' "" For Kayongo, collecting soap is ""a first line of defense"" mission to combat child-mortality around the world. Each year, more than 2 million children die from diarrheal illness -- the approximate population of San Antonio, Texas. According to the World Health Organization, these deaths occur almost exclusively among toddlers living in low-income countries. ""The issue is not the availability of soap. The issue is cost,"" Kayongo said. ""Make $1 a day, and soap costs 25 cents. I'm not a good mathematician, but I'm telling you I'm not going to spend that 25 cents on a bar of soap. I'm going to buy sugar. I'm going to buy medicine. I'm going to do all the things I think are keeping me alive. ""When you fall sick because you didn't wash up your hands, it's more expensive to go to the hospital to get treated. And that's where the problem begins and people end up dying."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Kayongo, 41, is familiar with the stress that poverty and displacement can create. Almost 30 years ago, he fled Uganda with his parents because of the mass torture and killings by former Ugandan military dictator Idi Amin, he said. Witnessing the devastation of his homeland shaped Kayongo's mission and still haunts him today. ""It's a long-term grieving process that sort of never ends,"" he said. ""As a child coming from school, passing dead bodies for 10 solid years -- 'It's not cool,' as my son would put it. It's not good. A lot of my friends were orphaned, and I was lucky."" Kayongo and his parents fled to Kenya, where he would visit friends and family in refugee camps and struggle to survive -- sometimes without basic necessities. ""We lost everything,"" Kayongo said. ""We didn't live in the camps, but we sacrificed a lot. The people worse off lived in the camps. Soap was so hard to come by, even completely nonexistent sometimes. People were getting so sick simply because they couldn't wash their hands."" Kayongo transitioned from the tough life of a refugee to become a college graduate, a U.S. citizen and a field coordinator for CARE International, a private humanitarian aid organization. But he has not forgotten his roots -- or the fact that many refugees in Africa continue to lack access to basic sanitation. ""As a new immigrant and a new citizen to this country, I feel very blessed to be here,"" he said. ""But it's important, as Africans living in the Diaspora, that we don't forget what we can do to help people back at home. It's not good enough for us to complain about what other people aren't doing for us. It's important that we all band together, think of an idea and pursue it."" With the support of his wife, local friends and Atlanta-based hotels, Kayongo began his Global Soap Project in 2009. So far, 300 hotels nationwide have joined the collection effort, generating 100 tons of soap. Some participating hotels even donate high-end soaps such as Bvlgari, which retails up to $27 for a single bar. Volunteers across the U.S. collect the hotel soaps and ship them to the group's warehouse in Atlanta. On Saturdays, Atlanta volunteers assemble there to clean, reprocess and package the bars. ""We do not mix the soaps because they come with different pH systems, different characters, smells and colors,"" Kayongo said. ""We sanitize them first, then heat them at very high temperatures, chill them and cut them into final bars. It's a very simple process, but a lot of work."" A batch of soap bars is only released for shipment once one of its samples has been tested for pathogens and deemed safe by a third-party laboratory. The Global Soap Project then works with partner organizations to ship and distribute the soap directly to people who need it -- for free. To date, the Global Soap Project has provided more than 100,000 bars of soap for communities in nine countries. Kenya Relief is one organization that has benefited. Last summer, Kayongo personally delivered 5,000 bars of soap to Kenya Relief's Brittney's Home of Grace orphanage. ""When we were distributing the soap, I could sense that there was a lot of excitement, joy, a lot of happiness,"" said Kayongo, whose work was recently recognized by the Atlanta City Council, which declared May 15 as Global Soap Project Day in Atlanta. ""It's a reminder again of that sense of decency. They have (someone) who knows about their situation, and is willing to come and visit them ... to come and say, 'We are sorry ... We're here to help.' "" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of military police raided a slum in northern Rio de Janeiro this weekend, seizing dozens of vehicles and hundreds of bundles of marijuana, state-run media reported Sunday. There were no exchanges of gunfire in the operation, the city's public security chief Jose Mariano Beltrame told reporters on Sunday, according to Agencia Brasil. The peaceful operation is in stark contrast to what happened in Rio in November, when at least 35 people died in violence set off after drug gangs lashed out at the increased police presence in the crime-ridden slums, which are known as favelas, police said. That unrest led to a massive sweep of the Alemao favela complex that involved about 2,600 police and soldiers. This weekend's operation, which culminated with the raising of a Brazilian flag Sunday morning in the Caixa d'Agua section of the city, was conducted by about 750 military police personnel. Brazilian intelligence agents and marines also played a role, with 14 armored vehicles, five helicopters and GPS units all used as part of the operation, Agencia Brasil reported. About 315,000 residents live in the affected neighborhoods, which include Morro da Mangueira, Morro dos Telegrafos and Candelaria. Authorities announced that they'd seized 32 vehicles and 300 packs of marijuana. They'd also served 55 arrest warrants issued in the preceding two months, with three arrested as part of the weekend operation. Beltrame defended the decision to give advance notice of the raid, saying it minimized the prospect of violence. He added that authorities have information on drug traffickers who fled the area ahead of the operation, saying they will be arrested when the time is right. While Brazil has made significant economic inroads in recent years, poverty and crime remain significant problems in several areas, particularly slums in cities such as Rio de Janeiro. That coastal city is among those that will play host to soccer's 2014 World Cup, and two years later it will be home to the summer Olympics. CNN's Marilia Brochetto contributed to this report.","There are no exchanges of gunfire, an official says, in contrast with late last year .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams has been beaten in her comeback event in Eastbourne, losing a tight three-set second round match to top seed Vera Zvonareva on Wednesday. American Williams has not played in a competitive tournament since defeating Zvonareva in the Wimbledon final a year ago. However, the Russian claimed some revenge for that loss, recovering from dropping the opening set to secure a 3-6 7-6 7-5 triumph after three hours of intense tennis. Murray unlikely to win Wimbledon despite recent success . Zvonareva, who has been seeded second for Wimbledon next week, paid tribute to Wiliams after the match, telling the official WTA Tour website: ""Serena has done an unbelievable job coming back after almost a year of not playing. ""She spent more than three hours on the court playing some unbelievable tennis. She's a great champion and I have a lot of respect for her."" Williams was appearing in Eastbourne for the first time after two operations on a foot she cut on broken glass in a restaurant, followed by further surgery in February to remove blood clots from her lungs. Meanwhile, older sister Venus kept the Williams flag flying high on England's south coast, reaching the quarterfinals with a comfortable straight sets win over Ana Ivanovic. Venus, who has been out of action for five months with an abdominal injury, went through 6-3 6-2 and told the WTA Tour website: ""I was happy to have some clean service games and not a lot of errors. ""I feel I'm playing well on the big points -- these matches have been crucial for me to get back, literally, into the swing of things."" In other matches, third seed Victoria Azarenka beat the final British player, Elena Baltacha, 6-1 7-6, while Czech fifth seed Petra Kvitova saw off defending champion Ekaterina Makarova 7-6 7-6.

Top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, from France, who was betean in the final at Queen's by Andy Murray, lost 6-2 6-3 to Czech Radek Stepanek. Meanwhile, American Sam Querrey, who won at Queen's in 2010, has been forced to withdraw from Wimbledon due to an arm injury.","Serena Williams beaten by Vera Zvonareva in the second round at Eastbourne .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Juventus took on Torino in the Turin derby last weekend, and in honor of that we have scoured the world to bring you 10 other local derbies that stir the passions of those involved. At the River Plate and Boca Juniors matches, the atmosphere can swell to boiling point. Don't agree? Think we've left out a more hotly contested derby? Tell us about one you think should make the top 10 in our Sound Off box, below. 1) CELTIC v RANGERS -- Glasgow, Scotland . These two are the bitterest of bitter rivals. Not only are they divided by football, but by religion as well, with Rangers taking their support from the Protestant community and Celtic the Catholic community. The hostility has become so intense that both clubs have asked their fans to stop singing the sectarian songs that had become commonplace on match days. To add fuel to the fire, they are consistently the only two teams who challenge for the Scottish title, with the make-up of the Premier League ensuring they face each other four times in a season, not including cups. Despite both clubs attracting some top foreign stars, the helter-skelter nature of the fixture has not been diluted over time, as confirmed by the number of dismissals over the years. 2) ROMA v LAZIO -- Rome, Italy . Undoubtedly the fiercest derby match in Italy, these two rivals really hate each other. Violence in and around the Olympic Stadium between the sets of supporters, and the police, has become an all-too-common occurrence in recent seasons. Both teams hate the perceived arrogance from the Northern cities (Milan, Turin) -- but they loathe each other more. Roma take their support from a traditional working-class fan base, while Lazio's support tends to come from the wealthier districts. The historical political differences between the fans is another reason for this rivalry. Lazio's supporters, in general, followed right-wing ideals while the Roma fans leaned more to the left. 3) BOCA JUNIORS v RIVER PLATE -- Buenos Aires, Argentina . Although by no means the most ""local"" derby in South America (the clubs are about 7km apart), it is undeniably the most intense. The rivalry, hatred and violence involved are based on social class and money. Both clubs were founded in the poor district of Buenos Aires called La Boca, but River Plate moved to a wealthier area called Nunez in the 1930s, heightening the animosity between the clubs. Boca Juniors' stadium is known as ""La Bombonera"" (The Box of Chocolates) because of its layout. The steep stands and the lack of a running track makes for a particularly intimidating atmosphere. 4) AL AHLY v ZAMALEK -- Cairo, Egypt . Arguably Africa's most passionate derby, this match brings together two of the continent's most successful clubs. Their rivalry is so strong that foreign referees are always brought in for the derby games and, following a number of violent incidents, matches between the two have been moved to the 75,000 capacity Cairo International Stadium. On the pitch, Al Ahly currently have the upper hand, winning the last four league titles. 5) GALATASARAY v FENERBAHCE -- Istanbul, Turkey . The Bosphorus separates the city of Istanbul into a European side and an Asian side. Galatasaray, on the European side, have traditionally been the wealthier of the two clubs, while Fenerbahce, on the Asian side, have a largely working-class following. However, in recent years, Fenerbahce have attracted a number of wealthy fans who have pumped money into the club, thus unbalancing the equilibrium. Nowadays, there is nothing to choose between them on and off the pitch. The last five league titles have alternated between the two clubs and both clubs have won 17 Turkish championships. 6) OLYMPIAKOS v PANATHINAIKOS -- Athens, Greece . This is the derby between the two giants of Greek football, although the rivalry between the two also exists in basketball, Greece's national sport. In the past, Olympiakos, from the port area of Piraeus, used to represent the working class, while Panathinaikos represented the upper-class suburbs of Athens. Nowadays, the situation has evened out. However, on the pitch, Olympiakos are the dominant club, having won 11 of the last 12 league titles, including the last four in a row. 7) RED STAR BELGRADE v PARTIZAN BELGRADE -- Belgrade, Serbia . This is a relatively new fixture: both clubs were founded in 1945, but what they lack in age, they make up for in passion. Partizan was founded as the football section of the central club of the former Yugoslavian Army, while Red Star was founded as the civilians' club. Red Star, or Crvena Zvezda as they are now known, have traditionally been the more successful, achieving the ultimate of winning the European Cup in 1991. 8) WYDAD v RAJA -- Casablanca, Morocco . These two are the biggest clubs in Morocco and violence between the fans often mars these fixtures. Wydad used to dominate honors, but in recent seasons Raja have enjoyed more success. N.B. Raja means ""hope"" and Wydad means ""love,"" although there is certainly no love between the rivals when they face each other! 9) PALMEIRAS v CORINTHIANS -- Sao Paulo, Brazil . Another derby that has been going for nearly 100 years. Corinthians used to be the only club in the city, but a group of Italian members broke away to form Palmeiras, earning the nickname of the ""betrayers"" by Corinthians fans. Morumbi is the biggest stadium in Sao Paulo and all the derbies are played there, although the Pacaembu stadium, which hosts many Corinthians matches, is also used for the occasion. 10) PENAROL v NACIONAL -- Montevideo, Uruguay . One of the oldest derby matches in the world, with both clubs being formed in the 1890s. The two most honored clubs in Uruguay, they share a remarkable 85 Uruguayan league titles and eight Copa Libertadores championships between them. The derby is always played in the Centenario Stadium, with a capacity of almost 74,000, although Nacional also have their own ground in a different neighborhood of the city.

"(Mashable)  -- The word on the street tonight is that Apple is toying with the idea of a much larger screen for the iPhone 5. Other iPhone 5 rumors include a slide-out keyboard and a more competitive camera. These rumors may have been spawned by glimpses of as-yet unfinished prototypes which may never come to market; they could be complete fiction. Or they could also represent part of the future of Apple's iconic phone. The bulk of this iPhone 5-related gossip comes from a Taiwanese blog with a high rate of accuracy on previous Apple leaks. The screen-size rumor comes from DigiTimes. The interesting thing about all these rumors is that each one suggests Apple is more concerned than ever about competing with Android devices, many of which feature huge screens, massive cameras and physical keyboards already. For example, many top-of-the-line Android models feature 8-megapixel cameras in contrast to the iPhone 4's 5-megapixel model. A couple devices in non-U.S. markets even top that spec; the Altek Leo features a 14-megapixel camera. Without question, the trend is toward more megapixels with every passing month. And some of these Android devices feature screens as large as 4.3 inches. Android devices with screens in the 4-inches-and-over category often sport kickstands and are lauded for their multimedia capabilities -- or derided for being slightly impractical and unwieldy, depending on the user's perspective. Mashable: iPad 2 rumored to have SD card slot . Now, the iPhone 5 is rumored to have a camera between 8 megapixels (competitive with current Android phones) and 12 megapixels (blowing most current Android models out of the water and likely keeping pace with future Androids, too). With a better camera and a larger screen, it might sport the specs to intrigue those whose loyalties lie with the best hardware over the brand name. The physical keyboard rumor, however, is a horse of a different color. A handful of Android and RIM devices have been holding sway over the business and content-creating crowd with their über-efficient text entry. But the enterprise isn't a market Apple has typically courted in the past; to do so now, we suspect they'd have to have a virtual keyboard option alongside a physical keyboard option -- an extremely atypical move for the company. Which of these rumors -- if any -- do you think are true? Give us your opinion in the comments. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- The Mississippi River is cresting at Memphis, forecasters said Tuesday, as attention began turning to flooding concerns in Louisiana and Mississippi. The slow passing of the bulge of water working its way from north to south along the Mississippi is only the beginning of the end of the siege for Memphis residents, who could be dealing with high water levels into June. And the struggle is just getting started for residents of Mississippi and Louisiana, where the river is expected to rise over the next few days to levels unseen since 1927. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal predicted Tuesday that as many as 3 million acres of his state could be affected by the flooding. As has been the case upriver from Missouri south to Tennessee, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is predicting its system of levees and flood walls will hold, keeping the river from inundating the small towns and farms that line its banks. ""The system is under stress. It has been under significant stress all along. However, it is operating as designed and intended,"" said Memphis District Readiness Branch Chief Steve Barry. ""The time of greatest concern has passed. We're in a stable situation,"" he said about the area around Memphis. In Tunica, Mississippi, where the river was inching toward a 48-foot crest Tuesday evening, county spokesman Larry Liddell said there's not much anyone can do. ""We're just watching and waiting,"" he said. About 600 people in the Tunica community of Cutoff have been driven from their homes, Liddell said. Some of the city's casinos also have water in them, but no one is sure how much, he said. Downstream in Louisiana, the Corps said it was closing a major lock that allows for the transfer of barge traffic between the Mississippi and the Red River Basin. The Corps also opened 44 more gates to the Bonnet Carre spillway in Norco, Louisiana, on Tuesday, sending millions of gallons of water rushing into Lake Pontchartrain and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico. The Corps opened 28 gates on Monday and may consider opening an additional 38 on Wednesday, according to Jefferson Parish President John Young. The spillway was diverting the equivalent of nearly 50 Olympic-sized swimming pools from the Mississippi each minute, according to Corps statistics. The agency is also considering opening a second spillway -- the Morganza Spillway -- that could flood populated areas. The wait for whatever is going to happen is causing anxiety among residents. They've been posting on Facebook pages operated by the Corps, demanding answers about if and when the Morganza Spillway will be opened and what other areas might be flooded. The spillway is on the Mississippi River north of Baton Rouge. Opening that spillway would send water into the Atchafalaya Delta to the west and south of Baton Rouge. A decision about whether to open the spillway is expected within the next 48 hours, according to Col. Ed Fleming, commander of the Corps' New Orleans District. If that second spillway is opened, Jindal predicted that roughly 2,500 people and 2,000 structures would be at risk directly inside the floodway. Another 22,500 people and 11,000 structures would be affected by backwater flooding, he said. The river in Memphis measured 47.81 feet as of 1 p.m. Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, which had not yet reported an official crest. Water levels could fall or rise slightly, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""This is a long process that has small peaks and valleys,"" she said. A crest is defined as the high point of the water during a flood before it begins to recede. Observers generally know that cresting is occurring when the gradual rise stops and the water level becomes stable. The Mississippi is the highest it's been at Memphis since 1937, when it crested at 48.7 feet -- 14.7 feet above flood stage. That flood killed 500 people and inundated 20 million acres of land, said Col. Vernie Reichling, the Corps of Engineers Memphis District commander. So far, the levees protecting the area have only shown minor weaknesses, which workers have been able to control, he said. The river covered the lowest parts of the city's historic Beale Street and had already forced about 400 people from their homes Monday, Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. said. Another 1,300 remained in low-lying areas, he said. One of the Memphis residents in peril was Latisha Bowles. Her neighborhood had been swallowed by floodwaters but so far, her home was the last one at the waters' edge. ""It wants to come up here, but I've been praying every day it don't,"" Bowles told CNN affiliate WMC Monday.  ""I got three kids, and I'm not ready to move out of my house over this."" President Barack Obama signed disaster declarations for Tennessee on Monday and Tuesday, which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms, flooding and tornadoes since April and continuing. Although the river was cresting, Reichling warned Memphis residents not to assume everything will soon return to normal. ""The flooding is going to stay,"" he said. ""This river is not going to drop below 47 (feet) until early next week at the earliest. And that means all the tributaries that flow into this are going to stay high."" Flooded areas in Tennessee could turn into ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which can transmit West Nile virus and other diseases, the Tennessee Department of Health warned. The Mississippi State Department of Health said people in flooded areas could be at greater risk for tetanus. Once past Tennessee, the crest will next target Louisiana and Mississippi, where residents and authorities continued preparations for river levels that could break records set in 1927, when flooding displaced 600,000 people and caused the equivalent of nearly $624 million in damages, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasters don't expect anywhere near that kind of flooding, in large part because of the network of levees built after that disaster. Some 500 National Guard members have been mobilized for the flooding event so far, Jindal said. The river's crest was expected to begin arriving in Louisiana next week. So far, 21 parishes have issued emergency declarations, Jindal said. Flooding is the last thing needed in southern Louisiana, which is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina, said Lynn Magnuson, a New Orleans resident who submitted footage of the flooding to CNN iReport. ""I went through Katrina,"" Magnuson said. ""I would not wish flooding on anyone, and this city is the last place on Earth that needs any more high water."" U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, echoed that thought. ""After hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike -- as well as the oil spill -- Louisiana can ill-afford another large-scale disaster. Billions of dollars in property is at stake, not to mention the threat to human life,"" she said. Flooding also continued to be a problem in southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois, even though the Mississippi and Ohio rivers have already crested in those states. Last week, the Corps intentionally breached a levee in Missouri as part of its effort to reduce the pressure on other levees, flooding 130,000 acres of agricultural land over the objection of state officials and some farmers. The latest flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys is largely the byproduct of torrential rains throughout the region. Over one two-week stretch, there was about 600% more precipitation than usual, forecasters said. Current weather finally appears to be working in the flood fighters' favor. Only minimal rain is expected over the coming days, with daytime temperatures forecast to be in the upper 80s and 90s through Thursday. CNN's Greg Botelho, Marlena Baldacci, Phil Gast and Ben Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Health departments warn of risks associated with flooding .

"(CNN) -- Spain international Juan Mata is poised to Join English club Chelsea after they agreed a deal for the player with Valencia. The 23-year-old is due in London to discuss personal terms and have a medical at the Premier League runners up this week. Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham had been credited with an interest in the playmaker but he is set for a move to Stamford Bridge. Mata began his career at Real Oviedo before joining Spanish giants Real Madrid as a 15-year-old. He moved to Valencia in 2007 and quickly established himself as an important first team player, scoring in his team's Copa Del Rey victory over Getafe. The following season he missed only one league game for Valencia and forced his way into the national team. He was part of the Spain squad that lifted the 2010 World Cup but appeared only once as a substitute, in place of another of Chelsea's Spanish players, Fernando Torres. Meanwhile, German Bundesliga club Wolfsburg have signed Liverpool's Greek defender Sotirios Kyrgiakos and Hrvoje Cale from Turkish outfit Trabzonspor. Kyrgiakos is familiar with German football after a two-year spell with Eintracht Frankfurt between 2006 and 2008. Cale, who is 26-years-old, has signed a deal until the end of the 2014 season.","Spain international Juan Mata close to joining English club Chelsea .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- New Hampshire Republicans will not watch Monday night's presidential debate in the same way as typical voters across the country. Any good politician knows this. The state's traditional blend of fiscal conservatism and social tolerance poses a tricky challenge for the seven GOP candidates onstage at St. Anselm College. Answers that win applause in Iowa living rooms might not work as well in the Granite State. Discussions of faith, now common in presidential debates, are important to most Republican voters in other early primary and caucus states. But religion is not as central to life in New Hampshire, where social conservatives hold limited sway. A quarter of Granite Staters go to church on a typical Sunday, far below the national average. This state is one of the few where same-sex marriage is legal. In 2009, when a Democratic Legislature and governor replaced civil unions with same-sex marriage, many local Republicans were angry. Despite a sharp turn to the right in both the state House and Senate in the 2010 elections, quick reversal of the new law has not become a top GOP priority. According to a University of New Hampshire poll in February, 37% of Republicans strongly support repeal. Ending same-sex marriage is extremely important to just 5% of the state's voters. As a result, questions asked Monday night about divisive social topics may get more attention along Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, than on Hampton Beach. Other issues are more important here. New Hampshire's reputation as a conservative Republican stronghold is well-deserved. The state's most influential modern governor, Meldrim Thomson, left a tight-fisted legacy of small government that endures more than three decades later. His populist slogan, ""Ax the Tax,"" ensured that the sales and income taxes accepted in most states would remain political poison here for decades. In November, a new populist wave arrived. Tea Party insurgents won scores of state legislative seats. The activists then overwhelmed the GOP establishment, electing allies as House speaker and state party chairman. In this new political climate, issues that matter to libertarians, strict constitutionalists and fiscal conservatives are moving to center stage. Past attempts to weaken unions went nowhere. But labor now has few Republican friends in New Hampshire. A controversial right-to-work bill, which would make most union membership voluntary, may be passed over Democratic Gov. John Lynch's veto. Limitations on government are important to many of these new activists. Many embrace the 10th Amendment, which they see as essential protection against a too-powerful federal government.  They have no use for ""compassionate conservativism,"" which they see as nothing but big, intrusive bureaucracy. Eminent domain is another government power distrusted by many of these new conservative activists. A controversial power line proposal that depended on state confiscation of rural land already faced broad opposition, but the new activists' votes may prove decisive in blocking the project. Questions that touch on some of these issues may seem unusual elsewhere, but not here. The answers will have real impact as New Hampshire's Republicans and independents begin studying the field. To avoid stumbling here, candidates must remember that the Granite State is changing but it remains unique. Treating its voters like Iowans would be as foolish as confusing ethanol with maple syrup.","Answers that win applause in Iowa living rooms might not work as well in New Hampshire .

"(CNN) -- A truck driver who had been sought for more than 12 years in the slaying of his ex-girlfriend in Canada has been arrested after a traffic stop in southern California, U.S. immigration officials said Tuesday. Ninderjit Singh, a Canadian citizen who lives in San Jacinto, California, is being detained on a provisional arrest warrant, the first step toward extraditing him to Vancouver, where is wanted in the 1999 shooting death of Poonam Randhawa, according to a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The case was featured on ""America's Most Wanted"" in July 2000. According to Vancouver detectives, the program generated a number of leads, but the fugitive continued to elude capture. But within the past two weeks, agents with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations received information from Vancouver police that Singh, 33, might be in the Los Angeles area. HSI agents quickly located Singh, who had been making a delivery out of state, and began tracking his movements. At about 11:30 a.m. Friday, California Highway Patrol officers pulled Singh's big rig over in Irvine and issued him a ticket. Thumbprints taken during the traffic stop verified Singh as the long-sought fugitive, and he was arrested. ""In a world where everyone wants instant gratification, it is all too easy to abandon cases that aren't solved quickly,"" Vancouver Police Deputy Chief Warren Lemcke was quoted as saying in an ICE statement. ""We wouldn't let that happen to Miss Randhawa and her family, or any victim of a crime. We are grateful to our partners in the United States who helped us catch this man."" According to authorities, Randhawa was last seen alive with Singh in a vehicle near her school in Vancouver, and her body was found a short time later on a nearby street.","Ninderjit Singh, 33, has been a fugitive for more than 12 years .

"(CNN) -- The owner of a south Philadelphia cheesesteak shop who once instructed customers to order only in English has died, according to to relatives. Joey Vento had a heart attack at home and died Tuesday on the way to the hospital, said Joseph Perno, his nephew and manager of the shop. ""Things are a little somber tonight,"" Perno told CNN affiliate KYW behind the grill at Geno's. ""But he's in our hearts."" Vento founded Geno's in 1966 in Philadelphia, where it sits across the street from another cheesesteak shop, Pat's King of Steaks. Pat's claims to have invented the cheesesteak in 1933, but both stores welcome a plethora of visitors to the City of Brotherly Love each year, and serve the popular steak sandwiches 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For more than 40 years, the rivals have been engaged in a friendly competition over who makes the city's best cheesesteak. Geno's became a popular stop for presidential candidates on the campaign trail and a photo gallery on the restaurant's website shows employees posing with celebrities such as Oprah, Shaquille O'Neal and Ray Romano. Vento made national headlines in 2006 when he posted a sign on one of his restaurant's windows that read, ""This is America. When ordering, please speak English."" The sign prompted the Philadelphia commission on human relations to file a discrimination suit. Vento said he was using ""common sense"" by expecting Americans to speak English at his establishment, and refused to take down the sign. Two years after the controversy began, the suit was overturned. Since his death, fans are using Twitter and Facebook to leave messages. ""Joey Vento was a true American patriot,"" one message read. Others paid tribute to his famed sandwiches. ""Thank you for making the world just a little bit better by being here. Now heaven will have the best cheesesteaks in the world!! RIP Joey""","Joey Vento has a heart attack at home and dies on the way to the hospital .

"(CNN) -- Miss California Alyssa Campanella bested 51 other contestants Sunday night to win the Miss USA crown in Las Vegas. Campanella wore a green flared dress for the evening gown competition and answered a question from judge and OPI co-founder Suzi Weiss-Fischmann during the interview segment about the legalization of medical marijuana. Campanella, 21, said she was uncomfortable with the idea, but believed marijuana was medically beneficial. Campanella will represent the United States at the Miss Universe pageant in September. The 60th Annual Miss USA Pageant took place at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. It was hosted by Andy Cohen, host of Bravo's ""Watch What Happens: Live"" and Giuliana Rancic, co-anchor of ""E! News."" They were joined by Kellie Osbourne, daughter of Ozzy Osbourne and co-star of ""The Osbournes,"" and Susie Castillo, who was Miss USA in 2003. The audience was packed with former winners from years past, going back to 1953. Each had a sash with the year of their win and waved enthusiastically when a camera panned past. New technology allowed fans to rate contestants in real time as the competition unfolded on television. Fan ratings didn't count toward contestants scores, but fans were able to watch preliminary contests online and help vote their favorites into the semifinals. From there, however, the judges took over. In addition to Weiss-Fischmann, the panel included actress Mariel Hemingway, rapper and producer Lil Jon, 2011 NBA champion and Dallas Maverick Tyson Chandler, celebrity chef Rocco DiSpiroto and Penn Jillette of the comedy-magic duo Penn & Teller. Other finalists in the competition included Miss Tennessee, Ashley Elizabeth Durham; Miss Alabama, Madeline Mitchell; and Miss Texas, Ana Christina Rodriguez. Campanella succeeds Rima Fakih, the first Arab-American and Muslim to wear the crown. Fakih repeatedly faced questions about her ethnic and religious identity. There was also controversy over pictures of Fakih dancing around a stripper's pole that emerged shortly after she won her crown, but Fakih has said the photos were taken during a radio station competition and no clothes were removed.","The California contestant beat 51 other women to win the crown .

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- A few thousand people turned out Sunday to protest in Morocco, saying the king's proposed constitutional reforms don't go far enough. Though many expressed support for their king to stay in power, demonstrators argued that a network of privilege and patronage surrounding him must end, and that he must part with more power than he has proposed. In calling for the protests on Saturday, a member of the Rabat wing said participants are seeking ""a truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy."" ""The plan as proposed by the king yesterday does not respond to our demands for a true separation of powers,"" the organizer said Saturday. But a Casablanca-based spokeswoman for the reform movement spoke out Saturday against organizing demonstrations, saying, ""All Moroccans are happy with the king's speech."" King Mohammed VI of Morocco declared sweeping reforms that will boost the power of the prime minister and take away some of his own. The revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable, the parliament in Rabat more dynamic and will give the government greater powers, the 47-year-old king said in a nationally televised address. The reform movement has called for the creation of a parliamentary monarchy, an end to the influence of the king's inner circle and for a crackdown on corrupt officials. Spain and Britain are examples of a parliamentary monarchy. In his 30-minute speech Friday, the sovereign described the draft constitution as ""a bedrock of the special Moroccan democratic development model -- a new historical bond between the throne and the people,"" while describing himself as a ""citizen king."" His actions followed a series of unprecedented protests in this North African modern Muslim country, where street protests are normally tolerated by the state, unlike in most other Arab countries. If the draft is ratified in a referendum set for July 1, its most radical change would be empowering voters to select a prime minister, thereby ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job. The prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state. If Moroccans back the draft, then the new prime minister would have new powers in decision-making and in day-to-day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some European Union countries. In an example of power sharing, the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the House of Representatives, and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of parliament. ""It specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches,"" the king said. Friday's speech stems from a process that was first announced in March, after widespread civil unrest in the wake of the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. The king instructed a hand-picked committee to consult with political parties, trade unions and civil society groups on constitutional changes with a brief to trim the monarch's political powers and make the judiciary independent. But not all civil society groups were consulted, which sparked a wave of demonstrations across the kingdom from groups who feared they would be left out of the new plan. This move alone -- to grant real power to an elected prime minister -- could satisfy a number of demands from those members of society who have called for change. Confirming the full authority of the head of government over cabinet members, the draft constitution gives the prime minister the power to propose and dismiss cabinet members. But King Mohammed will remain a key power broker in the security, military and religious fields, according to the draft. For example, the king would still serve as ""the supreme commander of the armed forces"" and would not relinquish the power to appoint ambassadors and diplomats under the new constitution. Furthermore, the king would retain the power to dissolve parliament after consultations with the new constitutional court, half of whose members he would have appointed. Journalist Martin Jay contributed to this report.","NEW: Thousands turn out Sunday .

"(CNN) -- England and Sri Lanka drew their third and final Test at the Rose Bowl on Monday, a result that saw hosts England take a 1-0 series victory. A century from Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara, the 25th of his career, ensured the tourists escaped defeat in a match that saw 155 overs lost due to bad weather in its first three days. A final downpor during the tea interval prevented any further play, with Sri Lanka on 334 for five in their second innings -- having lost just two wickets on the final day. This meant Sri Lanka had a lead of 141, in reply to England's first innings total of 377 for eight declared. England won the first Test in Cardiff by an innings and 114 runs before a draw in the second Test at Lord's, and Sangakkara -- who made 119 -- told reporters his side were ultimately made to pay for collapsing to 82 all out inside 25 overs in that first Test match. ""None of us were really switched on for Cardiff, we could have had a 0-0 Test series if we were,"" said Sangakkara. ""There is a lot of regret but lessons were learned. There were various situations that could have played out today but we batted with our heads held high and walked away with a good result."" England captain Andrew Strauss added: ""We got ourselves in a position to go on and win the game but fair play to Sangakkara, the Sri Lankans blunted our attack -- we didn't make the inroads we needed to make."" ""I think we got ourselves into good positions in all three Test matches and in a way that two-hour session in Cardiff was good enough to get us one result."" England remain third in the ICC Test rankings behind leaders India, their next Test opponents, and South Africa.","England and Sri Lanka draw their third and final Test at the Rose Bowl .

"(CNN) -- Police alternately closed and reopened commuter train stations in downtown San Francisco Monday after demonstrators gathered to protest recent shootings by the train system's police officers. Police in helmets and protective gear shut the Civic Center station about 45 minutes after the demonstration began at 5 p.m., making protesters and media crews head for the exits. Soon after, officials also closed the Powell Street BART station but that station was reopened less than an hour later. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system reported on its Twitter page that all stations were open less than an hour and a half after the demonstration began at the Civic Center station. Then, the Powell Street station was closed again for a time, only to be reopened with the Civic Center station being closed again. And so it went. At least three protesters -- two men and a women -- were taken into custody during the protest at the the Civic Center, after they engaged in verbal confrontations with police. One of the men, who spoke to the demonstrators with a litany of complaints against BART police, was taken from the platform in handcuffs by officers as demonstrators shouted, ""Let him go, let him go."" Meanwhile, trains continued to run amid the protest. After the Civic Center station was closed, demonstrators accompanied by a line of police officers began a march on city streets. BART officials had said that they planned to beef up security at the Civic Center station because of the protest. ""BART may need to close some stations temporarily or make other service adjustments on short notice,"" train officials said in a statement before the protest. BART has been at the center of controversy about shootings by its officers, the latest being last month that resulted in the death of Charles Hill, 45. Last week, hackers attacked BART's website and posted the home addresses and other information of all 102 police officers on the train system's police force. There also have been several other attempts at protests, including one earlier this month that BART officials quelled by cutting cell phone signals at some subway stations. The train system's board members have scheduled a special meeting for Wednesday to discuss that controversial decision. The decision to cut cell phone service elicited criticism from civil liberty organizations, the San Francisco Chronicle's editorial page and others. CNN's Divina Mims contributed to this report .","Police close, reopen stations to thwart demonstrators .

"(CNN) -- German astronomers say they have discovered conclusive proof of a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy. The center of the galaxy is a ""unique laboratory"" for astronomical study. The 16-year study involved tracking the movement of 28 stars at the center of the Milky Way using telescopes at the European Southern Observatory in Chile. Using the data collected, astronomers were able to calculate important properties about the black hole -- called Sagittarius A* -- such as its size and mass. Professor Reinhard Genzel, who led the study at the Bavaria-based Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, said the data collected proved the existence of the black hole ""beyond any reasonable doubt."" ""Undoubtedly the most spectacular aspect of our long term study is that it has delivered what is now considered to be the best empirical evidence that super-massive black holes do really exist,"" said Genzel. The black hole had a central mass concentration of four million solar masses, he added. The study also enabled astronomers to calculate the distance of the earth from the center of the galaxy, now measured to be 27,000 light-years, and enhanced by six times the accuracy to which they were able to measure the positions of stars -- the equivalent of seeing a one euro coin from a distance of 10,000 kilometers (6,214 miles). One star, called S2, orbited the center of the Milky Way so quickly that it completed one full revolution within the duration of the study. Genzel said the center of the galaxy was a ""unique laboratory"" for the study of the strong gravity, stellar dynamics and star formation with a level of detail ""never possible beyond our galaxy."" Stefan Gillessen, the chief author of the study, published in the Astrophysical Journal, said: ""The Galactic Center harbors the closest supermassive black hole known. Hence, it is the best place to study black holes in detail.""","Astronomers discover supermassive black hole at center of Milky Way .

"(CNN) -- Confusion and then an uneasy calm. That's how residents up and down the East Coast described their reaction to the 5.8-magnitude earthquake that rattled millions of people Tuesday. The quake, which struck at 1:51 p.m., was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep. The epicenter was about 40 miles northwest of Richmond, Virginia, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It sent tremors throughout the region, surprising people at least as far away as New York, Ohio and Georgia. Sarah Merz said her co-worker in Camden, New Jersey, was the first one to notice the rumbling. ""She said, 'What is that? Is it a train?' Everyone kind of started looking at each other. Everyone's eyes just kind of widened, and we all just ran to the front door."" People stood stunned outside for a few minutes, she said. ""All of the sudden your heart starts to pound because you know on the East Coast, this just doesn't happen. It made me nervous at first, but then at the same time it's kind of this crazy curiosity."" Even an hour after the quake, Merz, 28, said she still felt dizzy. ""You're like, wait, am I moving? You keep second-guessing yourself. ... You start thinking too much. You're like, is it happening again?"" When she sat down at her desk, Merz noticed her framed college diploma was still vibrating on the wall. Stories like hers poured in from across the East Coast as residents, generally not used to earthquakes, struggled in the early moments of the temblor to understand what was happening. Was is a helicopter? A truck? A train? Kate Duddy was in an office building elevator in Manhattan, alone, when the shaking started. ""I have never felt a quake before. It was scary having no idea what the cause was,"" she said. ""I felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes."" Gabby Randle, 23, was in a meeting in an office building at New York Avenue and 15th Street in Washington. ""We could see a couple of things falling off of the building next to us,"" she said. ""We sort of ran because the ceiling tiles were swaying."" An official who works in a federal building in New York said he thought someone was ""playing a joke"" on him when his desk started shaking. ""And then,"" he said ""I felt my whole body swaying and realized it was something much more."" Many buildings were evacuated in the U.S. capital, where huge crowds lined the streets as police cars sped by with sirens sounding. CNN iReporter Susan Prahinski sent CNN images of her home office in Washington. The quake knocked shelves off her walls and sent books and her computer monitor crashing. A statue of the Greek philosopher Aristotle lost its head. In Spotsylvania, Virginia, Tish Walker said she grabbed her dog and raced outside when the earthquake struck. ""I used to live in California, so I know shaking and this felt big,"" she said. ""My first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us."" Courtney Thompson, a CNN iReporter from Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey, had no doubt it was a quake, either. The question for her was whether it had occurred out in the ocean. She said everyone taking in the sun at Ortley Beach, New Jersey, sprang up at the same time and looked anxiously out to the Atlantic. ""The water did not recede (a telltale sign of an impending tsunami), but I'm sure that's what everyone was worried about,"" she said. ""People started panicking. They didn't tell us we had to get off the beach, but I'm telling you, everyone got right off the beach."" Brendan Wein, a sales representative at Hoffman Nursery near Rougemont, North Carolina, said he first sensed rattling inside the building. ""We were thinking it was a helicopter,"" Wein said. ""I was literally shaking in my chair."" Simon Griffiths, in Raleigh, North Carolina, compared the quake to a tractor-trailer truck roaring outside his house. Billy Wray said his guitars are OK, but things felt pretty weird when the bank building that houses his music shop in Mechanicsville, Pennsylvania, started to sway. ""Over here, we were rocking and rolling,"" he said. CNN iReporter Jeff Yapalater said he was in his backyard in New York's Long Island when the shaking started. ""Suddenly I felt this light swaying of the earth, I'd never felt that before, so I thought maybe I was experiencing vertigo for a moment, and it lasted maybe 30 seconds. ... We're feeling this really far away!"" he wrote. CNN's Susan Candiotti came across a couple waiting to get back into an evacuated courthouse, where they had been waiting to be married when the quake struck. ""I didn't feel the shaking at all,"" the groom said. He glanced over to his fiancee and joked, ""Maybe it's a sign."" CNN's Philip Gast, Katy Byron, Brian Walker and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","The quake, near Washington, sends tremors as far away as North Carolina .

"(CNN) -- A man and a woman have been charged by police in Italy after they were found having sex in a confession box, it was reported Wednesday. The Italian ANSA news agency said the young man and woman were taken into custody by police in the northern city of Cesena following a telephone complaint from a man attending morning Mass in the city's cathedral. Authorities were alerted after a parishoner heard ""rustling and groaning"" coming from inside the confession box and pulled back the curtains to reveal a goth-rock couple engaged in oral sex, ANSA said. The agency said the pair -- a 31-year-old laborer and a 32-year-old teacher -- defended their conduct saying: ""We are atheists and for us, having sex in church is like doing it any other place."" However, Bishop Antonio Lanfranchi of Cesena-Sarsina took said the couple's behavior was ""an outrage of notable proportions which bespeaks unutterable squalor."" He added that a special ceremony would be held to purify the confession box.","Man and woman being caught having sex during morning Mass .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. JORDAN BIENSTOCK, WRITER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Hi, I'm Jordan Bienstock, and this is the latest summer edition of CNN Student News. This week, we're taking you behind the scenes to answer a question we get asked a lot around this time of year: What does CNN Student News do over the summer? Let's go find out! First up, we're gonna talk to the executive producer of CNN Student News, Donna Krache. DONNA KRACHE, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: During the school year, I'm in charge of the content for CNN Student News: the program and the website. In fact, I'm in charge of the content throughout the year. But I like to take a look ahead in the summer. So, one thing we do a lot of here is planning. You can't predict the news, but you can tell when there are some important events that you're going to have to focus on. For example, the election in 2012 is going to be very important. But we also know that, you know, Black History Month in February and Women's History Month in March, Financial Literacy Month are all months that we like to focus on here at CNN Student News. There are also people who come to Atlanta during the summer, and they'll send us e-mails and say, ""We're coming. Is there anybody from Student News we could say hello to?"" And if we're here, we'd love to come downstairs and say hi and do a little meet-and-greet with you. So, if you're coming to Atlanta, let us know. BIENSTOCK: Next up, we're going to check in with our producer, Jeremy Dunn. JEREMY DUNN, PRODUCER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: My job during the school year is deciding what news stories we're gonna cover, what stories we're gonna air, and what elements we need to tell those stories. What video, what sound, what graphics? So during the summer, what I'm doing is I'm looking back at what we do -- the whole show -- and seeing what works, what doesn't, what can we do better. And working with the graphic artist, the video editor, picking new music, deciding what we can do to freshen up the show so that it's interesting for you guys to watch. BIENSTOCK: This week, we're going behind the scenes to see what the CNN Student News staff is working on this summer, and the next person we're going to talk to is our associate producer, Tomeka Jones. TOMEKA JONES, ASSOCIATE PRODUCER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: So, this summer I'll be focusing on some more Career Connections segments that you may have seen throughout the 2010-2011 school year. You're going to get to see the behind-the-scenes of an editor who puts together some cool stuff, not just for our show, but for several other shows. But on top of that, I'm going to be working with teaming up with different departments, like CNN International and CNN en Espanol. So that way, for the next school year -- for the 2011-2012 school year -- we can try to get more guests, and we can try to diversify our level of guests that come on our show. BIENSTOCK: Now, there's one person on the CNN Student News staff who doesn't need an introduction from me. CARL AZUZ, ANCHOR, CNN STUDENT NEWS: All right, you know what I do during the school year. But I have a second job here at CNN many of you may not know about. It's done right here in CNN's main studio, and I'm usually on between 12 noon and 1 p.m. Eastern speaking with CNN's Suzanne Malveaux. I deliver reports that go in depth and give a little more detail about some of the stories in the news. So, if you're around between 12 and 1 p.m., turn on CNN Newsroom; I might see you there. And another thing I'll be doing over the summer is I might be filing some reports from Washington, D.C. So, I'm looking forward to going to the nation's capital and doing a little work from there. BIENSTOCK: Next up is going to be our web producer, Jeff DeHayes. JEFF DEHAYES, WEB PRODUCER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: During the school year, I'm responsible for CNNStudentNews.com. I update the page. I make sure the show is available for streaming. I make sure that the show's available for podcast. During the summer, I'm working on some behind-the-scenes things: possibly redesigning CNNStudentNews.com, redesigning our daily e-mail. And I'm working on being a cameraman; carrying the camera for all of these interviews. BIENSTOCK: The next person we're gonna talk to is one of the writers on the CNN Student News staff: John Martin. JOHN MARTIN, WRITER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: During the school year, I put together the Daily Discussion and the weekly Newsquiz for you all to use in your classroom. I was just at a conference where I presented Student News to teachers, showing them how to use our program in their classroom, as well as how we use social networking to interact with you all. Right now, I'm putting together a video and presentations for a conference that we're hosting here at CNN. We're bringing in students from all over the state of Georgia, so that they can come here and learn about the world of journalism. BIENSTOCK: Before we go, I should probably explain who I am. During the school year, I'm the one who writes the CNN Student News show every day. I'm also the department copyeditor. So, you know how your teachers take a red pen to your work sometimes? I do that, but I do it professionally, and with red type on the computer, not a red pen. Over the summer, I'm obviously anchoring one of our summer shows, and I'm producing some of our shows as well. I'm also doing some writing for CNN.com. It's a chance to do some extra stuff in different areas and take on new challenges. And finally, because I'm the one who has to come up with all those puns throughout the school year, I'm trying to plan for every possible pun scenario you can think of. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Animals! BIENSTOCK: I can BEARly think of any ideas. A jungle cat on the loose? You must be LION! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Food! BIENSTOCK: A donut-eating competition is no holes barred.

"(CNN)  -- Four Italian journalists were kidnapped Wednesday in Libya by unknown assailants, a spokesman for the Italian foreign ministry confirmed to CNN. One of the journalists was able to call his newspaper, and according to his editor he reported that he and his colleagues had been beaten when they were taken, and one of their drivers had been killed. The foreign ministry spokesman, Maurizio Massari, said the four reporters were kidnapped on a road about 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) from Tripoli. Massari said while it was unclear who captured the journalists, the ministry assumed it was pro-Gadhafi forces. He also said it was unclear what demands, if any, the kidnappers had. Massari said that the journalists, all from prominent Italian daily newspapers, were well. He did not elaborate. Paolo Alfieri, foreign editor of the newspaper Avvenire, identified the four as Elisabetta Rosaspina and Giuseppe Sarcina from the newspaper Corriere della Sera, Sono Domenico Quirico from La Stampa, and Claudio Monici from Avvenire. Alfieri told CNN that those holding the journalists allowed Monici to make a call to his newsroom, and Monici told his colleagues that he had been traveling with the others from the town of Zawiya toward Tripoli when they were stopped at a roadblock. Monici said he and the other journalists were beaten, and one of the drivers was killed. Alfieri said Monici's voice was ""calm"" during the call to his newsroom, and Monici reported that at the time he and the others were ""well."" The call lasted about five to six minutes, Alfieri said, and Monici asked him to alert the Italian foreign ministry and the other newspapers. Monici did not say anything about what the kidnappers were demanding. Alfieri said that Monici had been in Zawiya since Sunday night and had arrived there from Tunis. Monici and the other journalists are all experienced war reporters Alfieri said. Monici also told his colleagues there was a lot of shooting in Zawiya, and it was more than ""festivities shooting"" that has occurred as rebel forces have advanced, according to Alfieri. Massari said late Wednesday that the Italian consul in Benghazi, Guido De Sanctis, had reached one of the four reporters by phone. De Sanctis said the journalists were well, and were in Tripoli, according to Massari. It was not clear which of the four reporters De Sanctis spoke with.","The four are reporters from prominent Italian daily newspapers .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday Israel's military will continue to hit Palestinians suspected of attacking Israel, amid escalating violence in the region since a deadly terror attack on Israelis a week ago. Twenty-two Palestinians have died in air strikes in the past week, Palestinian medical sources say, as Israel has carried out a series of targeted attacks on the alleged leaders of terror groups. Eight have died in the past day. Meanwhile, more than 140 rockets and mortars have been fired into Israeli territory from  Gaza since last Thursday, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces told CNN Thursday, eight of them in the past 24 hours. In an interview for CNN in Jerusalem, Barak said the recent violence had been triggered by the terror attack last Thursday by Palestinian militants near the southern city of Eilat, which killed eight Israelis. Another Israeli was killed by a rocket attack near the city of Beer Sheva in southern Israel. Most of those responsible for the attacks had been swiftly found and killed by Israel, Barak said, some near the scene of the attack near Eilat and others in Gaza. ""I'm extremely satisifed by this achievement,"" he said, because it signals ""that we mean business and we are not going to accept the massacre of our civilians on the roads."" Asked if Israel and the Palestinians were entering a new period of dangerous hostilities, Barak said he hoped not -- but that he couldn't promise it. The International community has expressed concern over the latest round of violence, which has come despite a purported truce agreed between Israel and Palestinian militant groups during the weekend. Barak said Israel believed Bedouins with Egyptian citizenship had probably been involved in the attack near Eilat -- but that he did not know for sure. Israel was not able to share all its intelligence with the public, he said, as that would help members of terror groups ""not to fall into our cross hairs."" Barak reiterated Israel's expression of ""regret"" over the deaths of Egyptian soldiers in its Sinai region, which borders Israel, last week. Egypt condemned Israel's action as ""indiscriminate shelling."" Barak has promised Israel will conduct a military investigation, followed by a joint examination with the Egyptian military, of the incident. Asked about Israel's relationship with Turkey, Barak said his country had to consider issuing an apology to Turkey over the deaths of activists on board a Turkish ship bound for Gaza last year. Barak said the operation had been justified but that questions had been raised over its execution by the Israeli military. Turkey has demanded an apology from Israel. Relations between the two nations reached rock bottom last summer, when nine activists on board the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with aid and 700 activists from various countries, died in clashes with Israeli Navy commandos while attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. An independent Israeli commission found that Israeli commandos ""acted professionally and in a measured manner in the face of unanticipated violence"" and that members of a Turkish relief group on the ship ""were direct participants in hostilities"" who attacked the Israeli troops. Barak said Turkey was ""an extremely important country in the region"" and that it would serve both countries' interests to reach an understanding. Turkey had ""a major role to play"" in maintaining the stability of the Middle East, he said. Both countries are awaiting a United Nations report into the 2010 flotilla incident. On the subject of Syria, Barak said he was fully behind the call by the United States and several European allies for leader Bashar al-Assad to step down. ""He has clearly lost legitimacy with his own people. I believe he is doomed. He will probably stay there for another three or six months, but he is doomed,""  he said. Barak said he would like to see a similar international approach to Syria as has been taken with Libya. ""We need much tighter international pressure there,"" he said. With regards to the Palestinian Authority's plans to make a bid for statehood in the United Nations next month, Barak said he believed the move served the interests of neither Israel nor the Palestinians. Fnding a way to continue negotiations would be the best way forward, he said. CNN's Kevin Flower and Guy Azriel contributed to a report.","Ehud Barak says Israel will not leave last week's terror attacks unpunished .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony must serve a year of probation after being convicted on check fraud charges, a Florida appeals court ruled Tuesday. Anthony cannot ""take advantage"" of an administrative error to avoid serving the 2010 sentence, the appeals court ruled. The Fifth District Court of Appeal's ruling comes a day after Florida's attorney general filed a motion in the case. Attorney General Pamela Bondi argued that a clerical error should not prevent Anthony from abiding by a judge's verbal order. Anthony ""and her lawyers were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement,"" the appeals court ruling said. Anthony has been in seclusion since her July acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, and her subsequent release from jail. Anthony was convicted of felony check fraud for stealing a checkbook from a friend and writing five checks for $644.25. A judge sentenced her in that case in January 2010. Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. ruled earlier this month that she had to report for probation on the bad-check charge by Friday. The attorney general's office wrote that Anthony ""upon her release (July 17), should have reported"" for probation -- something she did not do. Anthony's probation order requires her to live in Orange County, Florida, unless the probation office allows her to leave. She has received no such approval, a corrections department spokeswoman has said. But Anthony's attorneys have argued repeatedly that Anthony should not have to return to serve her probation in Florida. In an emergency petition filed on Wednesday with the same appeals court, Anthony's defense team asked that the court overturn Perry's order before the required date. They also asked the appellate court to strip Perry of further jurisdiction in the case. Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland had earlier ordered Anthony to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter, but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed, instructing that Anthony would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial. The order was updated August 1 to add the words ""upon release."" But Anthony's lawyers contended that she couldn't be required to serve probation, arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from Strickland. Serving the sentence now would violate constitutional protections against having to serve a sentence twice for the same offense, they argued. Perry ruled earlier this month that Strickland's verbal order was binding -- a ruling the appeals court upheld Tuesday.","Appeals court: Casey Anthony can't ""take advantage"" of an administrative error .

"(CNN) -- An 80-year old Austrian man is being investigated for allegedly sexually abusing his wife and his two mentally disabled daughters for more than 40 years, police and a prosecutor said Thursday. The man's wife died three years ago, investigators said, but the daughters still lived with their father in the northwestern town of Braunau.  They slept on a wooden bench and were threatened by their father with a pitchfork, authorities said. ""He isolated the two women from the outside world for all the time,"" said Ernestine Heger, one of the prosecutors in the case. Police freed the two sisters in May 2011, they said.  The man is in a nursing home in Braunau while the case is being investigated, authorities said.  Prosecutors now have to decide if they will order pretrial detention for the suspect. Austrian police discovered the abuse case by accident, they said. When the 80-year-old man fell on the floor in May, he was unable to get up.  His daughters refused to help him for two days. They then entrusted themselves to a social worker, who informed police about their allegations. The two daughters have not yet been questioned by prosecutors. According to Austrian law, they can refuse to testify. In 2008, Austrian Josef Fritzl was arrested after having imprisoned and raped his daughter for 24 years.  He was convicted on charges of incest, rape, false imprisonment, assault and murder and sentenced to life in prison in 2009.  The murder charge was for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth. Heger said that in contrast to the Fritzl case, the sisters in Braunau ""were not really imprisoned. ""Although they could not move where they wanted, neighbors have seen them several times throughout the years,"" she explained. The two sisters are now in psychological care, officials said.","NEW:  The case was discovered through a social worker .

"(CNN) -- Researchers from Alfred Kinsey to local nonprofits have tried for decades to count the United States' gay, lesbian and bisexual population, and still, there were no hard numbers. But for the first time, the decennial census results report counts of same-sex partners and same-sex spouses, regardless of whether same-sex marriage is legal in their states. Headlines from across the country reveal common themes: There are more people who identify as gay, and they've dispersed to more places. In New Jersey, ""Number of gay couples ... rises sharply."" In South Carolina, ""Family makeup is changing."" In Iowa, ""Same-sex households up 77%."" In Provincetown, Massachusetts: ""America's Gayest City."" The U.S. Census Bureau has been releasing the state data since June, along with information about how many children are being raised in same-sex parent households. National figures will be released in November. State numbers reveal about a 50% increase in same-sex couples since 2000, with some of the biggest increases in traditionally conservative parts of the country, said demographer Gary Gates of UCLA Law School's Williams Institute, a think tank dedicated to sexual orientation and gender-related law and public policy. The increase isn't because of a surge of gay people coupling in the last decade, Gates said. Rather, growing social acceptance of homosexuality has led to a greater willingness to report it. Some states with the greatest proportion of same-sex couples -- Vermont, Massachusetts, California, Oregon, Delaware -- are among those that issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples or allow civil unions. Other trends are emerging, too. What do Provincetown; Wilton Manors, Florida; and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, have in common? They're vacation or retirement destinations known for having strong ties to the LGBT population, and the data shows some of the highest concentrations of same-sex couples. ""What may be happening is this idea that baby boomers were the first generation to really have a visible LGBT community, and of course, they're starting to retire now,"" he said. The numbers also show the proportion of same-sex couples raising children hasn't changed much since 2000, he said, despite increasing numbers of adoptions. Gates' explanation: Fewer couples are raising children from previous heterosexual relationships. ""That form of parenting is on the decline,"" he said. ""With greater social acceptance, people are coming out earlier in life and they're less likely to have children."" So why count gay couples and their children at all? The numbers and correlations could be used to develop policies about same-sex marriage or partner benefits, advocacy groups say. ""It's hard to advocate for a group of people when you can't say with certainty how many of them are in our communities,"" said Brian Moulton, chief legislative counsel for Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT advocacy group. ""This helps us better quantify the economic harm to same-sex couples and how many people are affected by decisions to deny them the rights and benefits of marriage, especially those associated with federal law."" But some argue the census didn't go far enough to collect data on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population. No question in the 2010 census asked ""Are you lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender?"" and no results share the total number of LGBT people in the United States. Rather, the census counted people of the same sex who live together and checked the boxes for ""husband and wife"" or ""unmarried partner."" The results are based on how people identify themselves, even if they live in states where same-sex marriages aren't legally recognized. The 2000 census provided the first opportunity for same-sex couples who described themselves as husbands or wives to be counted as same-sex couples. But those responses were ultimately counted as unmarried partners, because marriage for same-sex couples wasn't legal in any states then. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg officiates same-sex wedding . When the census counted only those who live with a spouse or partner, it left out the majority of gay people in the United States, said Richard Socarides, president of Equality Matters and former White House special assistant and senior adviser to President Bill Clinton. ""Any data is better than no data, so I think there is some data that might be helpful for researchers and statisticians, "" Socarides said. ""But from a political perspective, until they agree to count the LBGT community in its entirety, I'm not going to be satisfied."" Socarides acknowledged that the census doesn't specifically enumerate heterosexuals, but argues that population isn't wrapped in a polarized debate about rights. ""The country is involved in a very important policy debate about extending rights and responsibilities to gay Americans and in the context of that debate, it is important to know how many people we're talking about,"" he said. Others have attempted to estimate -- not count -- the country's LGBT population, but any count can be hampered by survey methodology and willingness to respond. The Williams Institute estimated that more than 8 million adults in the United States are lesbian, gay, or bisexual, and nearly 700,000 are transgender. A study released in April suggested that nearly 9 million Americans, about the population of New Jersey, identify as LGBT. Williams Institute research has also found that about 50,000 same-sex couples have married, based on administrative data on the number of couples who have legally married in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire. Another 85,000 same-sex couples have entered into civil unions or domestic partnerships in Vermont, California, New Jersey, Oregon, New Hampshire, Washington and Nevada, according to the Williams Institute. The census results are just one table on a long, long spreadsheet, but demographers and advocacy groups said it's a significant change. ""The fact that the census is very publicly beginning to acknowledge the need for this kind of data, that's a big deal,"" Gates said. ""Those who work to expand civil rights and legal protections for same-sex couples say having some sort of baseline count helps their efforts."" Before the census count, some nonprofits conducted their own counts of the LGBT populations in their communities. The United Way of Broward County, Florida, launched its own web-based survey in 2009 with the goal of assessing the needs of the ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning"" community. ""The Count"" asks basic demographic questions -- race, ethnicity and age -- but also tries to take the pulse of the community and identify problems. One question asks whether ageism, elitism, sexual addiction or lack of leadership are serious problems. Others ask respondents about violence or harassment based on sexual orientation, about health and whether their relationships are ""nurturing and supportive.""","The number of same-sex couples is on the rise, and they live in more places .

"Washington (CNN) -- NATO has begun high-level internal discussions on how to protect Libya's mustard gas supplies if the stockpile suddenly was deemed to no longer be secure, an Obama administration official tells CNN. At this point the effort is considered ""prudent planning"" only, the official said, but this is the first indication the international community could be prepared to secure the stockpile currently at the Rabta site south of Tripoli. The mustard gas is not weaponized and would be difficult to use in any immediate attack. But much of the concern is that material could be diverted or sold to third parties such as terrorist groups. The United States is involved in the safeguard discussions, but there is no current consideration of sending U.S. troops the official said. The focus of the planning effort is what to do ""if a force of some type is needed to secure the site,"" he said. ""The discussion is: who is best suited to do it?"" Any force could include both military personnel as well as intelligence or contractor personnel with the technical expertise in monitoring chemical stockpiles. A NATO official said if there is a need to send personnel to Rabta it might be done by individual nations rather than the alliance which would have to reach a consensus on sending NATO forces on a new mission. At the moment no one has publicly said whether Moammar Gadhafi's forces or rebel forces are in control of Rabta, although U.S. officials have said for days they believe the stockpile is secure. The discussions have accelerated in recent days as the Gadhafi regime began to collapse. ""We are watching the chemical weapons and SCUD missiles to make sure they are not used in the endgame,"" a senior NATO official told CNN.","Libya has a stockpile of mustard gas at Rabta south of Tripoli .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Twelve members of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo's inner circle have been indicted for crimes relating to the post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 dead. A bloody six month stand-off ensued after Gbagbo refused to step down following a loss at presidential polls in November. So-called ""death squads"" targeted those perceived to support his opponent, Alassane Ouattara, who himself was forced to rely on U.N. protection after pro-Gbagbo soldiers surrounded his Abidjan lagoon-side hotel. Among those charged are Gbagbo's son Michel, former party leader Affi N'Guessan, and former prime minister Gilbert Aké N'Gbo. They had been under house arrest in various locations in the north and centre of the country. Noël Dje, a representative of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, told CNN those indicted remain under arrest. The charges are: breach of national security, conspiring against state authority, insurrection and setting up armed groups, he said. A trial date hasn't yet been fixed, Dje added. Gbagbo and his wife Simone -- whom the United Nations says was responsible for organizing the death squads -- haven't yet been charged. Since being pulled out of a bunker beneath the presidential palace on April 11, both have been under house arrest in the northern staunchly pro-Ouattara towns of Korhogo and Katiola. Ouattara has invited the International Criminal Court to open proceedings against them. A high-ranking official from Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) party told CNN the charges come as a ""shock."" ""According to our information, everything happened out of the blue yesterday, with no warning. The various lawyers had no time to co-ordinate. Why was there no pre-trial for such massive crimes? The whole thing makes a mockery of Ouattara's claim to extend the olive branch,"" the official said. Speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, the official said an emergency party meeting would be convened to discuss what ""further steps to now take."" The members of the inner circle and the Gbagbos are being held under a colonial-era law that allows anyone considered a threat to national security to be kept under house arrest indefinitely. Human-rights groups say both sides committed potential crimes against humanity during the six post-electoral conflict, and have accused Ouattara's government of implementing a one-sided justice since taking the reins of power. ""Despite frequent promises of impartial justice, the Ouattara government has not charged anyone from the Republican Forces -- the troops that supported him in removing Gbagbo and that are now the country's military -- for the grave crimes committed during the post-election period,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement on August 5. Around 70 Gbagbo loyalists have been charged by military or civilian courts, while an international arrest warrant has been issued for Charles Blé Goudé, the leader of the pro-Gbagbo Young Patriots militia. Another international warrant has been issued against Koné Mamadou, a ""prophet"" close to the Gbagbos whose partisan ""prophecies"" fuelled a frenzy of violence in the last days of the conflict. Ouattara Sunday said he was extending an ""olive branch"" to former members of Gbagbo's party. Many remain in exile in Ghana and other neighboring countries.","NEW: Gbagbo's party calls the charges a ""shock""

"(CNN) -- Unknown gunmen fired into a crowd of people outside an elementary school in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, Wednesday afternoon, killing one person and injuring four others, a Juarez municipal police spokesman said. ""A group of unknown gunmen were chasing down a target who ran to the Ricardo Flores Magon elementary school. He was with another woman, and they were being chased. The gunmen caught up to them outside of the school and fired into the crowd without caring about the people there,"" municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. School was in session at the time of the shooting at 2 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), but none of the children were injured, Sanchez said. The students at the school are in the 10-to-11-year-old range, he said. It was their first week of classes. Journalists at the scene reported children witnessed the shooting. Teachers at the school did not want to talk to reporters, saying they were still in shock. Three women and one man were injured, including the woman who was accompanying the man targeted, Sanchez said. The women who were shot were waiting for their children outside of the school. There was no indication any of the victims were involved or connected to drug trafficking, but that was part of the municipal police investigation, Sanchez said. The suspects are still on the loose. The gunmen were seen traveling in a Volkswagen Jetta carrying AK-47s, witnesses to the incident told CNN. Drug traffickers in Mexico have a reputation for prefering AK-47s. Earlier this week, the Chihuahua state government said that 225 women have been murdered in Juarez this year. Ciudad Juarez is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and has been the scene of some of Mexico's worst violence in recent years.

"(CNN) -- The suspect in Norway's terror attacks bought chemicals and tools on eBay that helped him kill 77 people this month, according to a British newspaper. The Sunday Telegraph, which said it investigated thousands of online transactions over a seven-month period, has reported that Anders Behring Breivik used eBay to procure sulphur powder, which the newspaper described as a key ingredient for the bomb that exploded in Oslo, killing eight people. The Sunday Telegrah also said that Breivik, under the username ""andrewbrei,"" used eBay to order a drill press vice, a full-face respirator and a ""hazmat"" suit. In addition to the Oslo bombing, Breivik is accused of opening fire on Utoya Island, killing 69 people on July 22. EBay Inc did not respond directly to the Sunday Telegraph report, but released a statement that made reference to the Norway attacks and said that the company is working with local authorities. ""We are deeply saddened by the recent events in Oslo and our thoughts are with the victims and families involved in this horrific incident. eBay and PayPal coordinate regularly with law enforcement around the world and we are assisting Norwegian law enforcement in their investigation,"" the company statement said. An eBay spokewoman declined to comment further, citing an ""ongoing criminal investigation."" Breivik, who is being held in solitary confinement at Ila Prison, near Oslo, mentioned eBay repeatedly in his purported 1,500-page manifesto that rants against Muslims and lays out meticulous plans to prepare for the attacks. The author of the manifesto described how he used eBay to procure various items, some of which were not discovered during the Sunday Telegraph investigation, suggesting Breivik could have had more than one eBay account, the newspaper reported. ""Ebay is not the best place to look as it is mostly civilian body armour available. But now and then, some inexperienced sellers simply make a mistake and list high grade mil spec armour and some times, Ebay is unable to stop the auction in time, which allows you to 'swoop in and pick it up' with a winning bid. I finally managed to buy 2000 USD worth of plates,"" the manifesto author wrote. At another place in the manifesto, the author told his readers: ""Ebay is your friend."" Breivik has admitted carrying out the bombing in Oslo and the shootings on Utoya, his lawyer and a judge have said. He has also pleaded not guilty in court. The attack on Utoya targeted members of the Norway Labour Party's youth movement as they attended a summer camp. Norwegian authorities completed the identification of the dead last week, releasing the names of all 77. Their ages ranged from 14 to 61.

"(CNN) -- British cyclist Mark Cavendish extended his lead in the Tour de France's sprint standings with victory in Sunday's stage 15, while Thomas Voeckler retained his overall advantage. Cavendish claimed his fourth win of this month's race and the 19th of his career as his HTC Highroad team guided him home in the 192.5-kilometer ride from Limoux to Montpellier. With the sprinters back to the fore in a route featuring just one small climb, the 26-year-old headed off American Tyler Farrar and Italians Alessandro Petacchi and Daniel Oss. He is now 47 points clear of Jose Joaquin Rojas in the race for the green jersey after the Spaniard came home fifth, also in four hours 20 minutes 24 seconds. Vanendert wins tough 14th stage . Voeckler was listed as 71st after the top 116 finishers were given the same time as Cavendish, meaning he retains his yellow jersey for Tuesday's 16th stage from Saint-Paul-Trois-Chateaux to Gap as the three-week race heads towards the Alps. The Frenchman is one minute and 49 seconds ahead of Luxembourg's Frank Schleck, whose brother Andy is fourth behind Australia's two-time runner-up Cadel Evans. ""It was a good day for us but I don't think that the teams of the sprinters did their job to make us happy. It was in their interest and it was normal that they do a good job,"" Voeckler told the race website. ""For us it was a good day, and as it was a flat stage it was welcome because yesterday's stage was very hard. Everyone is happy and I feel that the guys are really proud to ride for this jersey, so I have to try something. I'm not obliged to keep the jersey but I must give all I can to hold onto it. ""This is my ninth Tour de France. I've been doing this race since 2003 and obviously I'm not able to win it. I'll give all that I'm able to -- as I've said since I took the jersey -- but when I saw the guys who were just behind me in the overall classification, when I saw the different stages that are yet to come ... I don't know how I could keep on to the lead."" Cavendish credited his teammates after putting him in prime position to win the green jersey for the first time. ""It was a really nervous day, you saw everyone fighting for the front the whole day. I'm lucky that I've got a group of guys like I have to keep me out of trouble at the front and that kind of took the pressure off a bit, but it's still hard,"" he said. ""It was up and down, there were crosswinds the whole day. It was a difficult stage but it was a sprint and the guys controlled it.

"(CNN) -- For many gamers, recent news stories about potential security breaches, lost data or lifted financial information were missing the most basic, most important point: When do I get to play again? Sony's PlayStation Network breach was one of those things that wasn't supposed to happen. And the subsequent network crash was one of those things many gamers really, really, really didn't want to happen. Sure, gamers could play locally, off-network -- as in ""by yourself."" But that can be a little like playing tennis ""by yourself."" Which potentially (if not inevitably) leads to heat exhaustion, sun poisoning, and never being able to track down where all the fuzzy little balls went. And, to some, it seemed like Sony wasn't terribly forthcoming about what had happened or, during those first few days, that anything significant had happened. Those observations appear to have crossed the minds of Rep. Mary Bono Mack, R-California, and Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina. The PlayStation Network breach affects millions of potential young voters, so Congress got into the act, asking Sony to do some explaining. In a letter to its chairman, a House subcommittee on Energy and Commerce asked why Sony waited so long to notify customers about the breach. Reps. Bono Mack and Butterfield asked how they could be confident credit card information wasn't stolen and if Sony knew the identity of those responsible. Or, to paraphrase their letter: . ""Dear Sony, Come on, when do we get to play Portal 2? Later, Congress."" Sony has said that the network will be up this week. And here we are on Thursday afternoon, with no game. Until the network is back up and running at full strength, how are gamers dealing with the outage? Reading? Pointing PS3 controller at their televisions and muttering, weeping? Practicing knife kills on mall security while clutching rubber spatulas? ""PS3 people always talk about their hardware being better,"" said Mike Pascuzzi, a 27-year-old gamer from Houston. ""So for all the Xbox people, this is hysterical to them. I've got a PS3 and an Xbox, so I'm in both camps. But, you see now why Xbox Live service costs money. It has that added security-- that's part of what you're paying for. It's more secure, so it's more safe."" ""Still,"" Pascuzzi said, ""I took my credit card information off the Xbox servers yesterday."" Courtney Nawara works in the gaming industry and lives in Tampa, Florida. In her home she plays on a PS3, Xbox360 and a Wii. ""Some games play better on one system or aren't available on another,"" she said. ""Viva Pinata is only available on the Xbox360. Portal 2 seemed like it would be better on the PS3 as opposed to the Xbox360. The Wii seemed like a good idea at the time, but it hardly gets touched ever."" Nawara is still a fan of Sony but is waiting for some answers from the tech giant. ""I'd love to know how easy it was for Sony's security to get compromised, how much credit card information was leaked and how far back it goes,"" she said. ""Like was my information from when I played Everquest over seven years ago still stored in their system?"" As impatient gamers from all over the world wistfully pick up their familiar, even comforting, ergonomic PS3 game controller, many are asking the same question Nawara is: ""I'd also love to know what Sony is doing to prevent this from happening again."" From his Los Angeles home, Andrew Walker said he's frustrated by the PSN outage and has been spending more time on Microsoft's system. ""I just wish my Xbox didn't sound like a helicopter taking off when I switch it on,"" he said. Walker feels a big part of Sony's job will be getting the network back up. Another big part? A type of digital mea culpa tour. ""Sony does need to figure some form of grand gesture back to their customers,"" Walker said. ""What with SOE being hacked as well, this could be a lingering black mark against their reputation. I honestly don't know what it will take, but they may want to look at how Apple handled the iPhone 4 antenna debacle."" (Geek Out! contacted Sony for a comment on this article but as of this publishing the company has not responded. However they have responded to Congress with a letter.) When the PlayStation Network does come back online, it'll be coming up slowly, not all at once. Sony will also fire up a ""Welcome Back"" program to encourage its customers to re-embrace the PlayStation Network. Initial indications from Sony are that they'll give current PSN customers the premium service, PlayStation Plus, free for 30 days. Current PlayStation Plus customers may also get 30 days free. Tina Tynda, the founder of Girls on Gaming, doesn't need the freebies. She said she's sticking with PSN because no matter how hard they firewall an open network, there will always be some amount of vulnerability. ""No personal information stored online is ever 100% safe, if someone wants it bad enough. I'm still a fan of Sony's PlayStation Network, though,"" she said. ""I've never had the 'Red Ring of Death' on my PS3."" `","Playing PlayStation games offline isn't a gamer's idea of a good time .

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces battled demonstrators Wednesday, killing a dozen more people, a Syrian opposition group said as the Syrian government vowed it was taking steps to achieve democracy. The opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria (LCCS) reported eight people were killed in Homs, two in the Medan district of Damascus, one in Hama and one in Idlib. A witness in Homs said Syrian forces fired randomly at protesters. ""Tonight, they shut down the electricity and stormed the city, firing shots everywhere,"" he said. CNN is unable to confirm reports from Syria independently because of limited access. Throughout the months-long unrest in Syria, the government has said it has been cracking down on ""armed gangs"" and ""terrorists,"" not peaceful protesters. But witnesses, human rights groups, officials of numerous governments and a U.N. fact-finding mission have reported grave human rights abuses and widespread shootings of unarmed civilians. The opposition London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gathers information from inside Syria, reported four people killed in Homs. In Idlib province, a 28-year-old man who was arrested by security forces last week when they stormed the town of Khan Sheikhoun died under torture, the observatory said. And in the city of Harasta, security forces carried out a series of raids and detentions to stop large demonstrations, arresting 37 people, the observatory said. Syria's state-run news agency SANA reported that 14 Syrian citizens ""were martyred in Homs at the hands of the armed terrorist groups who kidnapped, tortured and killed them and mutilated their bodies."" The story, on SANA's website, included gruesome photos. SANA also reported that ""an armed terrorist group"" attacked a bus in Hama on Monday, leaving a woman dead and some other passengers wounded. President Bashar al-Assad issued a decree Tuesday on a local administration law, which has the primary goal of decentralizing authority and placing it ""in the hands of the people to achieve democracy,"" SANA reported. The Syrian opposition has called for widespread reforms and for al-Assad's ouster. The United States and several European nations have echoed that call. Wednesday's developments came a day after opposition members meeting in Istanbul said dissidents have formed a national council to lead the opposition to al-Assad's regime. The new council seems to be one of several opposition movements and parties claiming to represent the Syrian opposition inside and outside Syria. The United States and its European allies on the U.N. Security Council began circulating a draft resolution Tuesday that calls for tough sanctions against al-Assad and other top Syrian officials. ""The resolution includes an arms embargo, travel ban and asset freeze on individuals and entities who are responsible for what is happening,"" British Deputy Ambassador Philip Parham told reporters. ""But there are things they can do now. They can stop the killing and release detainees. And allow access."" CNN's Nada Husseini and Kamal Ghattas contributed to this report.","Opposition group reports 12 deaths Wednesday in various Syrian cities .

"(CNN) -- Pilots of the British business mogul Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways have broken with tradition and voted in favor of the picket line over a pay proposal, a first in the airlines' history. ""We are naturally disappointed with the result of the ballot but remain committed to further talks with our pilots' representatives to find a solution,"" Virgin Atlantic said in a statement issued Tuesday. Representatives from the British Airline Pilots Association, the main union for the United Kingdom's commercial pilots, claim Virgin Atlantic pilots have not had a pay increase since 2008. Pilots do not want to strike, but are being driven to strike and are hugely disappointed by the company's approach, said Jim McAuslan, general secretary for the pilots association. He added that pilots were offered increases below inflation for the next two and a half years. Union representatives said 97% of the pilots who voted were favor of a strike, and 94% of the membership voted. ""The size of the poll and the huge majority for action should send a clear message to Sir Richard Branson,"" McAuslan said. ""There has been no UK pilot strike for 32 years. But there comes a time when even moderate people say 'enough.'"" Virgin Atlantic representatives said they have made an offer to the pilots union that is double the national average for a UK business. ""We value our pilots enormously and that is why we have offered three guaranteed pay rises in the next two and a half years and a share of company profits,"" Virgin Atlantic said in a written statement. Airline representatives said they were optimistic that once the union communicated their offer to the pilots, a strike would be averted. But the British Airline Pilots Association stood firm. ""Time is running out,"" McAuslan said. ""If damage is to be avoided and passengers not inconvenienced, then Sir Richard needs to act now."" Virgin Atlantic representatives said contingency plans are in place to minimize the impact of a strike on consumers.","""There has been no UK strike for 32 years,"" a union official says .

"(CNN) -- As activists reported intense gunfire, mounting deaths and mass detentions Monday in Syria, regional leaders stepped up their criticism of the escalating violence. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain said they were recalling their ambassadors from Syria to discuss the situation. Officials announced the diplomatic moves after Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah condemned violence in Syria in a rare rebuke directed at a fellow Arab leader. ""There is no justification for the bloodshed in Syria, and what is happening has nothing to do with religion or ethics,"" he said in remarks broadcast on state television early Monday. ""The Syrian leadership could activate comprehensive reforms quickly."" Activists inside and outside Syria said a government crackdown was continuing Monday. Three people died after security forces opened fire at a funeral procession in Daraa, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. And at least 65 people died during a military operation that began Sunday in Deir Ezzor, according to the activist network Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Tanks entered the town of Maaret al-Numan after more than a month stationed outside its borders, the Local Coordination Committees and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Syrian forces reportedly detained dozens of residents there. As some groups described increasing violence, Syrian state media reported that the military was pulling back in at least one city. SANA said troops were leaving Hama on Monday after accomplishing ""their mission of protecting citizens."" Earlier Monday an activist based in the city said clashes were continuing, with residents describing sounds of intense gunfire in at least one neighborhood. Markets were closed, tanks surrounded some hospitals, and doctors did not have enough medicine to treat the sick and wounded, according to an activist, who asked to remain anonymous because he feared for his safety. Syria: Understanding the unrest . Syria has restricted international journalists' access to the country, and CNN was unable to independently confirm the death toll and details of the situation. The reported crackdowns were the latest in months of unrest, which started when Syrian forces swiftly suppressed anti-government protests in the southern city of Daraa. Anti-government fervor caught on nationwide as more protests were met with tougher crackdowns. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency says government officials have pledged political reforms, and security forces are fighting dangerous armed gangs and ""terrorist groups."" It describes troops killed in clashes as ""martyrs."" SANA, citing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said in a report Monday that the country is ""dealing with the outlaws ... who are blocking roads, closing cities and terrorizing citizens,"" adding that it ""is the duty of state to protect the lives of citizens."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 2,000 people, primarily demonstrators, have died in the months-long unrest. In recent days, critical statements from regional leaders -- including the Arab League and a coalition of Gulf states -- have joined an international chorus calling on the Syrian government to end the violence. Saudi Arabia's king said the situation in Syria was ""unacceptable,"" announcing his country's decision to recall its ambassador ""for consultation on current events."" ""The brotherly Syrian government and people are aware of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's past support for them,"" Abdullah said, according to a transcript of his statement released by the Saudi government. ""Today, Saudi Arabia stands up to its historical responsibility towards its brothers, demands an end to the killing machine and bloodshed, and (is) asking for reason to prevail before it is too late."" The statement from the king -- who leads a nation with significant religious authority and symbolic status among Muslims -- comes at a significant time, during the holy month of Ramadan. Later Monday, foreign ministries in Bahrain and Kuwait announced that their countries' ambassadors to Syria also had been recalled for consultations on the situation. ""This is a steady drum beat, an increasing drum beat ... The message is becoming clearer and clearer to Assad that he has fewer and fewer friends,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday. Turkey's foreign minister's scheduled visit to Syria Tuesday will be a chance ""to send send yet another strong message"" demanding that al-Assad stop the violence, Toner said. ""His neighbors and other powerful countries and voices in the region need to chime in and get that message to him,"" Toner said. The Arab League issued a statement calling on Syrian authorities ""to stop immediately all acts of violence and security campaigns against civilians and to speed up in executing reforms."" On Sunday, the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, a union of countries located on the Arabian Peninsula, called on Syria ""to put an end to the bloodshed and resort to wisdom, and make serious reforms necessary."" SANA, citing a Syrian official, reported that the government received the statement ""with regret."" The council ""completely ignored the information and facts presented by Syria on the killing and sabotage acts committed by armed terrorist groups seeking to undermine the homeland's sovereignty and security,"" the SANA report said. Criticism of al-Assad's government appeared to take a new form Monday when the Syrian Ministry of Defense website was apparently hacked. For a brief period, the site showed the Syrian flag and a statement: ""The world stands with you against the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad. Know that time and history are on your side."" The statement was signed, ""Anonymous"" -- an apparent reference to the international hacking collective that has claimed credit for high-profile cyber-attacks in recent months targeting government websites and major corporations. Later Monday SANA reported that al-Assad named a new minister of defense to replace Gen. Ali Habib Hamoud, whose ""health condition deteriorated recently."" It was unclear how the reshuffling would impact the nation's military strategy.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Washington Monument was closed indefinitely as engineers study damage and ways to repair cracks at the top of the capital's iconic structure caused by the 5.8-magnitude earthquake that rattled the East Coast this week. Tuesday's quake caused a 4-foot crack in the pyramidion at the top of the 555-foot obelisk and several pieces of mortar fell inside the monument's observation area during the earthquake, a National Park Service spokesman said. An outside structural engineering firm is conducting a thorough damage assessment, and the monument may not be reopened to the public until after any necessary repairs are completed, the spokesman added. ""It could be awhile and the most important thing is the visitors' safety is key, is paramount, is chief and we're not going to risk anyone going in and becoming injured,"" National Park Service spokesman Bill Line said.

"(CNN) -- Former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a coup nearly two years ago, returned to his homeland Saturday. His plane touched down in the capital, Tegucigalpa, in the afternoon. Thousands of supporters cheered his arrival at the airport. While Zelaya has entered Honduras since the military roused him in his pajamas and sent him into exile, Saturday marked the first time he returned without fear of prosecution. Wearing his trademark cowboy hat, Zelaya addressed his supporters, calling on them to pursue peaceful, democratic change. ""The problem of poverty, of corruption ... will not be solved with violence, but through more democracy, greater citizen participation and better transparency,"" he told a roaring crowd. Zelaya this month inked an accord with the country's current president that allowed him to return. Most recently, he has been in exile in the Dominican Republic. The deal, which was brokered by the Colombian and Venezuelan governments, was signed in Cartagena, Colombia, by Zelaya and Honduran President Porfirio Lobo. It allowed Zelaya and his allies to return to Honduras and helps clear the way for the country to rejoin the Organization of American States. Zelaya and his supporters will also be permitted to participate in Honduran politics. ""I hope the reconciliation plan serves to unite the family of Honduras,"" Zelaya told CNN en Espanol, from the plane that took him to Honduras. ""I am a peaceful man. I am a Christian and I do not hold a grudge."" He said he does not immediately intend to run for president. Zelaya, who alienated many by his insistence on pursuing constitutional changes that might have allowed him to seek re-election, nonetheless counts with many allies. His supporters in Tegucigalpa prepared banners and posters this week to pass out to those who would gather to welcome him back. Yet many others are not thrilled. Even several of the country's news networks refused to cover Zelaya's arrival. Cholusat Sur broadcast images of his return. ""I think that this will create more problems for the country,"" university student Daniel Melendez said prior to the former leader's arrival. ""There is going to be a repeat of what there was before."" Zelaya was overthrown on June 28, 2009, and flown into exile. He sneaked back into Honduras in September of that year and got refuge in the Brazilian Embassy, where he remained holed up until Lobo arranged for Zelaya to get safe passage out of the country. Honduras has been excluded from the Organization of American States since the coup, in part because Zelaya had not been allowed to return home without fear of prosecution. He faced corruption charges, which were dropped this month. The de facto government that replaced Zelaya was eventually replaced by the elected government of Lobo. But because the election happened under the rule of the de facto forces, some countries have not recognized the election results. Many countries, including the United States, have recognized the Lobo government, while others, such as Brazil, have not. Zelaya's return to Honduras is expected to help further reintegrate Honduras into the international community. Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: Manuel Zelaya calls on his supporters to pursue peaceful, democratic change .

"(CNN) -- Former Chelsea assistant Ray Wilkins believes the Premier League club will re-appoint Guus Hiddink as their new manager. Wilkins worked alongside Hiddink in 2009, when the Dutchman took over from Luis Felipe Scolari, and the pair helped Chelsea lift the FA Cup that season. Hiddink's temporary reign ended before the start of the 2009-2010 season and Carlo Ancelotti then took the London side to a league and cup double, before a trophy-less season just gone resulted in the Italian losing his job. Since then, Hiddink -- who is currently in charge of the Turkish national side -- has been linked with a return to Stamford Bridge and Wilkins, who was controversially sacked by Chelsea last season. believes he will be appointed by the London club very soon. Speaking to CNN, Wilkins said: ""It seems to be heading towards Guus. He has been there once before, only for four months, but we won the FA Cup and also reached the Champions League semifinals in that time. ""The Champions League seems to be the holy grail for Chelsea and if they are to go one stage further in that competition, Guus would be the man to do that."" Wilkins added: ""Guus knows the way Chelsea think and knows everybody at the training ground, so it would just be like slotting in the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle."" Meanwhile, Aston Villa have confirmed the appointment of former Birmingham manager Alex McLeish on a three-year contract. McLeish led Birmingham to victory in last season's Carling Cup final, but the club were also relegated out of the Premier League for the second time under his control -- and he quit his position under a cloud last week. Birmingham and Villa are bitter city rivals and McLeish's appointment has resulted in fan demonstrations. However, McLeish told the official Villa website: ""I know some of the fans have voiced concerns and I can understand why. But it is up to me to convince them that I am the right man to take this club forward."" Elsewhere in the Premier League, the fixtures for the forthcoming 2011-2012 season were released with champions Manchester United facing a trip to West Bromwich Albion in their opening match. United won 2-1 there last season, but WBA were the only team to come away from Old Trafford with a point in a 2-2 draw. Arsenal travel to Newcastle, where they squandered a four-goal lead to draw 4-4, while new big-money Liverpool signing Jordan Henderson faces a dream home debut against the club he has just left, Sunderland. New boys Swansea face a daunting trip to Manchester City, while fellow- newcomers QPR are at home to Bolton and Norwich must travel to Wigan.","Ray Wilkins believes Guus Hiddink will be re-appointed as Chelsea manager .

"Washington (CNN) -- A bomb threat made at an airport ticket counter in Dayton, Ohio, prompted a search of a US Airways flight that landed safely at Washington's Reagan airport Sunday, authorities said. A law enforcement official said Sunday afternoon that no explosives have been found and the scene is now clear. The woman who made the threat in Ohio, who was taken into custody, may have mental health issues, the official said. Hours earlier, the FBI, Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration began probing reports of ""a bomb on board US Airways Flight 2596,"" FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin said. The flight originated in Dayton and was closer to Washington when the threat was made, ""prompting officials to let the plane proceed,"" Godwin said. The US Airways flight departed on time, at 11:42 a.m., but landed about 30 minutes later than scheduled at 1:36 p.m., according to the airline's website. The plane was preparing to land when the airport was told to hold the flight, said Courtney Mickalonis, a spokeswoman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Upon landing, the plane was directed to a remote runway and the 44 passengers were deplaned, Mickalonis said. US Airways spokeswoman Tina Swail said three crew members also had been aboard the CRJ 200 plane. A K-9 team alerted to a checked bag, TSA said, and local police are investigating. Kristin Lee, a Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman, said Sunday afternoon that the agency is ""aware of a verbal bomb threat."" All passengers safely were taken off, and the bomb squad swept the plane, she said in an e-mailed statement. Video showed luggage scattered on ground around the runway just outside the aircraft. One person dressed in bomb squad gear opened and looked at the bags, one by one. Other aircraft could be seen taking off from the airport. But US Airways' express flights -- like the one from Dayton -- are experiencing delays as a result of the incident, airline spokeswoman Tina Swail said. The plane's passengers, meanwhile, were being questioned by FBI investigators, Mickalonis said. CNN's Jonathan Helman, Mike M. Ahlers, Carol Cratty and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: The woman who made the threat may have mental issues, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer began his bid for a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon title with a straight-sets victory in his opening match in windy conditions in England on Tuesday. The Swiss world No. 3, seeded outside the top two for the first time since his first success in south-west London in 2003, beat Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 6-2. Federer will next play France's 55th-ranked Adrian Mannarino as he seeks to join Open Era record-holder Pete Sampras and William Renshaw (1881-1889) at the top of the grass-court event's roll of honor. ""The first rounds here at Wimbledon on Centre Court are never easy,"" he told the ATP Tour website. Isner wins rematch of 2010 Wimbledon marathon . ""They're somewhat nerve-wracking because you don't get a chance to practice on the Centre Courts here. So I'm happy I was able to come through in three sets this time around."" Federer was playing his first event since ending Novak Djokovic's 43-match winning run at the French Open, where he then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal. ""It feels like if things go well for me I can go extremely far here, whereas at Roland Garros I feel it's a bit more on other opponents' rackets,"" the 16-time grand slam champion said. ""But here I feel it's a bit more on mine. That's why I'll always play with some pressure here at Wimbledon just because of the occasion and what it means to me. I was nervous going out in today's match."" Federer: I can beat Djokovic anywhere . World No. 2 Djokovic bounced back to winning ways in his first match since his Paris disappointment, beating unseeded Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-4 6-1 6-1 in one hour and 20 minutes on Centre Court after Federer's match. The Serbian, seeking to reach his first Wimbledon final, won 14 of the last 16 games to set up a second-round clash with big-serving South African Kevin Anderson or Ukraine's Illya Marchenko. ""When this streak ended in Paris, it was kind of a relief because it's been a very successful five or six months for me, but very long as well and exhausting,"" Djokovic said. ""I've played so many matches. So I needed some time to relax, and I'm happy to see that I'm playing well again and that I'm mentally really fresh to have more success. ""I'm very satisfied with the way I started the tournament. This performance was great. My serve was very accurate in quite difficult conditions for both of us because we had to face the strong wind."" Fifth seed Robin Soderling won his opening match, beating Germany's Philipp Petzschner 6-4 6-4 2-6 7-6 (7-5) to set up a clash with 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt of Australia -- who defeated Japan's Kei Nishikori in four sets. Seventh seed David Ferrer also progressed, beating France's Benoit Paire 6-4 6-4 6-4, and the Spaniard will next face American Ryan Harrison -- who beat Croatia's Ivan Dodig 7-6 (7-5) 6-0 7-5. Eighth-seeded American Andy Roddick battled past German qualifier Andreas Beck. The three-time Wimbledon runner-up won 6-4 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 in a match delayed by Monday's rain to earn a meeting with Romania's Victor Hanescu. Former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro continued his successful comeback this year from long-term injury with a 6-1 6-4 6-3 win over Italy's Flavio Cipolla. The 22-year-old Argentine will next face Belgium's Olivier Rochus as he seeks to reach the third round for the first time.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: February 28th: The month is just about over. But 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines are just getting started. I'm Carl Azuz. Welcome to a new week of CNN Student News! First Up: Crisis in Libya . AZUZ: First up, British officials say the best hope for Libya is for Moammar Gadhafi to leave. The Libyan leader is the focus of protests that have been going on for weeks. And the international community is getting involved in this. On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council voted 15-0 to punish Libya by putting sanctions, or restrictions, on Col. Gadhafi and his associates. Some experts say Libya has been under sanctions before; they haven't worked. The Security Council referred the crisis to the international criminal court, which could decide to investigate Col. Gadhafi for war crimes. The U.N. also acted to freeze Gadhafi's financial assets, which means he won't have access to some of his money. The United Kingdom made the same move yesterday. Back in Libya, thousands of people are trying to get away from the violence. The United Nations Commission on Refugees says a lot of those people have fled to the neighboring countries of Egypt and Tunisia. Quake Anniversary . AZUZ: Chilean President Sebastian Pinera says a little more than half of the reconstruction is finished, one year after a devastating earthquake hit Chile. President Pinera said more than 2 million people were directly affected by the quake. In the early morning hours Sunday, Chileans gathered for a candlelight vigil to mark the anniversary and remember the 521 people killed by the quake. President Pinera, who hadn't taken office yet when the tremor struck, called it the most destructive earthquake in the history of Chile. This file footage shows you scenes from the aftermath of the quake. It was tremendous, with a magnitude of 8.8. Thousands were left homeless. And now, even a year later, dozens are still missing. Budget Battle . AZUZ: Workers' unions are at the heart of a budget battle in Wisconsin. Republican Governor Scott Walker says his state is broke and unions block efforts that could save money. People protesting against Governor Walker's proposed budget bill say it's designed to break up unions by limiting collective bargaining. That's when unions negotiate working conditions for employees. Governor Walker talked recently about why collective bargaining should be limited. GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, (R) WISCONSIN: Collective bargaining has a cost. It has a cost in terms of health care and pension contributions. It has a cost overall in terms of how our governments operate at the local level. And we've got to change that relationship so that we can preserve jobs and ultimately, most importantly, so that the corrections we make for this budget aren't one-time fixes or short-term fixes. AZUZ: Last week, the Wisconsin assembly passed the budget bill. The Senate hasn't voted yet, because Senate Democrats haven't come back; they left the state to keep the vote from happening. Governor Walker says layoffs could be coming if they can't reach an agreement soon. One leading Wisconsin Democrat says the governor and Republicans aren't listening to what people want. PETER BARCA, (D) MINORITY LEADER, WISCONSIN ASSEMBLY: Governor Walker and assembly Republicans are so out of touch that they are willing to resort to these extreme ends to achieve their political goals. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Brock's social studies classes at Sullivan Middle School in Fargo, North Dakota! Which of these is located about 220 miles above the Earth's surface? Is it the: A) Moon, B) Stratosphere, C) Hubble telescope or D) International space station? You've got three seconds -- GO! The international space station is orbiting the Earth about 220 miles above its surface. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Discovery Docks . AZUZ: And that's where the space shuttle Discovery is right now, too. The shuttle and its six-person crew, on a mission to deliver a science rig and other equipment and spare parts to the international space station. Discovery docked with the ISS over the weekend. This is the 13th time the shuttle's made its way up to the station, and also its last. The space shuttle program is winding down and this is Discovery's final scheduled mission. The Endeavour and the Atlantis are set to go up later this year. And every time a shuttle launches, it comes with costs and it comes with risks. And as John Zarrella explains, that has some people asking, why keep sending shuttles up? (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN MIAMI BUREAU CHIEF AND CORRESPONDENT: A moment to be remembered, historic. NASA ANNOUNCER: Space shuttle Atlantis now comes home to the Kennedy Space Center for the final time. ZARRELLA: It was over, the first of the three shuttles heads to retirement. Clean the tires, polish the metal. Hold on, not so fast. That was last May. Something happened on the way to the museum. BILL GERSTENMAIER, NASA ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR FOR SPACE OPERATIONS: If we didn't think we really needed this flight, I would not be recommending this flight. ZARRELLA: NASA, with Congressional backing, in fact urging, decided Atlantis had one more flight in her. Hold off on those moth balls. Once the shuttle program ends and until commercial companies take over, with rockets ten times safer than the shuttle, the Russians will ferry astronauts to the space station. Flying Atlantis shortens that gap and allows NASA to stock the station's pantry. GERSTENMAIER: You know, it can carry, you know, roughly five to ten times what one of these single other supply ships can carry. So, in one shuttle mission, you could think of me being able to carry at least five other vehicles' worth of cargo. ZARRELLA: But it's an expensive U-Haul trip. Shuttle flights cost about half a billion dollars. FRED GUTERL, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN: The rule of thumb is whenever the space shuttle flies, it's a waste of money. The space shuttle is hugely expensive for what it does and it's not that safe, which is why it's being discontinued. So, to continue it for one more flight is not necessary. ZARRELLA: But NASA has what it needs to pull off the flight. There was one more external tank at the factory in Louisiana, and an extra set of booster rockets came in by train from Utah. But is this more about putting off the inevitable end and keeping shuttle workers employed than a real need? MIKE LEINBACH, NASA, LAUNCH DIRECTOR: This is our passion. This is what we do. I mean this is, this is how we support our families and how we support the American people and the international partners. It's not dragging it out, it's allowing us to continue doing what we do best. ZARRELLA: Atlantis is scheduled to lift off in late June, return in early July. This time, when the NASA commentator says... NASA ANNOUNCER: Space shuttle Atlantis now comes home to the Kennedy Space Center for the final time. ZARRELLA: ...He'll mean it. Probably.

It was named for former White House Press Secretary Jim Brady, who was wounded in the attempted assassination of President Reagan. Blog Report . AZUZ: Wrapping up Black History Month, this last day in February, we asked who you'd nominate for a national Black History Hall of Fame. And there were a few names that came up a lot. Those included President Obama, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman. Albert chose Carter G. Woodson, the father of black history, who laid the groundwork for black history month. Kody picks Jesse Owens because he was a great runner who won the Olympics against Nazis. Michael nominated Michael Jackson for being an amazing humanitarian, influencing music and the world. A lot of you agree with Jace that Jackie Robinson should be in the hall of fame. He shattered the barrier in baseball between black and white people; he was inspiring. Kevin nominates Bill Cosby because he's one of the few people who can be a great comedian by using clean humor. Kiara names Oprah Winfrey; she has cared and told about so many wonderful people. And Ryan says George Washington Carver transformed the way we use the peanut and inspired Ryan to become a great scientist! Black History Month Materials .

But once the first puffs of smoke start to show up, it doesn't take long for the whole thing to cave in on itself. Officials decided that demolition was the only option for this run-down relic. They even set up a special ceremony so folks could see how they were tearing something down... Goodbye . AZUZ: ...In order to pave the way for the future.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou reshuffled his Cabinet Friday amid a financial crisis that could reverberate far beyond his country's borders. Among the sweeping changes, Papandreou tapped Evangelos Venizelos, the former defense minister, to serve in the key posts of finance minister and deputy prime minister. The government reshuffle is an attempt by Papanedreou to push through austerity measures demanded by the European Union but unpopular at home and opposed by some of his own party members. The harsh reforms designed to help reduce Greece's enormous budget deficit have so far led to public sector job losses and tax hikes. The crisis raises concerns for Europe's currency, the euro. A default on its debts by Greece, or another struggling nation such as Portugal or Ireland, could adversely affect the world economy. There are fears that efforts to restructure Greece's debt could send shockwaves through Europe's banking sector and spark investor panic similar to that in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the U.S. based global investment bank. Venizelos addressed the nation Friday, urging consensus in solving the crisis. ""Our priority is the viability and sustainability of the public debt,"" he said. ""There is no disagreement on this issue."" He said that with the help of the Greek people, ""I am sure we will succeed."" Venizelos, a veteran politician, steered Greece's preparations for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. He replaces Giorgos Papakonstantinou, who will become the environment minister, a government spokesman said. The new Greek Cabinet members were sworn in during a televised ceremony Friday afternoon. ""With the new composition of the government we make a new start,"" Papandreou told Parliament. ""We face the biggest threat that our country has known over the last decades."" He said Venizelos was tapped to spearhead the implementation of what he called an ""especially painful"" and ""difficult program of big structural changes that will lead our country to a viable economy during the following years. Papandreou said he will soon convene a Cabinet meeting to address the problem of record-high unemployment rates. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso expressed hope the government retructuring will help Greece move forward. ""I call on all political forces to put all their energy into securing broad political support for the economic reform that Greece needs -- reform for the benefit of the people and for the benefit of Greece,"" Barroso said in a statement. In Berlin, the leaders of Germany and France met to find common ground on furthur bailout money for Greece to stop it from defaulting. European nations are divided over whether to provide more assistance. ""We'd like to once again emphasize what we have said again and again --  that the euro is our common currency,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday. ""Europe and the euro are most closely connected with each other,"" she said, speaking to reporters with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. ""Its economic strength, Germany's economic strength, is connected to a strong euro, and we will therefore do everything to preserve and support the euro and its stability altogether ... and to recover from the difficulties we are having."" Sarkozy said any solution that involved the private sector should be on a voluntary basis. Papandreou faces opposition from his party over the austerity measures needed to secure an additional bailout package from institutions including the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. The IMF said Thursday that it would continue to back Greece provided that Greece carried out the economic policy reforms agreed upon by the government. In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said U.S. officials are monitoring the situation in Greece closely but believe their European counterparts have the capacity to deal with it. ""We consider it a headwind, if you will, in terms of the global economy and therefore the domestic economy,"" he said. ""So far, Greece has made significant progress in terms of reforms. But it is important that the Greek government carry on with the fiscal measures and reforms that are frequently under discussion with the EU and the IMF."" The Greek government's popularity has plunged recently, and anti-government protests turned violent Wednesday, as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the Ministry of Finance and police fired tear gas at protesters, police said. On June 9, the Cabinet approved a tough five-year plan for 2011-15 and introduced a bill in Parliament to put the measures into effect. The government has said that the passage of these additional measures is essential to Greece's securing the fifth portion of the first 110 billion euro ($158 billion) bailout package that Greece signed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Hong Kong suspended food and milk imports from five prefectures in Japan on Wednesday after radiation was detected in vegetable imports at the city's international airport. The government banned products that include milk, milk powder, vegetables and fruits produced and harvested from Chiba, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Gunma and Fukushima Prefectures, according to the Hong Kong Food and Health Department. Japanese meats and seafood imports have also been suspended ""unless there is official evidence stating that these products are in compliance with safety rules,"" the department said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday issued an import alert preventing milk, milk products, fresh vegetables and fruit from any of four prefectures -- Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma -- near the Fukushima nuclear reactors from entering the country. But shipments of spinach, milk and a leafy vegetable called kakina could ""test out"" and enter the U.S. food supply if shown to be safe, an FDA spokeswoman said. Other foods from those prefectures will be diverted for testing, she added. Japanese food imports make up less than 4% of food imported into the United States, the FDA says. ""Let's say the contaminated spinach from Japan did make its way to the United States,"" posed CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""A person would have to eat the contaminated spinach from Japan every day for one year to get the same amount of radiation you would get from one CT (CAT) scan."" But the import bans are a part of a ripple effect stemming from a March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that wreaked havoc on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's six reactors and led to the release of unknown quantities of radioactive vapors. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said three air monitors in California and one in Washington state have detected levels of radiation that were ""millions of times below levels of concern."" In Japan, that country's Health Ministry reported Tuesday finding radioactive materials at levels ""drastically exceeding legal limits"" in 11 types of vegetables grown in Fukushima prefecture, including broccoli and cabbage, according to Kyodo News Agency. None of the vegetables have been shipped since Monday, it said. The news agency, citing the ministry, said, ""If a person eats 100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) of the vegetable with the largest detected amount of radioactive materials for about 10 days, it would be equal to ingesting half the amount of radiation a person typically receives from the natural environment in a year. Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Ibaraki Prefecture to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley, and the government of Fukushima Prefecture told residents not to eat leafy vegetables, Kyodo reported. Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency listed specific export bans on food items from Ibaraki, Tochigi and Gunma Prefectures, but did not list similar restrictions on the same food items for domestic consumers in those areas. The website of the Japanese prime minister's office noted that ""temporary consumption will not affect your health."" Meanwhile, countries across the region implemented safety measures in an effort to restrict potentially tainted imports. Thailand's government is focusing on Japanese shipments of meat, milk, fish and seaweed. A radiation physicist from the Office of Atoms for Peace said the agency will work with the country's health ministry to do random checks of imported food from Japan. India has also ordered radiation tests of Japanese food at its ports and airports. Only food originating from Japan after March 11 will be tested. But the impact on Japanese food production and exports will largely depend on the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited where the food is produced or harvested. Radioactive iodine is considered an ""immediate concern,"" but it has a relatively short half-life, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization and International Atomic Energy Agency. But radioactive caesium has also been detected in Japanese food, which can linger for years and cause long-term problems for food production and human health, according to the agencies. On Sunday, Japanese authorities slapped restrictions on milk and spinach that tested positive for radioactive cesium-137 and iodine-131 isotopes. Iodine-131 is radioactive. It collects in the human thyroid gland, which readily absorbs iodine, and could cause health problems, said Dr. James Cox, an oncology professor at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. In addition to the spinach and milk, very small amounts of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water near the plant. Cox, an expert on the effects of radiation on the survivors of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, said he believes the radiation levels measured in these products pose a ""nonexistent"" immediate risk to humans, and ""very low"" long-term risk. Still, he concedes that ""radiation doses ingested through food is really very poorly understood."" ""Children, especially very young children, concentrate iodine in the thyroid, and their thyroid is more susceptible to the radiation,"" he noted. The immediate health risks for adults, by contrast, are minimal. ""I don't think you could eat enough spinach and you probably couldn't drink enough milk to have health risks,"" Cox added. In the longer term, ""There is still a theoretical risk of development of cancer, 10, 20, 30 years later,"" he said. But in the short term, radioactivity levels ""would have to be a factor of 10 greater to have any demonstrable health effects."" On Wednesday, Tokyo government officials advised residents not to give tap water to infants or use it in formula after tests at a purification plant detected higher levels of radioactive iodine. The city's water agency said the spike was likely caused by problems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, located 240 kilometers (150 miles) away.","NEW: Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency listed food export bans that do not correspond to domestic restrictions .

"London (CNN) -- Amy Winehouse ""was the happiest she has been for years,"" with a new love and renewed determination to overcome her drug addiction in her last weeks, he father said in a statement Tuesday as family and friends gathered for the singer's funeral in London. ""But knowing she wasn't depressed, knowing she passed away, knowing she passed away happy, it makes us all feel better,"" Mitch Winehouse said. Record producer Mark Ronson, who worked with Winehouse on her Grammy-winning album ""Back to Black,"" was among the mourners at the funeral, according to CNN affiliate ITV. But the singer's ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, was not released from prison to attend the memorial, a source familiar with the situation said. He is serving a 32-month sentence for burglary and possession of an imitation firearm, according to media reports. Sparse details are being released about the ceremony though Winehouse spokesman Chris Goodman described it as ""a small, private event for a few friends and family."" Investigators might not know what killed Winehouse until they get results from lab tests on her blood and tissue, due in two to four weeks, according to London's Metropolitan Police, also known as Scotland Yard. An autopsy was completed at St. Pancras Mortuary on Monday afternoon, two days after the singer was found dead in her London apartment. ""It did not establish a formal cause of death and we await the results of further toxicology tests,"" a police statement said. An inquest into her death was opened Monday, the statement said. Her father, in his statement Tuesday, said his daughter had made a ""fantastic recovery"" as ""recently Amy found love with Reg (Traviss.)"" ""He helped her with her problems and Amy was looking forward to their future together."" Winehouse said.  ""She was the happiest she has been for years."" He wrote of a ""great night"" with his daughter recently at London's 100 Club  when ""her voice was good, her wit and timing were perfect."" ""She told me that she had 'thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed herself,'"" her father said.  ""The last time she called me she had found a box of old family photos and called me to go over to look. We spoke three times a day at least, she was very excited."" Winehouse ""was trying hard to deal with her drinking and had just completed three weeks of abstinence,"" he said. ""She said, 'Dad I've had enough, I can't stand the look on your and the family's faces anymore,'"" he said. Her boyfriend and mother told him Winehouse was ""in good spirits"" and not depressed when they saw her Friday, a day before her death.  ""That night, she was in her room, playing drums and singing."" ""As it was late, her security guard said to keep it quiet and she did,"" Mitch Winehouse said.  ""He heard her walking around for a while and when he went to check on her in the morning, he thought she was asleep. He went back a few hours later, that was when he realized she was not breathing and called for help."" The singer, beloved for her talent but infamous for erratic public behavior, arrests and drug problems, was found dead Saturday afternoon in her London apartment. Winehouse's soulful, throaty vocals brought the British musician stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her Top 10 hit ""Rehab"" -- won her notoriety. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Belgrade, Serbia. Winehouse died at the same age as at least four other music legends. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison each died of drug overdoses when they were 27. Kurt Cobain was 27 when he committed suicide, soon after his release from rehab. Police were called to Winehouse's Camden Square apartment just after 4 p.m. Saturday in response to a report of ""a woman found deceased,"" authorities said. Her song ""Rehab,"" in which she sang ""They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no,"" helped form the public's view of Winehouse. She told CNN in a 2007 interview, ""I don't care enough about what people think of me to conform to anything."" The London-born singer was a tattooed teenage rebel after she was expelled from a prestigious performing arts school. Her first album, ""Frank,"" debuted in 2003, when the singer-songwriter was 19. International success came with her 2007 album ""Back to Black."" She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of ""Rehab."" Winehouse's volatile marriage to Fielder-Civil took a toll on the singer's career. The couple divorced in 2009 after a stormy two years filled by drug addiction and arrests. Winehouse's parents went public with their efforts to help their daughter, telling the London Telegraph in 2009 that she was on the road to recovery. ""A gradual recovery, which is good,"" Winehouse's father told the Telegraph. ""With slight backward steps -- not drug backward steps, more drink backward steps if you follow my drift. I think that will be the pattern of recovery."" The organization that awards the Grammys issued a statement Saturday calling Winehouse ""a dynamic performer and musician who seamlessly blended rock, jazz, pop, and soul and created a sound all her own."" ""Her rich, soulful and unique voice reflected her honest songwriting and earned her a devoted fan following, critical acclaim, and the genuine respect and admiration of her musical peers,"" the Recording Academy statement said. ""She will forever be remembered for her immense talent, and her music will live on for generations to come. Our deepest sympathies go out to her family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.""

"(CNN) -- Swedish authorities have scheduled a time to interrogate the founder and editor of whistle-blower website WikiLeaks. Karin Rosander, Swedish Prosecution Authority spokeswoman, confirmed the development on Thursday, but couldn't ""disclose what time or what day"" Julian Assange will be questioned. She did say that it would be ""sooner rather than later."" Assange says Swedish authorities still haven't given him details of the crime he is alleged to have committed. ""The present investigation of issue (there are no charges), is one alleged non-sexual 'harassment,'"" Assange wrote Thursday in an e-mail to CNN. ""I have no idea what this is and no details have been provided to us."" Swedish authorities arrested Assange ""in absentia"" over the weekend on two charges -- rape and molestation, a non-sexual charge that is similar to harassment. The chief prosecutor has since revoked the arrest warrant and dropped the rape charge, though Assange still faces the molestation allegation. Leif Silbersky, the lawyer representing Assange, told CNN this week his client strongly denies all the accusations. Assange told CNN that although he no longer is accused of rape, the allegations have been damaging. ""As a result of the case mishandling and the smear, there are currently millions of web pages with my name and 'raped' or 'rape' and over six million with 'sexual,'"" Assange wrote to CNN. ""The damage they have caused me and WikiLeaks is enormous,"" Assange told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet in an article published Thursday. Assange told the Arabic-language television network Al-Jazeera on Sunday the accusations are ""clearly a smear campaign."" The only question, he said, is who is behind it. The attorney for the alleged victims has told CNN that rumors of possible Pentagon or CIA involvement in the sex crime accusations against Assange are ""complete nonsense."" The allegations follow WikiLeaks' release last month of 76,000 pages of U.S. documents related to the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has criticized the leak, saying it would have a significant negative impact on troops and allies, revealing techniques and procedures. Assange has defended the leak, saying it can help shape the public's understanding of the war. He said the material was of no operational significance and that WikiLeaks tried to ensure the material did not put innocent people at risk.

"Abuja, Ni(CNN) -- At least 18 people were killed in a bombing at a U.N. building in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, a police spokesman said Friday. Police commission Michael Zuokumo told reporters eight people had been injured. Rescue officials are at the scene helping to pull people from the rubble. Bomb squad officers and other security teams were sent to the scene, deputy police spokesman Yemi Ajayi said. A representative for the National Hospital said there was a shortage of blood to use in surgery. Hospital staff and relatives of the injured are currently going to the blood bank to donate. The hospital has called in all doctors and nurses who were not working Friday to deal with the emergency, the spokeswoman said, as ambulances brought people in. A witness outside the building at the time of the attack told CNN she had seen a white SUV drive through the main gate of the compound quickly. She then heard two explosions in quick succession, the second one much larger and followed by the shattering of glass, before running to safety. Alessandra Vellucci at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland confirmed that the ""U.N. premises in Abuja have been bombed"" but was unable to give more details. The building is home to the main U.N missions operating in Nigeria and may have had as many as 400 people inside. Eyewitnesses in the U.N. building told CNN there was an explosion, then an internal wall fell on some people, causing several casualties. Abdulkadir said it appeared that a car bomb had gone off at the front of the building, causing a wall to cave in. He said the area was not very busy because it was a diplomatic district, with the Liberian and U.S.embassies nearby, but that there were people working there. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Abuja, Deborah MacLean, told CNN that there had been no damage to the embassy building, which is half a mile from the U.N building. Embassy personnel were initially told to be careful in case of further violence, she said. Zoran Jovanovic, head of mission for the International Red Cross in Abuja, said the explosion was heard at 10:15 a.m. local time. The U.N. building was in a large compound that had five gates, Jovanovic said, adding that the area was also home to western African embassies. It is not yet clear who was responsible for the attack. The Nigerian capital has seen a series of bombings recently. In June, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. It detonated less than two minutes after the federal police chief entered the building, a security source said at the time. A month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. The number of casualties could have been higher if services were still going on, according to a police spokesman. In October, at least 12 people died when car bombs exploded as the nation celebrated 50 years of independence. The attacks near the Justice Ministry injured about 50. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta claimed responsibility for the October attack. MEND, an umbrella organization of several rebel groups, is battling the government for fairer distribution of oil wealth. Recent attacks, including on the church and police station, may have been the work of a radical Muslim sect, Boko Haram, the nation's officials said this year. Boko Haram aims to enforce a strict version of Sharia law in the nation. Africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely Christian south and a Muslim north. Journalist  Alkasim Abdulkadir, and CNN's Umaro Djau, Alkasim Abdulkadir, Christian Purefoy, Ben Brumfield, Stephanie Halasz, David Wilkinson and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 18 people are killed, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Americans snicker over the sordid details of Rep. Anthony Weiner's Internet escapades. But they pity his wife, Huma Abedin. They see an accomplished and beautiful woman betrayed by her husband's Twitter posts. And she's pregnant? The details just get worse and worse. Abedin and other political wives before her have been forced to face the public flogging of their husbands, heightened in this case by the technological evidence that Weiner left behind and by the helpful testimony of his correspondents. Americans love to debate the role of the wronged political wife. What will Hillary Clinton, Jenny Sanford, or Newt Gingrich's wives (pick one) do? What should they do? Actress Julianna Margulies was nominated for an Emmy for her portrayal of ""The Good Wife"" on CBS. Will she ever leave her fictional cheating husband? To which author Laura Munson says, ""Stop."" Stop calling these women victims. Unless there are threats to her physical safety or financial security, only Abedin decides if she is a victim. (And she's not talking publicly.) When her own husband, suffering through a midlife crisis, threatened to break up their marriage to end his pain, Munson chose not to play the victim. Instead she planned a summer of joy for herself and her two kids -- and her husband when he wanted to join them. She gave him six months to work through his crisis. How did she stop herself from pleading with him or simply dumping him just to get it over with? How did she choose a third way? Munson, author of the memoir ""This Is Not the Story You Think It Is,"" had recently committed to the end of suffering. After years of writing novels that weren't published, the death of her father, and therapy, she decided that she -- not anyone else -- would decide her own happiness. That included her husband. The same philosophy can apply to not-so-famous women facing infidelity or other crises that destroy their dreams and upend their lives. These crises can be opportunities to find your true calling, says Susan Piver, author of ""The Wisdom of a Broken Heart."" If you don't remember what makes you happy, imagine figuring it out and starting the seeds of a new life. (Again, this advice doesn't apply if you are facing threats to your safety.) Wait to make big decisions. If you're not facing financial ruin or the threat of violence, wait at least a few months for the pain and anxiety to settle down. In the fog of pain, people make rash decisions. One of Munson's friends was so unhappy in her life that she decided she had to get out of her marriage. She didn't realize she didn't really want out until she was gone. You need to figure out what you want. Focus on the present moment. When the crazy thoughts are going through your head about who did what to who, and why didn't you say that perfect comeback line, Piver suggests taking out a piece of paper and writing down five things that you notice are actually happening around you. They're usually pretty ordinary -- cars driving by, the dog barking, a child playing with dolls. Go a little deeper and notice three things a little more carefully. Write those observations down. That list, part of a group of exercises in her book, isn't ever as crazy as what's in your head. It can have a calming effect. Create something now. Take charge of your own joy. Munson didn't simply plan a summer of fun for her family. She thought deliberately about what she could do to make herself and her two children happy during their financially strapped summer in their Montana town. It was often as simple as taking three deep breaths or walking down the block. Sometimes she walked to a beautiful place or visited friends who helped keep the focus on herself, instead of trashing the husband. She turned on the sprinklers and watched her kids get soaked. She bought many tomatoes and canned tomato sauce. ""Do something that is positive and nurturing to you,"" she says. Give up on the dream. Many people create a storyline or myth for their lives that says they will be powerful when they are pretty or handsome, skinny, married, a parent, or have the ""right"" job or salary. ""If you're only powerful when it goes a certain way, then what happens when you lose your job?"" asks Munson. Do you not matter anymore? Figure out the myths you tell yourself about your definition of success before you can move on. Look for your truth. Take some quiet time in prayer or meditation to get through other people's voices, and what the culture says about what your life should be like, to your essential truth. ""The advice for anyone going through a trauma is to allow the sorrow and vision for what you thought life should be to dissolve and see what's left,"" says Piver. ""You have all the knowledge you need to solve your problems inside of you."" Choose your own feelings. It's incredibly hard to do, but Munson says it's essential. After all, we only truly believe other people's mean comments about ourselves when we think they're true -- that we're unlovable or fat or nagging or mean-spirited. ""What if someone told you when you were 12 that nobody can make you feel mad, make you cry just by what they say?"" she asks. ""What if we had really understood that no one could make you feel emotionally anything?"" Repeat after me: Those barbs are not necessarily true. Do not play the victim. You are only a victim in an emotional crisis if you choose to be. ""When we get into reaction and escalating the drama, it only hurts us,"" says Munson. ""There is a time and place for anger, but I want to powerfully choose those moments -- I don't want to feel like they're choosing me.""","Author: Political wives can choose not to be victims when their husbands cheat .

"(OPRAH.com) -- On my 24th birthday, my boyfriend since college proposed. While it was the happiest moment in my life so far, I was not allowed to enjoy it for very long. Within minutes, phone calls, text messages, BBMs and emails began flooding in, asking when the wedding would be. Immediately, the focus was turned away from our commitment to a lifetime together and toward the overwhelming and incredibly exciting process of planning the party. When it comes to getting married, I imagine every bride finds it very easy to get caught up in the party-planning element of things. After all, this is meant to be the one day in a girl's life when she can be a total princess -- here's to hoping I can avoid Bridezilla status, and that there will, in fact, be more princess days left in store -- so everything must be perfect. Whether you're planning an intimate affair for 15, or a blowout bash for 500 of your nearest and dearest, every detail deserves your utmost attention. There are plenty of would-be party planners (mothers, grandmothers, aunts, cousins, friends, sales clerks) with tips of their own to offer to make sure your wedding goes off without a hitch. But what if there is a hitch? Anyone who has been to a wedding knows weddings with hitches are still joyous and memorable...even if the cake melts, the band doesn't show and the groom is an hour late. After months spent deciding on a date with my groom, selecting the guest list and designing invitations, and choosing my dress, shoes, flowers and color themes, I feel I'm finally ready to start preparing emotionally for the real journey -- what awaits us after ""I do."" Oprah.com: What happily married women know . While I appreciate the generous wisdom of so many women who have gone before me as they educate me in the politics of table seating, the virtues of white versus ivory, the essentiality of at least one good Bach piece in the processional, and so on -- what I am most craving as I prepare for the impending end of my singledom is some good old-fashioned life advice. Perhaps I am impertinent. Because I have never had a problem asking difficult, embarrassing and perhaps completely inappropriate questions --don't mind me, blame the parents -- I've taken to asking every woman who will lend me her ear to share her secret to a healthy and happy marriage. I've selected my three favorite below, but I am most curious to hear from you if you have something to offer --maybe a bit of grandmother's advice passed down to you, or something you've recognized in your own relationships or marriages (even failed ones!), or something you wish someone had told you as you prepared to take that step. I'm all ears. Secret 1: Best marriages based on good health and bad memory . This perfect kernel came from a great-aunt of mine who lives abroad. Not that it needs much explanation, but I think the concept is worth delving into. So often, people would rather be right than happy. Think about all the petty arguments -- the ridiculous ones where you get so angry over nothing and forget what even sparked the fight -- that have ruined nights together or sent you to bed angry. How many of them were worth it? How long do you hold the grudge afterwards? Oprah.com: When you SHOULD hold a grudge . If the fight is only worth a short-lived outburst where you say things you don't mean, it probably doesn't need to happen. If it's the kind that is long, festering and sticks with you days and weeks later, then it probably needs a much more pervasive solution than a fight that simply points out the problems. I am all about airing grievances, but it has to be solution-oriented. Holding grudges, as tempting as it is, hurts you more than anyone else by bottling up the negative energy and embittering you from the inside out. On the flipside, recalibration and reconnection can happen in an instant. Keeping each other healthy -- like taking walks together, hearing each other out, supplying physical and emotional nourishment --brings you together to the exclusion of those things that can so easily drive people apart. Think about how much easier it is to feel less overworked and less stressed when you share a home-cooked meal, or even Chinese takeout, while sitting at a table with someone you love. Secret 2(a) --Adjust your expectation Secret 2(b) -- Choose your attitude . These two come from my mother and grandmother, respectively, and sum up their personalities in a nutshell. Both are firm believers in the idea that you can only control your own behavior. Trying to micromanage the universe -- or just other people -- is an exercise in futility and sure to irritate. When choosing your attitude, you're deciding what your outlook on life will be. It's easier said than done, but habitually happy people are not that way because only good things happen to them. Instead, they simply decide that no matter what happens outside their control, their attitude will be a positive one. Choosing to do the best you can with what you can control, and make the best of what you cannot control, seems like good life advice all around. Oprah.com: Elizabeth Gilbert explores marriage around the world . Adjusting your expectation has got to be the most overlooked trick in the book for securing a stable and happy relationship with friends and significant others. Mismatched expectations are so pervasively harmful because there's no way to get around them: I want something from you that you are not prepared to give either because you don't know it is what I want, or because it's not something that's in your nature to do. I get hurt repeatedly because, no matter how much I pout and sulk, you won't do what I want. It sounds childish when it's written like that, but this is exactly what the brain goes through when you expect five phone calls a day and he only has time for one. Or when he sends you lilies instead of the expected roses. Or when he likes rationalized argument and you prefer heated spats. Oprah.com:  5 best things to do for your relationship . The onus is on me to open the dialogue so that my expectations come to match yours. Moreover, I have to not try to change you (the theme here seems pretty obvious), because I have no real control over how you will change, if at all. A much safer bet would be to adjust what I expect, and to acknowledge that you are exactly the way you are meant to be. Caveat: For those of you thinking this sounds like the ""roll over and play dead"" strategy, it is not at all. Adjusting your expectations is not about sacrificing what you feel entitled to in order to feel happy and fulfilled. Instead, it is about giving up crazy and useless effort to change someone else in favor of realizing how you can create positive change by focusing on your own behavior.

"(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o has edged towards a move away from Inter Milan, after it was announced that a deal has been agreed to sell the Cameroon striker to Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala. Eto'o, 30, will undergo a medical with Anzhi on Wednesday before putting pen-to-paper on a three-year contract. ""An agreement was reached today between the two football clubs regarding the transition of the forward Samuel Eto'o's to the Makhachkala club,"" read a statement on Anzhi's official web site. ""Both sides are completely satisfied about the financial terms of the transfer. Anzhi expresses gratitude to the leadership of Inter for its professional and constructive approach in the negotiations. Why are Spanish footballers on strike? ""Tomorrow the player will undergo a medical, following which a three-year contract with him will be concluded. ""On Thursday, Samuel will arrive to the base of his new team, and will begin preparations for the game against FC Rostov."" Former Barcelona forward Eto'o is set to become the latest star name to join Dagestan-based Anzhi, who have already signed winger Yuri Zhirkov from Chelsea and attacking midfielder Balazs Dzsudzsak from PSV Eindhoven during this transfer window. Anzhi also secured the signature of Brazilian World Cup winner and former Real Madrid left-back Roberto Carlos in February. Eto'o, a four-time African Player of the Year, rose to prominence during a four-year spell with Spanish side Mallorca, before joing Catalan giants Barcelona in 2004. Eto'o won multiple honors during his stay at the Nou Camp, including three Spanish Primera Liga titles and two European Champions League triumphs. Inter signed Eto'o in 2009, with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic moving in the opposite direction, and he helped the Nerazzurri claim Italian Serie A and  Champions League glory in 2010.","Inter Milan and Anzhi Makhachkala have reached a deal for the transfer of Samuel Eto'o .

"(CNN) -- A Delaware pediatrician accused of molesting more than 100 of his patients was sentenced Friday to serve his lifetime in prison. Earl Bradley, whose practice was in Lewes, was sentenced to the maximum sentence of 14 life terms, plus 164 years in prison without the possibility of parole, according to a statement from the office of state Attorney General Beau Biden. He originally had  faced 529  counts of rape, sexual exploitation of a child, unlawful  sexual contact  and other charges. In June, he was found guilty on 24 counts. The charges include first-degree rape, forcing girls to perform oral sex on him and filming dozens of children engaging in sex acts. Police officers and detectives, but none of the alleged victims, testified in June in a bench trial, which is a trial held before a judge and without a jury. Bradley's attorneys did not call any witnesses nor did they make closing arguments. The evidence against Bradley is based on video seized from his home and office, Biden has said. Public defenders in April challenged the scope of a search warrant used to acquire these tapes, but the judge ruled against them. According to the indictment, the abuse allegedly occurred between 1998 and 2009. All but one of the 103 alleged victims were girls, some as young as 2 years old. Police arrested Bradley in December 2009.","Pediatrician was accused of sexually assaulting 103 of his patients .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony was ""polite and cooperative"" in her first meeting with her probation officer for check fraud and fraudulent use of a personal ID, a Florida Department of Corrections spokeswoman said Thursday. Gretl Plessinger, the department's communications director, said that Anthony reported to a probation office Wednesday at 6 p.m. for a visit that lasted a little over an hour. Anthony previously had been sentenced to one year of probation, which including monthly check-in meetings plus ""random contacts"" in the public. ""She told the probation officer that she intended to do well on probation,"" Plessinger said of Anthony. ""She was polite and cooperative."" In July, a jury acquitted Anthony on murder charges related to the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, though she was convicted on four counts for misleading law enforcement. The probation sentence stems from a different conviction, for which a judge sentenced her in January 2010, on felony check fraud for stealing a checkbook from a friend and writing five checks for $644.25. Anthony's attorneys have argued repeatedly -- and, ultimately, unsuccessfully -- that their client should not have to serve her probation in Florida, pointing to a court document that erroneously stated she would serve her probation while in prison awaiting the murder trial. As the corrections department had previously said in a statement, officials are not releasing Anthony's address ""or anything that might lead to the discovery of her location,"" said Plessinger. This move is an effort to comply with a judge's order that Anthony's whereabouts should remain confidential for her own safety. ""The court made a pretty strong statement, talking about how she's one of the most hated women in America,"" Plessinger said. ""We want to make sure that she's treated like other offenders, in that if she violates these court orders, we will immediately notify the court. But we will put security measures in place."" Those measures include not inputting Anthony's information into a public database, as is typically the case with offenders. In addition, her probation officer will not be identified by name. Under the terms of her sentence, Anthony must meet with her probation officer no later than the fifth day of each month. She can't change her residence or employment and, as Plessinger said Thursday, her probation officer would have to OK a travel permit if Anthony wants to leave the county. Her probation office is in Orange County, unless she makes a request that is granted to move elsewhere in Florida. None of Anthony's attorneys was present when she met with the probation officer Wednesday, the state spokeswoman said. In that meeting, the officer ""laid out for her, in detail, the conditions"" -- after which Anthony indicated ""she understood those conditions,"" said Plessinger. Among other things, Anthony's sentence requires her to pay the state of Florida $20 per month toward the cost of supervision plus a 4% surcharge, unless the fees are waived. During the period covered by the sentence, she will not be allowed to drink excessively. She is also barred from any personal contact with the check-fraud victim for the duration of the probation period. Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland had earlier ordered Anthony to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter, but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed, instructing that Anthony would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial. The order was updated August 1 to add the words ""upon release."" But Anthony's lawyers contended that she couldn't be required to serve probation, arguing that she had already served it while in custody under a signed order from Strickland. They also argued that serving the probation sentence now would violate constitutional protections against having to serve a sentence twice for the same offense. A Florida appeals court affirmed earlier this week that Anthony would have to serve the one-year probation sentence. She cannot, the court ruled, ""take advantage"" of an administrative error to avoid serving the sentence, which was first imposed in 2010. This backed up a ruling earlier this month by Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr., who said Strickland's verbal order was binding and ordered Anthony to report for probation in Florida on the bad-check charge by Friday. The attorney general's office wrote that Anthony ""upon her release (July 17), should have reported"" for probation -- something she did not do. In an emergency petition filed on Wednesday with the same appeals court, Anthony's defense team asked that the court overturn Perry's order before the required date. They also asked the appellate court to strip Perry of further jurisdiction in the case. CNN's Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.","NEW: A Florida corrections spokeswoman says Casey Anthony was cooperative .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich are through to the group stages of the Champions League after a 1-0 win at Swiss side FC Zurich gave them a 3-0 aggregate success in their play-off second leg. A strong Bayern side, featuring eight members of the Germany national side, secured their place in the last 32 courtesy of an early strike from Mario Gomez. Gomez was left unmarked in the area to finish off a flowing move involving Toni Kroos and Thomas Mueller, for the only goal of the game in the seventh minute. Bayern -- who will be hosting the final of the competition in May 2012 -- now join compatriots Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen in the main draw. Four other second round ties were played on Tuesday, with Spanish side Villarreal also sealing their place in the group stage with a 3-0 win over Odense of Denmark, for a 3-1 aggregate success. Highly-rated Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi netted a close range double, the second coming via a superb curling right-wing cross from Ruben Cani. Substitute Carlos Marchena added a third after goalkeeper Stefan Wessels fumbled his long-range shot, but a bad-tempered second half saw each side have a player sent off, with the home side losing Borja Valero for head-buttting Andreas Johansson in the stomach. Dinamo Zagreb are also through to the group stages, but they were given a scare by Malmo of Sweden. Zagreb side led 4-1 from the first leg in Croatia, but Malmo won 2-0 on the night, just failing to get the third goal that would have seen them progress on the away goals rule. Belgian side Genk beat Maccabi Haifa of Israel 2-1 on the night, a result that left the sides tied at 3-3 on aggregate. The scoreline remained the same through extra time, but Genk prevailed 4-1 on penalties to seal their place. Brazilian striker Ailton scored twice, with the decisive goal coming three minutes from time, to give Cypriot side APOEL Nicosia a 3-1 victory over Wisla Krakow of Poland for a 3-2 aggregate success. There is a consolation prize for the losing teams with a place in the group stages of the Europa League.","Bayern Munich are through to the group stage of the Champions League .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. State Department got personal in its complaints against the Syrian government Thursday, accusing it of a ""targeted, brutal attack"" on a popular Syrian political cartoonist, Ali Farzat. Shortly after a cartoon by Farzat depicting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hitching a ride with outgoing Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi began circulating in Syria, Farzat was reportedly kidnapped by masked men, beaten and thrown unconscious from a van onto a road in Damascus . ""The (al-Assad) regime's thugs focused their attention on (Farzat's) hands, beating them furiously and breaking one of them -- a clear message that he should stop drawing,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland wrote in an official statement. The statement went on to name five other ""moderate activists"" that it said have been jailed for speaking out against the al-Assad regime. ""While making empty promises about dialogue with the Syrian people, the Assad regime continues to carry out brutal attacks against peaceful Syrians trying to exercise their universal right to free expression. We demand that the Assad regime immediately stop its campaign of terror through torture, illegal imprisonment, and murder,"" Nuland's statement continued. Passers-by reportedly found the beaten 60-year-old cartoonist and took him to a hospital. A photograph circulating Thursday on the internet showed Farzat with a bandage over his right eye, his face badly bruised, and heavy bandages wrapped around both hands. Nuland's statement described Farzat as ""the most popular political cartoonist in the country,"" and reaction in Syria was swift to the attack on a man described on a website featuring his cartoons as having ""a pen of Damascus steel."" In a demonstration of solidarity, a number of Syrians on Facebook changed their profile pictures to that of the bruised and bloodied satirist. Farzat is known for his caricatures lampooning figures such as Saddam Hussein, who threatened him with death before banning his work in Iraq, and Gadhafi of Libya, where his work is also banned.","Ali Farzat is a popular Syrian political cartoonist .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Aya Abu Mouwais, a 3-year-old who lives in the West Bank, can barely walk or talk because of a failing kidney and liver. For much of her life, the Palestinian child has needed dialysis to survive. Thankfully, an Israeli man has been able to help her get the treatment she so desperately requires. More than 500 times in the past two years, Yuval Roth and his volunteers have driven Aya and her mother roundtrip from a checkpoint near the West Bank border to Rambam Medical Center, which is an hour away in Haifa, Israel. ""What Yuval has done, no one else has done,"" said Aya's mother, Suhair. ""He is day by day helping us to get her to the hospital. I'm not allowed to drive an Israeli car, so if not for Yuval, we wouldn't be able to transport her. I thank him."" Leaving the West Bank is the only way Aya's family can get dialysis. For one thing, medical facilities are limited in the territory. ""In the Palestinian Authority, it's very expensive to get health care, and most of the people cannot afford it,"" Roth said. It's also expensive to make the trip to Israeli hospitals. Although the Palestinian Authority allows sick children and adults to leave the West Bank for treatment, Palestinians are not allowed to drive past the checkpoints. To get to Israeli hospitals, they'd have to take a taxi, which would cost at least $90 each way. Fortunately, there is Roth and his organization, Derech Hachlama (""On the Road to Recovery""). Since 2006, Roth and his team of volunteers have been giving Palestinians a lifeline. ""The volunteers are driving at least five days a week,"" said Roth, a 55-year-old carpenter and professional juggler from Pardes Hanna, Israel. ""Some (drive) in the morning to drop off patients, and others come in the evening to take them back. That makes the whole thing easy, since they can still go to work and don't have to spend the whole day."" For Roth, the transportation service is a way to recover from personal tragedy. In 1993, his brother Udi was kidnapped and killed by members of Hamas. After his loss, Roth found a way to channel his anger into peace. ""I heard an interview on Israeli radio with a man who lost his son in the same way that I lost my brother,"" Roth said. ""After the interview, I called him ... and he said he had an idea to establish a group to encourage dialogue between bereaved families from both sides, Israelis and Palestinians."" Roth joined the group, called Parents Circle - Families Forum, and befriended many Palestinians. All shared a surprisingly common need: transportation access to Israeli health-care facilities. ""One day, (a program participant) called and told me his brother might have a brain tumor. He had an appointment at Rambam hospital but no way to go,"" Roth said. ""He asked if I could drive him, and I agreed it would be no problem."" That first call for help was more than four years ago. As word of Roth's generosity spread, transportation demands grew, and Roth began to recruit his friends as driver-volunteers. Today, Roth's group has grown to 200 volunteers. Transport coordination efforts are run entirely by Roth, who spends many hours on his cell phone inquiring about the location of volunteers and Palestinian families. Each volunteer maintains his or her own vehicle, but Roth helps cover gasoline costs with donation money he has received. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Even though differences exist, including some language barriers, Roth believes that the program helps Israelis and Palestinians learn from and respect each other. ""When we are coming to pick up the sick kids, the (Palestinian and Israeli) checkpoint managers help us a lot,"" Roth said. ""It makes our life and their life a lot easier. I think Palestinian families trust me also because I'm coming as one of them. I feel like they are my family or my friends."" Roth's group has driven an estimated 90,000 kilometers (about 55,000 miles) in 2010 alone. He says they have helped hundreds of Palestinians get access to health care. ""I lost my brother, but I didn't lose my head,"" Roth said. ""This activity gives me an essence for life. I have learned the price of the conflict is a lot more than the price of making peace. We are all human beings."" Want to get involved? E-mail On the Road to Recovery at roadtorecovery10@gmail.com for more information.

"(CNN) -- Instead of slathering on baby oil and baking in the sun until turning red as a tomato, more beachgoers are donning wide-brimmed hats, flowing tunics and hiding from ultraviolet rays under large umbrellas. Friends Anne Botica, 27, and Monique Moore, 28, noticed this shift in sunbathing fashion trends during a trip to the beach two years ago. ""Instead of tanning and trying to get as bronze as possible, people were being really smart about the sun and covering up in really cute, fashionable ways,"" says Moore, who co-founded a sun-blocking clothing company called Mott 50 with Botica in New York City last year. New companies like Mott 50 are fulfilling people's needs to stay healthy and stylish. Until a few years ago, those seeking special sun-blocking clothing could order apparel only from specialized catalogs. The options were often limited to drab colors and basic cuts. Today, new clothing lines have recognized shoppers' desires to buy outfits they can wear to parties and show off to friends. ""Everything is style-driven and designed to incorporate the latest trends,"" says Melissa Marks, founder of Cabana Life, a sun-blocking clothing company she started in 2005 after she was diagnosed with skin cancer. As the rate of skin cancer continues to rise -- with more than 2 million people diagnosed in the United States each year -- more Americans are seeking sun-safe products. The list includes clothing that contains UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) values, which span from 15 to 50-plus. The higher the value, the more the fabric absorbs UV rays and prevents them from hitting skin. But consumers should not confuse UPF with SPF (sun protection factor) values that rate protection from ultraviolet-B rays in sunscreen because ""they don't necessarily match,"" says Vilma Cokkinides, an epidemiologist and director of research for the American Cancer Society in Atlanta. Sleeves, shade your best bet for sun protection . The UPF value is based on the color and weave of the fabric. ""Shirts with tight weaves are much more protective than shirts with loose weaves,"" says Martin Weinstock, chief of dermatology at the VA Medical Center in Providence, Rhode Island. While darker hues are more protective, clothing companies have created bright, popping colors that are UPF-approved and in style this summer. Some lines sell apparel that covers most of the skin, such as dresses with long sleeves and swim shorts that extend past the knee. Mott 50 caters to people who want to protect themselves and still have fun in the sun. ""We sort of say, 'Go out, wear your swim suit, your bikini, get the color that you want and desire, but ... when you're covering up and you're not looking to get color, then wear something that is certified with the UVA and UVB protection,' "" Moore said. Moore's business partner Botica has a family history of skin cancer. She said women concerned about wrinkles and the sun's effect on aging tend to buy their products, including women in their 20s and 30s. Other customers have been diagnosed with skin cancer and need clothing to protect themselves from UVA and UVB rays. Some purchase items like Henley shirts and colorful sundresses because they think they're ""cute,"" Moore said. ""The fact that it has skin protection is an added value."" For Marks, designing trendy skin-protective clothing is the main goal. Marks was a merchandise expert for fashion magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair and Seventeen before she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma at age 26. At the time, her dermatologist said she needed to wear skin-protective clothing -- something Marks was unfamiliar with. ""Here I am in the fashion world, I had never heard such a thing,"" she said. New melanoma drug helps patients . When she started researching UPF clothing, she was disappointed by what was on the market. ""I thought, 'OK, no wonder I had never heard about it, because it's not something me or any of my friends would want to put on and march around wearing,' "" Marks said. ""It was fluorescent, it was synthetic, and it was not going with a pair of stilettos."" Marks, who is now a cancer survivor, said she was inspired to design clothing that ""combined fashion with function"" and would compete on the same floor as designer brands. Since officially launching in 2005, she has accomplished that goal -- selling Cabana Life hats, beach cover-ups and children's swimwear at Saks Fifth Avenue and resorts like the Four Seasons and The Breakers. Celebrities such as Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and Lisa Kudrow have also supported her products. ""When we hit the scene in 2005, I said UV protection in clothing, and I felt like we had to explain it to everyone,"" Marks said. ""Over the course of the time since we started the company, more and more people are talking about it, understanding it."" Over the past five years, Julie Mahoney from Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, has purchased Cabana Life products for herself and children ages 3 and younger. ""My father had gotten skin cancer years ago, and I'm Irish with very fair skin, so I just decided it was time to be a little more responsible, but also I wanted to wear cute things,"" she said. Five ways to avoid getting a deep-fried sunburn . While some of the clothes tend to be on the expensive side -- with prices ranging from $48 for a girl's pink terry cover-up to $75 for a woman's coral tunic dress -- Mahoney said they're ""well worth the investment."" Her favorite item? Rash guard bathing suits for children that have long sleeves, boy shorts and come in bright colors and aquatic designs. ""They look cute, the kids love wearing them, and they're also great with the sun protection,"" she said. Michael Hubsmith, executive vice president of Coolibar, said he has noticed an increase in the level of awareness about sun-blocking clothing since Coolibar started in 2003 in Minneapolis. Modeled after popular Australian skin-protective clothing, all Coolibar products have a UPF value of 50-plus that is guaranteed to last the life of the garment. Unlike some companies, Coolibar doesn't sell products like bikinis that expose a large portion of the body to sun. ""If you don't cover the skin, then those little triangles of UPF 50-plus in your bikini aren't really going to do anything for you,"" Hubsmith said. While wearing a bathing suit may not comply with sun-blocking practices, Marks said companies have to be realistic about people's clothing choices. ""If I had a sun suit that covered me from head to toe and zipped up over every part of my body, yes, it would be extremely effective, but it wouldn't be effective because I wouldn't put it on,"" she said. Hubsmith also recognizes the need to make UPF clothing ""as fashionable as it can be."" ""People that need UV protection also want to feel like they're included in the crowd -- that the style and clothing they're wearing is not going to single them out as having some kind of a problem with the sun,"" he said. Why not to fry your skin . About one in five Americans develop skin cancer, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Besides making smart clothing choices, experts say people can protect themselves from harmful rays by wearing sunscreen and minimizing the time spent outdoors between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when UV rays are the most intense. But people shouldn't be afraid to venture outside, said Weinstock, the Providence VA Medical Center chief of dermatology. ""It's important for people to be physically active, which usually means being physically active outdoors,"" he said. ""People just need to be sensible. They need to take precautions to minimize any damage to their skin.""","Protecting yourself, family with sun-blocking clothes is becoming a healthy fashion trend .

"(CNN) -- Syrian opposition leaders have dubbed Friday's planned demonstrations ""Friday of Saleh al-Ali,"" a prominent Alawite who commanded one of the first rebellions against the French mandate of Syria in the early part of the 20th century. Some opposition activists said they hope the name prompts the powerful minority ruling class, which is composed primarily of Alawites, to join the demonstrations demanding the fall of the regime. They also say the name sends the message that their demands are not directed against Alawites, but against the regime. Government opponents accuse the regime of identifying them as an Islamist movement, which they deny. The plans came as Syrian refugees continued Thursday to flee across the Turkish border to escape violence, as world powers amplified their outrage over the Damascus regime's tough crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. The number of Syrian refugees now in Turkey stands at 8,904, Turkish emergency officials said. Their report comes a day after Turkish government officials, including Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, met with a special Syrian envoy to help stem the growing tide of refugees. Violence in the country and an offensive in and around the town of Jisr al-Shugur spurred thousands of people to make their way to the border region, and Turkish officials are worried that the crisis could deteriorate and destabilize the area. Davutoglu met Thursday with Syrian envoy Hasan Turkmani, who also sat down on Wednesday with Erdogan. The foreign minister briefed the news media in Ankara about the border crisis, the Turkish meeting with the Syrian envoy, and his visit with Syrian refugees on Wednesday in the Turkish city of Hatay. ""It was a meeting that was very comprehensive in which everything was openly discussed, based on mutual confidence and a joint understanding of sharing matters,"" Davutoglu said of the meeting with Turkmani and his delegation. Calling for a ""strong, stable and prosperous Syria,"" Davutoglu urged the timely development of a ""comprehensive reform process"" there and an end to the discord in Syria. ""I hope the positive scenario of introducing reforms and eliminating violence will take place,"" he said. ""I don't even want to think about the other scenario."" He said Turkey will provide humanitarian help to Syrians massed on the Syrian side of the border. Many Syrians who have fled their homes haven't crossed into Turkey and have instead lived near the border in grim conditions. ""Turkey will never refrain from any help for Syria,"" Davutoglu said. On Wednesday, the U.N. human rights office called for ""a thorough probe into the allegations of widespread abuses committed by Syrian authorities during their violent crackdown."" ""The most egregious reports concern the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians, including from snipers positioned on rooftops of public buildings, and the deployment of tanks in areas densely populated by civilians,"" according to a preliminary report prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""As of mid-June, the number of those killed during such incidents is believed to have exceeded 1,100 persons, many of them unarmed civilians; among them were women and children,"" it said, according to a U.N. statement. The human rights office said reports indicate that up to 10,000 people have been detained over three months, and security forces ""have perpetrated acts of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment against detainees, resulting in death in custody in some cases."" The report, which covers the period from March 15 to Wednesday, is based on data from U.N. agencies, human rights activists, a small number of victims and witnesses, and various other groups. The human rights office said it had to rely on these sources because it hasn't been able to get its own staffers into Syria. There also have been reports that the rights of people to freedom ""of assembly, expression, and movement"" and to get food and health care have been violated. ""The material currently before the high commissioner is a matter of grave concern and reflects a dire human rights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic,"" the report said. ""The alleged breaches of the most fundamental rights on such a broad scale require thorough investigation and, with respect to the perpetrators, full accountability."" Navi Pillay, the high commissioner for human rights, urged Syria ""to grant access to the country for the fact-finding mission established by the U.N. Human Rights Council."" More than 50 nations issued a tough statement on human rights abuses in Syria at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Wednesday, and the U.S. State Department underscored the thrust of the message Thursday. ""The international community has been shocked by the horrific reports of torture and arbitrary arrests, and widespread use of violence against peaceful protesters,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now."" The State Department called on Syria to allow the high commissioner's office to pursue its mission.

"(CNN) -- Manchester City's pursuit of Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri appears to be coming to an end after the two clubs agreed a fee for the French international. Nasri had just one year remaining on his Arsenal contract and City's offer, believed to be in the region of $32 million, has persuaded the London club to cash in, despite manager Arsene Wenger's reluctance to lose the player he signed from Marseille in 2008. The transfer was thought to have hit a stumbling block last week, resulting in Nasri appearing for Arsenal in their 2-0 home defeat by Liverpool on Saturday. What now for Arsenal and Fabregas? However, Nasri has been left out of Arsenal's squad for the second leg of their Champions League qualifier against Udinese, meaning he will not be cup-tied for City's own Champions League campaign. The move, which is now dependent on Nasri passing his medical, will see the 24-year-old become the second player to join City from Arsenal since the end of last season, following defender Gael Clichy's switch, while Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor have also made the same move over the last two years. Nasri follows captain Cesc Fabregas, who completed his transfer to Barcelona last week, out of the Emirates exit door, leaving Wenger with a massive influx of money available to him to reinforce his Arsenal squad by the close of the transfer window on August 31. And Fabregas used his personal Twitter account to say: ""Good luck to my friend Nasri at his new club. One of the best players around."" The Gunners have had a shaky start to the English Premier League season, with just one point and no goals from their opening two matches, leaving Wenger under more pressure than he has ever faced since becoming Arsenal manager 15 years ago. ""The summer was difficult because we had Fabregas and Nasri on permanent transfer negotiations and that is draining in the end,"" Wenger told the official Arsenal website. ""We lost two great players and that's sad, but at some stage it has to be over because we want to focus on the future. ""Overall what you do not want is to have players who play and think they go the next morning, that is not ideal. You want players who are completely committed to the long term,"" he added. Wenger must also take his depleted squad to Italy for Wednesday's crucial match against Udinese, with the Londoners holding a slender 1-0 advantage from the first leg. However, UEFA have confirmed that Wenger will be allowed to sit on the bench for the match after Arsenal appealed against a two-match touchline ban for breaking the terms of his one-match suspension during the first leg against Udinese. In other transfer news, Premier League side Blackburn Rovers have completed their fourth signing of the transfer window, with 25-year-old Montenegro winger Simon Vukcevic joining from Sporting Lisbon on a three-year contract for a fee of $3m.","Arsenal and Manchester City agree a fee for the transfer of Samir Nasri .

"(CNN) -- Casey Anthony's defense team was expected to call more witnesses Friday, a day after presenting testimony that seemed to try to create doubts about forensic evidence presented earlier in the case. On Thursday, the first day the defense began calling witness, Anthony's attorney Jose Baez called several to testify about the evidence. Two of them were FBI examiner Heather Seubert and Orange County, Florida, Sheriff's Office crime scene technician Gerardo Bloise who said that testing found no blood on any of Anthony's clothes, in her car trunk or in the interior of the car. Prosecutors allege that Anthony, 25, killed Caylee in 2008 by using chloroform on her and putting duct tape over her nose and mouth. They allege she then put the little girl's body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home. Caylee's skeletal remains were found December 11, 2008. Although she was last seen June 16 of that year, her disappearance was not reported until July 15, after Anthony's mother demanded answers from her daughter about Caylee's whereabouts. Anthony faces seven counts in Caylee's death, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. She has pleaded not guilty, and her defense attorney has said that when all the facts are known, his client's innocence will become clear. The defense has said Caylee was not killed but rather drowned in the family pool June 16. Baez told jurors in his opening statements that Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death. George Anthony rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial. Bloise  discussed the execution of a search warrant at the Anthony home on August 6, 2008, and his duties, which were to examine the clothing in Anthony's closet with an alternative light source for any stains. Bloise testified that no stains were found on the pants Anthony wore June 16, 2008, the day Caylee was last seen. However, he acknowledged to prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick on cross-examination that Anthony's mother, Cindy, told authorities she had washed the pants after that day. Seubert, who was a forensic DNA examiner for the FBI in 2008, told jurors in the Orlando courtroom that testing showed an indication of possible female DNA on a shovel. Previously, the Anthonys' next-door neighbor, Brian Burner, testified that Anthony asked to borrow the shovel from him June 18, 2008, saying she wanted to dig up a bamboo root. Burner said she returned the shovel shortly afterward. However, Seubert said the amount on the shovel was so small she could draw no scientific conclusions from it. Testing showed no blood present in Casey Anthony's trunk, she said. ""If a method is used to kill someone that doesn't involve bloodshed, then the absence of blood doesn't really say it didn't happen, correct?"" prosecutor Jeff Ashton asked Seubert. ""Correct,"" she replied. ""I can't speak to whether it happened or not."" But she told Baez that as fluids leave the body during decomposition, it is likely that blood could be among them -- if there is a hole in the plastic bag holding a body, for instance. Seubert also tested three pieces of duct tape found at the scene where Caylee's remains were recovered, two of them covering the mouth portion of her remains. She testified that a DNA profile generated on the outside of the tape matched another FBI forensic examiner, Lorie Gottesman. Testing on the inside of the tape was inconclusive, but a possible indication of DNA there did not appear to match Caylee, Casey Anthony or George Anthony, she said. Outdoor elements such as sunshine and water can degrade DNA, she said. Also testifying Thursday was Ronald Murdock, a supervisor in the Orange County Sheriff's Office forensics unit. Murdock testified that a piece of cardboard with a heart-shaped sticker on it was found about 30 feet from where Caylee's skull was discovered. An FBI technician previously testified that heart-shaped adhesive was seen on the duct tape covering the mouth portion of the remains. Sheets of heart-shaped stickers have been introduced into evidence after being found at the Anthony home, but FBI analysis showed that the sticker found near the remains did not match those taken from the home. Gottesman testified that she examined the duct tape for any heart-shaped sticker residue but was unable to see it, even using specialized tools. She said she had no idea how her DNA wound up on the duct tape. In Session's Mayra Cuevas, Ilana Rosenbluth and Michael Christian contributed to this report.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Officials searched for answers Tuesday after a Russian jetliner made a premature descent and burst into flames in the country's northwest, killing 44 people and injuring eight others. ""I do not want to prejudge the investigation and all that but preliminary information suggests an obvious pilot error in poor weather conditions,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov, the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported. Investigators recovered the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from the site of the crash, according to the Investigative Committee probing the crash. The cause of the premature descent is being investigated by the Inter-State Aviation Committee and the so-called black boxes will be recovered and sent to Moscow for deciphering, said Russian Deputy Transport Minister Valery Okulov on Russian state TV. The recorders will help authorities piece together the final minutes of the flight and possibly tell investigators what caused the plane to go down. ""Seems that he had been visually looking for the runway but couldn't see it,"" Ivanov said. The dead included 36 Russians, four people with joint U.S.-Russian citizenship, a Swede, a Dutchman and two Ukrainians, according to the Transport Ministry. Of the injured, five are in critical condition, according to regional authorities in Petrozavodsk. Some will be transported to Moscow for medical treatment. President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences in the aftermath and has sent Transport Minister Igor Levitin to the scene on a fact-finding mission. The families of the dead will receive 1 million rubles ($35,500), while the families of the injured will be compensated 500,000 rubles ($17,750), according to the authorities. The jet with 43 passengers and a crew of nine took off Monday night from Moscow for Petrozavodsk, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) to the north. Controllers lost contact with the twin-engine Tupolev-134 about 11:40 p.m. (3:40 p.m. ET), and it crashed onto a highway outside Besovets, near the Petrozavodsk airport, the ministry reported. ""The first thing that the plane had contact with was a pine tree of about 15 meters high,"" said Alexander Neradko, head of the Russian Federal Aviation Agency on Russian state TV. ""This proves that the plane didn't break in mid-air but that all those destructions were inflicted to it as a result of that contact,"" he said. Nearly 140 rescue workers, doctors and police officers were on the scene before dawn Tuesday. Forensic experts have been dispatched to the crash site to help with identification of the bodies, regional authorities said.

"New York (CNN) -- One hour of recreation a day. Veal patties and noodles for dinner. New York's well-known Rikers Island jail complex has been featured in films, television shows and documentaries, but life on the other side of the bars appears less than glamorous. A number of well-known or infamous inmates have been at least briefly incarcerated there, from the late Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious to, more recently, former NFL receiver Plaxico Burress and rapper Lil' Wayne. However, many celebrities find the facilities in the Rikers Island complex a far cry from the surroundings they may be used to. International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn is the latest well-known inmate at Rikers Island. He was transferred there on Monday after a Manhattan Criminal Court judge refused to grant him bail. Strauss-Kahn faces multiple charges stemming from an alleged sexual assault of a housekeeping employee at New York's Sofitel hotel. Rikers Island, actually a complex of 10 different units located in the New York borough of Queens, dates to the 1930s, when the first facility -- the James A. Thomas Center, formerly known as the Rikers Island Penitentiary -- opened, according to the New York Department of Correction. Once a 90-acre site, Rikers Island was enlarged to more than 400 acres using sanitary landfill, according to the department's website. It is an actual island, accessible only by a bridge from Queens, and its jails have a combined capacity of nearly 17,000 inmates. However, Strauss-Kahn is in protective custody, meaning he is kept away from the general population because of his status as a high-profile inmate, said a department spokesman who asked not to be named. He is in Rikers Island's West Facility, part of which is used to house inmates with contagious diseases, but other parts are used for inmates in protective custody, the spokesman said. Strauss-Kahn is awakened at 6 a.m. each day in his 11-by-13-foot cell, the spokesman said. He will not have interaction or contact with other inmates, and ""his cell is the only one occupied on that side of the unit."" When he is taken out of his cell for his daily hour of recreation or taken to the visiting area to receive visitors, he will be accompanied by a corrections officer and a captain, the spokesman said. Inmates travel outside their cells one at a time, meaning he will have no opportunity to encounter other inmates. The spokesman said Monday that Strauss-Kahn will be allowed to leave his cell periodically and walk around his housing area corridor, where he can watch television -- but he still won't come into contact with anyone else. Tuesday's menu for inmates included an apple, banana, cereal, toast, milk and coffee or tea for breakfast; vegetable chili, rice, green beans, carrot and celery salad and wheat bread for lunch; and veal patties, noodles, steamed cabbage, whole wheat bread, a piece of fruit and tea or a fruit drink for dinner. Inmates and others can deposit money into their commissary accounts, which can be used to purchase toiletries, snacks and haircuts, as well as buy daily phone calls, all of which are monitored and recorded, according to the department. Strauss-Kahn will be allowed three visits a week, not counting his attorney or outside doctor, if he has one, the spokesman said. CNN's Jesse Solomon contributed to this report.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn is in protective custody in Rikers Island .

"London (CNN) -- Portuguese coach Andre Villas-Boas was confirmed as the new manager of Chelsea Wednesday. The 33-year-old will become the youngest manager in the English Premier League. He moved to the west London giants after a payment of €15 million ($21.6 million) made to his former club Porto triggered a release clause in his contract. Villas-Boas, who guided Porto to a treble last season, has signed a three-year contract at Stamford Bridge and will replace Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, who was sacked in May. ""Chelsea football club is delighted to announce that Andre Villas-Boas will be the club's new manager,"" read a statement on the team's official website. Could Villas-Boas succeed at Chelsea? ""His ambition, drive and determination matches that of Chelsea and we are confident Andre's leadership of the team will result in greater successes in major domestic and European competitions."" The former Academica coach worked as a scout for the four-time English champions under compatriot Jose Mourinho, who is now in charge of Real Madrid. Mourinho -- like Villas-Boas -- guided Porto to a trio of domestic and European honors in 2003, before winning two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and two League Cups as Chelsea boss between 2004 and 2007. Is Villas-Boas the new 'Special One'? Turkey head coach Guus Hiddink had been linked with the vacant position after he enjoyed a successful temporary spell with Chelsea in 2009, but billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has opted for Villas-Boas. Former AC Milan coach Ancelotti was dismissed after a trophy-less campaign saw Chelsea finish second in England's top division, despite delivering a league and FA Cup double the previous year. Abramovich will hope Villas-Boas can secure Chelsea the European Champions League, an honor which has so far eluded the Russian since he gained control of the club in 2003. Meanwhile, seven-time French champions Lyon announced the appointment Wednesday of Remi Garde as their new manager. The former French international has been in charge of the club's youth set-up and replaces Claude Puel, who left Monday with a year left on his contract. Garde was capped six times by his country and played for Lyon for nine years before moving on to Strasbourg and Arsenal in the English Premier League.","Chelsea confirms Portuguese coach Andre Villas-Boas as new manager .

"(CNN) -- Everyone on the East Coast knew Thursday that monstrous Irene, energizing over bathtub-warm ocean waters, was heading toward them, posing the biggest hurricane threat to the United States in six years. What they did not know was the exact path of the storm. So people along a 700-mile stretch of the Atlantic Seaboard were, as North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue put it, preparing for the worst and praying for the best. There was even a possibility that the storm, which could reach Category 4 status, could slam into Manhattan, causing concerns about soaring skyscrapers and underground tunnels. A state of emergency has already been declared in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Delaware, Connecticut and parts of North Carolina in anticipation of Irene. Fears were perhaps greatest in North Carolina and Virginia and on the slivers of islands that extend off those coastlines, which could start feeling Irene's punch by Friday evening. On North Carolina's Ocracoke, there is only one way off the island -- by ferry. The county ordered tourists and residents to evacuate. Bobby Hill, the emergency manager for the North Carolina Ferry Division, said more than 1,500 people left Wednesday. The ferries are operating all day Thursday, he said, but the last chance for anyone to get off the isolated, skinny island sticking out in the Atlantic, is one boat Friday morning. After that, well, you are out of options. Clayton Gaskill was one of about 100 Ocracoke residents still around Thursday night. In between playing progressive rock songs on community radio WOVV-FM, he talked about residents making final preparations. ""You pick up stuff that will float."" ""This is a little more serious than many of them,"" Gaskill said, referring to other storms in the region. Isabel in 2003 and Alex in 2004 did have significant impact. Residents have a couple grocery stores, ice and an emergency electrical source to help them ride out and recover from Irene. ""As long as the storm is in progress, you are on your own,"" Gaskill said. Hill has lived through 15 hurricanes in his lifetime: Floyd, Hazel, Connie, David. He's used to boarding up his home in coastal Beaufort and firing up the generator. You might call him a veteran. ""You're a veteran of one and they still keep coming,"" he said. Irene? Well, it will be another name on the long list. Janeen Wall has only one name in her hurricane memory. Floyd in 1999. ""It was scary,"" she said. So much so that Wall was not taking any chances. She arrived at her rented vacation condo on Carolina Beach just this Monday. But by Thursday, she was safely back home in Richmond, Virginia, buying extra bottles of water and gas for the grill, in case the power goes out. In Wilmington, North Carolina, Leigh Muscle planned a dream wedding for Saturday -- along the Intracoastal Waterway, of course. ""Literally my first reaction was, 'Nooo!,'"" Muscle told CNN affiliate WWAY. She had planned to walk down the aisle in the front yard of her mother's house; the reception was to be in the back yard, along the water. ""As of now, it looks like it's just going to be a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind, and it just looks like we need to move the event from outside to inside, so that's what we're planning,"" Muscle said. She's hoping a perfect storm won't ruin her perfect day. On Nags Head, Leanne and Nathan Robinson, surfers since they were kids, hoped to ride a few waves like they do in every hurricane the North Carolina natives have lived through. The winds are too high during the hit, but the swell before and after the storm could be ideal. But this time, it's different. Not because Irene is so huge, or that she is eyeing the Outer Banks. But this time, the young couple owns a house. This time, they have a 2-year-old daughter to protect. If it looks like a direct hit, Leanne plans to evacuate with their child. Nathan will stay to look after the house and the surf shop that Leanne manages. ""We are going to wait until tomorrow afternoon to make a decision,"" Leanne Robinson said. In the meantime, they've brought in the tomato plants, picked up debris and tied down everything that needs to be secured. And they cut dead branches off the tall pines in their yard. Farther north in Lewes, Delaware, Georgia Tugend is planning to ride out the storm along with her husband, Dave, and dog, Barkley. ""Our plan is not to leave,"" Tugend said. ""Temporary shelters will not take the dog, and we feel that our house is elevated enough that we would avoid any possible storm surge."" Tugend, who lives about half a mile from the Delaware Bay, said she and her husband are securing several items in their yard, including outdoor furniture and a 14-foot aluminum boat. ""We're going to hope for the best as far as the cars go,"" she said, noting that they don't have a garage. Tugend said she plans to fill her tub with water, and may stock up on extra beer as well. ""We had some really bad storms this past fall and winter with gusts clocked up to 70 miles per hour. We know we can get through that,"" she said. ""But you don't want to get cocky. If we get 100-mile per hour winds, that's a different ballgame. We've never lived through that."" In nearby Dewey Beach, 71-year-old Allan Lynch was taking steps to protect his restaurant, The Captain's Table. Lynch, a lifelong resident of the area, is planning to cover all of the windows at the restaurant, take down loose signs outside and bring in his trash cans. Lynch said he will probably close his business. He's also bringing in a supply of dry ice to help preserve the restaurant's food in case power is lost. As for himself, Lynch said he would probably ""go inland a little bit"" and seek shelter with his 90-year-old mother if the storm becomes severe enough. Lynch's wife stocked up extra milk, water and batteries. Some described their preparations as ""minimal,"" such as Nathan Nickerson in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. But ""I've got my chainsaw sharpened, and I've got my tractor ready to clear the way"" if there are a lot of downed trees, he said. Nickerson predicted that traffic at his business -- Arnold's Lobster and Clam Bar in Eastham -- will ""probably drop off to nothing, at least temporarily."" But the place will stay open as long as it can, Nickerson said. Thursday, he was already taking down several awnings, tents, and umbrellas. If nothing else, he joked, he would hold Arnold's annual employee party during the storm. Meanwhile, the owner of Alex's Bait & Tackle at Point Pleasant Beach in New Jersey said he's preparing for the worst. He's going to put as many as 150 sandbags in front of his water's edge store. ""I will stay here as long as I can,"" Marc Palazzo said. ""Most storms I ride out, but for the first time in 15 years I'm thinking of not riding this one out. ""I think the storm will head right up the Jersey shore at this point,"" he said. ""And locally, I don't think we're prepared. Nobody's boarding up anything, and there could be some major devastation."" Stores even farther north in New Hampshire were also gearing up for Irene. The emergency display was up at the Home Depot in Manchester, reported CNN affiliate WMUR. Generators. Flashlights. Backpack survival kits. And extra supplies of sump pumps. Peter Hoiries, who works for a restoration company, warned residents of Irene's strong winds. ""Standard shingles used in the New England area are good only for 75 miles per hour,"" he said. Older ones could blow off in even lighter winds. In Horseneck Beach, Massachusetts, the sun beat down Thursday. No sign of Irene yet, but people asked: ""What if?"" Boat owners in Falmouth Harbor began removing their vessels, according to CNN affiliate WHDH. Some people find it exciting, the prospect of a hurricane -- generally thought of as a Southern thing -- heading to New England. But veterans were quick to say ""beware."" ""They're exciting until they get a week into not having hot water, refrigerator, running around for ice and no electric power,"" said Bruce Crenshaw, a charter boat captain. ""The excitement wears off quick."" The reality is that many folks on the East Coast were still in a wait-and-see mode Thursday, as Irene -- slowly but surely -- made her way toward them.

"(CNN) -- Applauding budget-cutting measures taken and proposed by Greece's government in the face of intense public pressure, European finance ministers announced Monday that Athens is on track to receive fresh loans in mid-July. ""The Greek authorities are embarking on a significant and necessary adjustment effort,"" said members of the Eurogroup, which consists of officials from countries in the Euro economic zone, in a statement. ""Ministers recognized the considerable progress achieved by the Greek authorities over the last year (and) are also conscious of the serious challenges that Greek citizens are facing in these difficult times."" No specifics were given on the extent or parameters of the loans, which would be the second round in the bailout aimed at keeping Greece solvent -- and preventing its economic crisis from worsening and spreading through Europe and beyond. While Athens is on track for the new loans, the ministers said they were contingent on completing a planned ""compliance report,"" finalizing details through ongoing negotiations with European officials and taking other steps, including continuing austerity measures. ""This, together with the passing of key laws on the fiscal strategy and privatization by the Greek parliament, will pave the way for the next disbursement (of loans),"" the finance ministers said. The Eurogroup also said ""voluntary roll-overs of existing Greek debt"" would be permitted under the strict parameters of its bailout plan. The ministers explained the relaxed move was needed given that Athens likely won't get access to private market funds until early next year. This statement came a day after Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou called for lawmakers to back his latest round of budget-cutting measures, telling them, ""The government must stop spending more than it takes in."" He's fighting to stay in power in the face of weeks of protests against plans for measures to bring down the country's budget deficit and get a second international bailout. He reshuffled his Cabinet on Friday and is seeking a vote of confidence in his new ministers as his party clings to a wafer-thin majority in parliament. Two days after his appointment as finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos attended talks Sunday on a second economic bailout package for his debt-strapped country as part of a two-day meeting on Europe's economic outlook in Luxembourg. The former defense minister also took over the post of deputy prime minister. The Greek bailout tops the agenda of the meeting of the Eurogroup and Economic and Finance Ministers Council, which representatives of the International Monetary Fund will also attend, according to an EU news release. The IMF is contributing to the bailouts of European Union member countries. IMF staff members will present their assessment of Europe's economy. They and the finance ministers will examine existing bailouts for Ireland and Portugal, as well as the economic progress in those countries. Ireland is poised to meet proposed austerity conditions for the second quarter, according to the EU, and has received second-quarter disbursements. Portugal has met requirements for the first payments of its bailout package. The crisis raises concerns for Europe's currency, the euro. A default on its debts by Greece, or another struggling nation such as Portugal or Ireland, could adversely affect the world economy. The harsh reforms designed to help reduce Greece's enormous budget deficit have so far led to tax hikes and public-sector job losses alongside already record-high unemployment. There are fears that efforts to restructure Greece's debt could send shock waves through Europe's banking sector and spark investor panic similar to that in the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the U.S.-based global investment bank. Venizelos addressed the Greek nation Friday, urging consensus in solving the crisis. ""Our priority is the viability and sustainability of the public debt,"" he said. ""There is no disagreement on this issue."" Papandreou faces opposition from his party over the austerity measures needed to secure an additional bailout package. The IMF said Thursday that it would continue to back Greece provided that Greece carried out the economic policy reforms agreed upon by the government. The Greek government's popularity has plunged recently, and anti-government protests turned violent Wednesday, as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the finance ministry and police fired tear gas at protesters, police said. On June 9, the Cabinet approved a tough five-year plan for 2011-15 and introduced a bill in Parliament to put austerity measures into effect. The latest measures include further cuts in public spending, more tax increases and the faster privatization of state-held assets, including utilities, ports and airports. The government proposes reducing the public-sector workforce by 150,000; workers will also face changes in working hours, practices and wages. The plan also sets out changes to social benefits, including pensions and unemployment aid. According to the finance ministry, these measures will help achieve 28.3 billion euros ($40.5 billion) in cuts from 2012 to 2015, and shrink Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product, in accordance with the EU target. The government has said the passage of these additional measures is essential to Greece's securing the fifth portion of the first 110 billion euro ($158 billion) bailout package that Greece signed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts. CNN's Diana Magnay and Ben Brumfield and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: Euro zone ministers say new loans are contingent but on track .

"Paris (CNN) -- A decree from the early 1990s, reimplemented by French regulators, is putting an end to French television and radio announcers naming social networking sites on air except for news purposes. The decree banned ""clandestine advertising"": the promotion of a brand outside the boundaries of recognized publicity avenues. The reimplementation of the ruling by France's Superior Audiovisual Council means that French programs will no longer be able to urge their viewers or listeners to follow them on specific sites, such as Twitter, as has become the norm in worldwide broadcasting. The controversy began when an unnamed French TV channel approached the council to ask whether, under this decree, they had the right to direct viewers to social sites. Christine Kelly, spokeswoman for the council explained: ""Facebook and Twitter are commercial brands like Coca-Cola or L'Oreal or any other. There are many social networking sites on many topics -- cooking, animals -- why should we mention one and not others?"" From now on news anchors will be able to give only vague instructions as to where to find information online, such as ""follow us on social networking sites."" French bloggers have been up in arms on Twitter and some have even composed tongue-in-cheek ways to get round the ban. One suggested: ""find live coverage of the trial on our thread on the platform which spreads messages of 140 characters"" French commentators have been speculating on the real roots of this regulation. Matthew Fraser, a social networking expert and author of ""Throwing Sheep in the Boardroom,"" a book looking at the online social media revolution, believes the ban could be a sign of defiance against Anglo-Saxon cultural domination. ""In my mind,"" he said, ""if it had been a French social networking site then nobody would have wanted it to be regulated, but because these sites symbolize the United States, regulation is there."" This is not the first time anglicized, Internet-related vocabulary has been banned in France. In 2003 the use of the word ""e-mail"" was forbidden in all government literature. This was due to the Toubon law, which tries to protect the purity of the French language from anglicized words and phrases. This time, however, the Superior Audiovisual Council insists that the ban is in no way linked to language purity. ""It's not at all related. It's true that we are very attached to the French language and defend it a lot, but ... this is simply about reapplying existing regulations,"" Kelly said. The council's decision did not cause much of a debate in the French media. Fraser believes that unlike cheese or wine there were no French interests involved and the French are simply used to regulation. ""It doesn't faze them because it's part of their culture,"" he said. Kelly emphasized the cultural differences that need to be taken in to account: ""We have many, many rules which do not exist elsewhere. There is a very different context for this from one country to another. In the U.S., for example there are advertisements on TV every five minutes, whereas in France its more like every 20 minutes."" She added that, similarly, in the United States product placement is commonplace, but it is forbidden in France. Many are struck by the bizarre timing of the ban as it comes on the heels of the e-G8, an internet summit in Paris at which President Nicolas Sarkozy met with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.","A decree bans ""clandestine advertising"": promotion outside standard publicity avenues .

"Cairo (CNN) -- It's been more than four months since longtime Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak was forced out by his people in largely peaceful mass protests that lasted 18 days. The opposition activists who celebrated in the streets after Mubarak stepped down had hoped that tangible changes would follow soon after their Tahrir Square victory. It had not even taken three weeks to rid the country of an autocratic president who had ruled with an iron fist for three decades. Why, then, is it taking so long to achieve further progress? ""The people who went to Tahrir were fed up with corruption, with the lack of freedom, the social injustice and police brutality,"" said Amr Khodeir, a 27-year old accountant who camped out with fellow revolutionaries in the square. ""We thought we would feel the change once Mubarak and his men were no longer in power."" But four months on, little has changed on the ground. With parliamentary elections planned for September and the government in transition, the nation's economic outlook is as bleak as ever. The country's long-detested police force, which deserted the streets during the uprising, has been hesitant to return and face the wrath of a now-emboldened and angry public. This has contributed to a security vacuum that has led to increased crime, thuggery and a spate of sectarian violence. Yet protesters still face the prospect of detention and possible mistreatment, human rights activists say. Many Egyptians feel that the revolution is incomplete as they wait for Mubarak and members of his former administration to be brought to justice. They wonder why the Supreme Military Council, now in control, has not acted against former regime members to show its commitment to change. Trials of the former ministers -- facing charges ranging from misuse of public funds to ordering the killing of protesters --- have been postponed several times. Mubarak himself has so far escaped justice, although he is under arrest in his hospital room in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh and has been barred from leaving the country. ""Egyptians too are dismayed that the ousted president's loyalists were given ample time to hide their assets,"" Asmaa Mahfouz, a founding member of the April 6 youth movement, recently told a Cairo gathering. Some Facebook users ask why the Supreme Military Council and the transitional government have taken to so long to put Parliamentary Speaker Fathy Surour, Mubarak's chief of staff Zakaria Azmy and National Democratic Party Secretary General Safwat el Sherif behind bars. There has been no official response. Members of the Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party still hold key positions in state institutions. ""Whenever one NDP member is forced out by angry protesters, he or she is almost immediately replaced by another Mubarak loyalist,"" said Najlaa Abdel Hafez, a journalist working for the state-sponsored Al Ahram newspaper. At Egypt's state TV, where I worked until quitting February 3 in protest of the uprising coverage, the same heads of channels and senior editors who described revolutionaries as traitors and foreign agents during that period are still in charge . ""Nothing has changed,"" said Ahmed Sherif, a news editor with the main Arabic channel. ""In fact, there is greater control now than there was during the Mubarak era. All scripts are revised by senior editorial staff, and any news item related to the armed forces has to be approved by the Morale Affairs Department before it is aired or published."" In recent weeks, six journalists were summoned by the military prosecutor for questioning after publicly criticizing the military on television talk shows. Among them was Hossam Hamalawy, who had urged that members of the armed forces be held accountable for any wrongdoing, saying that no one is above the law. Blogger Michael Nabil was sentenced to three years in prison by a military court for criticizing the army. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which promotes press freedom, has said that such actions were meant ""to create a climate of fear and to intimidate journalists."" In a more shocking development just weeks ago, a young reporter was sexually assaulted while covering a Friday rally in Tahrir Square. The attack was front-page news, and all the local dailies carried a picture of the reporter in apparent shock after her ordeal. In a conservative, predominantly Muslim society where a girl's chastity is closely linked to family honor, it is rare for such photographs to be displayed publicly for fear they may sully a girl's reputation and stigmatize her for life. ""The decision by local media editors to brazenly show the pictures was a clear message to deter female protesters from joining their male counterparts in Tahrir Square in future,"" businessman Medhat Fawzi suggested. There also have been reports of brutality against Tahrir Square protesters arrested since Mubarak's fall from power. Mona Seif, a young activist who has made it her mission to document rights abuses by the armed forces, says one group of detainees was subjected to torture, including electric shocks, at the hands of the military March 9. In an earlier incident, on February 26, opposition activist Mohamed Moussa alleges that he and fellow protesters were relentlessly beaten and kicked while in detention, allowed a brief respite only when they followed orders to chant ""Long live Hosni Mubarak."" As the elections draw nearer, many are left wondering whether the military rulers will be willing to cede power to a civil government. Ambassador Mohamed Rifaah, former official spokesman for the Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar, Egypt's highest religious authority, is one of the skeptics. ""Egypt has been ruled by the military for 60 years,"" he said. ""Convincing the diehard dictators to loosen their grip on power won't be easy.""","It took only 18 days for Egyptians to oust President Hosni Mubarak .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Coalition forces in Afghanistan have killed the Taliban insurgents responsible for the downing of a helicopter that left 38 U.S. and Afghan personnel dead, the commander of U.S. forces there and NATO announced Wednesday. A precision airstrike killed Mullah Mohibullah -- a Taliban leader -- and the insurgent who fired what's believed to be the rocket-propelled grenade that brought down the helicopter, according to Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Several of their Taliban associates were also killed, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. ""This does not ease our loss, but we must and we will continue to relentlessly pursue the enemy,"" Allen told Pentagon reporters assembled for a video news conference Wednesday. The strike took place in Chak district, Wardak province, on Monday, the ISAF said. A Taliban spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. Wardak provincial spokesman Shahidullah Shahid also could not be reached for comment. The attack on the helicopter Saturday represented the worst single-incident loss of American life since the start of the Afghan war. Thirty Americans died in the crash, military officials said.  The other victims were Afghan personnel. The Pentagon will put the Navy SEAL death toll in the helicopter downing at 17, according to two Defense Department officials. Originally, Pentagon sources told the news media that 22 SEALs were killed. Mohibullah was a key facilitator in an insurgent attack cell led by Din Mohammad, a Taliban leader killed in a previous Special Operations mission, Allen said. Mohibullah had as many as 12 Taliban fighters under his command, including potential suicide bombers. ""After an exhaustive manhunt, Special Operations forces located Mullah Mohibullah and the shooter after receiving multiple intelligence leads and tips from local citizens,"" the ISAF statement said.  ""The two men were attempting to flee the country in order to avoid capture."" ISAF troops found and followed the two into a wooded area and, after ensuring no civilians were around, called for the airstrike, the statement said. Allen said the aircraft involved in the strike announced by NATO was the F-16, but he didn't say how many. Allen said the strike didn't kill the Taliban leader that U.S. forces were hunting the night of the fatal attack, but he confirmed that Mohibullah was killed in the F-16 strike announced Wednesday. The remains of all 38 of those killed in Saturday's incident arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Tuesday for a ""dignified transfer.""  Because the catastrophic nature of the crash made the remains difficult to identify, all were brought to the United States. The Air Force Mortuary Affairs Office explained that a ""dignified transfer"" is not a ceremony, but rather ""the process by which, upon the return from the theater of operations to the United States, the remains of fallen military members are transferred from the aircraft to a waiting vehicle and then to the port mortuary."" Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the names, ages, hometowns and military units of the slain Americans will be released within the next 24 hours. He said the public announcement has been delayed for security reasons. The Afghan remains will be returned to their families once identifications can be made, U.S. officials said. CNN's Joe Sterling, Larry Shaughnessy, Barbara Starr and David Ariosto contributed to this report .","The IDs of the 30 U.S. service members killed will be released soon .

"(CNN) -- American sci-fi fans are missing something. After roughly 20 years on television, the ""Stargate"" franchise is defunct. The ""Battlestar Galactica"" franchise is still waiting to launch its latest iteration, ""Blood and Chrome,"" and the resurrected ""V"" franchise, which ran on ABC, ended after two seasons. Where are all the aliens on television? This weekend, at least some aliens will be on TNT, as ""Falling Skies"" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. Robert Rodat and Steven Spielberg have been working on the show (an apocalyptic science fiction show about an alien invasion that decimates Earth's societies) for three years, and fans have been waiting. (TNT, like CNN, is owned by parent company Time Warner.) The ""Falling Skies'"" preview at last year's San Diego Comic Con sparked excitement from a packed room of fans, but series star Noah Wyle knows the stakes are high. ""I was amazed at the turnout we got,"" Wyle said. ""And just how closely that particular audience pays attention to detail. How wounded they feel (after) being jilted in the past (by other science fiction shows) and so they have an apprehension about embracing a new project. ""But once that audience is won over, I don't think there's a more loyal following anywhere. They seem to be the most vociferous letter writers in the country to support shows they enjoy, and hopefully we'll be one of them,"" he said. Sci-fi fans say they have been burned by TV in the past and are cautious with their excitement for shows like ""Falling Skies"" and FOX's upcoming ""Terra Nova."" Fledgling shows with ardent fan support have not been lucky in prime time in the last year. ""It seems like if a show doesn't come out of the gate blazing white hot and maintain that 'Wow' factor, they're gone in two episodes,"" sci-fi fan Shawn Hill said. Hill, who works in the IT security industry, spent 13 hours getting a stargate tattooed around his elbow. ""I feel like American networks don't get it,"" said Joy Scarborough, an insurance agent in Athens, Georgia, and an avid science fiction fan. Citing NBC's recent pass on ""Seventeenth Precinct,"" a supernatural show created by ""Battlestar Galactica"" alum Ron Moore, which would have ostensibly been a cross between ""Harry Potter"" and ""Law and Order,"" Scarborough said, ""The networks are not catering to the people who want to see something intelligently written. I think they're absolutely missing out and BBC and Syfy get it."" In order to fill the programming void, plenty of fans who tuned in to long-established franchises are turning to ""Doctor Who"" on BBC America and ""Eureka,"" ""Haven,"" ""Sanctuary"" and ""Warehouse 13"" on the Syfy channel. ""Falling Skies"" executive producer Darryl Frank knows what sci-fi fans have been missing and said it was a specific design of the show to get writers who could offer compelling stories. ""We literally had writers from 'Battlestar Galactica,' 'Lost,' 'Heroes' and for the second season, a writer from 'Stargate,' "" Frank said. ""We specifically went out there to pursue people who could tell those types of stories. But then we also wanted to make sure the people that were tuning in weekly who didn't know about the mythology because maybe they missed a week or two could still get on for the ride,"" he said. Mark Verheiden, a co-executive producer and writer for ""Falling Skies"" is one of those people. He's worked on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" ""Smallville"" and ""Heroes."" ""One of the big differences I think with 'Falling Skies' from many other invasion shows is that we're actually starting six months after the main 'shock and awe' invasion has happened. So our survivors have had six months for the shock to fade and now they're faced with a series of choices. They're essentially under occupation from this alien force, which is very strange,"" Verheiden said. The aliens are mysterious, he said, because they aren't talking or negotiating with the captive Earth population. ""These aren't the Cylons, who look like us and we can talk to and try to talk our way out of it or negotiate or something. These creatures are very complicated and strange."" Wyle admits the aliens seen in ""Falling Skies"" are ""really freaky."" ""We didn't have the benefit of knowing what they were going to look like when we shot the pilot,"" he said.  Instead, the actors reacted to an image of one of the giant spiders from the movie ""Eight Legged Freaks"" that was blown up on a piece of cardboard and carried around by a prop guy. Freaky aliens and end-of-the-world scenarios are often catnip to the sci-fi fan community, something executive producer Justin Falvey knows all too well. ""Something Steven (Spielberg) spoke about from the beginning is, it should feel incredibly authentic and incredibly grounded in real human emotions. People should be able to posit the question, 'What would you do if you were in this scenario?' "" he said. Apocalyptic science fiction uses out-of-this-world circumstances to describe human struggle, Falvey said The most interesting area for ""Falling Skies"" creators to explore was the human character, he said. ""Everything in terms of how we judge people in society -- socioeconomically, education-wise, all those things -- they go away immediately given what's happened here,"" he said. It's one reason why science fiction fans love the genre so much. Stories that envision the future can focus on how society evolves and what fantastic technology could exist, like Gene Roddenberry's vision in ""Star Trek,"" but they can also show a more directly relatable side of future humanity. ""Everyone pulls together for the good of all mankind"" in apocalyptic science fiction, said Scarborough. ""There's a lot more pulling together in science fiction than really any other genre."" ""And you don't see that every day. With a tragedy you do, you see people pull together for a little while and it gives you hope that people do have that in them,"" she said.","Apocalyptic science fiction focuses on aliens and the human condition .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Myanmar's government announced Thursday that it will begin circulating a new currency note next week. The new note would be the largest unveiled by the military regime. The 5,000 kyat note, which is worth less than US$5, will be the largest bank note that the southeast Asian country has ever had. It will be released into circulation on October 1, according to an announcement on Myanmar's state-run MRTV. There was no explanation for the government's decision to introduce the new bill. Currently, the largest note is the 1,000 kyat bill, which is worth less than $1 . The announcement has raised concerns that Myanmar's economy is not faring well, said a veteran independent journalist who lives in Yangon. He declined to be named citing security concerns. Myanmar is a closed country whose military rulers have a tight grip on information and do not tolerate dissent or criticism. The journalist said the cost of living is already high for the average person in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. The decision to introduce the 5,000 kyat bill could depreciate the value of the country's currency and have broader economic repercussions, he said. The sudden cancellation of some Burmese currencies in 1987 sparked anger and led to a mass demonstration in August 1988. At that time, people's savings were diminished overnight.","The new 5,000 kyat note is worth less than US$5 .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels in Tripoli furiously hunting for signs of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are exploring a network of tunnels and bunkers built beneath his massive compound. CNN's Sara Sidner got a peek at the passageways Friday. She dubbed it ""Gadhafi's inner sanctum."" The correspondent, who's been covering the battle of Tripoli, walked down steps into a pitch-dark tunnel and used a flashlight to navigate an underworld described as ""massive."" So far, she said, rebels have cleared about 700 meters of underground passages. The tunnel network is believed to extend all the way to the city's international airport and the Rixos hotel. That's where 33 journalists and two foreign nationals were held for five days by pro-Gadhafi forces. It also is thought to extend to a neighborhood where Gadhafi forces were lobbing shells recently toward the compound after it was taken over by the rebels. The tunnels Sidner saw are wide enough for adults to walk side by side. She spotted a golf cart that can easily fit in the corridors. Sidner also saw a range of other sights as she strolled through the labyrinth: A thick wall, a massive door and a sturdy lock. A charred ceiling, couches and beds where a fire apparently occurred. Pieces of metal and shrapnel. A section where NATO bombs fell and the roof caved in. Another room contained videotapes lined up on a shelf, part of a TV studio where Gadhafi may have recorded messages. ""It's set up like a survival bunker,"" Sidner said in an on-air report.

"(Health.com) -- Four doses of rabies vaccine are enough to prevent infection in most kids exposed to the deadly virus, according to a new policy statement from the nation's largest organization of pediatricians. Between 20,000 and 40,000 people in the U.S. receive the rabies vaccine each year, usually after being bitten by an animal. The standard vaccine regimen has been five shots over a 28-day period, but recent research has shown that the vaccine works in just four (or even three) shots. The American Academy of Pediatrics is now recommending that children who have potentially been exposed to rabies receive four shots in two weeks. (Children with weakened immune systems should continue to receive the five-shot regimen, the group says.) This recommendation affirms a set of 2010 guidelines for all ages from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health.com: 12 vaccines your child needs . The policy change is designed in part to avoid shortages of the vaccine, says Rodney E. Willoughby, M.D., a professor and pediatrician at the Medical College of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, who helped write the policy statement in this week's issue of the journal Pediatrics. The most recent such shortage, in 2009, required public health officials to ration rabies shots. The change will also minimize the small chance of side effects (such as hives and swelling) associated with the vaccine, says Brett Petersen, M.D., an epidemic intelligence service officer in the CDC's rabies department. ""It's a very safe vaccine, but at the same time it does carry some risks,"" he says. ""We want to limit the number of doses we're giving to people."" Lowering the dose will also save nearly $17 million a year in health-care costs, the CDC estimates. Health.com: 8 ways to make shots easier for kids . The rabies virus causes brain swelling that is almost always fatal, but the vaccine is 100% effective when given in time. In the U.S., just two to three people are infected with rabies each year. Rates of rabies in the U.S. began falling in the 1950s, when local governments began requiring that dogs be vaccinated against the disease. Most states now require cats to get the shots too. Wild animals -- especially bats -- are by far the most common cause of rabies exposure in the U.S. Bat bites, which typically occur when a person finds a bat in his home and tries to shoo it out, are responsible for 80% of cases in which the vaccine is given, Willoughby says. ""Bats are about the size of mice and they have very small teeth, and so if you have a bat fly into you or bump you, that bat may have just bitten you and you may not appreciate it,"" he says. ""The bat bite looks like a staple wound, and that's enough to get rabies into you and kill you."" Health.com: Vaccines adults need now . For nearly a century after Louis Pasteur invented it in 1885, the rabies vaccine was made from ground-up animal brains and spinal cords. These vaccines -- ""really scary things, which were designed to prevent an even scarier disease,"" Willoughby says -- were painful and dangerous, causing serious neurological damage in about 1 in every 1,000 people who received them. They weren't very potent, however, so as many as 21 of the shots were required. In the 1970s, the first vaccines made from weakened rabies virus grown in cell culture became available. These shots, which are still used today, are much safer and more effective than the old-fashioned rabies shots, and are delivered into the upper arm or thigh. Children are much more likely than adults to be exposed to rabies. Kids are less likely to fear wild animals,  Willoughby says, and because of their small stature, they are more likely to be bitten in the face or neck, which means the virus can travel to the brain much more quickly. A key strategy for protecting kids against rabies is to teach them a healthy fear of wild animals, he adds. ""Wild animals are to be admired from a distance, and not approached or picked up.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebel fighters say they are in control of most of Libya's capital, though the months-long war appeared far from over Saturday. As rebels worked to extend their reach,  Moammar Gadhafi's forces battled back from a number of loyalist strongholds in Libya. The fighting followed warnings by the United Nations and its diplomatic partners that widespread shortages of food, water, fuel and medical supplies could further destabilize the region. ""All agreed that the crisis in Libya has entered a new and decisive phase,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, following conversations Friday with the heads of the African Union, the League of Arab States and others. ""All agreed, as well, on the importance of a smooth transition."" Ban said the transition from Gadhafi's rule must be based on inclusiveness, reconciliation and national unity. ""All agreed that, if the Libyan authorities request, we should be prepared to help develop police capacity, bearing in mind that the country is awash with small arms,"" Ban said. The rebel's leadership, the National Transitional Council, has called on the U.N. Security Council to order the release of billions of dollars frozen by the United States and others at the onset of the war. Though the National Transitional Council has been recognized by 57 countries and the United Nations as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people, the African Union failed to follow suit during a meeting Friday. It also has opposed the release of Libyan funds to the rebel leadership, saying there was no one in charge of the country. The African Union's Peace and Security Council issued a communiqué that urged the ""formation of an inclusive transitional government."" Gadhafi, who served as chairman of the organization in 2009, has strong ties to some of its members, including Algeria and Chad. There has been speculation that should Gadhafi flee Libya, one of the two countries would accept him. Gadhafi has not been seen since rebels advanced on the Libyan capital last week, though he has taken to radio airwaves and urged loyalists to fight. The transitional council has placed a $1.4 million bounty on Gadhafi's head to whoever brings him in or kills him. ""Right now, as I've been saying the past few days, right now there is no evidence to indicate that Gadhafi has left Libya,"" Josh Earnest, President Obama's principal deputy press secretary, told reporters Friday. It is unclear who is directing Gadhafi's forces, who have been battling back at a number of loyalist strongholds. In Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte, NATO warplanes bombed a headquarters bunker, the UK Defence Ministry said. Tornado aircraft fired a salvo of precision-guided missiles into the city, which is east of the Libyan capital on the central coast, it said. Clashes also were reported along Libya's western border, where rebels took control of the main border crossing between the two countries, according to Tunisian state-run media. In the heart of the capital, rebels began exploring a vast network of tunnels that run underneath Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound -- the scene of heavy fighting in recent days. Inside the tunnels, rebels discovered a golf cart believed to be used to navigate the thick-walled hallways, which they believe lead from the compound to the fiercely contested airport, said CNN's Sara Sidner, who joined the rebels to explore the underground network. A former U.S. airbase converted by Gadhafi into a military airport also was opened up by the rebels in Tripoli, revealing long lines of helicopters and dust-laden jets once worth millions of dollars apiece rusting on the tarmac. Rebels tore down a statue at the airport of a fist clenching a fighter jet, which was erected by Gadhafi after American fighters struck the leader's Tripoli compound in retaliation for sponsoring terrorism strikes against U.S. citizens. Rebels fought to retain control of the Tripoli International Airport, which has been shelled repeatedly in recent days by loyalists entrenched in a village to the east. A 17-year-old rebel said he hates war but feels forced to fight until the war ends. At that point, ""I'm going to see my mother. I'm going to see my family,"" said Louis al-Zinatni. ""I'm going to remove this gun from my hands. It's not for me."" The war's toll was evident at one Tripoli hospital where dozens of bodies lay abandoned, said CNN's Nic Robertson, who toured the hospital with rebels. One man was overwhelmed with joy to discover his son among the wounded inside the hospital. But his joy was tempered by the fact that the son's wound -- a bullet to the chest -- could still prove fatal, Robertson said. The continued fighting came amid mounting evidence of revenge killings by rebels and loyalists. Amnesty International said Friday it had gathered accounts from survivors of abuse in Zawiya by pro-Gadhafi soldiers and rebel forces. Amnesty said it also uncovered evidence that pro-Gadhafi forces killed detainees at two military camps in Tripoli on Tuesday and Wednesday. Escaped detainees said loyalist forces had used grenades and gunfire on scores of prisoners at one camp, while guards at the other camp fatally shot five detainees. ""Loyalist forces in Libya must immediately stop such killings of captives, and both sides must commit to ensuring no harm comes to prisoners in their custody,"" Amnesty International said. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Gadhafi alleging crimes against humanity. Meanwhile, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization warned antiquities dealers and others to be on the look out for Libyan artifacts that may be looted during the unrest. ""Experience shows that there is a serious danger of destruction during times of social upheaval,"" Irina Bokova, UNESCO's director-general, said. ""Careless dealers who buy these objects and fragments are in fact inciting more looting. It is, therefore, crucial that the international antiquities market be particularly wary of objects from Libya in the present circumstances."" CNN's Nic Robertson, Dan Rivers, Sara Sidner, Arwa Damon, Raja Razek, Chelsea J. Carter and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","The United Nations warn that food and fuel shortages can further destabilize Libya .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just days after a magnitude 5.8 earthquake cracked the Washington Monument in four places, the National Park Service is trying to protect it from being further damaged by Hurricane Irene, spokeswoman Carol Johnson said Friday. Engineers for the National Park Service are working inside the Washington Monument to ""plug holes and catch anything that they can't plug,"" Johnson told CNN. ""We have a group of people who are on ropes up there, trying to pin and plug whatever they can."" The engineers are using a flexible insulation called backer rod. ""They are basically jamming it into the cracks,"" Johnson said. ""They are doing what they can and putting this backer rod in and then they are going to go back up and inspect after the storm,"" she added. One area of special concern -- the most extensive damage to the stonework near the top caused by Tuesday's earthquake. ""The crack is about 4 feet long and 1 inch wide and in some places wider and you can see sunlight through the crack,"" Johnson said. The monument is closed indefinitely to the public while engineers assess the damage caused by the quake. Even without the new cracks, the monument would have experienced seepage because of the way it was built, according to Johnson. ""The anticipation is there will be more water because of these cracks. These cracks allow the water to get directly through and that is why we are doing everything we can to put in temporary waterproofing,"" Johnson said. However, the water is not expected to compromise the stability of the structure, she said. The first rain bands from Hurricane Irene began hitting the South and North Carolina coasts Friday. The storm is expected to near the D.C. area Saturday night into Sunday.","Park service engineers are using flexible insulation to fix cracks caused by quake .

"(CNN) -- Spanish La Liga side Malaga have continued their recruitment drive with the purchases of French midfielder Jeremy Toulalan from Lyon and experienced Dutch central defender Joris Mathijsen from Hamburg. The 27-year-old Toulalan, who represented France at both Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup finals, has agreed a four-year contract and will be presented by the club at the end of June. He joined Lyon from Nantes in 2006 for $10.5 million, and is a regular for his country -- winning 36 international caps. German striking legend Klose completes move to Lazio . Meanwhile, Mathijsen, 31, spent five successful seasons at Hamburg and has won 72 caps for the Netherlands, playing in last year's World Cup final defeat by Spain. Malaga are owned by Qatari billionaire Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who has invested a lot of money into the squad, since purchasing the club in June 2010. They flirted with relegation last season before finishing 11th in the table and coach Manuel Pellegrini has brought in the likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy, Julio Baptista, Enzo Maresca and Martin Demichelis over the past year to launch a challenge for a Europa League place this season. Meanwhile, Premier League side Newcastle have made their second summer signing with the capture of Senegalese striker Demba Ba from relegated West Ham. Ba, 26, had a clause in his contract which allowed him to move on if West ham were relegated, and he joins French midfielder Yohan Cabaye in arriving at St James' Park. The signing makes some amends for Newcastle, who this week lost club captain Kevin Nolan, ironically to West Ham. The 28-year-old Nolan, the highest scoring midfielder in the Premier League last season with 12 goals, signed a five-year deal with the London side to be reunited once again with his former manager at Bolton, Sam Allardyce.","Malaga complete double signing of Jeremy Toulalan and Joris Mathijsen .

"(CNN) -- A poultry facility in southwest Missouri was quarantined after the discovery of a suspected case of bird flu, officials said. ""As a precaution, the poultry facility has been quarantined following preliminary results obtained during routine testing,"" the Missouri Department of Agriculture said in a news release. Additional tests will authenticate the viral disease at the Polk County facility, the state said Wednesday, adding that it is extremely rare for humans to be affected by this type of bird flu. Cargill Corp. will euthanize up to 15,000 younger birds exposed to older turkeys that tested positive for bird flu antibodies, said Mike Martin, director of communications for the company. Martin said Thursday the older birds are being harvested at another Missouri location. Their meat poses no health risk, he said. Flocks within six miles of the facility are being tested. Test results may be back as early as Friday, Cargill said. ""At the time the tests were conducted, the birds had no symptoms of the avian influenza. However, the antibodies mean at some time, the animal immune systems responded to the avian influenza,"" Martin said. ""The flu could have been present in the water, ground, air or transmitted by other migrating birds."" Cargill owns the birds but uses the farm under a contract, he said. ""This flu is not transferable to humans,"" Martin said. ""The real concern is for animals and the flu not being spread to other animal herds.""

"(Health.com) -- Many people who are overweight and obese either don't realize it or are in denial -- and too few doctors are setting them straight, according to a new study in the Archives of Internal Medicine. Researchers analyzed data on roughly 5,500 people who took part in government health surveys between 2005 and 2008. One-third of the obese participants and 55% of overweight participants had never been told by a doctor that they were overweight, the study found. If a doctor did comment on a patient's weight, it seemed to make an impression. Nearly 20% of obese people whose doctors hadn't brought up their weight described themselves as ""not overweight,"" compared with just 3% of those whose doctors had addressed their weight. Obese and overweight patients who discussed the issue with doctors were also more than twice as likely to have tried to lose weight in the previous year. Health.com: Best and worst advice from top diet plans . ""If people are told by their doctor that they are overweight, it corrects their perception,"" says the lead author of the study, Robert Post, M.D., research director of the Virtua Family Medicine Residency in Voorhees, New Jersey. Overweight is defined as having a body mass index  between 25 and 29, and obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 and up. (BMI is a rough estimate of body fat based on the ratio of a person's height and weight.) Doctors may be reluctant to broach the subject of weight for a number of reasons, Post says. For instance, busy physicians might not want to fall behind schedule by adding another topic to their list of things to discuss during an appointment. And many doctors have negative attitudes toward their heavier patients, whom they see as unlikely to stick to a diet and exercise program, he adds. Health.com: Surprising celebrity BMIs . The researchers weren't surprised by the high percentage of overweight people who thought their weight was normal, as several studies in recent years have found comparable -- or higher -- rates. A study published last year that used similar data from government surveys showed that 23% of overweight women and 48% of overweight men considered their weight to be just right. Post and his colleagues chalk this up to what they call the ""'norming up' of society."" Roughly two-thirds of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese, and as Americans have grown heavier, the perception of what constitutes a normal weight has changed as well, Post says. In fact, most of the overweight study participants accurately estimated their BMI. But many didn't see their weight as unhealthy or recognize the need to shed some pounds. Health.com: America's healthiest diet tricks . Although it might seem obvious that excess weight is unhealthy, being reminded of this by a doctor can be an effective wake-up call, says Robert B. Baron, M.D., director of the weight management program at the University of California San Francisco. In an editorial accompanying the study,  Baron notes that studies have shown that smokers whose doctors remind them of how unhealthy the habit is and encourage them to quit are more likely to do so successfully than those whose doctors stay mum. Simple reminders and encouragement to lose weight could have a similar effect on overweight and obese patients, he says. Health.com: Obese? What your doc may be overlooking . Baron proposes calculating BMI and entering it on a patient's chart at every doctor's office visit, as is done with blood pressure and other vital signs. ""This is very, very easy to do,"" Baron says. ""If it were required or strongly suggested, it would not be very onerous.... We need to be as aggressive as we were with smoking cessation.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- He is China's most outspoken critic. But when he won his freedom after three months in prison, it came with a cost -- that he keep quiet. One day after Ai Weiwei was released on bail, the dissident artist remained at home, unable to speak with anyone about why he was detained or what awaits him now. All he was able to tell reporters was that he was all right. The terms of his bail stipulated that he not talk to the media. ""And he has reached an agreement with the authorities and that agreement is that he will not say anything about what happened during the 80 days that he was held incommunicado and also that he will desist from any advocacy of the rule of law, human rights or criticism of the government,"" said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Right Watch, . Ai's release came without much fanfare. It was quietly reported Wednesday by the state-run Xinhua news agency. Many in Beijing Thursday seemed unaware that he had been freed. A group of journalists and supporters gathered at his home and studio, hoping to be able to speak to him. Ai looked haggard and thinner. He managed a smile but declined to answer questions. ""I'm fine,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I can not talk. I am on probation, please understand."" It was not a customary answer from the provocative conceptual artist, renowned as a harsh, uncompromising critic of Chinese government policies. He's most famous for designing the Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. But later Ai called for a boycott of the games because he said China was using them as propaganda. He also has accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents. Ai was seized April 3 while planning to board a plane to Hong Kong and later accused of economic crimes, a move that prompted international condemnation and added to criticism over China's controversial record on human rights. He was never formally charged or tried. Ai's Beijing studio was raided, and his wife and eight assistants were taken into custody for questioning. Beijing police accused him of evading a ""huge amount"" of taxes, Xinhua reported in May, more than a month after he was detained. Investigators accused Ai's company of intentionally destroying accounting documents. His prolonged detention sparked international outcry, especially among artists and museum officials in the United States and Europe. He became a rallying point among human rights activists overseas who condemned China's crackdown on political dissidents, lawyers, artists and religious groups. Observers in Beijing said it may not be coincidental that Ai's release on Wednesday took place on the eve of Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming visit to Hungary, Britain and Germany, where Ai enjoys wide support among artists and politicians. The news came after more than 140,000 people in 175 nations joined a campaign spearheaded by Change.org that urged the artist's immediate release. Leading art institutions including the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, London's Tate Modern and the Association of Art Museum Directors were part of the campaign. Fellow activist Zhao Lianhai cheered Ai's release, but expressed concern about the current situation, especially the ongoing crackdown on dissent. On China's cyberspace, Ai's name is nowhere to be found, censored out of existence. Even words with the slightest connection to Ai -- AWW, or ""the fat guy""-- are blocked, too. Some Chinese netizens tried to camouflage their postings. ""The man whose name can not be mentioned is released!"" read one post. International reporting on Ai, including on CNN, was blacked out. China's mainstream press has largely downplayed Ai Weiwei's release; most newspapers ignored it. Ai will not be on Twitter, Facebook or on television. Under bail conditions, he has lost his freedom of speech, said Jerome Cohen, adjunct senior fellow for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""He's got to keep quiet and behave according to the criteria of the Chinese police for the foreseeable future,"" Cohen said. ""He's not the only one. This has happened many times before,"" said Cohen, also a professor at NYU School of Law. Beijing police told state media that Ai had been released on bail because of his good attitude in confessing his alleged crimes and also said he was suffering from a chronic disease. It is not clear to what disease police were referring. Ai has also said that he is willing to pay the taxes he allegedly evaded, police told Xinhua. Relatives and human rights groups said they believe Chinese authorities targeted him because of his irreverent commentary on modern Chinese society, though the Chinese government denied his activism had anything to do with his detention. ""He is not alone in this position and in fact shares it with many human rights lawyers, writers, activists and young people online,"" filmmaker Alison Klayman recently told CNN. ""A lot of the censorship that happens in China is self-censorship, and I think the fact that Weiwei doesn't engage in self-censorship is a big reason why people gravitate to him,"" said Klayman, whose feature film ""Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry"" is set to be released this fall. But for now, Ai will have to be silent. CNN's Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this report.","Ai Weiwei was released Wednesday night .

"(CNN) -- I thought it was absolutely fantastic, the enthusiasm of the people, the logistics. I like it even more because there has been so much doom-saying and criticism in the run-up to these games. There must be a few very frustrated marathon runners who could have set a new world record in the terribly polluted air of Beijing but decided not to compete, not to mention so many journalists that wished the games to end up in a disaster. The people in the cities hosting Olympic events and BOCOG deserve praise. The IOC, in my opinion, deserves even more praise for choosing Beijing and sticking to its decision despite all the criticism. Go China! Go! Laurentius Metaal GM Projects Western Way For Industrial Development Co. Ltd. Of course the show was without equal, for which congratulations are well deserved. HOWEVER, the spending of $40 billion in the face of abject rural poverty, the clandestine treatment of local gymnasts' ages, the lip-synching+re-editing of the opening ceremony and the shipping-off of near-octogenarian women to labor camp after filing an unwanted eyesore of a protest ""application"" as only a FEW examples, show that while we can admire China's cosmetic ability to show itself off, we MUST be wary of the beast within. Thank you for the greatest Olympics ever, China! Now, can we see some freedom for your people and some more balanced economic development? John Jakarta, Indonesia . I think that the International Olympic Committee made a tragic mistake when they awarded the Olympic games to the Chinese. The Chinese have a ... track record of human rights violations that only increased before and during the Olympics. It was disappointing that many media outlets covered so little of the atrocities that the Chinese government committed against their people. I realize that they had a commitment to cover the games, but so much more could have been shown concerning the loss that occurred for the entertainment of others. Homes were seized and demolished so the venues could be built. Michele McCullough . I think it was perhaps the best Olympics ever. China did an outstanding job of preparing and producing a very successful two weeks of competition on a world-class level. I would hate to be London and have to try even matching the spectacle or the opening and closing shows. Because of people power, which they used brilliantly, I think no other country will ever hold a candle to those two events. Mostly, I am happy for China. I think the world will view it differently despite issues in which we differ greatly. I am hopeful that the afterglow of its success will spill over into many other areas and bring a better future to its people. Wallace Rhodes . I don't know why the medal tracker is not done on a weighted point-based system. For example a Gold = 5, Silver = 3, and a Bronze = 1. This would eliminate the debate and allow gold to be valued higher and all medals to count for something. Cheers, Mike K . I think the games were great, but why shouldn't they be? With a country whose government can control everything and spend what it wants, everything should have been perfect. In a country with the the number of people that China has there should be an amazing number of gold ... perhaps even more. Thing about the number of people in China vs Canada. Percentage-wise China should have won a lot more. I'm glad that the games went well, but I don't think anyone should be at all surprised. Few countries have the number of people, the freedom for government control and spending that China has. It would be interesting to know what China could have done / would have done without government control. Dan Ingram Toronto . Participant age controversies and government ideologies aside, this could well have been the greatest Olympics of the modern age. With less pomp and ceremony and more art and talent, the Chinese have brought together both its people, its money, and its true concern for artistic beauty, and displayed to the world what it is capable of being. Now, if it would let its people figure out how to develop and illustrate their Olympic talents without the force and pressure of the whole weight of government, we could surely have some wonderful Olympic Champions. Thank you, Joel Shattles Lawrenceville, Georgia, U.S. A spectacular Olympics to be sure (however not the greatest cover of events on local TV in Bermuda... Thank goodness for my satellite dish !!) Only real complaint was that the scoring for boxing was a travesty ... Please scrap that system !! Donald MacPherson Bermuda . Without a doubt, China put on the most spectacular show on earth! However, the issue of many of China's gymnastic team not meeting age-requirement standards is of concern. Mention of this issue has been reported by CNN, and since no further commentary has been announced, I presume the issue is still under investigation. Evidence that under-age gymnasts were knowingly being trained for China's Olympic gymnastic team is well documented in Discovery Channel's series - Discovery Atlas - China. In that documentary is the story of Jin Yang, a 12-year-old girl from Beijing. Her intensive training, along with her performance in China's qualifying Olympic trial competition, was filmed. In her own words, Jin stated, 'I dream of the 2008 Olympics.' Jin Jang qualified after the first round, but was eliminated after the second one. Clearly, this is irrefutable evidence that China's Olympic coaches, etc., were attempting to create the most talented Olympic competitors irrespective of meeting age-requirement standards set by Olympic committee regulations. This evidence needs to be presented not only to the world at large, but submitted to the Olympic investigating committee. Sincerely, Sandra St John Sao Paulo, Brazil . Olympic Games; vulgar and shameful display of unrestrained commercialism. Luis in Mexico . I think they were great.

"(CNN) -- A virulent strain of E. coli that has killed 18 people in Europe has not affected produce in the United States, according to food safety and health officials who conceded Friday there's much to learn about the organism. Even as efforts continue to determine what caused the outbreak, cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce imported from Germany and Spain will be tested and cleared before they are sold in the United States, according to David Elder of the Food and Drug Administration, and the results will be shared with the European Union. ""I want to emphasize that this outbreak has not affected the U.S.,"" Elder told reporters in a conference call. ""Produce remains safe, and there is no reason for Americans to alter where they shop, where they buy or what they eat."" Two adult women and an adult man who traveled last month to northern Germany remain hospitalized in the United States with hemolytic uremic syndrome -- a form of kidney failure -- said Chris Braden of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those three cases were reported in Massachusetts, Michigan and Wisconsin. A fourth person developed bloody diarrhea, but was not hospitalized, he added. Two U.S. service members in Germany also developed diarrhea, Braden said. ""We have no expectation that this will spread in our country."" The E. coli infection has spread to 12 countries and is blamed for at least 18 deaths -- all but one reported in Germany. About 1,800 people have been sickened. The European Food Safety Alert Network initially said enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a strain of E. coli, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to various countries. But authorities have said that the source of the contamination has not been pinpointed. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, has advised German consumers not to eat raw tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Germany and Spain account for a small fraction of produce that is sold in the United States in a given year. Officials said tracking the source of the illness could be difficult. If it, in fact, stems from the produce, the tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce could have been eaten together in a salad. ""We don't know yet what is the cause and each of these (vegetables), individually or perhaps in some combination, appear as likely culprits, so I don't think we know enough to hypothesize at what point in the supply chain contamination may have occurred,"" said Don Kraemer of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""We don't know which one that actually had the contamination in it."" The CDC is warning any U.S. citizens who have recently traveled to Germany to seek immediate medical care if they begin to show symptoms of the bacterial infection. Braden said officials were unable to identify the source for an outbreak of this E. coli strain in the republic of Georgia in 2009. The strain is more common among women and adults, he said, and officials are not certain how it may be associated with produce. ""We have a lot to learn about this particular organism,"" Braden said. The officials told reporters the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act signed by President Barack Obama this year provides steps that minimize the risk of E. coli at U.S. farms and production facilities. ""We believe prevention is superior to responding to an outbreak such as this one,"" Kraemer said.","Illnesses are traced to northern Germany .

"(BudgetTravel) -- If the idea of bunking in the barnyard gives you hives, relax. Here's everything you need to know about taking -- and enjoying -- a vacation with Mother Nature. Why would anybody in their right mind want to spend their vacation on a farm? In a word: the food. ""Meals are often the best part of a farmstay experience-the ingredients are the absolute freshest you'll find anywhere,"" says Reid Bramblett, former Budget Travel editor and founder of trip-planning website reidsguides.com. Bramblett, who has stayed at dozens of farms throughout Europe and North America, says, ""There are veggies and dairy produced right on the spot, rib-sticking dinners, and breakfast spreads that will blow you away."" The opportunity to help gather those ingredients, get your hands dirty, and unplug is another big draw. ""For families especially, a farmstay is like stepping back into idyllic, 1950s Beaver Cleaver time,"" says Scottie Jones, who owns Oregon's Leaping Lamb Farm. ""Moms and dads put away their handheld whatevers and pitch in with chores or play by the creek with their kids. Everybody relaxes and rejuvenates."" Last year, with the help of a federal grant, Jones launched the website farmstayus.com. It now lists more than 700 farmstays across the country, which is roughly double the number it started with a year ago. In fact, the trend is booming around the world. Agritourism has been popular in Europe since at least the 1990s, and today there are more than 5,200 farmstays in France, and about 1,600 in Italy. In more recent years, North American farmers have started opening their doors to curious city folk as well. National statistics are hard to come by, but in 2008, more than 2.4 million tourists visited working farms and ranches in California alone. BudgetTravel.com: 7 affordable farmstays .

There are plenty of farms where you'll rough it, such as Switzerland's Schlaf im Stroh (German for ""sleep in the straw""), where guests pay $23 each to sleep in barn stalls alongside cattle pens. Then there are places like Tennessee's Blackberry Farm, a 4,200-acre spread in the Smoky Mountain foothills where guests shell out $1,095 per night for an all-inclusive stay in a private cottage (and, at that price, presumably the best blackberries on the planet). There's plenty in the mid-price range, too: Guests at Vermont's Inn at Mountain View sleep in one of 14 double rooms carved out of a redbrick New England farmstead (doubles from $175). High-end or cut-rate, farmstays are almost always rich in unique experiences. Where else but at New Zealand's Whiti Farm Park do you get to bed down in Native American-style teepees? And no worries, there are solar showers and toilets on-site (from $22 per person). BudgetTravel.com: How to be a packing genius . What if I'm allergic -- to hard labor? Just because you're staying on a working farm doesn't mean you'll be expected to work as a hired hand would. Most farmstays let you participate as much, or little, as you want. Common chores include tending beehives, making cheese, harvesting grapes, herding sheep, milking cows, and collecting eggs from the chicken coop. There are also some tasks you won't be allowed to do. No farmer wants an amateur ruining his prize-winning cider or butter. Safety, too, is a factor. ""I can't let visitors drive the tractor,"" Jones says. ""Sorry, but that's a major liability issue."" Speaking of safety: Will I need to get any shots? Not usually. The only possible cause for worry is an outbreak of something like hoof-and-mouth disease, but that's not very likely. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps close tabs on farms around the world and offers travel advisories if any are needed. The agency hasn't issued any major warnings related to farmstays in several years. BudgetTravel.com: Confessions of a cruise ship musician . How much should I expect to spend overall? Many farmstays are all-inclusive, so you'll know the cost going in. And some are free. The nonprofit organization World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms connects travelers with ranches, farms, and vineyards in 98 countries that allow guests to work for as long as they wish in exchange for free room and board. The U.S. branch has more than 1,700 participating farms and 10,000 members. If you're still worried about surviving the dirt part of a dirt-cheap getaway, pick up Brian Bender's ""Farming Around the Country: An Organic Odyssey,"" which chronicles the author's year WWOOFing at 12 farms across the U.S. WHEN TO GO . When it comes to farmstays, it's almost as important when you go as where. Here are the best places to head throughout the year. Spring is sublime in Western Europe. Farms are overrun with baby chicks and newborn lambs and goats -- not crowds of summer tourists. Summer is ideal for produce farms across the U.S. Midwest. This is your best shot at the freshest tomatoes, corn, and everything else under the sun. Fall harvest season is prime for wineries in California and New York. Oenophiles can help pick and stomp grapes in between tastings. Winter is the best time to head Down Under. It's summer in Australia and New Zealand, and both are loaded with farms welcoming visitors.

"Myth No. 1: A suntan's fine, as long as you don't burn. Reality: While even one sunburn may double the chance of eventually developing melanoma (the most serious type of skin cancer), your kids are still at risk even if they never burn. ""The more sun you get, the more likely you are to develop certain skin cancers,"" says Martin Weinstock, M.D., chairman of the American Cancer Society's Skin Cancer Advisory Group, no matter what your skin tone. ""Any tan indicates damage to your skin."" Myth No. 2: A beach umbrella blocks the sun. Reality: It's not foolproof. Sand reflects 17 percent of UV radiation, so you're still exposed, says Dr. Weinstock. Nevertheless, it's smart to stay in the shade when the sun's rays are high; just make sure you're also slathered with sunscreen. Myth No. 3: Sun can't penetrate through windows. Reality: Glass filters out only one kind of radiation -- UVB rays. But UVA rays, which penetrate deeper, can still get through. That's why many adults have more freckles on their left side than their right -- it's from UV exposure on that side through the car window when driving. To protect yourself, apply sunscreen to any exposed areas (like your hands, forearms, and face) before getting into your car, especially in the spring and summer months, says Anthony Mancini, M.D., head of pediatric dermatology at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. If you're buying a new car, consider one with tinted windows, which keep out almost four times more UVA light than regular ones. You don't need to worry about putting on sunscreen when indoors unless you or your child spends most of your time near a window (for example, if your child's desk is right next to one). Parenting.com: TLC for sunburned skin . Myth No. 4: Too much sunscreen causes vitamin D deficiency. Reality: You may have read that extra exposure to sunshine is needed to help your body make vitamin D. But according to the ACS, the American Academy of Dermatology, and the Skin Cancer Foundation, both kids and adults get plenty of this nutrient through multivitamins, vitamin D--rich foods (like milk and fortified orange juice), and everyday sun exposure. Also, even if you're wearing sunscreen, small amounts of UV rays still penetrate your skin, and that's more than enough to help your body produce vitamin D. Parenting.com: Sun protection 101 . Myth No. 5: If it's cool or cloudy outside, you don't need sunscreen. Reality: According to the Skind Cancer Foundation, up to 80 percent of the sun's UV rays can pass through clouds. This is the reason people often end up with serious sunburns on overcast days if they've spent time outside with no sun protection. Even in the winter months, you need to beware: Snow can reflect up to 80 percent of UV rays, increasing exposure. This is especially true if your family's on a ski vacation -- the higher your altitude, the greater your UV exposure. Parenting.com: Your print-and-save guide to warm-weather safety . Myth No. 6: 80 percent of sun damage occurs before age 18. Reality: Contrary to previous estimates, recent studies show that we get less than 25 percent of our total lifetime sun exposure before age 18. That means you get the majority of it later on. So while you absolutely should be vigilant about protecting your kids, make sure you take care of yourself, too. While 83 percent of parents arm their kids with sunscreen and protective clothing whenever they're outdoors, only two-thirds practice what they preach, according to a 2005 AAD survey. ""Remember, kids don't always pay attention to what you say -- it's more about what you do,"" says Dr. Weinstock. ""If you're making them wear sunscreen but baking yourself, you're sending them a mixed message they may carry into adulthood.""

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome! Thank you for rounding out your week with CNN Student News. I'm Carl Azuz, here to pilot you through 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines. First Up: Libya Civil War . AZUZ: First up, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says there are no signs of a cease-fire in Libya. That announcement came yesterday, one week after the U.N. Security Council voted to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya. That's part of the military operation that's been firing missiles and running airstrikes. It's been led by the U.S. Yesterday, there was talk of a deal that would make NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the leader of the operation. But that wasn't set in stone, and there was some doubt about it. One interesting point about the conflict in Libya is how it could affect gas prices in the U.S. Libya produces about 2 percent of the world's crude oil; it's not very much. But some stock traders are afraid that the trouble there could happen in other countries that produce more oil. That fear is one reason why oil prices are rising in the stock market. And that means gas prices are more likely to increase too, since crude oil accounts for about 65 percent of what we spend on gas. Now, getting back to the military operation. Diana Magnay is on the ship that some of those airstrikes are launching from. She gives an idea of what life is like there. (BEGIN VIDEO) DIANA MAGNAY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Each night they fly, Harrier jets off the USS Kearsarge, bound for Libya. U.S. strike missions to take out Gadhafi's air defense and attack capabilities as rebels clash with Gadhafi's forces. CAPTAIN MIKE WYRSCH, HARRIER FIGHTER PILOT: It was pretty neat the next day after the first attacks, to see that the rebel forces, their morale once they saw that they had people coming to help them out. But it's breaking their supply chains as well as slowing down their advance onto Benghazi by taking out their tanks and artillery. MAGNAY: Day times are about maintenance and repair, checking over these V-22 Ospreys, which had their first outing in Operation Odyssey Dawn early Tuesday morning. A daring rescue mission with a team of 30 Marines to find a U.S. fighter pilot who ejected over eastern Libya after his F-15 fighter jet suffered what the military called mechanical failure. The pilot's back in the medical facilities here on board. His other crew member, the weapons officer, also had to eject, but landed in a completely different location. So, he was rescued first by rebel forces and is now back on a U.S. Air Force base in northern Italy. There are around 700 Marines on board, but this isn't a war which involves coalition ground forces. The Kearsarge's six Harrier jets taking the active role in enforcing the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone . REAR ADMIRAL MARGARET KLEIN, COMMANDER, EXPEDITIONARY STRIKE GROUP FIVE: If there are vehicles on the ground that can shoot down our aircraft which are enforcing the no-fly zone, we consider that a legal mandate to be able attack that equipment. MAGNAY: Precision targeting, 500-pound laser-guided bombs, and the sorties continue. No sign here that this part of the offensive is over yet. Diana Magnay, CNN, on the Kearsarge in the Mediterranean. (END VIDEO) Violence in Syria . AZUZ: Syria is the latest country to deal with the political unrest that we've seen around the Middle East and North Africa recently. Syria is located between Iraq and Turkey. And people there have been protesting over economic and human rights issues. Those demonstrations have gotten violent in the past few days, with protesters and security forces fighting on the streets of at least one city. Human rights workers say at least 34 people have been killed in the violence this week. And that includes a soldier who was reportedly shot because he refused to fire on the protesters. Thousands of people came out on Thursday for the funerals of that soldier and some of the other people who've been killed. Disaster in Japan . AZUZ: Toyota, the car company, might shut down some of its U.S. manufacturing temporarily because it doesn't have enough parts. There's been a delay in getting those parts from Japan because of Japan's recent earthquake and tsunami. Inside Japan, workers are still trying to get things stabilized at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. These pictures were taken inside the plant. Two of the workers were taken to the hospital yesterday after they accidentally stepped in contaminated water. Officials say the men could be all right if they're quickly decontaminated. A U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is going through a similar process right now. Martin Savidge, you're on deck. MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right now, every piece of hardware, every aircraft and every piece of machinery used to move that aircraft is on the front of the USS Ronald Reagan. And you can see a lot of the crew hands. You're wondering maybe why are they all sitting around? Well, we'll show you. Look what's going on back over here: water. Lots and lots of water just being sprayed all over the deck right now, in what is probably the biggest cleanup effort you're ever likely to see at sea. Impact Your World .

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Ms. Mielke's world cultures classes at Gorzycki Middle School in Austin, Texas! What type of food is a peanut? You know what to do! Is it a: A) Grain, B) Legume, C) Fruit or D) Tuber? You've got three seconds -- GO! Peanuts are legumes. And here's another interesting fact: peanuts are not technically nuts! That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Allergy Outrage? AZUZ: Peanut allergies are pretty common. But in some cases, the allergic reactions can be life-threatening. And that's why experts say it's important to have a plan in place in order to avoid a potential problem. At one Florida school, the plan in place affects everyone, not just the student with the allergy. And as Jason Carroll explains, the plan is prompting protests. (BEGIN VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're trying to take away all our rights. JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Protesters picketing outside a school in Edgewater, Florida. Their signs showing how a medical problem for one of the school's students has turned into a controversy that has some parents calling for that student's removal. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are not attacking the child or the parents. CARROLL: At issue, rules the school put in place to protect the six-year-old girl who has a life-threatening peanut allergy. Lunches must be left outside the room. Students must wash their hands before entering the room and after lunch. At one point, students were also required to rinse out their mouths. Parents debating whether the rules infringe on the rights of students and take time away from education. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I guess it's not fair for one kid to have a set of standards that the rest of the kids have to abide by. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's protecting the safety of the child. Everybody has the right to an education, so I don't see what the problem is. CARROLL: A district administrator says the rules must be enforced because the student's allergy is considered a disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act. More districts could soon face a similar situation. The Centers for Disease Control says food allergies are on the rise. From 1997 to 2007, reports of food allergies increased almost 20 percent among children under 18 years old. DR. SCOTT SICHERER, PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS, MT. SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: It's always necessary to have precautions for a young child who has a food allergy. There might be specific procedures that need to be in place to just really ensure that that child doesn't end up eating the food that they're allergic to. (END VIDEO) Sound off on our blog!

Was it: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Sandra Day O'Connor or Elena Kagan?

He was injured while serving in Iraq and lost his eyesight. Now, every step is a reminder that he is still alive. After the attack, Captain Castro says it took three people to help him stand up. Last weekend, he finished a full marathon. And the only help he needed was his running partner, who helped him navigate the course with a string tied around their wrists. Goodbye .

"(CNN) -- As a Alabama native, I packed my bags and moved to New York City in pursuit of a modeling career at 18 years old. Even though I will always be a small-town girl at heart, I always dreamed of all the adventures of living in a big city. After signing with the Wilhelmina Models agency, it wasn't long before I landed my first Essence cover. Soon after that I was on a plane to Paris to do the couture shows. Macy's commercials, OiI of Olay ads and Maybelline campaigns were soon to follow. I knew I had arrived when Iman asked me to shoot a spread for Vanity Fair alongside supermodels Naomi Campbell, Tyra Banks and Beverly Johnson. This was the first time that I was photographed by famous photographer Annie Leibovitz. My career has taken me all over the world from Australia to Anguilla as a top model, and the education that I received is priceless. I live by the words ""follow your dreams,"" and ""be fearless."" This attitude has landed me right where I am today. I am 43, and I reside in Atlanta with my husband Peter Thomas and my 11-year-old daughter Noelle Robinson. I am a cast member on Bravo's hit reality TV show ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta."" Outside of the instant celebrity that came with the show, the platform has been amazing. I have so many great opportunities coming my way, and I want to use my celebrity to change the world. I recently opened The Bailey Agency School of Fashion in Atlanta. The school offers classes on modeling, photography, makeup, hair styling, fashion styling and fashion designing. Sharing all that I have learned from being in the fashion industry for the past 25 years is one of the ways that I want to inspire young people to follow their dreams and give back to the community. There is a lack of education available at affordable prices for young, aspiring, talented people who are interested in a career in fashion. Before I set on my journey to New York to become a fashion model, I was very shy and lacked self-confidence. Then, I never would have believed that I would be the independent, successful, confident woman that I am today. I believe that this industry encourages high self-esteem and confidence which is invaluable in any career choice.","Cynthia Bailey is a cast member of ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta""

"(CNN) -- A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee that has been weighing evidence on whether dye additives in food affect behavior in children will make its recommendation Thursday. The panel will first listen to testimony from the public and the industry. It spent Wednesday listening to testimony from doctors and scientists who contend that studies, although small in many cases, do show that some kids begin to show signs of hyperactivity once they are exposed to certain dye mixtures. The question is whether the FDA committee will urge the agency to strengthen its regulation of the ingredients? Although the committee only makes recommendations to the FDA, the agency usually follows those recommendations. According to the experts who testified, European companies already are dropping dyes including Blue #1, Yellow #5, Green #3 and others and substituting natural dyes for them. But the United States still allows artificial dyes, mostly for aesthetic reasons, not for taste. ""Why are these dyes in these foods anyway?"" asked Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science and the Public Interest, a watchdog group on nutrition and food safety. ""I would push for having them taken out completely. But if that can't be done, why not warn the public and parents that these dyes could have some effects?"" The idea that dyes in food causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, was first noted in ""Why Your Child is Hyperactive,"" a book written by Dr. Benjamin Feingold in 1975. The eating style described in the book became known as the Feingold Diet. He found if one eliminated artificial food dyes and additives in American diets, cases of hyperactivity in children would decline. But reviews of the data found that the correlation between dyes and hyperactivity were inconsistent. Although numerous data have been collected on food dyes and hyperactivity in kids over the past decade, critics say the design of the studies has been weak. They note many of the studies were performed on small groups -- many involved no more than 25 children. They also noted that much of the observation data (how the child acted) was reported by parents and not by clinicians. And they pointed out that most of the dyes tested were combined into a dye mixture and not tested individually. The most recent studies to bring food dyes and ADHD back to the public eye was a 2007 project conducted by researchers at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom. It showed that artificial food dyes along with sodium benzoate (a white crystalline salt used as a food preservative) increased ADHD symptoms in both hyperactive and non-hyperactive children. That study was followed up by another paper in 2010 by the same researchers who looked at the connection between food dyes, ADHD and histamine, a chemical that's produced in the brain when the body is having an allergic reaction. ""We found mixtures of certain artificial colors together with sodium benzoate preservative in the diet increased the average level of hyperactivity in 3 and 8/9 year old children in the general population,"" Dr. Jim Stevenson, a professor at the School of Psychology at the University of Southampton, and lead author of the study, testified Wednesday. ""We found mixtures of certain artificial colors together with sodium benzoate preservative in the diet increased the average level of hyperactivity in 3 and 8/9 year old children in the general population."" Yet, it was noted that when the Southampton data were unveiled to the European Food Standards Authority, a European version of the FDA, the EFSA found the evidence weak. But some groups in the United States say the findings are another reason that dyes should go. A recent report issued by CSPI looked at data from a number of studies related to artificial food dyes. Jacobsen argued to the board Wednesday that artificial food dyes are not safe for humans and can be connected to numerous health problems, including ADHD allergies, even cancer . ""The average child consumes approximately 121 milligrams of artificial dyes a day,"" Jacobsen asserted. ""That's a lot. And dye in food is used twice as much as it was in the 1970s. These are noted scientific effects. There are other factors that could affect child behavior, but if we can take out food dyes as a factor, why not?""","The FDA usually follows through with panel's recommendation .

"(CNN) -- Security forces surrounding the Rifaie Mosque in the Damascus suburb of Kafr Sousa fired tear gas early Saturday on thousands of worshipers as they ended their prayers and tried to leave the building, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) reported. Many of the worshipers returned inside the mosque, where they chanted slogans calling for the fall of the regime, said the LCC, which organizes and documents anti-government protests. Later, the organization reported that security forces were making random arrests outside the mosque. In the restive city of Daraa, where the arrests in March of 15 teenagers for scrawling anti-government graffiti on walls ignited the country's expressions of discontent, security forces fired randomly in an attempt to disperse two groups of demonstrators who were chanting, ""God is great!"" Tanks were surrounding more than 2,000 protesters and two armored vehicles were outside Daraa's Omari Mosque, preventing worshipers from leaving the mosque to protest. In all, eight people were killed Friday in Syria, the LCC said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported that 11 army and security forces were killed by ""terrorist groups"" in Homs and Deir Ezzor. Another 16 soldiers were wounded, SANA said. CNN was not able to independently confirm the reports. On Friday, at least one person was wounded when security forces opened fire on a group of demonstrators in the Bab Sbaa neighborhood of Homs, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group. The demonstrators, who were calling for President Bashar al-Assad's ouster, had gathered for a funeral of a man killed Thursday by sniper fire, the group said. In a separate incident that occurred outside Damascus, security forces fired on a car, wounding at least one man, the group said. And in Deir Ezzor, at least one demonstrator was wounded when Syrian security forces opened fire there, the group said. Demonstrators had dubbed Friday a day of ""patience and determination."" YouTube videos showed demonstrations in a number of cities. ""The people demand the execution of the president!"" was one chant from demonstrators in Homs. CNN is not able to confirm the authenticity of the videos. The violence occurred on one of the most holy days of Ramadan and on the same day that a U.N. team, having completed a five-day humanitarian mission to Syria, concluded that there is ""an urgent need to protect civilians from the excessive use of force."" The August 20-25 mission, which was intended to assess the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people, also concluded that there is no country-wide humanitarian crisis, the world body said in a statement. It added that ""the constant presence of government officials"" limited the visitors' ability to assess the situation. ""However, the people it was able to talk to in areas of previous or ongoing unrest said they felt extremely intimidated and under constant threat."" Though the Syrian government allowed participants to visit any location they requested, ""it is doubtful that Syria has fully complied with its assurances of providing free and unimpeded access,"" the statement concluded. Though government officials had vowed open access to the U.N. mission, they have restricted access to the country by international journalists. Also Friday, Russia proposed a draft resolution that neither condemns Syria nor calls for the imposition of sanctions, as pressed for by the West. Instead, the Russian draft calls upon Damascus to speed the pace of reform ""in order to effectively address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of Syria's people."" In addition, it urges the Syrian opposition ""to engage in political dialogue with the Syrian authorities with a view to holding a substantial and in-depth discussion on the ways of reforming Syrian society."" That was not enough for Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. ""The regime's violence has continued unabated, the international condemnation has grown louder, and the Security Council's response should reflect those realities,"" he said, noting that a draft resolution proposed this week by the United States and its European allies on the Security Council contains both elements. No timetable has been set for a vote on either resolution. Also Friday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and the new Syrian ambassador to Russia, Riyad Haddad, discussed the situation in Syria, according to the state-run Itar-Tass news agency. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Tuesday that ""we don't think"" the time was right for sanctions against Syria, and Brazil, China, India and South Africa also expressed reservations. Security Council resolutions need at least nine votes to pass on the 15-member council with no vetoes. Al-Assad's regime is accused of attacking peaceful demonstrators in an effort to crush a pro-democracy movement that emerged in the aftermath of similar protests throughout North Africa and the Middle East in the ""Arab spring."" This week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said that more than 2,200 people have been killed in Syria since mid-March, with more than 350 people reportedly killed since the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on August 1. On Thursday, the U.S. State Department accused the Syrian government of carrying out a ""targeted, brutal attack"" on a popular Syrian political cartoonist, Ali Farzat. Shortly after a cartoon by Farzat depicting al-Assad hitching a ride with outgoing Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi began circulating in Syria, Farzat was reportedly kidnapped by masked men, beaten and thrown unconscious from a van onto a road in Damascus. ""The regime's thugs focused their attention on his hands, beating them furiously and breaking one of them -- a clear message that he should stop drawing,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement. Passers-by reportedly found the beaten 60-year-old cartoonist and took him to a hospital. A photograph circulating Thursday on the Internet showed Farzat with a bandage over his right eye, his face badly bruised and heavy bandages wrapped around both hands.","NEW: Eight people are killed, an activist group says .

"(CNN) -- Two weeks after Haiti's devastating earthquake, Daniel Rouzier stood in front of heaps of bodies, dumped unceremoniously in the valleys of Titanyen. He clutched a mahogany rosary and covered his face with a sterile mask -- the stench of decomposing human flesh carried with the breeze. Rouzier, a wealthy businessman and executive with a notable charity had seen on CNN how earthquake victims had been trucked out of Port-au-Prince and disposed in Titanyen without burial. Upset, he put his own resources to work and hired bulldozers to dig mass graves for 2,500 bodies. He said then that it was sacrilege so many people had not been given proper internment. He didn't want to blame anyone for the aftermath of Haiti's tragedy; he was simply grateful to be able to help. Now, Rouzier stands poised to be able to do a lot more for his country. Haiti's new President Michel Martelly tapped the successful entrepreneur to become the troubled nation's next prime minister.  Unknown in Haitian politics, Rouzier at first was not even sure he wanted to enter a new realm. ""It was not in my cards at all,"" he said in a brief phone conversation in the midst of his confirmation hearings Thursday. ""But it is quite an opportunity to serve the people."" The ratification process before a parliamentary committee began Wednesday and is expected to go on for a few days. Rouzier said he hopes to be approved by next Tuesday. Martelly and Rouzier go way back. They went to the same high school and Rouzier's brother Fabrice Rouzier founded the Haitian band Mizik Mizik. Until recently, Martelly, of course, was better known as Sweet Mickey, a wildly popular bad boy of music. Martelly said he tapped Rouzier because the two men share a vision for a prosperous Haiti. ""Daniel Rouzier is a man of integrity,"" Martelly said. ""He has a track record of getting things done, he turns dreams into reality. Daniel is a man who will prioritize the interests of the country and will respect the rule of law."" A deeply devout Catholic, Rouzier said that if he is confirmed, he will serve in the prime ministerial post as a servant of God. He acknowledged that the journey ahead will be challenging. Haiti remains the poorest and least developed country in the Western hemisphere and is struggling to recover from the 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and displaced 1.6 million others. Hundreds of thousands of those people are still eeking out existances in makeshift camps. The Inter-American Development Bank estimated that the cost of rebuilding homes, roads, schools and other infrastructure could be as much as $14 billion.The international community pledged $10 billion in March, 2010 but evidence of that money is scant. A year after the earthquake, there are still mounds of rubble stacked high in parts of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's problems were compounded by a cholera epidemic that erupted last  October and has resurged recently as the rainy season begins. Part of the reason Martelly won at the polls is because Haitians had increasingly grown discontent with the slow pace of recovery and reconstruction. Haitians said they wanted a fresh start. Rouzier adds to Martelly's credibility in that aspect, said Jocelyn McCalla, a Haitian-born political strategist and human rights expert. Rouzier also brings expertise both in the business world and in charitable work. He served as general manager of his family's Port-au-Prince car dealership, Sun Auto, and also spearheaded E-Power, a private plant intended to increase Haitians' access to electricity. That project was inaugurated on the first anniversary of the earthquake this past January. Rouzier also helped oversee Food for the Poor, a Florida-based Christian charity that is active in Haiti. Despite no political experience, Rouzier is seen as someone who can be fair, McCalla said. ""He has a good reputation,"" McCalla said. ""He strikes me as somebody who is well-intentioned."" But as with all others who have entered politics in Haiti, Rouzier will have to rise above entrenched corruption, McCalla said. If he becomes prime minister, Rouzier will inherit a government that was barely functioning, McCalla said. ""One of his challenges is to rebuild the government from the ground up,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A record number of Americans served time in corrections systems across the country in 2007, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Center on the States. Some of the nation's most high-profile federal inmates are housed at the Supermax prison in Colorado. The U.S. correctional population -- those in jail, prison, on probation or on parole -- totaled 7.3 million, or 1 in every 31 adults. The Pew Center on the States compiled the information from Justice Department and Census Bureau statistics. America's prison population has skyrocketed over the past quarter century. In 1982, 1 in 77 adults were in the correctional system in one form or another, totaling 2.2 million people. The United States has 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of the world's prison inmates, the center said. The numbers vary widely by race and gender. ""Black adults are four times as likely as whites and nearly 2.5 times as likely as Hispanics to be under correctional control. One in 11 black adults -- 9.2 percent -- was under correctional supervision at year-end 2007,"" the report said. ""And although the number of female offenders continues to grow, men of all races are under correctional control at a rate five times that of women."" There are also wide differences depending on the state. Georgia tops the nation, with 1 in 13 adults in the state's corrections system, while in New Hampshire the figure is 1 in 88. Southern states tended to have higher rates, with Plains and rural Northeastern states coming in lower. ""State policy choices are responsible for creating this mess and state policy choices can get us out,"" said Adam Gelb, director of the Public Safety Performance Project for the Pew Center on the States. ""There are two things, and two things only that determine the size and cost of the prison system."" Dealing out longer sentences and putting more people behind bars have been the hallmarks of Southern states, he said. America's record prison population has had a huge budgetary effect, according to the report, with increased corrections spending outstripping everything at the state level except for Medicaid. Gelb said prison costs 22 times more than community-based corrections. ""If you talk to judges and prosecutors practically anywhere in this country, they will tell you if they had stronger community corrections, they wouldn't have to send so many people [to prison] for so many low-level offenses,"" he said. For California, it has meant overcrowded prisons. In February, federal judges tentatively ruled that California must reduce the number of inmates in its prison system by up to 40 percent to stop a constitutional violation of prisoners' rights. Implementing the court's ruling would result in up to 58,000 prisoners being released, said Matthew Cate, California's corrections and rehabilitation secretary, describing it as a threat to public safety. The Pew Center on the States, through its Public Safety Performance Project, says it promotes ""fiscally sound, data-driven policies and practices in sentencing and corrections that protect public safety, hold offenders accountable, and control corrections costs.""","NEW: Director: Weak community corrections programs force judges to choose jail .

"(CNN) -- Ollanta Humala, a left-leaning Peruvian politician who promises reforms in education and services to the poor, was sworn in as the nation's president Thursday. In his first address as president, Humala stressed equality, saying he wants Peru to be ""a place where everyone enjoys the same rights to abundance and happiness."" ""Economic growth and social inclusion must march together,"" he said of his governing philosophy. He succeeds Alan Garcia, who oversaw a period of robust economic growth as president, but who nonetheless was unpopular and criticized for promoting business at the expense of indigenous groups and the environment. Humala, an ex-army officer who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2006 as a leftist ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, reinvented himself as a more moderate leader. He calmed markets and worries that his moderation was a facade to win the election by naming a Cabinet made up of political moderates. The new president has promised to spread the benefits of Peru's economic boom to the poor. He has cited needs to improve the nation's infrastructure, water, sanitation and education, particularly in rural areas. A number of presidents from other Latin American countries, including Ecuador, Chile and Brazil, were on hand to witness the swearing-in ceremony. There was a small oddity during the swearing in of Humala and his two vice presidents, when they all swore allegiance to Peru's 1979 Constitution. That document, however, was replaced in 1993 by a new one drafted during the presidency of strongman Alberto Fujimori. Humala defeated Fujimori's daughter, Keiko, to win the presidency. The slap at the current Constitution resulted in boos and shouts from members of Fujimori's party. Several times in his speech, Humala talked about the importance of unity. ""Reality requires a new social contract that makes it possible for all Peruvians to live together,"" he said. He added that he wants ""to be seen as a defender of human rights and of freedom of the press and expression."" Other leftist leaders in Latin America, such as Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Venezuela's Chavez, have been criticized by press freedom organizations for clamping down on the media. Humala promised change, but warned that it would not be as swift as his critics fear, or as some of his supporters desire. To be lasting, he said, ""any changes must be gradual and rational."" In another minor controversy, the outgoing president, Garcia, did not attend the swearing-in ceremony to pass the presidential sash to his successor. Garcia, who was also president in a disastrous term from 1985 to 1990, was booed and heckled by Congress when he bid farewell. According to local media, he decided not to attend this time to avoid another round of heckling.","NEW:  Peru's new president stresses equality .

"(CNN) -- Since ""The Tree of Life,"" reclusive filmmaker Terrence Malick's fifth film in four decades, premiered at Cannes earlier this week, the 2½-hour long impressionistic tone poem has elicited mixed reactions ranging from scattered boos to walkouts to long standing ovations. When the film took the coveted Palme d'Or at the end of the festival, the buzz was deafening. So what's the big deal? Let's get the things we already know about the ambitious film out of the way first: It stars Brad Pitt as a stern but ultimately disappointed father of three boys in 1950s Texas, Jessica Chastain as his luminescent wife and Sean Penn as one of their grown-up sons many years later; there is little in the way of linear narrative or dialogue outside of breathy voiceovers contemplating the existence and disposition of God; there are lengthy sequences of volcanoes erupting, cells dividing and many other awe-inspiring natural phenomena that recall both ""Nova"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey""; and, yes, there are CGI dinosaurs. A tough sell to be sure, especially for Americans who would rather stick with the familiar territory of ""The Hangover Part II"" or ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" than a meditation on how the lives of this family coincide with the birth of the entire universe (enter the dinosaurs), but stay with me. What the film lacks in traditional box office appeal, it more than makes up for in stunning visual effects and a unique, poetic perspective on family, faith, loss of innocence and reconciliation that will stay with you long after you may finish scratching your head at the film's conclusion. The complaints about ""The Tree of Life"" center around the fact that while some plot and conflict is established, nothing ever really happens. It's more or less true, but it misses the point. In as spiritually minded a movie as ""The Tree of Life,"" it only makes sense that the journey would be the destination. Or, as the film's stars put it at a press conference in Cannes: ""It's like (Malick) is waiting with a butterfly net to catch what was going by that day,"" Pitt said. ""It's all about capturing an accident,"" Chastain added. ""He would be shooting and Brad would be wonderful and then there'd be a woodpecker nearby and he'd turn to that. You can't plan any moment."" For a viewer, this so-called aimlessness may sound frustrating, but Malick is nothing if not meticulous. He juxtaposes explosive imagery and a soaring operatic score with smaller, tender moments like natural light shining through blades of grass and a baby's first steps to create the complete mood and mosaic of ""The Tree of Life."" Ultimately, that is this film's strength. In a move that rankled many at Cannes, Malick declined to do any press and was only on hand unexpectedly and briefly at the Palais to premiere the film. Pitt described the absence as the auteur's preference to focus on ""building a house, not selling the real estate."" Still, with a movie that raises more questions than it answers, the public wanted Malick's help interpreting the film. We say just see it. And then maybe see it again. It's a work of art to experience and behold, but don't try too hard to dissect it, because the whole doesn't always live up to the sum of its extraordinary parts. Have you seen ""The Tree of Life""? Tell us what you thought in the comments. ""The Tree of Life"" is open in limited release in New York and Los Angeles, with wide release on July 8.","The film stars Brad Pitt as a stern, disappointed father of three boys in 1950s Texas .

"(EW.com)  -- Though he picked up plenty of high-profile projects like ""Playboy,"" ""The Firm"" and ""Prime Suspect,"" NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt knew he'd have to answer for the one project he didn't greenlight: What the heck was wrong with Wonder Woman and why didn't it make the schedule? Not surprisingly, Greenblatt was diplomatic about the reboot from Warner Bros. TV and David E. Kelley (after all, the uber-producer is also the man behind Harry's Law, which earned a second season pickup). ""I hate to disappoint anybody. I know there are legions of fans of the original show,"" Greenblatt told EW. ""I don't know if it's cursed or what. I just have this one experience. They made a really fine pilot and Adrianne Palicki did a fantastic job. You look at what you have, what you need, and it just didn't seem to fit in with what we were doing. ""We did what was best for the schedule,"" Greenblatt continued. ""It does give one pause. You're almost damned if you and damned if you don't. It's tricky."" Did Warner Bros. TV make a mistake by releasing early pictures of Palicki in the costume? Greenblatt isn't so sure. ""I was surprised there was such an uproar. But that didn't have anything to do with whether the show got picked up. I love that it got so much attention. All that engagment from people whether it was positive or negative was good. And she did ultimately have these little hot pants..."" Alas, we'll never get to see them. Or will we? Greenblatt says Warner Bros. TV may shop the pilot elsewhere.

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors say they have broken up a major effort to ship parts for fighter jets and helicopter gunships to Iran in violation of U.S. arms export laws. In a raft of indictments announced Thursday, the Justice Department accuses executives from companies in Florida, Illinois, France and the United Arab Emirates with illegally supplying components for U.S.-built aircraft to Iran. An Iranian company and its top officers also have been charged in the case. ""Through coordinated law enforcement efforts, we have cut off more than a branch of this illegal supply tree; we have cut off the tree at its trunk,"" Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney in Macon, Georgia, said in a statement announcing the charges. The Florida-based company, The Parts Guys, kept a warehouse in Macon, according to the indictments. The company and its president, Michael Todd, have already pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Arms Export Control Act. The other U.S. company, The head of the other U.S. company named in the charges, Hamid ""Hank"" Seifi, was sentenced to nearly five years in prison on Wednesday, prosecutors said. Both American firms are accused of supplying parts for 1970s-vintage warplanes and helicopters to Iran through the French company Aerotechnic and Emirates-based Aletra General Trading. Both of those companies were named in the indictments along with top executives from each, none of whom were in custody Thursday. The parts were meant for F-4 Phantom II and F-5 Tiger jets, Huey helicopters and Cobra helicopter gunships. Iran purchased those aircraft before the 1979 revolution that toppled Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a U.S. ally. The charges disclosed Thursday include conspiracy to violate U.S. arms export laws and sanctions on Iran, as well as fraud, money laundering and making false statements to investigators.","Prosecutors release charges against U.S., French, Arab and Iranian companies .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama extended a helping hand to Japan on Friday as hundreds of people were dead and additional hundreds were missing after a devastating 8.9-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami. ""I offer our Japanese friends whatever assistance is needed,"" he said during a news conference. ""Today's events remind us how fragile life can be."" Obama said Friday that the main U.S. assistance to Japan for now would probably be ""lift capacity"" in the form of heavy equipment to help clean up damaged infrastructure. The U.S. government is taking inventory of how many military personnel are in Japan to provide help, he said, adding that American citizens in Japan will also receive assistance. Obama called the earthquake and tsunami ""a potentially catastrophic disaster,"" saying the images of destruction were ""simply heartbreaking."" At a session of the President's Export Council on Friday morning at the Old Executive Office Building, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about the U.S. delivering coolant to Japan for its nuclear reactors, CNN has confirmed. ""You know Japan is very reliant on nuclear power, and they have very high engineering standards. But one of their plants came under a lot of stress with the earthquake and didn't have enough coolant. So Air Force planes were able to deliver that. So we're really deeply involved in trying to do as much as we can on behalf of the Japanese and on behalf of U.S. citizens,"" she said. Neither the Air Force nor the Pentagon could confirm that U.S. Air Force planes delivered coolant to the Japanese power plant. Obama said he has been in touch with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan about the potential vulnerability of any nuclear power plants in Japan. ""So far, they have not seen any evidence of a radiation leak, but obviously you have to take all potential precautions,"" Obama said. The president said he has spoken with his energy secretary, Steven Chu, ""to make sure that if in fact there have any breaches in the safety of the nuclear plant, they are dealt with."" Five U.S. Navy ships were heading to Japan, and two others were already docked in the country, according to the Pentagon. The State Department on Friday said there were no immediate reports of casualties among the tens of thousands of U.S. citizens -- tourists, military personnel and others -- in Japan. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington is in the maintenance yard in Japan and unable to get underway. Another nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan in the western Pacific, is the only carrier heading to Japan. ""We currently have an aircraft carrier in Japan, and another is on the way."" Obama said Friday. ""And we also have a ship en route to the Mariana Islands to assist as needed."" Among the 38,000 U.S. military personnel, 43,000 dependents and 5,000 Department of Defense civilians assigned to Japan, there are no reports of loss of life and no reports of major damage to U.S. warships, aircraft or facilities in Japan, said Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan. Obama was awakened at 4 a.m. ET with news of the disaster and received a briefing from his top security and emergency response advisers at 9:30 a.m., the White House said. In a statement, Obama sent his condolences to the people of Japan and declared that the United States stands ready to offer aid, citing the strong ties between the two nations. Obama also spoke by telephone with Kan, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said. Clinton pledged ""immediate disaster relief assistance"" and said ""we are working closely with the government of Japan to provide additional help,"" according to a State Department statement. Pentagon spokesman Lapan said Japan's foreign minister had formally asked the United States for help, launching the process of figuring out what is needed and what the U.S. military can provide. The State Department issued an alert against nonessential travel to Japan because of the earthquake and tsunami. The alert said that Tokyo airports were closed and others also may be closed or restricted, and that public transportation in Tokyo and other areas has been interrupted. The alert also said strong aftershocks were likely ""for weeks"" and included instructions for what to do if caught in another earthquake or aftershock. It urged U.S. citizens in Japan to contact family and friends to let them know of their well-being. Two U.S. airlines -- Delta and American -- announced the cancellation of flights to Tokyo. It was unclear if flights to other Japanese airports also would be affected. In addition, Delta, United and Continental airlines announced they were waiving change fees for people whose travel plans involving Japan were affected by the disaster. At the State Department, Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Janice Jacobs said a 24-hour consular task force has been set up to help Americans affected by the earthquake. Americans in Japan who need help, or people seeking information about a loved one in Japan, can send an e-mail to japanemergencyusc@state.gov, Jacobs said. Americans outside Japan but in tsunami-affected areas who need help, or people seeking information about an American in affected areas outside Japan, can e-mail pacifictsunamiusc@state.gov, she said. A telephone information line also has been set up at 1-888-407-4747, said Jacobs, who encouraged people to use the e-mail options if possible. When seeking information about Americans in Japan or other affected areas, Jacobs said, provide the full name, birth date and location of the person, as well as any pre-existing medical conditions, and if they are elderly or a child. Obama, who was first informed of the earthquake before dawn by Chief of Staff Bill Daley, said he has instructed the Federal Emergency Management Agency ""to be ready to assist Hawaii and the rest of the U.S. states and territories that could be affected"" by tsunamis. ""The United States stands ready to help the Japanese people in this time of great trial,"" Obama said. Vice President Joe Biden, traveling in Moldova, called the disaster a ""mega-earthquake"" and said ""the thoughts and prayers of the American people ... are with our friends in Japan."" ""We the United States stand ready to do anything we can to help our Japanese friends as they deal with the aftermath of this tragedy,"" Biden said, according to a pool report of his remarks.

"(CNN) -- Santos secured the Brazilian club's first Copa Libertadores title since 1963 on Wednesday, defeating Uruguay's Penarol 2-1 in the second leg of an ill-tempered final. After a scoreless first leg in Montevideo last week, goals from young Brazil striker Neymar and midfielder Danilo ensured Santos won South America's premier club competition for the first time since legendary football icon Pele played for the team half a century ago. A late own-goal from defender Durval offered Uruguayan side Penarol hope of snatching a sixth Libertadores title, but Santos prevailed at the Estadio do Pacaembu in Sao Paulo. Neymar, who has been linked with a move to a host of European clubs including Real Madrid and Chelsea, broke the deadlock with a well-struck shot early in the second half. Danilo, a Brazil under-20 international, scored what proved to be the winning goal after 68 minutes with a driven shot beyond Penarol goalkeeper Sebastian Sosa. Santos' post-match celebrations were soured by a mass brawl which broke out between both sets of players, immediately after referee Sergio Pezzotta had blown the full-time whistle. Multiple kicks and punches where thrown amid chaotic scenes, with a small number of Santos fans running onto the pitch to celebrate with their team, having clinched the title for the third time in the club's history. Police stepped in to separate the two squads, with players from both sides also attempting to make the peace.","Santos have won the Copa Libertadores after a 2-1 over Uruguay's Penarol .

"(CNN) -- France has ordered the extradition of former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega to Panama, where he faces charges that he ordered a political rival to be killed. The former dictator has a month to appeal. He was notified of the extradition order on July 29, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday. Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering. Noriega also was fined almost 2.3 million euros ($2.9 million), the amount of drug money he was accused of laundering through French banks. Noriega denied the charges. Noriega could be back in Panama by early September; that's when he has a final court date mandated after the appeal term is up. But Noriega's lawyer, Yves Leberquier, said the former leader will not appeal the extradition order. During the French trial, Noriega told the court he once had a strong relationship with the United States. However, the United States gave consent to French authorities to begin the process to extradite Noriega. The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments. He was in U.S. custody from 1990 and was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April 2010 after he spent 20 years in a U.S. federal prison. Panamanian officials want him to face justice there in the case of the killing of Hugo Spadafora, a doctor and political opponent of Noriega. Noriega was convicted in absentia of being involved with the kidnapping and killing of Spadafora in 1985. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: Manuel Noriega could be back in Panama by early September .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Wednesday night that all the 33,000 additional U.S. forces he ordered to Afghanistan in December 2009 will be home within 15 months. In a nationally televised address from the East Room of the White House, Obama said 10,000 of the ""surge"" forces would withdraw by the end of this year, and the other 23,000 would leave Afghanistan by September 2012. At the same time, Obama said the drawdown would help the United States begin to refocus attention and resources on efforts to resolve economic and other problems and to unify a politically divided nation. Here's how CNN analysts reacted to the address: . Peter Bergen, CNN security analyst . ""Well, we've known [talks with the Taliban] have been going on for several months, but certainly as far as I can tell this is the first time the president sort of officially acknowledged it. Bob Gates did a few days ago. President Karzai was the person who kind of first outed it officially. ""I think it is a big deal that White House officials I spoke to said that they're aware of somewhere between 10 and 20 different what they call ""leads"" into the Taliban. They're sort of doing detective work is what they're saying, trying to work out if these leads, how legitimate are they. ""Is somebody coming forward as sort of a free agent who really doesn't represent senior leadership of the Taliban, or is it something deeper? ""They are saying they are not starry-eyed about these discussions with the Taliban. They don't expect some Treaty of Versailles or some peace agreement on the deck of the USS Missouri. But they are looking at sort of some leads that appear to be fairly substantial. That might lead to further negotiation. So I think this is newsworthy."" Gloria Borger, CNN chief political analyst . ""This is a president who understands that 56% of the American public does not want to be in Afghanistan. And the White House advisers I spoke to today said to me, 'Look, if you go back to his speech in December of 2009, this is a president that people will view as steady.' ""Because he told us what he was going to do when he announced the surge in December 2009. And that is exactly what he has done. He is claiming some success in diminishing and defeating al Qaeda, obviously killing bin Laden helps him with that narrative. ""And so I think he believes it now. He can make the case to the American public that he can draw down having had some success. ""But given the fact that we're spending all this money on this war, that it is usually unpopular. I think it's very difficult to separate what is a military decision from what will become a political decision, you know? It's just -- it's all part and parcel of the same thing."" David Gergen, CNN senior political analyst . ""Well, he has chosen I think what was called earlier the 'Goldilocks strategy.' That is there's some people that want to move out rapidly, some people that want to stay a long time. I might choose the middle of that. ""And overall I thought that this speech did bring into focus -- it was a very good speech -- brought into focus his overall philosophy. ""You have to say he promised as a candidate early on in his presidency he would wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and try to do that successfully. ""And his White House aides were pointing out this afternoon when he came into office he had 196,000 troops deployed. By the end of this year we'll have less than 100,000. He is winding down. I think there's substantial disagreement on how he's winding down."" Fareed Zakaria, CNN world affairs analyst . ""I think it's in keeping with his basic strategic rationale from the start. He did announce the surge. Part of that was, I think, the military boxed him in. You remember [Gen.] Stan McChrystal leaked his recommendation. It became very difficult for a Democratic president to overturn it. ""But Obama has started his presidency saying we are too committed overseas, we are too militarily engaged, we have too large a footprint, we've got to rebalance, we've got to focus on nation-building at home. We've got to focus on Asia. And he sounded all those themes. ""It was a remarkable speech for an American president in the caution, the strategic emphasis, rather than the idealistic emphasis. ""He says things like, we must be as pragmatic as we are passionate, as strategic as we are resolute. People would have America overextend itself, confronting every evil that could be found abroad. This is reminiscent of a very different strain of America, in many ways, a strain that goes back before the Cold War.""","Bergen: President for first time acknowledged talks with Taliban .

"(CNN) -- Joseph Maraachli, the infant whose family refused to accept a recommendation by a Canadian hospital to remove the boy's breathing tube and allow him to die, is now breathing on his own without the aid of a mechanical ventilator. The family flew back to their home in Windsor, Ontario, on Thursday, one month after receiving a tracheotomy at a children's hospital in St. Louis. ""By providing him with this common palliative procedure, we've given Joseph the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital."" said Dr. Robert Wilmott, chief of pediatrics for SSM Cardinal Glennon. The 15-month-old, widely known in the media as ""Baby Joseph,"" became the center of an international end-of-life debate when a London, Ontario hospital where he was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to insert a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck and allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs. In court papers, doctors in Canada said there was no hope for recovery. They would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. The family refused to accept the recommendation. The Maraachlis' daughter, Zeina, had died at home in 2002 with a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications, and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son. The Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considers this a ""victory over the culture of death."" He says ""[Joseph] has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents."" Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization which functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia. They are often noted for the graphic images depicting abortion they use to make their case. The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Maraachli was initially treated -- responded on March 23 that ""there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation"" and that ""the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source."" On Thursday, the hospital said it ""has no new comments from those already provided in our previous media statements."" After arriving in Canada on Thursday morning, the child was examined by a team of physicians at the Windsor Regional Hospital to ensure no complications or infections resulted from the flight. According to the hospital's president and CEO, David Musyj, the Maraachlis are prepared to take care of their son, but they also will be provided round-the-clock nursing care in their home. A team of community care nurses will alternate shifts staying with the family. They will take the lead on daily requirements, to include cleaning the trach, tube feeding and administering anti-anxiety medications. The nurses will also monitor his heart rate, suction secretions that build up in his lungs and provide oxygen as needed. According to Musyj, the 24-hour nursing care, medications and all the equipment are provided free of charge under Canada's universal health care system. In the United States, hospice care is underutilized even though it tends to be less expensive than hospitalization and provides more comfort to the patient. Estimates find approximately 60% of all deaths occur in the hospital, yet most patients express a preference to die at home. It is unclear at this point just how much time the Maraachlis have left with their son. In a phone conversation, Pavone said Joseph's symptoms are much more benign than those suffered by his sister. ""It's really an unpredictable condition,"" he said. ""Our mission to save Baby Joseph was never based on any prediction of the future, but rather on the value of his life here and now.""","Joseph Maraachli suffers from a progressive neurological disease .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Mercy petitions of three condemned prisoners jailed in connection with the 1991 assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi have been turned down by India's President Pratibha Devisingh Patil, her spokeswoman told CNN Thursday. In 1999, India's supreme court confirmed death sentences for four of the people convicted of involvement in the suicide bomb attack on Gandhi in southern India.

"(CNN Student News) -- October 13, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Chile • Fort Hood, Texas . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: This is CNN Student News. Welcome on this Wednesday, October 13th! You know the deal about our show: 10 minutes, no commercials, top headlines from around the world. My name is Carl Azuz. Thank you for joining us. Let's go ahead and get started today. First Up: Chile Rescue Mission . AZUZ: 33 men have spent nearly 70 days trapped half a mile underground. And sometime soon, it could all finally be over. Now, when we taped this show on Tuesday evening, officials in Chile were going through the final steps before the rescue attempt could start. By the time you are watching us today, some of those 33 miners could already be up on the surface. When they come up, they'll be wearing special goggles to protect their eyes. You've got to remember, they've spent two months down in the darkness of the mine. Karl Penhaul shows us some of what was going on above ground in the final countdown to the rescue. (BEGIN VIDEO) KARL PENHAUL, CNN CORRESPONDENT, LATIN AMERICA: A prayer for the 33 miners. A prayer for the success of the imminent rescue attempt. Nelly Bugueno has faith her son is coming home at last. NELLY BUGUENO, MOTHER OF TRAPPED MINER [TRANSLATED]: Victor will be anxious to finally get out of that mine and be reunited with his family. As he comes out, he will be reborn. PENHAUL: Down in Camp Hope, preparations are rushed to completion. Fifteen hundred journalists from 39 countries scurry for last minute details. The final countdown has begun. LAURENCE GOLBORNE, CHILEAN MINES MINISTER: The whole process that they have lived has been pretty traumatic, so I think they will be a little bit excited. But we have to wait and see, but we are prepared for any contingency. PENHAUL: Engineers have welded steel pipes into place at the mouth of the rescue shaft to prevent rockfalls. And before dawn Monday, rescuers dropped the Phoenix capsule down for its first test run. The miners' families have a new hero: the T-130 drill that cut through half a mile of rock to reach the 33 men. HECTOR TICONA, FATHER OF TRAPPED MINER [TRANSLATED]: We're happy. I'm about to see my son again. I'm happy because that drill has worked a miracle. PENHAUL: Now, the drill is now pulling out, but the work's not yet over. JEFF HART, DRILL ENGINEER: Until the last guy comes up, the job's not done. PENHAUL: On this barren hillside, a miner's mother insists the men down below were not alone. BUGUENO: There were 34 miners down there; the 33 were down there with the spirit of God. PENHAUL: Whether through the power of machines or the almighty, the miners' life-or-death struggle is nearly won. Karl Penhaul, CNN, at the San Jose Mine in northern Chile. (END VIDEO) Economic Outlook . AZUZ: So, waiting for great news in Chile. There's some not-so-good news about the U.S. economy. The National Association for Business Economics asked a group of experts for their opinions about the recovery. The result: They don't think it's going so well, and they don't think the rest of the year is gonna get much better. They do think that business will lead the recovery as things get better. And they think the job market will pick up eventually, too. But they don't expect that to happen until the second half of 2011. Fort Hood Hearing . AZUZ: The U.S. military has opened a hearing related to last year's deadly shooting at Fort Hood in Texas. Major Nidal Hasan -- he's a U.S. citizen -- is accused of the attack. Authorities say Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 32 others when he allegedly opened fire at the military base. This hearing will determine whether Hasan will be court-martialed, which could lead to the death penalty. Yesterday's hearing stopped almost as soon as it started. The colonel in charge is considering a request from Hasan's attorney to delay the hearing until November. Drilling Moratorium . AZUZ: Yesterday, we talked about a moratorium, a delay or stop in activity. We've got another one we're reporting on for you today. This is the moratorium on deep-water oil drilling, and it's over. The White House made that announcement yesterday. The moratorium started after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year. Officials say there will always be risks with drilling, but that they've come up with new rules and regulations to help reduce those risks. Just the Facts . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the Facts! Stem cells are the human body's master cells. That means they can become different types of cells, like heart or liver cells, for example. Scientists believe that stem cells can be used to treat different types of diseases. Two kinds of stem cells are adult and embryonic. Adult stem cells are found in tissues like bone marrow. Embryonic stem cells come from human embryos that are four to six days old. Stem Cell Injection . AZUZ: Using stem cells to treat diseases is still pretty experimental. But for the first time, cells from an embryonic stem cell have been injected into a human. Adult stem cells, not too much controversy with those. But embryonic stem cells, that's where this debate gets intense, because in order to get those, the embryo has to be destroyed. We don't know much information about this person who was injected with the embryonic stem cells. It was part of a medical study on patients with spinal cord injuries. In order to qualify for the study, you have to be completely paralyzed from the chest down. Scientists are hoping the stem cells will help make a new spinal cord for the patient. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Alley's 8th grade class at Dyersburg Middle School in Dyersburg, Tennessee! Which word describes someone who is at least 100 years old? Is it: A) Centurion, B) Centenarian, C) Septuagenarian or D) Hundredarian? You've got three seconds -- GO! A centenarian is at least 100 years old. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! 101-Year-Old Citizen . AZUZ: Eulalia Garcia Maturey is a centenarian. She has lived almost all of her 101 years in the United States. But this centenarian just became a U.S. citizen yesterday! Maturey came here from Mexico when she was a baby, exactly 101 years ago yesterday. In 1941, she got a ""Certificate of Lawful Entry"" card from the U.S. government. So, she's been living here legally. But Maturey recently decided to make it official. She filed papers, passed the citizenship test, and yesterday, became a full citizen. So one question: Why do it now? In her words, ""I want to spend the rest of my days in this life living legally in the United States."" Blog Report . AZUZ: Our show, your voice. We're taking it to our blog! From yesterday's program: Was St. George's right when it forfeited a football game in the name of safety? Or should they have taken the challenge in the name of sportsmanship? From Enrique: ""Players are being taught to quit when it looks tough. Why choose to fail when success is an option?""  From Zak: ""Everything's not about winning or losing; it's all about trying."" And Gabe says, ""we are playing football here. There is no safety. I think they need to suck it up and play."" ""By not playing the game, St. George's is teaching their student athletes that when you face adversity, you back down."" That quote from another student named Zach. Stephanie wrote, ""it was a good idea for them to back out of the game because they would've gotten crushed and probably injured by the other players. They were massive."" But from Amethyst: ""When you decide to play a sport, you have to understand there will always be bigger and better. No one practices not to play."" If you need a refresher on this story, you can find it at CNNStudentNews.com in yesterday's show. And as a reminder: We only publish first names on our blog; we only read first names on our program. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, they don't sell this in your school cafeteria. We are heading to the Iowa World Food Festival. Some vendors there are building one intense burger. You start off with the beef, like you see. Add some cheese. But then -- here comes the interesting part -- you slap on the top half of the bun, which is a donut! They recommend not using ketchup or mustard on this. They wouldn't want to ruin the taste. If you like eating your dessert at the same time as your entree... Goodbye . AZUZ: This sounds like the perfect meal, donut? Donut? Don't know if that worked. Maybe your eyes just glaze over at that burger; maybe they glaze over at that pun. Or maybe you think it's all in bad taste. Either way, there are no arguments from us. We don't want to start a beef with anybody. Hope you have an awesome day. We'll see you tomorrow, when CNN Student News returns. Bye bye!","Officials and family members prepare for the rescue of 33 trapped miners .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is recovering ""really, really well"" from surgery that implanted a synthetic bone and a shunt in her skull, her doctors said Thursday. The Arizona Democrat told her neurosurgeon that she was extremely excited to have crossed a key milestone in her recovery, which her doctors called ""almost miraculous"" considering she was shot point-blank in the head in January. ""The shunt is in good position, the implant is in good position and everything looks great,"" said Dr. Dong Kim, who performed the 3 1/2 hour-surgery to replace the part of her skull bone that was shattered and contaminated. ""She looks great,"" he said. ""I started calling her 'Gorgeous Gaby' today."" The shunt is expected to help Giffords improve but, Kim said, it was impossible to predict exactly how much progress she was going to make. The Arizona Democrat was shot outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket where she was meeting with constituents in January. Six people -- including a federal judge -- were killed and 13 others were wounded in the attack. Jared Lee Loughner stands accused in the shooting. Surgeons in Arizona had cut a hole in Giffords' skull to give her brain space to temporarily swell. The congresswoman was later transported to Houston for further treatment and rehabilitation. Her skull could be repaired only after the swelling had subsided. Kim implanted a piece of synthetic bone specially made for the congresswoman. ""It really is a significant step. More than just getting the bone back, it is a marker for where we are"" in Giffords' recovery, Kim said. Like many other patients with gunshot wounds to the head, Giffords has hydrocephalus, or a build-up of fluid in the brain. Kim said an internal drain, called a shunt, was inserted into Giffords' cranial cavity to carry excess fluids from the brain to the abdominal cavity. Giffords will have to wear the shunt forever. Dr. Girard Francisco, who is in charge of Giffords' rehabilitation, said that the congresswoman will undergo bedside rehab for at least the next two days before returning to the in-patient program at the TIRR Memorial Hermann Rehabilitation Center in Houston. Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, the commander of the space shuttle Endeavor, has been getting updates from conversations with family. ""Everything went as planned,"" he told PBS Thursday from the International Space Station. ""Her neurosurgeons are very happy and she's recuperating and she's actually getting back to therapy today so it went really, really well."" Monday, Giffords watched and cheered as the Endeavour took off on its final voyage from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Surgeons implanted a piece of synthetic bone and also a shunt in U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' skull .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Five American service members were killed Thursday after an improvised explosive device detonated in southern Afghanistan, officials said. The attack occurred several days after 30 Americans died in a helicopter crash in central-eastern Afghanistan. That was America's worst single-incident loss of life since the war began. No other details were provided regarding Thursday's incident. On Wednesday, Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi told reporters that coalition forces had killed 189 militants in joint operations against Taliban insurgents across the country in the past three weeks. Azimi announced that 362 insurgents had been detained since July 23, as NATO and Afghan forces stepped up raids against Taliban strongholds. ""We've increased our efforts over the last several months,"" said Lt. Cmdr. Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. ""The focus is to allow them to have less and less (in terms of) safe havens."" But a Taliban spokesman rejected the insurgent casualty figure cited by the Defense Ministry in what appears to be the latest example of coalition forces vying with insurgents in attempting to control information from the battlefield. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said fewer than 30 militants had been killed during that time, adding that the insurgency had stepped up its guerrilla tactics and mine attacks. Mujahid also rejected an earlier NATO statement that said coalition forces had killed insurgents responsible for the downing in eastern Afghanistan of a CH-47 Chinook helicopter that left 38 U.S. and Afghan personnel dead. He said a NATO airstrike killed a separate group of insurgents, while those responsible for Saturday's strike slipped into a separate Afghan province. He did not elaborate, and CNN could not independently confirm the claims. Al Jazeera aired Thursday video of what it said was wreckage of the helicopter. The video shows unspent shells; papers in English and rubble. ""These are the only pictures of the helicopter remains that NATO forces were not able to hide,"" the narrator says. ""It's apparent that the helicopter did not only fall, but it exploded and scattered."" Saturday's attack on the helicopter represented a major blow to America's most elite fighting unit: 17 U.S. Navy Seals were killed along with other special operations forces, Afghan commandos and a civilian translator. U.S. Special Operations Forces have conducted at least 2,500 raids by helicopter in the last year and Saturday's strike was the first during that time in which an aircraft supporting operations was lost, ISAF said. Meanwhile, the country faces looming questions over its long-term stability and the prospect of a resurgence by the Taliban as a security handover and NATO drawdown take place. But it remains unclear whether recent attacks by Taliban fighters represent newfound insurgent strength. In May, the Taliban launched what they called a Spring Offensive against Afghan and NATO forces, in a wave of attacks that has continued into late summer. But NATO forces, bolstered by last year's ""surge"" of 33,000 additional U.S. troops, say they have increased operations against Taliban safe havens, pushing insurgents from strongholds in the south and east. Meanwhile, 10,000 U.S. soldiers are scheduled to depart Afghanistan by year's end, with the full drawdown set for the end of 2014. Western diplomats, however, predict a NATO military presence will extend beyond the drawdown date.

"(CNN) -- Barry Manilow told CNN's Piers Morgan that when he first got into show business, he had ""no eyes to be a performer. I had no ambition to be on the stage singing, singing and dancing around the stage."" Manilow, who has sold over 80 million records worldwide, had 35 consecutive Top 40 hits and five albums simultaneously on the charts, is the guest on Thursday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The show was taped before a rare in-studio audience, and the renowned singer-songwriter played the piano and sang some of his hits. ""When I got up there to promote my first album,"" said Manilow, ""I really didn't know what to do with my legs. I was able to get up from the piano, and then I really didn't know what else to do, because I had never, ever thought about standing up on a stage and entertaining. And, I thought I was dreadful. But the audiences didn't. And I think they were able to connect with a guy who was telling the truth."" Manilow recalled that his first real shot at the spotlight was given to him by Bette Midler in the early 1970s. ""I was her conductor and arranger,"" said Manilow. ""And I had an album out. And she allowed me to do a couple of songs."" During the 1960s and 1970s, Manilow worked as a commercial jingle writer. He composed the songs for State Farm Insurance (""And like a good neighbor, State Farm is there... ""), Band-Aid (""I am stuck on Band-Aid, 'cause Band-Aid's stick on me!"") and McDonald's (""You deserve a break today"") among others. Manilow pointed out that the State Farm and Band-Aid jingles still air to this day. The Brooklyn-born-and-raised Manilow recalled that on the day he was presented with his first $1 million check, which he calls ""The 'Mandy' check,"" he had actually bounced a check he'd written out to AT&T that same morning. ""Mandy,"" which was recorded in 1974, was Manilow's first No. 1 hit. ""I used it as a bookmark,"" said Manilow. ""I mean, that's where I was at, you know. I didn't take money seriously. I was never doing it for the money."" Manilow also recounted the lashing he got from critics who bashed ""Mandy,"" despite the song's success on the charts. ""I've got my feelings on my sleeve,"" said Manilow. ""I've made a career out of it, you know? This is who I am, this is what I feel and I think that was one of the reasons I had such trouble with the critics. They didn't like to see that from a guy. They'd much rather see a guy being angry on the stage."" Manilow's first album of original songs in more than a decade, ""15 Minutes,"" is out. The singer-songwriter has been the resident headliner at The Paris Hotel in Las Vegas for two years; prior to that he headlined at the Las Vegas Hilton for five years. Now in his seventh year in Vegas, Manilow may soon beat Elvis Presley's record of Las Vegas longevity. The album name is a nod to the expression coined by artist Andy Warhol in 1968: ""In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."" Manilow, who has been world-famous for nearly 40 years, told Morgan that the rewards of fame depend on how it is handled. Manilow said that he fears for people who become famous on shows such as ""American Idol"" and ""X Factor"" without having paid their dues. ""They do have talent,"" Manilow said. ""But, you know, before you know it, they are household names. And they haven't worked in the bars that we worked in. They haven't played the bar mitzvah, they haven't gotten dressed in the men's room."" However, Manilow pointed out there's a dark side to fame today and that stars often pay a price that he didn't have to pay. In particular, he referenced Britney Spears' psychological issues and troubles with paparazzi and said, ""I don't know whether anybody brings that kind of thing on themselves. It seems to me that she was trying to live her life. ""This didn't happen to me. Not that. They didn't follow me around wherever I was going."" He said he worries about young celebrities today because ""just being famous is a very dangerous thing to do if you are not grounded."" Manilow also pointed out that celebrities today open their private lives to the public via Twitter, YouTube and reality shows, saying ""they invite people in, you know. For me, that's one place I lock the door unless I invite you in. It's my one thing that I finally have to myself, man. Which is my life and you can't come in unless I invite you in."" Morgan told Manilow that he agrees that ""we know too much"" about famous people's lives, and that he finds the musician more interesting because he keeps his private life private, invoking ""the old mystique from celebrity."" Manilow recalled coming up in ""that world of Sinatra's"" where ""we didn't see then what we do see now. ""I'm a private man, and I'm a gentleman,"" said Manilow. ""And I'm proud of it."" When Morgan asked Manilow to tell the now-famous story of how Bob Dylan publicly came to his defense, Manilow said, ""He said some really great things when I was out at dinner and he gave me a real compliment. He said, 'Keep doing what you're doing, man.' And those were the years that I really needed to hear that."" What's Manilow's favorite Barry Manilow song? ""There's so many songs,"" Manilow said. ""There's been 30 years of music, but 'One Voice' comes to mind."" Manilow said the song remains an inspiration to him because the words and music came to him in a dream one night. He wouldn't disclose his least favorite Barry Manilow song. How did Manilow feel about being ""the greatest showman of our generation"" by Rolling Stone magazine? ""That's really a beautiful thing to go through my life with, because I work real hard on that stage. I try to do the best work I can."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(Health.com) -- Mercury exposure from eating fish doesn't appear to raise the risk of heart disease and stroke, as some research has suggested, according to a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study -- the largest of its kind to date -- should help settle long-standing uncertainty about whether mercury from fish, which in high doses is believed to cause developmental delays in fetuses and infants, might also impact the heart health of adults. ""This research provides really robust evidence that mercury exposure from fish consumption at levels commonly seen in [the] U.S. and similar countries is not linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,"" says Dariush Mozaffarian, M.D., the lead author of the study and an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, in Boston. ""For the average consumer who's worried about mercury in fish, our study suggests that cardiovascular toxicity should not be a concern."" Health.com: 10 best foods for your heart . Not only is eating fish safe, but it's also good for your heart, thanks to its low levels of saturated fat and abundant omega-3 fatty acids. In the study, in fact, the participants with the highest mercury exposure appeared to be at slightly less risk of heart attack and stroke than those with the lowest exposure, a trend that is probably due to the benefits of fish consumption rather than the mercury itself, the researchers say. Fish ingest mercury, an industrial by-product, when it collects in rivers and oceans. Mercury levels tend to be more concentrated toward the top of the underwater food chain, as smaller fish (such as sardines and shrimp) are eaten by larger fish (such as swordfish and tuna). Fish-oil supplements, which many people take to promote heart health, have not been found to contain mercury, says Stephen Kopecky, M.D., a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. Health.com: Supplements for cholesterol: what works? For years, health officials have warned pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children to limit their fish consumption due to concerns about the apparent link between mercury exposure and subtle delays in the brain development of infants and children. Neurological problems stemming from mercury-laden fish do not appear to be a concern for adults, but doctors have been less certain about the effects of mercury on heart health. Some experts have suggested, for instance, that mercury could affect heart health by interfering with heart function, promoting blood clots, or neutralizing antioxidants. To test this theory, Mozaffarian and his colleagues measured mercury levels in the stored toenail clippings of 3,427 people with a history of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke, and compared them with an equal number of demographically similar people without heart problems. (Toenail clippings are a common way of measuring mercury exposure.) Health.com: 10 healthy fish recipes . The participants, who were part of two long-running government studies known as the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, also answered detailed questions about their dietary habits. The average mercury concentrations were about the same in both groups, 0.23 versus 0.25 micrograms per gram. (By comparison, 0.4 micrograms per gram is considered the upper limit of safety for pregnant moms and infants.) The researchers found no relationship between mercury exposure and the risk of heart attack and stroke, even in people with mercury concentrations of up to 1 microgram per gram. ""Any way we looked at it, we found no evidence for higher risk,"" says Mozaffarian, who is also an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. In short, there is no reason to change the current dietary recommendations regarding fish and mercury, Kopecky adds. Health.com: Healthy fish choices . The American Heart Association generally recommends that people eat fish at least twice a week, limiting their consumption of large, predatory fish that might have higher mercury levels. The Food and Drug Administration, meanwhile, urges pregnant women and young children to eat no more than two servings of fish per week. These groups should stick with salmon, catfish, canned light tuna, and other low-mercury species, and should avoid high-mercury species altogether, the agency says.

"New York (CNN) -- A man pleaded not guilty Thursday in the Father's Day shooting deaths of four people in a Long Island, New York, pharmacy robbery for painkillers, according to Robert E. Clifford, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney's office. Police said David Laffer has been accused of fatally shooting two employees at Haven Drugs in Medford as well as two customers before leaving with a large quantity of prescription drugs Sunday morning. The attack was allegedly unprovoked, according to Police Commissioner Richard Dormer, who cited surveillance video that captured the shootings on tape. Laffer's attorney, Mary Beth Abbate, noted that Laffer has no previous criminal record and has asked for a ""reasonable bail,"" she said. Police said Laffer later was identified -- despite wearing a phony beard, sunglasses and a cap -- after authorities received more than 400 tips from the public. The 33-year-old Long Island resident had appeared on a list of pharmacy clients who received various drugs from the Haven Drugs store, Dormer said. Laffer was also registered as owning a .45-caliber handgun, the same type of weapon used in Sunday's shooting, he added. Dormer noted that evidence found at the scene allegedly linked Laffer to the shooting, but did not elaborate. Laffer has been charged with first-degree murder and resisting arrest. On Wednesday, police removed a bloodied and handcuffed Laffer from his home, and he appeared to have suffered trauma to his face. ""The officers had to use force"" because Laffer became ""extremely violent"" during the arrest, Dormer told reporters. Laffer's wife, Melinda Brady, 29, was also arrested and charged with third-degree robbery and obstructing governmental administration, authorities said. ""He was doing it maybe because he lost his job over my health,"" Brady told reporters during her arrest. ""I'm sorry that he did all this."" Both Laffer and Brady appeared ""strung out"" and ""under the influence"" at the time of their arrests, Dormer said. Brady has since been hospitalized. The pair was arraigned Thursday at First District Court in Central Islip, Long Island. Police identified the dead as Raymond Ferguson, 45, and Jennifer Mejia, 17, both pharmacy employees, as well as customers Bryon Sheffield, 71, and Jamie Taccetta, 33. Mejia's death came days before her graduation from Bellport High School on Thursday, said school secretary Maryann Malcolm.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is watching closely to the see the ultimate fate of the most powerful man in Pakistan, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani army's chief of staff. Pressured by Washington to crack down on terrorists at the same time he was kept in the dark about the U.S. raid to kill Osama bin Laden, Kayani ""is facing more vocal and strident criticism than he has in the past,"" a senior U.S. military official told CNN. ""We really think he is coming under increased scrutiny by junior and mid-grade officers."" This is the type of scrutiny senior Pakistani generals like Kayani are ""not accustomed to facing,"" the official said. Criticism of Kayani inside Pakistan had grown in recent months as he became close to the Obama administration and the Pentagon. But in the wake of the U.S. military raid into Pakistan to kill bin Laden, the criticism has increased from an officer corps furious that U.S. troops invaded Pakistan's territory without the Pakistani military, and especially Kayani, being consulted. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, is one of Kayani's closest professional and personal allies, having met with him many times in the past several years. ""Mullen does consider him a friend,"" said the admiral's spokesman, Capt John Kirby. ""That doesn't mean there aren't still disagreements. It doesn't mean Kayani doesn't feel betrayed."" U.S. officials are closely watching a group known as the ""11 corps commanders,"" the senior Pakistani generals hand-picked by Kayani to command. Keeping their loyalty will be crucial for Kayani to keep his job. At his final Pentagon news conference Thursday before stepping down at the end of the month, Gates warned that no matter how much strain exists between the two countries, cooperation must be preserved. ""We need each other and we need each other more than just in the context of Afghanistan. Pakistan is an important player in terms of regional stability and in terms of central Asia, and my view is that this is a relationship that we need to keep working at it."" Incoming Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on June 9 sounded a similar warning: ""This is a difficult challenge. The relationship with Pakistan is at the same time one of the most critical and yet one of the most complicated and frustrating relationships that we have."" Panetta said it is ""complicated by the fact that they maintain relationships with certain terrorist groups, that they continue to not take aggressive action with regard to these safe havens, and that they're concerned about the sovereignty results and criticisms of the United States when, in fact, my view is that the terrorists in their country are probably the greatest threat to their sovereignty."" For his part, Mullen, also testifying before Congress this week, said he wouldn't ""push back"" on the challenge of working with Pakistan. ""Some of the criticism is more than warranted. Nobody's worked that harder than me, very frankly, with the leadership. And it's a conscious decision, I think, that we have to make. And if we walk away from it, it's my view it will be a much more dangerous place a decade from now, and we'll be back.""","Gen.

"(CNN) -- U.S. citizens should ""exercise extreme caution"" when traveling to the Philippines, the U.S. State Department said Tuesday in a statement. ""Targeted sites may be public gathering places including, but not limited to, airports, shopping malls, conference centers, and other public venues,"" said the statement. The warning, which is an update from November, specifies the island of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago as particularly dangerous and at great risk of harboring terrorist activity. Manila might also be included, the statement said. Because of election-related violence, the Philippine government declared a state of emergency in November 2009 for the Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat provinces, as well as Cotabato City in Mindanao. This state of emergency is still in effect, according to the State Department. Travelers should be aware of heightened police and military presence in these areas and of kidnap-for-ransom gangs that are active in the Philippines and target foreigners, the department said. Mindanao is a predominantly Muslim autonomous region, set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country. Read U.S. State Department's full warning . In November 2009 at least 57 people were killed when their convoy was ambushed in Maguindanao. The former mayor of the province was accused of plotting the deaths to thwart a political rival.

"(CNN) -- Five-time Wimbledon winner Bjorn Borg has backed world number three Roger Federer to emerge victorious this year. Borg, who won 15 majors between 1974 and 1981, is confident the six-time champion can overcome holder Rafael Nadal, in-form Serb Novak Djokovic and fourth seed Andy Murray at the All England Club tournament. The Swede cited Federer's form during the recent French Open at Roland Garros, where the Swiss lost to the Spaniard Nadal in the final, as the reason behind his prediction. ""I pick Federer because the way he played the French Open. I have never seen Roger play better clay court tennis than he did in Paris. Murray's Wimbledon mission will not succeed in 2011 . ""Roger is a mentally strong person, so when he's coming to one of his favorite surfaces, grass, I think it's going to be very difficult to beat him at Wimbledon."" Although Borg tipped the 29-year-old Federer to shine, the former world number one would not be surprised if top seed Nadal, Australian Open winner Djokovic or home-crowd favorite Murray clinched the title. ""You have four guys right now, they are playing incredible tennis and I think everybody's very confident for the moment. I pick Federer, but anyone can win."" Nadal equaled Borg's record of six French Open triumphs with his victory over 16-time major champion Federer earlier this month, and the 55-year-old said he has enjoyed watching the pair's rivalry develop over the last few years. ""My two favorite players are Federer and Nadal. I've only missed one match of all the matches they have played. They are a little bit different, different personalities, different styles. ""They produced tennis like ex-players want to see and people want to see, and they always play great tennis."" CNN's Open Court presenter and former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash disagrees with Borg, and thinks Nadal will retain his crown. ""I've got to say the number one player in the world. I think all four players (Nadal, Djokovic, Federer and Murray) have got a great chance, all four top players. ""But if I had to say one I'd have to say the number one player in the world who has just won the French Open, Nadal."" Boris Becker became the youngest-ever champion of the grass court grand slam in 1985, aged 17, and the German agrees with Borg that Federer can record a seventh Wimbledon crown. But the three-time winner at SW19 cannot pick a winner out of the tournament's top four seeds. ""I would agree with Borg in a sense that a six-time Wimbledon champion can win it seven times. ""I don't think there is a clear-cut favorite this year. Normally you would go with the defending champion, but Federer is the most talented of all of them. ""You have Andy Murray, the great hope of Britain, and you have Novak Djokovic, the player of the year losing only one tennis match. I want to see the first week, how everybody does in their first couple of matches, then I can give you a name.""","Bjorn Borg has backed six-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer to win 2011 event .

"London (CNN) -- A man who threw a shaving foam pie at media mogul Rupert Murdoch while he testified over the British phone hacking scandal has been jailed for six weeks, court officials told CNN Tuesday. Jonathan May-Bowles caused an uproar when he thrust the paper plate covered in foam towards the face of News Corp. CEO Murdoch at a hearing before lawmakers in London last month. Westminster Magistrates Court confirmed to CNN that Bowles, a self-described comedian and activist, had been sentenced to jail Tuesday over the public order offence. May-Bowles pleaded guilty last week to assaulting Murdoch, the British Press Association reported. Sentencing him, District Judge Daphne Wickham told May-Bowles he would spend three weeks of his six-week term in prison, the Press Association said. The judge said he had disrupted an important parliamentary process that should take place in a ""civilized fashion,"" and that she had taken into account the potential alarm caused to Murdoch by the incident. May-Bowles was also ordered to pay £250 (about $407) costs and a £15 (about $25) ""victim surcharge"", a levy that is attached to any fine for a criminal offense and used to provide services for the victims of crime. The foam pie incident was captured live on television as Murdoch and his son James answered questions from lawmakers over alleged wrongdoing by the staff of News Corp.'s British arm, News International. The swift reaction of Murdoch's wife, Wendi Deng, who leapt to defend her 80-year-old husband and smashed Bowles's hand with her own, also attracted wide media interest. Murdoch was unharmed in the incident. CNN's Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","Jonathan May-Bowles admitted throwing the foam pie at media mogul Murdoch .

"Yayladagi, Turkey (CNN) -- Syrian security forces and helicopters sprayed automatic weapons fire into a crowd of thousands of protesters demonstrating Friday after prayers in the northern town of Maaret al-Nouman, witnesses said. At least four men were killed, activist Fadi Moustafa Sufi said. An activist who has provided CNN with reliable information in the past said the crowd numbered in the tens of thousands when security forces on the streets and an attack helicopter aloft opened fire. Some demonstrators used their personal weapons, including hunting rifles and AK-47s, to detain a number of members of the security forces when they ran out of ammunition, said the activist, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. He did not say that demonstrators exchanged fire with the security forces. Citing the intensity of the gunfire from the security forces, the activist predicted the death toll would rise. CNN cannot independently confirm the activist's report. Another of the demonstrators, activist Yusuf Mohamed Ali Hassan, said he was shot in the right thigh by machine-gun fire from a helicopter. ""I'm at a friend's house getting treatment secretly from a doctor,"" Ali Hassan told CNN by telephone. ""I didn't go to the hospital because I don't trust the hospitals."" The violence in Maaret al-Nouman erupted Friday after Syrian state television announced that the military had launched an operation to retake the nearby rebellious northern border town of Jisr Al-Shugur. Meanwhile, Syrian refugees and opposition activists who had fled the town fearing a government attack said they heard tanks firing as they advanced through villages while approaching Jisr Al-Shugur. ""In response to the appeal from the families, units of the Syrian military began implementing its function to restore security in Jisr Al-Shugur and surrounding villages and arresting a number of militants,"" Syrian state TV announced Friday morning in a banner. ""They are attacking the village of Sirmaniya with tanks,"" opposition activist Ali Hassan said in a phone call to CNN earlier in the day, referring to a village less than 10 kilometers southwest of Jisr Al-Shugur. This comes as anti-government demonstrators embarked on protests across the country, which has been engulfed in conflict between activists opposing the Bashar al-Assad regime and government forces working to clamp down on the outpourings. Every Friday for weeks, anti-government marches have been organized after Muslim prayers. Friday's expression of discontent was dubbed ""the Friday of kinship,"" denoting that all Syrians are part of one family. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 15 people have been killed in various locations, including Maaret al-Nouman. From a hilltop near Sirmaniya, Ali Hassan said he saw black smoke rising from the village and heard tank cannon firing several times a minute. The military advance spread panic throughout the civilian population. Residents say they had evacuated women and children from Jisr Al-Shugur in recent days. More than 3,800 Syrians have fled to Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia agency reported, and humanitarian workers feared many more were on the way. ""My family called (from Jisr Al-Shugur) and told me not to go back,"" said a 27-year-old man named Ali who had fled his hometown and was camped out along the border with Turkey. The Syrian government announced it would punish Jisr Al-Shugur after it accused ""armed groups"" of killing at least 120 security forces there several days ago. Refugees have disputed that claim. They say some soldiers rebelled after being ordered to open fire on unarmed protesters and started fighting among themselves instead. Ali Hassan, the opposition activist, smuggled himself across the border to the Turkish village of Guvecci to speak Thursday night with journalists. CNN has been denied permission to report inside Syria. Ali Hassan showed a video he said he had shot on his cell phone. It showed a column of thousands of unarmed male protesters walking near the town of Jabal al Zawiya, roughly 30 kilometers from Jisr Al-Shugur, on June 3. Suddenly, long bursts of gunfire rang out, sending the demonstrators running and screaming for cover. ""This was a peaceful protest. The security forces started shooting at the people,"" Ali Hassan said. ""They were 50 meters away from us. They were security officers wearing military uniforms. Some of them had beards and they didn't even speak Arabic."" Ali Hassan denied Syrian government accusations that the protesters were armed. ""I challenge anyone who says the protesters had guns or weapons,"" Ali Hassan said. ""Nobody even carries a knife. I'm responsible for searching people who are going to demonstrate. Even if they have a wooden stick, we don't let them carry it."" Others making it over the border imparted similarly harrowing tales. One protester, shot last month in the leg and arm by Syrian security forces, was being treated at a hospital in Turkey. He said the security personnel opened fire at a peaceful protest one Friday and caused many casualties. ""We are oppressed and we want our freedom,"" said the 23-year-old protester, who didn't want to be named for security reasons. A Syrian military officer said he and other troops defected because of the ""massacre of the people of Syria."" ""Our current mission is to protect unarmed protesters who are asking for freedom and democracy,"" he said. The ongoing bloodshed in Syria is putting its neighbor and close trade partner Turkey in an increasingly uncomfortable position. On Thursday night, Turkey's prime minister, a political ally of the Syrian president, warned ""we cannot keep supporting Syria in the face of all these developments."" Speaking on Turkey's ATV channel just three days before his party competes in parliamentary elections, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he spoke four or five days ago with Assad. ""I explained this situation very clearly,"" he said. ""Despite this, they take these matters very lightly. ""Syria is almost like an internal affair (for Turkey). We have an 800- to 900-kilometer border. We cannot close our doors to those who run for their lives and want to take shelter in Turkey."" He added, ""How long can this continue?"" On Friday afternoon, at a refugee camp in the Turkish border town of Yayladagi, Syrian families chanted ""down with the regime"" and ""thank you, Erdogan."" One man approached the fence of the abandoned tobacco factory where more than 1,500 refugees were being held and broke the rules imposed by the Turkish authorities to speak to CNN. He was crying and said all of his brothers were killed Friday at the protest in Maaret al-Nouman. ""We are protesting because of the massacre in Maaret al-Nouman,"" another man said. A third man announced he would go on a hunger strike until the Assad regime collapses. Turkish police then shooed them away from the fence and the journalists.

"(CNN) -- A furious Hurricane Irene exacted a heavy toll on North Carolina, claiming at least five lives, peeling siding off houses and plunging hundreds of thousands of homes in darkness. And yet, it could have been much worse, said the U.S. Coast Guard. ""All in all, the damage wasn't nearly as bad as we had expected,"" said Rear Adm. William Lee, who surveyed the coastline on a helicopter tour from Cape Lookout to Wilmington.  ""Very few trees were down. I saw evidence of minor flooding."" Three of North Carolina's deaths involved traffic wrecks during the storm.  Another person died when he was hit by a tree limb, while feeding livestock.  A fifth died of a heart attack as he was putting plywood over this windows ahead of the storm's arrival. Some 450,000 were without power early Sunday, officials said. Irene stomped across the state most of the day Saturday after a morning landfall near Cape Lookout at the southern end of the Outer Banks. The storm ripped shingles and siding off buildings in Atlantic Beach, knocked over a church steeple and flooded homes in low-lying areas.  At least 10 major roads were closed and airports were forced to shut down, Gov. Bev purdue said. The hurricane unleashed 10 to 14 inches of rain over much of North Carolina and pushed a 4-foot storm surge into the Chesapeake Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. As of midnight Saturday, Kill Devil Hills had endured 31 hours of nonstop rainfall. Firefighters waded through knee-high floodwaters as they responded to calls in the community. The nearby town of Wanchese was reported under water, officials said. In Duck, North Carolina, the storm pushed water from the Currituck Sound inlet out to the sea, said resident Gregg Nigro. ""Once the storm's eye passes and the wind shifts, we will see flooding and erosion,"" he said Saturday. In Greenville, Mike Sharpe woke to find water under his living room door. ""The front parking lot is just as flooded, and the cars have water up past their doors,"" he said. ""Everybody's a little worried. We didn't expect to have any flooding. That's something we weren't prepared for."" Glenn Williams watched the storm from his downtown Raleigh office. ""I just come down here in the hurricane because it's safer than it is at home where all the trees are at,"" he told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV. By early Sunday morning, Irene had hammered the state with 10 to 14 inches of rain. Through it all, residents maintained their good humor. In Kill Devil Hills, the boarded-up shop windows displayed spray-painted missives to Irene: ""I have enough women in my life, Irene,"" said one. ""No crabs for Irene,"" said another at a seafood shop. ""Don't be mean, Irene,"" said a third. In some areas, beachcombers looked for any shells Irene had deposited. Surfers reveled at their good fortune at Wrightsville Beach, taking advantage of the bigger waves dished up in the aftermath of the storm. ""It's the wind and the waves and the culture,"" Dane Reynolds telling WRAL why he was out in the post-storm surf.  ""It's all about the culture of the surf community.""","NEW:  Many Outer Banks communities are flooded .

"(EW.com) -- He'll be back... if the script is right. Arnold Schwarzenegger has given Hollywood agency CAA approval to discuss a potential new Terminator movie with studios, a source close to the star confirms to EW, but until Schwarzenegger sees a script and specifics about the project, he will not fully commit to it. Director Justin Lin (who helmed this weekend's ""Fast Five"") is reportedly attached to direct the film, but it does not yet have a screenwriter. The rights to the franchise were sold to hedge fund Pacificor last year in a deal worth $29.5 million after Halcyon Holding -- which had acquired the franchise in 2007 -- declared bankruptcy. Sony and Lionsgate had attempted to jointly bid for the property, but the bankruptcy judge awarded it to the Santa Barbara, California-based hedge fund management company instead. The most recent film in the sci-fi franchise, 2009's ""Terminator Salvation,"" grossed $371 million worldwide, but did not star Schwarzenegger (although his computer-generated likeness did make a brief cameo in the film's final act). The former California governor's last starring role was in 2003's ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (global gross: $433 million), and he continues to be strongly identified with the cybernetic assassin that helped propel him to superstardom. EW reported exclusively last month that Schwarzenegger's first post-governor gig would be the animated series ""The Governator,"" a play off of the title combining ""governor"" and ""Terminator"" that became synonymous with his tenure running California's government before he even had the job. ""When I ran for governor back in 2003 and I started hearing people talking about 'the Governator,' I thought the word was so cool,"" Schwarzenegger told EW last month. With so many speculating over what live-action role he will take on first now that he's left the governor's mansion, it's not a huge surprise that while the 63-year-old is done being governor, he may not quite be done being the terminator.

"Washington (CNN) -- Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington closed its doors Saturday, completing the military hospital's merger with the Bethesda National Naval Medical Center. The event was marked with a flag-lowering ceremony, which followed the transfer of Walter Reed's 18 remaining patients to the combined medical center's Bethesda, Maryland, campus. The official closing was conducted a day earlier than originally planned in order to avoid the worst of Hurricane Irene, but the ceremony was still marked by grey skies, heavy rain and strong winds. This somber weather caused Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, the Army surgeon general, to remark in his closing speech, ""clearly the heavens are struggling with the finality of this too."" Despite the weather, a sizeable crowd of Walter Reed staff and military personnel attended the outdoor ceremony with their families. For many of them, the closure of the Walter Reed facility marks the end of an era. The hospital center has been in operation for more than a century and has provided medical care to many of the nation's wounded soldiers. It has also served as a leading center for medical research. The new combined facility, known as the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, is now the country's largest military medical center. It will be run jointly by the Army and the Navy.","Military hospital lowers its flag .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Moscow has been chosen as the venue for this year's international figure skating championship, to take place in April, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced Thursday at the start of a Russian cabinet meeting. The championship was initially scheduled to take place this week in Tokyo, but was cancelled in the wake of Japan's massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami March 11. ""I would like to assure all our friends and partners, that their teams, all participants in the championship and all guests, will feel at home in Moscow,"" Putin said as he delivered the news. The International Skating Union reported on its website Thursday that ""after a careful evaluation"" it had decided to allot the championship to Russia. It will be held April 24-May 1 in Moscow's Megasport Arena. Austria, Canada, Croatia, Finland, and the United States were the other countries bidding to host it, the organization's statement said. ""The ISU is convinced that the Japanese delegation coming to Moscow deserves and will receive special attention and respect,"" the statement says. ""At a time like this, words cannot express feelings but the ISU wants to let the skating friends of the Japan Skating Federation and the people of Japan know that the thoughts and wishes of the skating family continue to remain with them."" ""This event wouldn't be expensive, and we could easily handle all the expenses related to it,"" Putin said Tuesday when first proposing Russia as the venue for the championship. ""The more so, that there are millions of figure skating fans (in Russia),"" he said. ""Our people would be happy to see this wonderful show ... We don't insist on anything, but if the International Union needs a helping hand, we would extend it with pleasure.""","The earthquake and tsunami in Japan scuttled plans for the event .

"New York (CNN) -- The National Hurricane Center on Saturday warned residents of tall structures in the path of Hurricane Irene that the wind hitting upper floors will be stronger than those in most storms. ""As Irene moves through areas with high-rise structures, these structures will experience winds significantly stronger than indicated by the advisory intensity,"" forecasters said. ""Winds at the 30-story level will likely be 20% higher than at the surface. And winds 80-100 stories up could be about 30% higher than the surface."" Irene was expected to reach the New York metropolitan area Sunday at hurricane strength. Winds were at 80 mph Saturday evening. The center's analysis buttressed Mayor Michael Bloomberg's call for high-rise residents to stay away from windows if they live on the 10th floor or above. At the city's request, building owners were shutting down elevators Saturday. Reaching trapped residents would be a drain on police and fire who need to respond to ""real emergencies,"" Bloomberg added. In a hurricane the higher you go, the stronger the wind gusts. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said the higher friction at the ground surface slows wind speeds. According to the National Hurricane Center, forecasters started seeing the significant upper wind increase when the eye-wall collapsed over the Bahamas. They also noted that there was little thunderstorm activity associated with Irene. Thunderstorms tend to bring the higher winds down to the surface, and with the lack of such activity the stronger winds are staying at higher levels. As the storm re-emerges over the Atlantic late Saturday and moves northward, the colder waters also will aid in intensifying this effect. Construction workers had wind dynamics in mind while they secured One World Trade Center ahead of Irene's arrival. While the windows being installed on the soon-to-be tallest building in the U.S. are designed to withstand 125 mph winds, they're only in place up to the 52nd floor. Steel beams taking the place of the Twin Towers have risen to the 80th floor. The remaining upper floors are open to the elements. That's a serious concern because anything blown off a building from that height, even something as small as a bolt, can become a deadly projectile in a hurricane. ""They are very big on safety here,"" said Kelly Potts, an electrician working on One World Trade Center. ""If anything is not tied down they will address it and fix it."" The construction cranes high atop the World Trade Center site also were to be secured. They are designed to withstand strong winds. Construction workers on the site are well aware how serious high winds are at a skyscraper under construction. While the Time Warner Center was being built a few years ago at Columbus Circle in New York a plywood board was blown off the building. It struck a man below, killing him. Bloomberg also urged people not to have a generator inside their home or apartment because ""carbon monoxide fumes kill."" ""Homeowners and residents: If you haven't done so already, please bring outdoor furniture inside -- plywood, trash cans, any loose items that can blow around,"" he said. CNN Radio's Steve Kastenbaum contributed to this report.","Hurricane Irene will bring high winds to New York City on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has been reflecting on his meltdown at the Masters, after the 21-year-old squandered a four-stroke lead going into the final round at Augusta, eventually carding an eight-over-par 80 to finish 10 strokes behind winner Charl Schwartzel. Speaking to the official Masters website, the Northern Irishman said: ""I'm very disappointed. ""I was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go, and I just unraveled. Hit a bad tee shot on 10, and then never really recovered. It's going to be hard to take for a few days, but I'll get over it."" McIlroy is not alone in crumbling on the back nine whilst leading the Masters and joins a famous list that includes great names such as Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Scott Hoch and Greg Norman. Can McIlroy conquer mental minefield? And McIlory admitted that when he missed the fairway on the 13th hole, he knew his Masters dream had died. ""I'd knew that unless I birdied my way in, I realized I didn't have a chance,"" McIlroy said. ""I realized that was it then. ""But this is my first experience at it and hopefully the next time I'm in this position I'll be able to handle it better. ""I didn't handle it particularly well obviously, but it was a character-building day, put it that way. I'll come out stronger for it."" And, speaking on his Twitter feed, McIlroy quoted Muhammad Ali, saying: ""It's repetition of affirmations that leads to belief -- and once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen."" McIlory also received some words of encouragement from Schwartzel who said: ""Golf is a really funny game -- one moment you're on top of it, the next moment it bites you. ""Rory is going to feel hurt. It's not easy what he went through. He is such a phenomenal player and he will win one.

"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- Almost nothing stood. Where the awful winds bore down, massive oaks, 100 years old, were shoved over like stems of grass, and great pines, as big around as 55-gallon drums, snapped like sticks. Church sanctuaries, built on the Rock of Ages, tumbled into random piles of brick. Houses, echoing with the footfalls of generations, came apart, and blew away like paper. Whole communities, carefully planned, splintered into chaos. Restaurants and supermarkets, gas stations and corner stores, all disintegrated, glass storefronts scattered like diamonds on black asphalt. It was as if the very curve of the Earth was altered, horizons erased altogether, the landscape so ruined and unfamiliar that those who ran from this thing, some of them, could not find their way home. Southern Living: Stories from the Storm . We are accustomed to storms, here where the cool air drifts south to collide with the warm, rising damp from the Gulf, where black clouds roil and spin and unleash hell on Earth. But this was different, a gothic monster off the scale of our experience and even our imagination, a thing of freakish size and power that tore through state after state and heart after Southern heart, killing hundreds, hurting thousands, even affecting, perhaps forever, how we look at the sky. But the same geography that left us in the path of this destruction also created, across generations, a way of life that would not come to pieces inside that storm, nailed together from old-fashioned things like human kindness, courage, utter selflessness, and, yes, defiance, even standing inside a roofless house. Southern Living: What Stands in a Storm: Fellowship . As Southerners, we know that a man with a chainsaw is worth 10 with a clipboard, that there is no hurt in this world, even in the storm of the century, that cannot be comforted with a casserole, and that faith, in the hereafter or in neighbors who help you through the here and now, cannot be knocked down. I know this to be true because I came home to it the day after the storm. My street, a quarter-mile of small, historic homes and lovely trees, had looked as though it were painted on canvas and hung on the air. It was ruined April 27, and also spared. No one died in Glendale Gardens, while, yards away in Rosedale, rescue workers pulled the dead from houses blasted as if in war. It is why, even as they piled their neighborhood into trash heaps two stories tall, my neighbors said, over and over, how fortunate they were. Our little white house, on the edge of a mile-wide tornado, was hammered by flying 2-by-4s, stripped of its shingles but, somehow, still standing when we returned from New Orleans. My wife, Dianne, cried when she saw it, and cried more as she looked down our street. A third of the houses were destroyed. Others will be torn down. The trees that gave this place its name were gone or splintered. In our yard, a single, ancient dogwood survived, my wife's pride, a reminder of what this used to be. People say it will never be the same. I don't know about that. How do you leave? It had been a bad spring. The sirens screamed every few days, in Mississippi, Alabama and beyond. In Tuscaloosa, just days before the big storm, Mary Kate Jemison Cochrane and her daughter, Emily, walked through the family house in Glendale, looking for a place the 91-year-old Mrs. Cochrane could shelter when the weather turned. They settled on a hall closet, removed two Electrolux vacuum cleaners, silent since antiquity, and put in a chair. When sirens did sound on April 27, Mrs. Cochrane stepped inside and shut the door. She passed the time by looking through things, forgotten and dusty. She picked up a cookie tin, and pried off the lid. Neatly rolled inside was her christening gown, the one she wore as a baby, almost 92 years ago. She had been looking for that. Southern Living: What Stands in a Storm: Faith . She is hard of hearing. Inside, with her memories, she did not hear the destruction. She felt the house shake, but it had shaken before. Then she heard someone calling her name. A neighbor, Michael Carr, had huddled as the storm tore at his walls. The first thing he did, when it passed, was break into her house, damaged but intact, and shout for her. It was the same all along the street, as people ran from house to house, shouting, hoping. Carr called for her again. The closet door swung open. ""Well I am fine, Michael,"" she said graciously, ""and you are just so kind, to come check on me."" She stayed here because it was where she raised her children, where she once found a live horse in a bedroom, where every cardboard box bulged with history. It took the storm of a lifetime to move her. She walked through the ruin, and rode away. But she sent Emily back for the gown. There will be great-grandchildren to baptize. They must be properly dressed. Outside, minutes after the winds died down, people gathered in the street. Tammy Elebash, our boy took her daughter to prom, held a phone. ""I see the Pitts ... I see the Petrovics ... yes, Mrs. Brannon is fine. She's on my arm. ..."" Inez Rovegno and John Dolly had grabbed their wedding album and crawled into the tub. Mary Pitts had hidden with her triplets in a hallway as flying glass stabbed the walls. Beverly Banks had held to her big, white dog as her house disintegrated around her. Then, one by one, people noticed the change. The once verdant place was laid open, stripped, flattened. You could see things you had never seen, like a water tower that used to be invisible behind the curtains of green. It was like the storm had picked these people up and set them down someplace ugly, broken, new. How awful it would have been, to have landed there alone. 'I always thought we lived on a good street. Now I know' I have seldom felt helpless in my life. I hold to the hillbilly standard that there is no situation so hopeless that, through perseverance, I cannot make worse. It is why my wife will not let me have a chainsaw -- ""You will cut off your own head"" -- and will not allow me on the roof. So there I stood, giant trees across my driveway, my roof naked, helpless. What happened next still seems like magic. Within a minute of stepping into my yard, I was met by a never-ending stream of neighbors, some I only slightly knew, who left their own crises to help me clean up mine. There are too many to list here -- I would leave someone out -- but they came, capable men who knew how to run a saw or twist a wrench. Some came, worked like a dog, and vanished before I could thank them. I hope they are reading this, men and women who lifted and dragged tons of trees, and almost killed me and my stepson Jake, trying to keep up. Every church group in Tuscaloosa, it seemed, clawed rubble out of my yard, or out of the playground across the street, meaning I can never again say anything mean about the Episcopalians. I came to enjoy the company. That first afternoon, I straightened up from tugging on an unmoving limb to see Allen McClendon, the husband of my son's music teacher, saw through a tree that blocked my drive. He brought his father, Rick, and an old, brown dog named B.J., and we told duck hunting stories and I don't think any lies, but it was hard to tell over the roar of the saws. And then they, too, were gone, to help someone else, somewhere down the road. Southern Living: What Stands in a Storm: Food . There was no end to this generosity. Food just appeared. No one would take a dime. The college students on our street, the ones I had yelled at for driving too fast, cooked all the meat from our melting freezers, and let me pet their puppy. Mrs. Cochrane's Emily asked if we needed a generator. Our boy's friends brought gasoline. Folks with gas water heaters offered hot showers. That night, I went to sleep under the luxury of an electric fan. The next morning, my neighbors were in my yard before I was. So I wonder. If a street is made of people, not oaks and tulip trees, how can this place not be as fine as it ever was? I think the best I heard it put was by Mary Pitts. ""I always thought we lived on a good street,"" she said. ""Now I know."" A few days after the storm, on a Sunday morning, I awoke to a tap-tap-tap on my roof. I should have gone to see what it was about, but after a while the rhythmic tapping got to be almost soothing, and I ducked inside a dream. Later, I learned that my neighbor James Mize had scaled the roof and tacked down some covering that had blown loose. He did not ask me where I went to church, or how I voted, or who my family was. He did not climb that ladder for money, or attention, or even thanks. He did it, he said, because it looked like rain. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(Health.com)  -- A drug widely used to treat mild Alzheimer's disease appears to provide no benefit to this group of early stage patients, according to a new analysis of previously conducted research. Memantine, also known by its brand name, Namenda, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for moderate-to-severe cases of Alzheimer's, although doctors often prescribe it ""off-label"" for milder cases of the disease. ""We conclude that there is a lack of efficacy in mild Alzheimer's,"" says the lead researcher, Lon Schneider, M.D., a professor of psychiatry, neurology, and gerontology at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. ""We think physicians, patients, and caregivers should simply know this."" Pairing memantine with a cholinesterase inhibitor, a type of drug that prevents the breakdown of neurotransmitters involved in memory, has become a standard treatment for mild Alzheimer's disease, but this study ""clearly flies in the face"" of that approach, says William Thies, Ph.D., the chief medical and scientific officer of the Alzheimer's Association, a research and advocacy organization based in Chicago. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . People with mild Alzheimer's have impaired short- and long-term memory and typically experience difficulty with tasks such as paying bills, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Those with moderate disease may have trouble remembering their address or phone number and can become confused about the day of the week or their whereabouts. In 2003, the FDA approved memantine for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, but two years later the agency rejected an application from the manufacturer, Forest Laboratories, to expand the approval to mild Alzheimer's. The drug has nevertheless remained popular for that purpose. Nearly one-fifth of all people with mild Alzheimer's received the drug in 2006, and the rates may be far higher in some hospitals and practices, according to the study, which appears in the journal Archives of Neurology. Many neurologists -- 40 percent, by one estimate -- even prescribe the drug for mild cognitive impairment, a condition that may or may not progress to full-blown dementia. Health.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory . Schneider and his colleagues reanalyzed data from three clinical trials that included 431 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and 697 with moderate Alzheimer's. The trials were originally sponsored by Forest, but the new analysis was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and other non-industry sources. (Schneider has served as a consultant for Forest.) Patients with mild Alzheimer's who took memantine showed no improvement in mental function and their ability to handle everyday tasks (such as bathing and dressing) compared with those who took placebo, either within any one trial or when all of the data were combined. The drug did appear to be slightly more effective for moderate Alzheimer's. Patients taking memantine continued to experience mental decline while on the drug, but less so than patients taking a placebo. Even in this group, however, the evidence for memantine's effectiveness was ""meager,"" the researchers concluded. Health.com: Half of Alzheimer's cases misdiagnosed . ""None of the studies individually showed an effect,"" Schneider says. ""It was only when all three studies were added up together that we could see an effect on some outcomes, and [it was] very small."" The findings don't mean that memantine is ineffective for all patients, Thies says. ""There's a great deal of variation from patient to patient, so whatever you see in a clinical trial is just the average of whatever that is,"" he says. Some people may experience ""a robust benefit"" from the combination of memantine and a cholinesterase inhibitor, he adds, while ""some get none at all."" There is no cure for Alzheimer's. Medications sometimes help with symptoms but can't actually reverse the course of the disease, which may be why doctors are willing to prescribe drugs even when their effectiveness is unproven, Schneider says. Health.com: Alzheimer's disease -- should I take medicines? Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease who are already taking a cholinesterase inhibitor often ask, ""Isn't there more that can be done?"" Schneider explains. ""Memantine is one other thing that can be done. Part of it is hopefulness. The drug may not be indicated for mild Alzheimer's, but what's the cost?"" Memantine has very few side effects, he adds, but Alzheimer's is devastating. Gary Kennedy, M.D., the director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, says that while the new study will ""make people more appropriately cautious,"" it isn't likely to change doctors' prescribing practices.

"(Rolling Stone)  -- There are moments when ""Move Like This,"" the first new album by the Cars in 24 years, sounds so much like a record by the Cars that you find yourself laughing out loud. Take ""Sad Song,"" on which the opening salvo -- a terse guitar strum set against the machinelike thwack of snare drum and hand claps -- is such a note-perfect evocation of the band's vintage attack that it almost plays like winking self-parody. Ronald Reagan was mired in the Iran-Contra scandal when Ric Ocasek and Co. released their last studio album; Benjamin Orr, the Cars' bassist and co-lead singer, died of pancreatic cancer in 2000. But the Cars haven't moved their music an inch. This is the sound of a band picking up a conversation in midsentence. Rolling Stone: Watch the Cars return with surreal 'Sad Song' Can you blame them? Their hits are still radio mainstays, and their influence is audible in successive generations of pop-savvy rockers, from Weezer to the Strokes. Listen back to ""Just What I Needed"" or ""Drive"" and you'll hear where many of today's young bands learned their tricks: how to mix guitars and synthesizers, how to make rock that's as tuneful as bubblegum, and pop that's as stylishly sinister as rock. ""Move Like This"" is a reminder that New Wave can still sound new, especially when the Cars do it. Produced with skillful restraint by Ocasek, his bandmates and the dependable Jacknife Lee (the Hives, Snow Patrol), the album calls to mind adjectives long associated with the Cars: taut, sleek, seamless, efficient. It's a record that whizzes past -- 10 songs in less than 40 minutes -- leaving behind a dark gleam. Rolling Stone: New Wave heroes the Cars roar back on reunion record . It opens with a socko one-two punch: ""Blue Tip"" and ""Too Late,"" textbook Cars songs that place Ocasek's deadpan atop Elliot Easton's tensile lead guitar and Greg Hawkes' blipping, squealing keyboards. The Cars have been called post-punk pop classicists -- what Buddy Holly might have sounded like had he lived long enough to trade in his Strat for a Roland synthesizer. But the thing that has really set them apart is groove, and Ocasek is at his best in songs like ""Keep on Knockin',"" singing a jittery version of the boogie blues. Ocasek's lyrics can be hard to parse, whether about sex (""Your waxy face is melting on your lap/I sat there trying to crush a gingersnap"") or politics (""Sanctuary in the heartland/Black-and-white TV/Stroking all the gunheads/ To the ninth degree""). But for Ocasek, the sound is more important than the message -- in fact, the sound is the message. The Cars have always been mood-music specialists; their cold, brittle, shiny songs evoke long nights, jagged nerves, frustrated longings. Rolling Stone gallery: Random notes, rock's hottest photos . Orr added some warmth, a touch of daylight, to the proceedings, but with him gone, Ocasek has burnished the group's music to a glossier shade of noir. ""Your eyes are dim, your heart is blue/'Cause nothing ever lasts,"" Ocasek croaks over chiming guitar arpeggios in ""Take Another Look""; on ""Sad Song,"" he sings, ""It's just a sad song that pulls you along."" Long after we thought we'd heard the last from them, the Cars have made their darkest, most romantic album. It pulls you along.

"(Mashable) -- On Friday March 11, Apple's iPad 2 will become available for purchase online and in retail stores. Early trade-in activity surrounding the original iPad suggests that that the iPad 2 will be in high demand. As with last year's original iPad and the iPhone 4, we anticipate crowds and long lines at various Apple retail stores across the United States. Are you interested in buying an iPad 2 this weekend? Here's what you need to know. Online or in-store . With the original iPad and the iPhone 4, Apple allowed individuals to place pre-orders online or to reserve a device for in-store pickup. With iPad 2, Apple is eschewing the pre-order game. Instead, the iPad 2 will be available via Apple.com at some point early Friday, and in retail stores starting at 5:00pm. Online reports indicate that Apple.com sales will start at 12:01am PST on March 11, 2011. East coast buyers, set your clocks for 3am. At Apple.com, users can choose between white or black variants in Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + 3G. Users can select either Verizon or AT&T for their Wi-Fi + 3G unit. Apple promises ""fast, free shipping,"" which indicates they are using 2-day Fed Ex or UPS. Depending on when an order goes through, it's possible users could get units on Monday March 14, 2011. We'll be realistic and expect that most users who place an order on Friday will receive their packages on Tuesday March 15, 2011. Like Caesar, you'll need to watch for the Ides of March. Apple retail stores will begin selling the iPad 2 at 5:00pm. Typically, Apple shuts down its stores for a few hours prior to launch in order to get signage, inventory and staff in place. Lines may start at some outdoor Apple stores as early as Friday morning (if not Thursday night), but indoor mall locations may start later, depending on mall policies and general shopping traffic. Retail partners . In addition to the Apple retail stores, the iPad 2 will also be available at Best Buy, Target, Walmart and Sam's Club. Verizon Wireless will also be selling the iPad 2 on Friday March 11, 2011. None of the retail launch partners have specified if sales will take place both in-store and online, but we expect that in-store sales will not begin until 5:00pm. It isn't clear if AT&T will be carrying the iPad 2 at launch (we've reached out to them for comment), but 3G variants from both carriers should be available at retail partners like Walmart and Best Buy. Neither AT&T nor Verizon will be carrying the Wi-Fi only models. Models, colors, carriers . There are eighteen different iPad 2 units: the nine listed below, available in either black or white. -- iPad 2 16GB Wi-Fi: $499.00 . -- iPad 2 32GB Wi-Fi: $599.00 . -- iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi: $699.00 . -- iPad 2 16GB Wi-Fi+3G Verizon: $629.00 . -- iPad 2 32GB Wi-Fi+3G Verizon: $729.00 . -- iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi+3G Verizon: $829.00 . -- iPad 2 16GB Wi-Fi+3G AT&T: $629.00 . -- iPad 2 32GB Wi-Fi+3G AT&T: $729.00 . -- iPad 2 64GB Wi-Fi+3G AT&T: $829.00 . Unlike the white iPhone 4 debacle, Apple promises that white iPad 2 units will be available on launch day. It's really anyone's guess as to the breakdown between color choices. Apple retail stores will likely have the most white units in-stock, with retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart carrying mostly black units. Tips from iLine veterans . Having covered -- and waited in -- numerous iLines in the past, these are my suggestions: . -- Best Buy, Target or Walmart stores near an Apple retail store are likely to be less crowded. Customers who want the fastest purchase experience should check the retail locations closest to the Apple Store. -- If you have a color/size preference, order online. Waiting in line for a few hours only to find out that the model you want is out of stock is no fun. If you want a specific color/capacity, reduce your stress level and order online. -- Plan for non-iPad 2 shoppers. Wireless stores get pretty busy on Friday nights even without the iPad 2 -- keep that in mind before heading to the local Verizon or AT&T store. -- Avoid the Austin-area Apple stores. South By Southwest coincides with the iPad 2 launch, meaning thousands of geeks will be in town and may descend on the store. Locals and visitors alike should steer clear. Just thinking about it makes me queasy. -- Check Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare for line reports and information on how busy particular locations are. -- Wait for Saturday. It isn't uncommon for stores like Best Buy and Walmart to get Friday deliveries. We imagine that at least some iPad 2 inventory will be delivered for the weekend, which means that Saturday mornings are a good time to try local stores -- and if you're brave -- the Apple Store. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Former NFL lineman Shane Dronett's transformation from an affable prankster, quick to flash a wry smile, to a person who was often frightened -- and frightening -- was subtle at first. It began in 2006, with a bad dream. ""He woke up in the middle of the night and started screaming and told everyone to run out of the house,"" said Chris Dronett, Shane Dronett's wife. ""He thought that someone was blowing up our house. It was very frightening."" Chris tried to dismiss the incident as isolated, except that two weeks later, there was another outburst, then another, until they were an almost-nightly occurrence. And as Shane's fear and paranoia began overwhelming him, so did episodes of confusion and rage that sometimes turned violent. Only three years after retiring from the NFL in 2006, Shane was suffering. The tragic culmination of his pain came when he committed suicide in 2009 at 38. Scientists at the Boston University School of Medicine's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy tested Shane's brain tissue and confirmed that  before he died he was suffering with a brain disease -- chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- that seems to afflict football players. ""There is evidence of CTE in his brain making him yet another former NFL player who had definite CTE,"" said Chris Nowinski, co-director of the traumatic encephalopathy center. Nowinski said the center has found evidence of CTE in the brains of 13 of 14 former NFL players, including Dronett. Usually found in much older dementia patients, CTE is an accumulation of an abnormal protein in the brain called tau, which is associated with repeated head traumas -- concussions or subconcussive hits -- that are not allowed to heal. CTE can also diminish brain tissue and is associated with memory loss, depression, impulsive behavior and rage. Outrage comes out of nowhere . The Dronetts' daughter recalled an incident at a local burger joint: ""He was ordering, and he got mad at (an employee) and just punched him in the face,"" said 16-year-old Hayley Dronett. ""He thought the guy was shaking the ice weird or something, and he took him down in the restaurant,"" added Chris. It was all uncharacteristic for a man whom Chris described as ""someone who would light up the room,"" outgoing, affable, funny. It was incongruous behavior for a father who had been involved and close with his two daughters -- taking them four-wheeling, volunteering at school, even painting their fingernails. ""He was just the best dad in the world,"" said Hayley. Researchers believe that the battering Shane Dronett took as an NFL lineman -- and the hits he accumulated over two decades of playing -- might explain his brain's deterioration. ""What we know is that by definition, a lineman will have their head hit almost every play of every game and every practice,"" said Dr. Robert Stern, co-director of the BU CSTE. ""The estimates are around 1,000 or more hits for a lineman every season."" It might have been the accumulation of tens of thousands of subconcussive hits -- which might not result in overt concussion symptoms such as  dizziness, short-term memory loss and confusion but could still cause brain damage -- that finally took a toll on Shane. ""I think the issue is that the brain was not meant to be hit even subconcussively 1,000 times a year,"" said Stern. The NFL would not comment about Shane's case specifically, but it emphasized that the league supports the BU center's work and that it continues to take steps limit contact to the head and to ensure that concussions, when they occur, are properly treated. 10 hard seasons of hard hits . Shane played for 10 seasons, first with the Denver Broncos and then the Atlanta Falcons. He played defense on the 1998 Falcons team that had a storybook Super Bowl run. Chris said her husband never let a concussion deter him. ""Shane didn't come out of games because he always said NFL players are so expendable,"" said Chris. ""And if you're not out there, the next guy will be."" Kurt Warner: Playing with concussion ""part of the game"" Shane played through dizzying hits. ""There were times when he'd be slow getting up and kind of try to shake it off and get back in there,"" said Chris. ""He would have headaches and he would say 'I wish someone would split my head open with an ax and relieve the pressure,' but it wasn't even an option to come out (of the game)."" Could a tumor explain his behavior? When Shane was found to have a brain tumor in 2007, at the height of his unorthodox behavior, it was actually a glimmer of hope for his wife. ""I was almost relieved because I was thinking, 'OK, here is the answer to why he's acting like this, because he had a tumor,' "" said Chris. ""And then after he recovered from the tumor being removed, he was back to the same symptoms of paranoia."" Shane's neurosurgeon said that he most likely had the tumor all his life and that the benign growth could not explain his behavior, Chris said. Researchers at BU CSTE call the brain tumor potentially confounding, but most likely not a factor in Shane's behavior. ""There's no way we would ever know what was specifically caused by the tumor or the surgery for the tumor or CTE,"" said Stern. ""But more than likely at least some of his behavior and symptoms were associated with the worsening of the CTE."" The reasons for Shane's behavioral changes soon became secondary to a bubbling fear for his wife and daughters. It came to a head during a ski trip that Chris took with her daughter Hayley in January of 2009. ""He called us 100 times a day, wondering where we were and we'd tell him we're in Utah ... and he just didn't believe it,"" said Chris. ""He thought people were driving around the house and he was wondering who had been following him that day. It was just very scary."" Shane was supposed to pick up his family at the airport but never showed up. The next morning, Chris encountered her husband in the hallway of their home, brandishing a gun. ""I saw the gun, and I ran out the front door,"" said Chris. ""He had gone into the kitchen, and as soon as I put my hand on the front door, I heard it."" What Chris had heard was the firing of the gun that killed Shane when he turned the gun on himself. In a moment, months of consternation and abject fear ended, giving way to profound sadness for a family that, even as they waded through the mire of Shane's condition, could not have foreseen this end. ""He was always so full of life,"" said Chris. ""Even his darkest moments, I just still never imagined that he would do that."" Two years removed from the terrible events of that January morning, Chris finds some solace knowing that a brain disease that could explain why she and her daughters lost Shane. ""I had nowhere to turn. I didn't know anything about (CTE). I didn't know other players were going through this type of stuff,"" said Chris. ""I think if Shane knew at the time how serious (playing through concussion) could be down the road, he would have backed off."" Chris is heartened by rules changes and progress at the NFL level, but chafes when she hears about players who oppose those changes. ""I know a lot of the players are against that, but they're young and they haven't seen what I've seen,"" said Chris. Chris says that if she could speak directly to players, ""I would tell them what I went through, what Shane went through and what other people I know have gone through and then let them make that decision. Because I feel like they're making their statements without being educated.""","Scientists confirmed that ex-Falcons lineman had  a brain disease linked to concussion .

"(Mental Floss) -- The classic ""Seinfeld"" episode ""The Bottle Deposit"" will be 15 years old in May. In honor of Kramer and Newman's ill-fated trip to Michigan in a mail truck full of bottles and cans they hoped to redeem for dimes, let's take a look at why Michigan's bottle deposit is so high. How long has Michigan had the dime deposit? The 10-cent deposit traces its roots back to the Michigan Beverage Containers Law of 1976. Here's how it works: the consumer pays an additional dime up front, which will be refunded when the can or bottle is returned. The rule aims to curb litter, encourage recycling, and provide funding for environmental programs. Mental Floss: Why Does Bottled Water Have an Expiration Date? Does the higher deposit prompt more recycling? A five-cent difference may sound trifling, but the higher deposit helps make Michigan's recycling program wildly successful. Although it's tough to track fraudulent cans and bottles that come in from outside the state, the Michigan program has returned over 95 percent of the deposits it has taken in since the year 2000. According to stats published by the Container Recycling Institute, these rates dramatically outpace those in states with nickel deposits, where redemption rates largely remain in the 60-to-80-percent range. Those dimes add up, too. In 2008, Michigan returned over $407 million in deposits. Mental Floss: A Seinfeld guest star quiz . Could Kramer and Newman really have pulled off their stunt? Possibly, but it would have been illegal. Bringing in containers from other states and taking Michigan's dimes is technically fraud. In 2011, they'd have had an additional problem, as the state now uses ""reverse vending machines"" to scan barcodes and make sure the container in question is eligible for redemption. Moreover, they might have had to find quite a few stores to redeem their cans. Under Michigan law, retailers have to return $25 worth of deposits per person per day. Retailers are allowed to return larger sums at their own discretion, but they're only required to shell out $25 to each person. Since Kramer and Newman had $500 worth of cans apiece, they might have found themselves hoofing it to 20 different retailers. Mental Floss: Stories behind 11 regional soft drinks . Has anyone actually tried this scam? Oh yeah. In 2007, Michigan State Police ran Operation Can Scam -- no points for creative naming there -- which led to the arraignment of 10 grocers and conspirators. The grocers' scam was pretty much Kramer and Newman's idea on a grander scale: smugglers in Ohio collected millions of cans and sold them to grocers at a discount off the 10-cent redemption value. The grocers then redeemed the deposits for the full dime, and everyone made a profit. At least they did until the law caught wind of the scheme. In the course of making the 10 arrests, the authorities turned up millions of cans and $500,000 in cash. The director of the Michigan State Police told ClickonDetroit.com that similar scams defraud the state of $13 million each year. What happens to any unclaimed dimes? Even though an extremely high percentage of containers are returned, unclaimed deposits still regularly add up to eight-figure sums each year. Three quarters of that money goes into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Trust Fund to pay for environmental programs, while the remainder goes to the retailers.

"Washington (CNN) -- In the most extensive reshaping of the Obama administration's national security team to date, the president will name Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta as his nominee to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary, top U.S. officials said Wednesday. Gen. David Petraeus will be nominated to take over as CIA director, and Lt. Gen. John Allen will succeed Petraeus as head of the U.S-led international military force in Afghanistan, a senior administration official told reporters. In addition, longtime diplomat Ryan Crocker will be nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, the official said. President Barack Obama will formally announce the changes on Thursday, according to the senior administration official. It is the biggest reshaping of Obama's national security team since he took office in January 2009 and reflects a longstanding plan by Gates to step aside this year. More changes also are coming. Both Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and FBI Director Robert Mueller are not eligible for renomination for terms that expire this year. Gates will resign effective June 30, assuming Panetta gets confirmed by Congress in time and is ready to start on July 1, according to an administration official and a congressional aide familiar with phone calls Gates was making to legislators and senior staff members. Petraeus will remain in command in Afghanistan until Allen is ready to take over at the beginning of September, officials said, which could require an interim CIA director if Panetta moves to the defense secretary's office as planned on July 1. In addition, Petraeus will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian CIA director, officials said. Initial reaction from Congress was positive, with key legislators on intelligence and security issues praising both Panetta and Petraeus as good choices. ""The sum total of these picks is that the president has chosen experienced people with unique capabilities to serve our nation at a dangerous time,"" said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. ""This team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer. I could not be more pleased with these selections. I hope these nominees receive swift approval by the United States Senate."" Gates was telling legislators and staff members that he recommended Panetta for his job six months ago, and joked that Panetta stopped speaking to him for days for doing so, the officials said. In addition, Gates was saying that Allen was a consensus choice to succeed Petraeus, according to the officials. It took a meeting with Obama to convince Panetta to accept the job, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Panetta has been happy serving at the CIA, but ""believes strongly in public service and answering the call from the commander-in-chief,"" the source said. Panetta, 72, took over at the CIA in February 2009. He served as chief of staff to President Bill Clinton between 1994 and 1997, and was previously the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The California Democrat served in the House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993. Before coming to the CIA, he spent 10 years co-directing a public policy institute with his wife, Sylvia. He was brought in as a relative outsider, without hands-on intelligence experience, to manage an agency that had been shaken by the exposure and criticism of its controversial interrogation and detention program. Panetta's longstanding ties to Congress were seen as a way to restore the administration's relationship with oversight committees. He has been given high marks on both fronts from inside the agency and in Congress. David Berteau, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Panetta brings several important qualities to the table. He ""learned a lot of lessons"" about defense budgeting during his stint as the head of the OMB, and knows how to deal with a Republican Congress, as he did during the Clinton administration, Berteau said. Panetta's former congressional district in northern California had a huge defense presence, Berteau said. Panetta has earned the trust and confidence of Obama as leader of the CIA, and has name recognition, which is important, Berteau said, adding: ""It's a name Americans recognize. Filling Bob Gates' shoes is really going to be a tough job."" Berteau said the president's choice of Petraeus to lead the CIA indicates that Obama is interested in his national security views and efforts and it ""indicates that the president cares about the way all those pieces fit together."" Earlier this month, Petraeus took a highly unusual step for a military officer when he publicly acknowledged the possibility of being in contention for a presidential appointment. ""It's probably not appropriate for me to comment on whatever might be considered down the road,"" he told reporters in Kabul when asked about the possible CIA nomination. ""I've had discussions, but again, it wouldn't be appropriate to comment."" Petraeus, 58, assumed command of the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and U.S. Forces Afghanistan on July 4, 2010, after serving for more than 20 months as commander of United States Central Command. He previously commanded multi-national forces in Iraq, leading the so-called ""surge."" During his time commanding the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, he oversaw the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. Crocker has served previously as U.S. ambassador to Iraq and to Pakistan, while Allen became deputy commander of U.S. Central Command in July 2008. Gates is the only Cabinet member from the previous administration to stay on when Obama came into office. President George W. Bush nominated Gates as the nation's 22nd secretary of defense in December 2006 to replace Donald Rumsfeld, one of the architects of the Iraq War who was facing widespread criticism. Gates did not expect to stay on after Bush's presidency ended. When asked if he would continue under another administration, Gates said in 2008, ""I learned a long time ago never to say never, so my answer is: The circumstances under which I would do that are inconceivable to me."" But those circumstances arose. In December 2008, then-President-elect Obama expressed a desire for continuity at the Pentagon, given the ongoing conflicts abroad in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I spent a long time hoping the question would never be popped,"" Gates admitted the day after Obama announced his nomination. But, he said, Obama ""impressed"" him. It is unclear who may replace Mueller at the FBI. Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday did not rule out Mueller staying on short-term when his 10-year term expires in September if a successor has not yet been confirmed. Mueller will leave ""hard shoes to fill,"" Holder said. Holder said he has been discussing potential nominees with White House officials, including Vice President Joe Biden. Holder said he believes that if a nominee is selected by May, the administration should have time to get the new director confirmed by August. If that timeline slips, however, the Mueller term would end September 4, one week before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Mueller has often remarked that he barely had a chance to find his desk before the 9/11 attacks occurred, and his entire decade was dominated by the fight against al Qaeda and its scattered supporters at home and abroad.

"(CNN) -- World champion Sebastian Vettel claimed his fifth pole position in six attempts this season after profiting from a crash-affected qualifying session in Monaco on Saturday. The German was outshone by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton in Q1 and Q2, but had set the fastest time of one minute and 13.556 seconds when Q3 was halted for more than half an hour after Mexican rookie Sergio Perez slid into the barriers of the street circuit. Hamilton, the 2008 world champion, had yet to set his flying lap and was unable to do better than seventh following the resumption. The British driver went above Mercedes' Nico Rosberg -- who crashed at the same place as Perez in Saturday's final practice session -- but could lose that spot after running across a chicane in his desperate attempt to move up the grid and attracting the interest of the race stewards. The world's greatest motor race? Perez, who was taken to hospital, is unlikely to race on Sunday after suffering concussion and a leg injury, but his Sauber team said he had escaped serious harm. ""It was with great relief the team received the news that Sergio Perez has no serious injuries after his heavy accident in the closing minutes of the final part of qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix,"" the team said in a statement. ""The reason for the accident will be investigated and the team will update the media as soon as it has any further information."" It was the same barrier that Sauber's Karl Wenglinger hit in 1994, with the Austrian surviving after going into a coma. Hamilton accuses Toro Rosso of helping Red Bull . Vettel leads the championship standings by 41 points from Hamilton, who is the only man to beat him this season -- in China last month. The Red Bull driver bounced back from his runner-up finish in Shanghai to win in Turkey and Spain, and is now favorite to clinch his first victory in Monaco if he can avoid any mistakes as front-runner on the notoriously tricky track. The 23-year-old will start ahead of Hamilton's teammate Jenson Button, who won at Monaco on the way to becoming world champion while at Brawn in 2009. The Englishman clocked a best lap of 1:13.997 to head off 2010 Monaco winner Mark Webber in the second Red Bull (1:14.019) while final practice pacesetter Fernando Alonso of Ferrari was fourth in 1:14.483. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher was fifth in 1:14.682, with the German hoping to equal Ayrton Senna's record of six victories in the principality despite another disappointing season so far for Mercedes. Felipe Massa will start sixth for Ferrari, while Williams' Venezuelan rookie Pastor Maldonado was ninth ahead of the non-finishing Perez. It was a disappointing day for Lotus Renault, who lost a naming-rights law battle with Team Lotus on Friday and then saw Vitaly Petrov and Nick Heidfeld fail to reach Q3. Williams' veteran Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello, four times a runner-up in Monaco, will start 11th behind Russia's Petrov if Perez cannot take to the wheel.","Sergio Perez's crash disrupts final qualifying session for Monaco Grand Prix .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded outside a Catholic church in central Kirkuk, Iraq, early Tuesday, wounding at least 20 people, authorities said. The attack took place in Kirkuk's Shatterlo neighborhood around 5:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. Monday ET), according to a police official who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The wounded included staff from the Holy Family Church and people with homes nearby. The Interior Ministry said 23 people were injured. The explosion damaged the church and a number of nearby houses, police said.  Kirkuk is an ethnically divided city located about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Baghdad. In the past years, extremists have carried out major attacks against churches. An October 31 attack on the Sayidat al-Nejat Cathedral, or Our Lady of Salvation Church, left 70 people dead and 75 wounded, including 51 congregants and two priests. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes a number of Sunni Muslim extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for the Baghdad church siege. Religious minorities, such as Christians and Yazidis, make up less than 5% of Iraq's population, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Since 2003, attacks against these minorities by insurgents and religious extremists have driven more than half of the minorities out of the country, according to UNHCR statistics.","A car bomb targets a church in central Kirkuk .

"(CNN) -- The smiling photos of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords released Sunday, the first of her face since she was shot, capture the congresswoman's resilience, her spokesman said. ""I've seen her approximately once a month since she went to Houston, and every time I hear, I see ... tremendous improvement and I think these pictures really capture the resilience of Gabby Giffords,"" spokesman C.J. Karamargin told CNN. ""She has a positive attitude. She is upbeat. And she is determined to recover as quickly as she can."" The photos, published on Giffords' Facebook page, were taken on May 17 -- the day before she underwent skull surgery at TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, according to a message posted alongside the images. May 17 was also the day after Giffords, D-Arizona, attended the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour. Her husband Mark Kelly was commander of the mission. Rep. Giffords' skull surgery . Taken outside, the photos show the congresswoman relaxed and smiling. She has short hair and is wearing glasses. One photo shows her alone, smiling at the camera; in the other, she is sitting alongside her mother. They are the first photographs of Giffords' face since she was shot in the head in January and show how far she's come since then. Karamargin said Giffords' verbal skills, physical strength and cognitive abilities are improving all the time. But he cautioned the congresswoman still has many challenges ahead. He characterized her recovery as a ""marathon,"" not a sprint. ""People shouldn't get the wrong impression,"" he said. ""The congresswoman suffered a severe injury to one of the most sensitive areas to the human body. Her road to recovery is going to be a long one."" Giffords is expected to leave TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital and begin outpatient therapy in Texas by the end of the month, Karamargin said. Prior to Sunday, Giffords' office had released a photo of just her hand, holding her husband's hand. The photographer responsible for the new pictures said they were taken at the hospital. ""It was very inspiring to see how much she had recovered in 4 1/2 months,"" photographer P.K. Weis of SouthwestPhotoBank.com said in a statement. ""I was excited to see her and to see her smile. She was glad to see me, was in a good mood, smiling and laughing and seemed to enjoy the experience. I certainly did, too."" Weis, who's known the congresswoman for more than a decade, said ""her staff asked me to do it because she wanted someone who was not a stranger -- someone she would be comfortable around."" The Facebook post Sunday quickly filled with dozens of comments and ""likes."" ""She looks remarkably good!"" said Facebook poster Jeffery Haas. ""You are so special,"" another fan, John Evanchik, wrote. ""And you have so much courage and fortitude that I am so proud to say that you are a real role model for so many people who, in their circumstance, they probably give up, but not you, Congresswoman.

"(CNN) -- Some stunning buildings have appeared in American cities the past four years -- buildings, like the Aqua skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois, that attest to the creativity of 21st-century architecture. But there might be fewer of them in the near future, because the recession has forced many architects to tone down their ambition. ""A lot of projects have been delayed, a lot of projects have been scaled back, a lot of projects have been scrapped. ... It's not a time to see a lot of architectural masterpieces being created,"" said Kermit Baker, chief economist of the American Institute of Architects. Baker said the emphasis today is on value. ""I think most buildings that are being built are very much focused on managing cost,"" he said. ""So you tend to see less creativity in that environment, less exciting designs, less upscale materials being used in them."" At Aqua, the curved terraces vary slightly from floor to floor, giving the 82-story tower a soft, billowy look -- as though Chicago's celebrated winds are ruffling its façade. It's an award-winning structure that stands out for its innovative design by Studio Gang Architects. But its construction was well under way before the recession. Now ""we are hearing that there's more renovation work than construction work -- kind of retrofitting existing buildings rather than building new ones,"" Baker said. It might not be the most stimulating work for innovative minds, but at least it's work in what industry experts say has become an intensely competitive market. Where there were once two or three firms competing for a small project, now there are 20 or 30 as larger firms move in to take whatever jobs they can get. The larger firms might ""rather do a skyscraper, but if they can get a much smaller job they will, to keep the firm going and to keep people employed,"" said Robert Campbell, a free-lance architecture critic for The Boston Globe. ""And that drives people out of the field at the bottom who would otherwise have been getting those small jobs."" Many firms have had to lay off employees to stay afloat. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employed architects have dropped from an average of 233,000 in the first quarter of 2008 to 217,000 in the first quarter of 2009 and 198,000 in the first quarter of 2010. George Miller, the president of the AIA and a partner at world-renowned architecture firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, worries about the long-term effects this job shortage will have on the industry. ""It's really difficult, of course in these last several years, for students coming out of school to find appropriate positions in the field,"" he said. ""That really concerns all of us because we're afraid that we're going to lose a generation of architects. ... There are going to be fewer of us around to do the work that really needs to be done in the future."" What will be the architectural work of the future? Miller says it will likely be energy-efficient design and a renewed focus on infrastructure, especially in urban areas. ""We're going to be considering not only the individual building solution, but also the way in which our buildings fit in neighborhoods and communities and regions,"" he said. ""We really have to have a plan now that considers the infrastructure of our communities. ... I think if we're smarter in terms of designing our urban centers, we'll be more efficient in terms of the utilization of our natural and physical resources."" Experts agree that architecture is a cyclical industry and that the market will eventually rebound. The question is when. ""It's always been highs and lows, highs and lows,"" said Campbell, who is also a registered architect. ""I remember in 1975 I was working for a prominent firm in Harvard Square, and we dropped from 68 [employees] to 20. And that was the oil embargo, '74, and that led to an extremely steep recession but a short one -- not like this one that's lasted so long."" Some architects think recovery might be around the corner. ""We are seeing the private sector picking up,"" said Thomas Fridstein, head of global architecture for AECOM, a provider of technical and management support services. ""I feel like we've been through the worst, we've sort of hit the trough of the recession and things are on the upturn. We've had some major commercial clients contacting us about projects potentially starting up again, so that's a very positive sign."" It's a positive sign for the nation, too, because busy architects are a bellwether of economic stability. ""If you don't design it, you can't build it,"" Baker said. ""So [architects] are really the first step in the process toward seeing a recovery.""","Many architecture firms have laid off workers because of the recession .
Projects are tough to come by, and they're often conservative in scope .
America could ""lose a generation of architects,"" one industry expert fears .

"(Mashable) -- At Wednesday's announcement of Google's +1, the company was coy about comparing its experimental product to the longstanding Facebook Like button. But in the two companies' ongoing battle for ad dollars, +1 is a clear shot across Facebook's bow. Let's follow the money for a moment. Both companies get most of their revenue from advertising. They pitch their ad services based on their ability to serve highly targeted ads that get good results for brands and businesses. They are able to target ads based on the data they gather about users. But here's the main difference: Facebook gathers data based on user-submitted profile information. Google has to rely on roundabout ways to get data for ad targeting. And some of those methods, including cookies that track browsing behavior, are coming under fire from citizens and governments. As you can see from the chart below, Google has a lot to worry about when it comes to competing with Facebook for ad dollars. Google commands 12.6% of the annual $10.1 billion U.S. online ad spend; Facebook trumps that figure by nine full percentage points. New user acquisition . Google's +1 buttons will soon appear in Google Search, one of the most widely used services on the Internet. And clicking them will require the user to have a Google profile. As Google's Manager of Global Communications Jim Prosser told us in an email, ""We think it's important for users to know who they are seeing +12 s from, which is why we have the upgrade or creation of a Google profile as part of the flow of a user's first +1."" Facebook profiles are more or less de rigeur for anyone with an Internet connection. Meanwhile, Google Profiles -- and most of Google's other social products, such as Hotpot and Buzz --have mostly remained in the rarefied domain of the digerati. Making a Google Profile a requirement for those addictive little +1 buttons is a smart move on Google's part. It may not match Facebook's 500 million-strong membership when the feature rolls out to all users, but it has a good shot at vastly increasing levels of profile adoption. Facebook's critical mass of users has been one of the things that's allowed it to succeed in capturing more ad spend that Google. Even though it is a closed, unsearchable system, Facebook has the sheer number of users and amount of behavioral and demographic data to sweep up ad dollars no matter what. Data gathering for ad targeting . If Google's +1 does lead to a larger number of Google Profiles, Google will have even more personal and demographic data than it currently does about web users. Right now, Facebook has the ability to offer extremely highly targeted ads because of the kinds of data it gathers about its users. It knows whether you're single or not, it knows your gender and sexual orientation, where you work, where you live and a great deal more. Advertisers are very excited about being able to narrow their campaigns' scope by such finely tuned variables. If Google could get more profiles, it could increase the accuracy of its targeting beyond keywords and browsing data, potentially matching Facebook's level of personal relevance. With the push toward Do Not Track features, including a new privacy bill introduced in the U.S. Congress, who knows how long cookie-based browsing-data gathering will last? In short, Google needs other ways to gather data to target ads, and it needs huge amounts of this data very quickly. What better way to do this than by introducing a compelling search product with a social prerequisite? Whether better-targeted ads from Google will positively impact clickthrough rates and inspire further advertiser confidence remains to be seen. Currently, clickthrough rates for Google AdSense and AdWords campaigns vary widely, with around 30% of advertisers in a SearchEngineRoundtable survey reporting rates of 1% or less. Facebook ads might be underperforming the industry standard of 1%, as well. Socially driven recommendation engines . Facebook Likes are already recognized by brands and businesses as a measurable marketing tool, and Facebook itself has been embraced as a legitimate marketing platform. Likes can act as a social recommendation engine between friends, and these recommendations count a lot when it comes to making purchase decisions. In fact, in a recent survey from Nielsen, 90% of respondents said they had some degree of trust in a recommendation from a friend or family member. Those recommendations count more than consumer reviews or branded websites. In other words, a Facebook Like could count for more than a banner ad when it comes to moving product -- and the Like is free media. Once Google has its +1 wheels in motion, the feature stands to become a social recommendation engine, as well, but a more targeted one. On Facebook, you see Likes for brands, photos, and posts that have nothing to do with you. But on Google, you see personal recommendations for products and places you're actively seeking out. It's a powerful concept, and advertisers will surely want to optimize for that situation. Prosser notes, ""While we can't speak to what other products are doing, we think there's a great deal of value in surfacing personal recommendations and endorsements where they're most valuable, in search ... We've really focused on relevance. When you +1 something, you know your friends will find it in search, but you won't be pushing a notification to everyone."" As DeepFocus CEO Ian Schafer told us Wednesday, ""When someone is searching for a piece of information about a product, a review, or insightful commentary, it is typically a very insular activity,"" says Schafer. ""But being able to place a 'seal of approval' next to a search result may have the effect of making a typically insular activity more collaborative -- hopefully improving the 'algorithm' through the quality of your connections."" Search algorithms . The other interesting piece of the puzzle is the SEO question. Google came at search in the 1990s with an algorithmic approach that put it head and shoulders above contemporary UGC engines. Now, it's turning back the clock and allowing user feedback to drive search results once again. Does this mean algorithmic web search has failed? Will user-driven search data be just as gaming-prone as algorithms are? Google communications manager Jake Hubert wrote to us in an email, ""We rely on a fundamentally algorithmic approach to search quality because this is the most scalable way to answer more than a billion search queries each day, many of which we've never seen before, in more than a hundred languages. Google's algorithm is constantly evolving and improving. For example, in 2010 alone we experimented with more than 6,000 changes and launched 490. ""Google will study the clicks on +1 buttons as another ranking signal. As with any new ranking signal, we'll be starting carefully and learning how the signal is related to quality."" As users begin to see these +1s from friends and others as recommendations in search results, the results will likely become more personalized and hopefully more relevant. And when it comes to search, Facebook Likes -- an unindexed piece of data in a closed network -- don't count for a hill of beans. Who will win the war? Which company will end up with the most users, the most data, the best targeting and the most profit? The answer to that question largely depends on whether +1 can successfully change the game, whether this innocuous little button is actually Google's first killer social product. But regardless, online ad spend is hardly a zero sum game, and both of these companies are setting themselves up for a long-term, multilateral tug of war to capture as much of that market as possible. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(Mashable) -- Sir Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony, accidentally told everyone in the world that his company will be supplying image sensors for Apple's iPhone 5. In an interview late Friday with the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg, the Sony chief was talking about earthquake damage to 15 of the Sony's factories in Japan, and inadvertently mentioned that a camera sensor made in one of those plants is on its way to Apple, and that sensor would be delayed because of the quake and tsunami. Stringer didn't specifically say that Sony is building an 8-megapixel image sensor that will go into the iPhone 5, but since Sony is currently not manufacturing any image sensors for Apple, this confirmed that Sony plans to supply components of the iPhone 5. This points to the distinct possibility that in the iPhone 5, Apple will no longer be using those OmniVision 5-megapixel image sensors currently inside the iPhone 4. This is supported by an analyst's report from February of this year saying that OmniVision might lose out on supplying cameras for the iPhone 5 because OmniVision's 8-megapixel sensor won't be ready for the iPhone 5's rumored mid-summer launch. Because Stringer was talking about the irony of supplying the company's best camera to Apple, we can only surmise that he was talking about an 8-megapixel sensor. Here's what The Wall Street Journal wrote about Stringer's quote when reporting on its own event this morning: . Early on, he raised the irony of Sony supplying camera components for Apple devices. It ""always puzzles me,"" he said. ""Why would I make Apple the best camera?"" It is unclear what devices he was talking about as Sony isn't known to supply key camera components, known as image sensors, to Apple; A Sony spokeswoman declined to comment and an Apple spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment. Stringer's inadvertent slip also lends credence to the rumors of a delayed release of the iPhone 5. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona head coach Josep Guardiola hit back at his Real Madrid counterpart Jose Mourinho ahead of the European Champions League semifinal first leg between the two teams on Wednesday. The tie at Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu will be the third of four matches between the arch rivals, clashes which are known as ""El Clasico"", in 18 days across three competitions. Real recently defeated Spanish first division leaders Barca 1-0 in the Copa del Rey final on April 20 and it is comments made by Mourinho in the wake of that match which aggravated Guardiola. ""Since he has chosen to to talk about me, I'll do the same,"" former club captain Guardiola said on Barcelona's official web site. Is Jose Mourinho the master of mind games? ""[Wednesday] we'll face each other on the pitch. He's won his games off the pitch and I'll give him his personal Champions [League] for that -- just take it home and enjoy it."" Portuguese boss Mourinho used his press conference ahead of the match to accuse Guardiola, 40, of criticizing referees when they make correct decisions. The former Inter Milan coach's comments related to the Copa del Rey final, in which Barca had a goal from Spain forward Pedro correctly disallowed for offside. ""There have been two groups of managers up until now,"" the one-time Chelsea coach Mourinho told Real's official web site. ""A quiet one who doesn't talk about referees and a louder one, such as myself, that criticizes the referees when they make significant mistakes. ""We have entered a new era following the statements made by Guardiola and there is now a third group. He is the only one in it as he criticizes the right calls made by referees. I had never seen anything like it before."" According to British newspaper The Guardian, Guardiola responded in strong fashion and said: ""In this room [Real's press room], he is the chief, the f*****g man. In here he is the f*****g man and I can't compete with him. ""If Barcelona want someone who competes with that, then they should look for another manager. But we, as a person and an institution, don't do that."" Guardiola, who was a Barca player when Mourinho was part of the club's coaching staff between 1996 and 2000, was unhappy with his opponent alleging he had targeted match officials. ""I simply congratulated Madrid after the [Copa del Rey] final. If you think that his allegation that I always complain about the referees is true after you've all heard me over the last three years, well there's nothing I can do. ""Off the pitch, against his media supporters, there's nothing we can do to fight that. I've seen it before with Mourinho, he did it at Chelsea and now he's doing it here."" The Catalan club, who are three-time European champions, will be without Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta for the first match of the last-four tie. The 26-year-old, who scored the winner for his country in the 2010 World Cup final against Netherlands, is out with an injury to his right calf, but club captain Carles Puyol should be fit for the match. Real have won Europe's premier club competition on nine occasions, but will be without Sami Khedira for Wednesday's clash after the Germany international suffered a leg injury. Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho will also miss the match through suspension.

When Morgan asked Colfer what celebrity icons he looked up to as a kid, the actor said that while he mostly inspired himself along the way and didn't latch on to heroes, ""everyone wants to be Lady Gaga at one point or the other."" When Morgan argued that he has never wanted to be Lady Gaga, Colfer countered, ""Now you're lying. Everyone wants to be Lady Gaga."" Colfer admitted that he's always wanted to be Oprah Winfrey, proclaiming, ""Who wouldn't want to be Oprah Winfrey, are you kidding? If you don't want to be Oprah Winfrey, there's something wrong with you."" When Morgan pointed out that Colfer and his ""Glee"" character, Kurt, are looked up to by kids who are being bullied, the actor opened up about the bullying he endured as a child. When Morgan asked Colfer if his Golden Globe win was ""this wonderful moment of payback,"" Colfer joked, ""Now, there's a diplomatic answer that I could give, but... ."" When Morgan asked for a straight answer, Colfer responded, ""Yes! Oh, God, yes! Yes! And those individuals, I just -- it's almost like you want to say, 'Suck it' to them, like, right there."" The bullying didn't stop with ""Glee,"" as Colfer admitted that he stopped Googling himself altogether as of September 2009 after reading hurtful, often homophobic statements that he referred to as ""high school all over again."" Morgan asked Colfer, who attended the White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 30, what happened when he met right-wing politicians at the dinner who vote against gay rights. ""Oh, everyone loves 'Glee,'"" exclaimed Colfer. ""Everyone loves 'Glee.' Everyone loves me in 'Glee,' and it's hysterical."" ""And you know that,"" said Morgan. ""You quietly know they're all voting against gay rights."" Colfer told Morgan that while he is aware that many of the political leaders who request photo-ops with him do vote against gay rights, he gladly poses for pictures with them regardless, in the hopes that the next time a gay-related issue comes along, they don't say, ""No, that gay kid from 'Glee' didn't give me a picture, I'm going to vote no. Take that."" ""When people believe so strongly against you,"" stated Colfer, ""yet they want proof that they met you -- it's kind of awesome."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(Wired) -- The Mac App Store has launched, freshly stocked with over 1,000 OS X applications. The store comes as part of an OS X update, version 10.6.6, and is a standalone application rather than being yet another add-on to the already creaking and bloated iTunes. The store works a lot like the iOS App Store we know already: You sign in with your Apple I.D and then you can shop. Buy a Mac app and the payment is charged to your registered credit card account, and the app downloads automatically and is placed in the applications folder, with a convenient shortcut placed in the dock (the icon actually leaps from the Store window and lands in the dock -- neat). This is clearly aimed at novice users who may never have actually downloaded and installed third-party software before, and the interface will be instantly familiar to anyone who has used the App Store in iTunes or on an iPad. That said, there is plenty for power-users, too. Apple's flagship photo-editing software, Aperture, is in the store for just $80. You can still buy it from the conventional Apple Store, but it'll cost the usual $200. That's quite a saving. The iWork office suite is in there, too, although it remains the '09 version, not a new '11 update many were hoping for. The three iWork apps, Pages, Numbers and Keynote, cost $20 apiece, a saving on the usual $80 bundle price. If you already have these installed on your Mac, the App Store detects this and shows them as ""installed"", just like on the iPad. There are also free apps -- the slick new Twitter, for example, which is the long awaited v2.0 of Tweetie for Mac -- as well as some old favorites (""Angry Birds"" is quite something on a 27-inch iMac screen). There are no trials in the Mac App Store, and submissions are subject to strict rules, just like the iOS store. It appears that some of these can be waived, though. Twitter is clearly using custom, non standard user interface elements and it is featured on the front page. Apple is clearly playing somewhat by its own rules here, too. No trial versions are are allowed in the store, so developers have to host them on their own sites. Apple has abided, and the trial for the iWork suite is on the main Apple site . I predict that the store is going to be huge. It has the same kid-in-a-candy-store addictive qualities of the iPhone and iPad stores, along with a few features missing from the mobile versions. On the Mac, for example, all your purchases are listed under a tab in the top toolbar. Finally, here's a tip: Up in the Apple menu, on the top left of your screen, you'll see a new entry called ""App Store."" This replaces the old ""Mac OS X Software"" which has quietly been retired.

"(Mashable) -- Amazon has just entered the streaming music business with the launch of Cloud Player, a music player that lets anyone upload their music to Amazon's servers and play them via the web or Android. The new Cloud Player service adds a new ""Save to Amazon Cloud Drive"" button for saving MP3s to the cloud, as well as an option to upload music from a hard drive to a user's Cloud Drive. Users are given 5 GB of free storage, but can get 20 GB if they purchase an album through Amazon. It's $1 per GB after that. Cloud Player comes in two flavors, an app for the web and an Android app counterpart. Both players allow users to upload their music, create playlists and organize their music. And because it's a cloud-based platform, users can access their music and settings from any compatible computer or Android device. The most comparable service to Cloud Drive is probably Grooveshark, which also lets you upload your music, though Amazon has several major advantages in its MP3 store, its longstanding payment system and its stronger brand recognition. Google and Apple have been rumored to be hard at work on their own cloud-based players, but it looks like Amazon beat them to the punch. Amazon's Cloud Player will certainly face a stiff challenge when they launch their own streaming music services, especially given Google's control over Android and Apple's control over iPhone and iTunes. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(Fast Company)  -- According to a study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, nearly half of all 12-year-olds in the U.S. are using social network sites, despite not meeting the minimum age requirements for sites like Facebook. And such popularity only balloons once the teens grow older: roughly 64% of 13-year-olds are social networking; between the ages of 14 to 17, that figure jumps to 82%, says Pew. But that doesn't mean Facebook isn't trying to stop kids from becoming addicted to the network at such a young age (though indoctrination does have its benefits!). According to a report by the Daily Telegraph, Facebook is kicking out roughly 20,000 underage users per day. In a meeting with Australia's cyber-safety committee, Facebook's chief privacy adviser Mozelle Thompson agreed that underage users were taking advantage of the site. After all, any user no matter his or her age can register for the site by simply lying when signing up -- Facebook has no mechanisms to detect whether a teen is telling the truth or not. Fast Company: Facebook map of the world . ""It's not perfect,"" said Thompson. However, Facebook's privacy czar did argue that Facebook is trying to stop these young'ins from continuing to use the site. ""There are people who lie. There are people who are under 13 [accessing Facebook],"" Thompson said. ""Facebook removes 20,000 people a day, people who are underage."" Of course, that's a fraction of the nearly 600 million users on Facebook, but underage users have become a growing concern for the network, especially as it faces increased pressure from regulators -- whether in Australia or the U.S. Fast Company: Most innovative companies -- Facebook . Last April, Senators Franken, Bennet, and Schumer penned a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over privacy issues related to collecting the personal data of users. This month, Sen. Franken stepped up pressure on the world's largest network, with support from even more Congressional colleagues. This time the focus was specifically on ""users between 13 to 17 years of age."" ""Facebook's new privacy policy would endanger the privacy and safety of children as young as 13. Under Facebook's policy, 13 million users under the age of 18 may be allowed to share their personal information just like adult users,"" Franken argued. ""These younger users are the most vulnerable to predators on Facebook and the rest of the Internet and it should be impossible for them to inadvertently share their phone numbers and home addresses with anyone."" And that's not even taking into consideration the users who are younger than 13. Copyright © 2010 FastCompany.com, a unit of Mansueto Ventures, LLC.

"New York (CNN) -- Trees toppled and streets flooded Sunday morning as Irene lashed some of the biggest cities in the Northeast with wind gusts and torrential rains. Even as Irene weakened to a tropical storm, authorities in the region warned that its impact was not waning. ""We're not out of the woods yet. Irene remains a large and potentially dangerous storm,"" U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters. Officials said the storm had knocked out power to more than 4 million people and was responsible for at least 15 deaths in six states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said flooding in his state was widespread and advised residents to stay indoors. Streets in downtown Millburn, New Jersey, saw major flooding when the Rahway River overflowed early Sunday morning, said Lt. Peter Eakley, the town's deputy emergency management coordinator. ""It's crazy. ... The water is moving between buildings, up, down, all sorts of different directions,"" Rich Graessle told CNN's iReport. In New York City's lower Manhattan, the Hudson River overflowed, sending massive amounts of water spilling over jogging paths and pouring into at least one nearby apartment building. Water also lapped over the banks of the city's East River early Sunday, but later receded. CNN affiliate WCBS reported serious flooding in Brooklyn. Irene left streets looking barren and desolate in ""the city that never sleeps."" Shelves upon empty shelves greeted shoppers at stores. Caution tape barricaded the turnstiles at subway stops. But the flooding's greatest impact may be far from view, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told CNN. ""The challenge of New York is that so much of the electricity and other infrastructure is below the surface,"" he said. That means flooding could bring life in the city to a standstill even after waters recede, he said. The threat of flooding extended beyond New York City. Outside Philadelphia, waters had already climbed to street-sign levels in Darby, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said, sending ""couches, furniture, all kinds of stuff floating down the street."" Waves pounded the shoreline in Long Beach, New York, as water poured underneath the boardwalk and into the city's downtown area. By 11 a.m. ET Sunday, Tropical Storm Irene had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm was moving inland over southeastern New York state and heading northeast toward New England. Even as winds decreased, the hurricane center warned that an ""extremely dangerous storm surge"" was expected in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and parts of Long Island, New York. The storm slammed into Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey, as a Category 1 hurricane around 5:30 a.m., the hurricane center said, hitting cities along the coast as it hurtled toward New York City. While most New Yorkers stayed holed up in their apartments, officials and residents in states further south began taking stock of the damage Irene left behind. Authorities in Ocean City, Maryland, reopened the evacuated city. ""It was a long night last night, but I can tell you, we dodged a missile here at Ocean City,"" Mayor Rick Meehan told reporters. While Irene dumped 12 inches of rain by early Sunday morning, there was no major flooding. The maximum storm surge coincided with low tide, preventing the flooding that had been feared. Timing ""made a significant difference,"" Meehan said. But flooding remained a concern in many areas, said Craig Fugate, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""Assessments are still coming in,"" Fugate said Sunday morning, noting that Virginia reported particularly high rainfalls. Powerful gusts were so strong in some states that pedestrians struggled to stay upright. Storm surges along the East Coast turned at least one beach into an extension of the ocean. Two buildings collapsed in Philadelphia, Nutter told reporters, but no one was injured. A nuclear power reactor in Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, automatically went offline late Saturday after a piece of aluminum siding from a building struck a transformer amid strong winds. ""The facility is safe; there is no impact to employees or our neighbors,"" said Mark Sullivan, spokesman for the Constellation Energy Nuclear Group. ""There is no threat."" Officials have blamed at least 15 deaths across the affected region on Irene -- one each in Connecticut, Maryland and Florida, two in New Jersey, six in North Carolina and four in Virginia. A 55-year-old male surfer died around noon in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, and a woman in Queenstown, Maryland, died after a tree knocked a chimney through the roof of her home, officials said. Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy said downed wires appear to be to blame for one fatality in his state. Irene first made landfall in the United States Saturday in North Carolina near Cape Lookout at the southern end of the Outer Banks. It stomped across the state for most of the day. The storm ripped off roofs, toppled trees, induced ""massive flooding"" near the coast and brought down power lines statewide, according to the state emergency management division. The hurricane unleashed 10 to 14 inches of rain over much of North Carolina and pushed a 4-foot storm surge into the Chesapeake Bay, the National Hurricane Center said. As of midnight Saturday, Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, had endured 31 hours of nonstop rainfall. Reports of tornadoes came from several states, including North Carolina and Virginia -- but a final determination will have to be made by the National Weather Service. CNN's Tom Cohen, Rob Marciano, Ali Velshi, Soledad O'Brien, Rose Arce, Jeanne Meserve, Chris Boyette, David Mattingly, Susan Candiotti, Chris Lawrence, Jason Carroll, John Zarrella, Kimberly Segal, Sarah Hoye, Poppy Harlow, Holly Yan, Kristina Sgueglia, Eden Pontz, Gregory Clary and Elizabeth Cherneff contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities say at least 15 have died in six states due to the storm .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly 200,000 U.S.-supplied rifles and pistols meant for Iraqi security forces are unaccounted for in Iraq, according to a report to Congress. Loose record-keeping caused the Pentagon and the U.S. command in Iraq to lose track of about 110,000 AK-47 rifles and 80,000 pistols provided to the new Iraqi national police and army, the Government Accountability Office told Congress. The investigative arm of Congress, the GAO also found that 250,000 pieces of body armor and helmets can't be accounted for. The report also says a review of the 2007 property books shows continuing problems with missing and incomplete records. The report, issued July 31, follows an October accounting by the Defense Department's special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, which put the number of weapons missing at close to 500,000. Auditors were unable to determine whether the weapons -- which included heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers -- were stolen, being used by insurgents or still in the hands of Iraqi units. A Pentagon official in Baghdad, who asked not to be identified, said some of the weapons went back to Iraqi forces and some were destroyed. But he conceded some of them may be missing. Asked whether they ended up in the hands of insurgents, he said there was no hard data, but ""anything is possible."" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Monday he is not aware of any reports that show U.S. weapons designated for Iraqi security forces have been found in the hands of insurgents. The missing weapons mostly dated back to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's rule, and none had serial numbers, the official said. Coalition commanders have tightened procedures for tracking the weapons, including using biometric data from Iraqi soldiers and police -- and since June, Iraqi units have been issued U.S.-made M-16 and M-4 rifles, which are electronically tracked, the official said. Officials with the U.S. training command blamed insufficient staff and the lack of a ""fully operational distribution network"" for the poor record-keeping, the GAO report states. Coalition trainers did not keep centralized records of the equipment they issued to Iraqi police and troops before December 2005, and the coalition ""has not consistently collected supporting documents that confirm when the equipment was received, the quantities of equipment delivered, or the Iraqi units receiving the equipment."" The report said the U.S. commander in charge of training Iraqi forces reported about 185,000 AK-47 rifles, 170,000 pistols, 215,000 items of body armor, and 140,000 helmets were issued to Iraqi security forces as of September 2005, while the accounting books from the U.S. military contained records for only about 75,000 AK-47 rifles, 90,000 pistols, 80,000 items of body armor, and 25,000 helmets. The GAO recommended the Pentagon set accountability standards for the training program and make sure it has adequate staff and technology to oversee the program. The GAO also recommended the Secretary of Defense determine what DOD accountability procedures should apply to the program and ensure sufficient staff, functioning distribution networks, and proper technology are available to meet the requirements. The Defense Department concurred with the recommendations and has begun a review ""to ensure proper accountability is in place for the Iraq train-and-equip program,"" the report states. Pentagon officials said Monday the accounting systems should be ""continuously improved upon and refined."" According to the report the United States has provided $19.2 billion to develop the Iraqi security forces and the United States has asked for another $2 billion to continue training and equipping Iraqi troops.

"(Mashable)  -- Facebook released a new version of its Questions feature on Thursday, the result of nearly a year of beta testing. The new version of Questions takes the focus off public inquiries (a service already dominated by Q&A sites like Quora) and instead focuses on soliciting recommendations from friends. ""There are a lot of places you can go on the internet to ask questions of people who you don't know, but there are very few places you can go to get responses from your friends,"" said Adrian Graham, a project manager for Questions. ""We thought that this is where we should focus."" The updated version will be rolled out to current testers first. When they start asking questions, the feature will automatically be pushed to their friends. Those who don't want to wait for a friend to ask a question on their profile in order to use the new feature can download it here. For now, the feature is only available in English. Here's a quick look at the new product: . Asking a question . When asking a question, users have an option to create a poll with restricted answers or one that allows anybody to add answers. The latter option is helpful if, for instance, they want to ask their friends for restaurant recommendations. Generally, this type of question only requires a short answer, but it's not as though there are a limited number of options. Friends can add their favorite restaurants to the answer list easily, and if they have something else to say can write it in an attached comment section. For questions that don't work with a poll format (i.e. ""Can we have a long discussion about the meaning of life?""), this comment section becomes the answer section. When we last checked in on the product in July, wall posts about Questions merely referenced isolated pages where friends could respond. Now questions can be answered and commented on within newsfeeds and profile pages. When a friend participates, the question is also posted to his or her profile page. Hypothetically, a compelling question could spread to every Facebook user in this way. Answering a question . As users respond, each option's box fills to reflect its popularity. This way, viewers see the poll questions and results at the same time. Facebook also displays the profile photos of respondents next to the options they select. More on social media from Mashable . When users are adding an option to a poll-style question, Facebook prepopulates a drop-down menu with corresponding Facebook pages. One of these pages can be tacked to the answer so that other users can see a preview window of that page. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

Remember 'The Marriage Ref,' 'The Singing Bee,' 'Grease: You're the One That I Want?' All premiered big, but then fell off a cliff... "" Well, last night's second episode of ""The Voice"" not only didn't tumble, it climbed up the mountain a little higher. ""The Voice"" was seen by 12.4 million viewers and had a 5.6 preliminary rating among adults 18-49. That's up 10 percent from last week's premiere, which broke NBC records. Here's how unusual this is: ""The Voice"" is the only new show this season on a major broadcast network whose ratings rose for its second episode. The big question now is whether ""The Voice"" will continue its winning streak when the coaches ditch the swivel chairs and start the ""battle rounds"" next week. (See exclusive pics of the coaches and their new teams here). ""Biggest Loser"" (7.4 million, 2.6) opened the night. As the runner-up, CBS had ""NCIS"" (17.3 million, 3.5) glaring at spin-off ""NCIS: LA"" (14 million, 2.9). Both were down about 10 percent, followed by ""The Good Wife"" (12.2 million, 2.4), raising a nice 20 percent. On third-place Fox, ""Glee"" (8.6 million, 3.6) rose 6 percent from last week's season low, followed by ""Raising Hope"" (4.9 million, 1.9) and ""Traffic Light"" (3.0 million, 1.2). Then there was ABC with ""Dancing With the Stars"" results (15.6 million, 2.9), getting crushed by ""The Voice"" in the demo, down 19 percent. At 10 p.m., ""Body of Proof"" (10.4 million, 2.0) slipped 9 percent. The CW had ""One Tree Hill"" (1.2 million, 0.6) falling to a series low, and ""Hellcats"" (1 million, 0.4) tying its low.

"(Mental Floss.com) -- You might be planning a weekend camping trip with your family or friends. As you stuff your car with all the necessary equipment, take a moment to reflect on the fascinating history of some of those must-have camping accessories. 1. Duffel bag . While rucksacks have been around for hundreds (if not thousands) of years, they were usually made from animal skins or wool, which only did so much to protect contents from the harsh elements. But Spanish and Portuguese sailors of the early 17th century hit on a better solution. They found that bags made from the leftover scraps of fabric used to repair a ship's sails did a fine job against rain and seawater. This coarse, sturdy, waterproof material was imported from its one supplier in the town of Duffel, Belgium. 2. Flashlight . When D cell batteries became commercially available in 1896, it opened the door for all kinds of battery-powered inventions. One was the ""electrical hand torch,"" introduced in 1898 by the American Electrical Novelty and Manufacturing Company, which would later change its name to The American Ever-Ready Company. The first lights were paper and fiber tubes, with a carbon filament bulb covered by a lens on one end, two D batteries inside, and a metal ring on the side. Pressing down on the ring caused it to hit two metal poles -- one positive and one negative -- which completed the electrical connection, lighting up the bulb. Early batteries were quite weak, though, so the light only came on in brief flashes before going out again, which is how they got their nickname, ""flashlights."" Heavy use of the light also meant that it had to be ""rested"" so that the batteries could recharge. Still, it was much better than carrying a candle that could go out, a lantern that had to be refilled with oil, and, more importantly, there was no chance of starting a fire. As battery and filament technologies improved, the flashlights could stay on for minutes at a time, but the name had already become synonymous, so it stuck (in America and Canada anyway; the rest of the world still calls them ""torches""). While the lights were fairly popular, sales really skyrocketed in 1898 when Ever-Ready donated their new and improved metal flashlights to the New York City Police Department. When officers reported how useful the lights were in their duties, these testimonies were included in the company's product catalog, adding weight to the quality and usefulness of the brand. Mental Floss: The origin of the Boy Scouts . 3. Sleeping bag . The modern sleeping bag was influenced by a number of different sources. In the 1850s, French officials who patrolled the mountains had a knapsack bag made of sheepskin and lined with wool that could be rolled up and buckled in place, then carried with shoulder straps. Then, in 1861, Alpine explorer Francis Fox Tuckett tested a prototype sleeping bag made from a blanket with a waterproof rubber bottom. Both of these designs were little more than an open-ended man-sized bag, so getting in and out for a late-night bathroom break was a bit of a hassle, but it got the job done. A more convenient design came from Welsh inventor and father of the mail order business model, Pryce Pryce-Jones. In 1876, he introduced the Euklisia Rug. The Rug consisted of a wool blanket with an off-center pocket at the top for a sewn-in, inflatable, rubber pillow. Once inside, you folded the blanket over and fastened it together to keep you snug as a bug. P.J., as he called himself, had produced 60,000 Rugs exclusively for the Russian Army; many were used in the 1877 Siege of Plevna during the Russo-Turkish War. However, when the city fell, the Russians canceled the rest of their order, leaving P.J. with 17,000 Rugs left undelivered. He quickly added the Euklisia Rug to his catalog and sold it as an inexpensive bedding solution for charities working with the poor. The rug caught on, and it was soon being used by the British Army and Australians camping in the Outback, too. No known examples of the Euklisia Rug exist today, but in 2010, the BBC commissioned a replica made from the original patent as part of a special TV series called ""A History of the World."" They donated the recreation to a museum in Powys County in Wales, where Pryce-Jones lived. 4. Air mattress . The first air mattress was invented in 1889 by the Pneumatic Mattress & Cushion Company in Reading, Massachusetts. Surprisingly, the design of the mattress has remained virtually unchanged over the last 120 years, closely resembling the standard air mattress used for lounging in the swimming pool today. The rubber mattresses were originally produced as an alternative to hair-filled mattresses on Atlantic steamships because they could be deflated and stowed easily, and could even be used as a life raft if needed. The mattresses' easy storage was also a big selling point for landlubbers who, in the early part of the 20th century, moved out of the country and into one-room city apartments where space was limited. To sell their inflatable mattress, the company offered a 30-day trial period, a tactic still used today by many mattress retailers. If you didn't love your pneumatic mattress, you could return it for a full refund of $22 for the adult version, or $11 for the baby crib-sized version. Mental Floss: How Teddy Roosevelt got Abe Lincoln's hair . 5. Leatherman tool . Ask any outdoorsman, farmer, EMT, computer technician or soldier to give up his Leatherman Multi-tool and you'll likely be told, ""You can pry it from my cold, dead hands."" Fans of the handy gadget are dedicated to the multi-tool thanks to its compact size, versatility, and quality construction. But just what is a ""Leatherman"" anyway? Is it a nickname given to rough and tumble mountain men in the 19th Century? Maybe they were soldiers that were part of a special brigade that fought in the Civil War? Nope. It's a guy. His name's Tim. When Tim Leatherman, a mechanical engineer, and his wife were traveling through Europe in 1975, their rented Fiat kept breaking down. Tim was pretty handy, but he found that his old Scout knife, which had a couple of blades, a can opener, and a flat head screwdriver, simply wasn't enough tool to keep the old car running. So, using cardboard cutouts, and then later making a metal prototype in his garage workshop, he developed what he called a ""multi-tool"" that he thought would change the world. Unfortunately, the world wasn't too impressed. Tim tried to sell the idea to knife companies, but they said it was more like a tool. Tool companies said it wasn't a tool, but a ""gadget,"" so they weren't interested, either. Tim eventually decided to make and sell the Leatherman on his own, but still couldn't find anyone to carry it in their stores. Finally, in 1983, he convinced a mail-order catalog to sell his ""Sportsmen"" multi-tool. Tim had the resources to produce as many as 4,000 Leatherman multi-tools. He received 30,000 orders in his first year. 6. Sterno . If starting a campfire isn't your strong suit, it never hurts to have some Sterno, the flammable gel in a can, within reach. This ""canned heat"" has been around since 1893 and takes its unusual name from the company's founder, S. Sternau. The product really hit its stride during World War I, when the Sternau Company ran a marketing campaign suggesting soldiers going to Europe could use Sterno to heat water and rations, sterilize surgical instruments, and provide light and warmth in the cold, dark trenches. Soon, just about every Doughboy had a few cans in his duffel bag. Mental Floss: 7 alternative uses for beer . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- The site of a deadly truck-train collision east of Reno, Nevada, remained shut Saturday as federal accident investigators examined the scene, a state trooper said. Two people died in the Friday morning accident, Trooper Dan Lopez of the Nevada Highway Patrol confirmed Saturday morning. The highway patrol could not be reached later Saturday. Amtrak said Friday it had reports that at least one passenger, an Amtrak train crew member and the operator of the truck died. The National Transportation Safety Board would not comment on the death toll Saturday. It was not immediately clear how many people were injured when a tractor-trailer slammed into the Chicago-to-California Amtrak passenger train at a railroad crossing near Lovelock, Nevada. Amtrak said that numerous people aboard the train had been taken to area hospitals for treatment. Amateur video taken after the crash showed huge plumes of black smoke billowing from the train as a fire burned. Passengers and crew members stood outside. One voice on the video can be heard telling people to get away from the smoke. Another tells a woman, out of view, to ""hang and jump."" A third voice asks someone, ""Are you OK?"" ""Next thing I know, we get hit by something. A big ball of fire comes in. I jumped out the window,"" passenger Justin Rhine told CNN affiliate KOLO-TV in Reno. ""I saw people flying on the other side of the train."" The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched investigators within hours of the accident, the agency said. The NTSB has scheduled a press briefing for 9:30 p.m. PT. Saturday. Spokesman Nicholas Worrell declined to comment on the case before then. The truck struck the train, which was on its way to Emeryville, California, at 11:20 a.m., Amtrak said in a statement. The train was carrying 204 passengers and 14 crew members, the company said.","Nevada Highway Patrol confirms two deaths in truck-train collision .

"(Mashable) -- Apple's production partners are already hard at work on the new model of iPad, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The fact that Apple is working on an iPad 2, of course, is common knowledge. The famously tight-lipped company rarely talks about upcoming product launches, and isn't talking now. But Apple has never denied that it intends to follow up on one of its most successful products. Nearly $5 billion worth of iPads have been sold in the three quarters since its launch. And a quick glance at the history of the iPhone, which launches a new model every year, suggests that we should expect to see the iPad 2 right around the first anniversary of its predecessor's launch: April 3, 2011. A prototype of the iPad 2 was apparently spotted by a Reuters reporter after the launch of News Corp's iPad publication, the Daily, last week. And an unconfirmed report from DigiTimes in December said that Foxconn, the Chinese makers of the iPhone and iPad, had been ordered to manufacture the iPad 2 in market-ready quantities by the end of February. The Journal report, which carries three bylines and cites ""people familiar with the matter,"" offers a few more nuggets of detail. It confirms the widely-held belief that the iPad 2 will have a front-facing camera, enabling use of the Facetime videoconferencing app. It says that the 3G version will again be available on Verizon and AT&T, with Sprint and T-Mobile still shut out. But it contradicts earlier reports that Apple will endow the iPad 2 with a higher-resolution screen, much as the iPhone 4 had significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 3GS. Apple is likely still working on a higher quality iPad display -- it just won't be ready for the iPad 2. So will a slightly improved Apple tablet with camera be enough to persuade millions of iPad users to upgrade? Are there other bells and whistles we don't know about yet? We have previously reported on rumors that the new device will have an SD Card slot, and that it will feature rear-facing and front-facing cameras. (Click here for our comprehensive roundup of iPad 2 rumors). We'll know when Apple's acting CEO Tim Cook takes the stage, if this product timeline is accurate, in a few months' time. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Chicago (CNN) -- In Roseland, one of Chicago's most dangerous neighborhoods, many residents stay off the streets to protect themselves from rampant gang violence. But one grandmother opened her door and invited gang members to come inside. ""They say I'm a nut because I let kids into my home who I didn't even know,"" said Diane Latiker, 54. ""But I know (the kids) now. And I'll know the new generation."" Since 2003, Latiker has gotten to know more than 1,500 young people through her nonprofit community program, Kids Off the Block. And she hopes that by providing them with support and a place to go, she is also bringing hope to a community in crisis. ""We are losing a generation to violence,"" said Latiker, who started the program in her living room. According to Chicago Public Schools, 140 of its students have been shot since the school year started in September. ""How can a kid get a gun like he can get a pack of gum? It's that crazy,"" Latiker said. Latiker, a mother of eight and grandmother to 13, has lived in Roseland for 22 years. She said she was once ""young and dumb,"" dropping out of high school and having seven children by age 25. But she said that by 36, she had turned her life around: She got remarried and earned her GED. She had also given birth to her eighth child, Aisha. This time, she said, she was determined to do things right. But when Aisha became a teenager in 2003, Latiker worried that Aisha and her friends would fall in with a gang. After all, gang members lived next door, and there weren't many safe things for teenagers to do. ""I started taking (Aisha and her friends) to swimming and movies and whatever,"" Latiker said. ""My mother saw that, and she said: 'Diane, why don't you do something with the kids? They like you and respect you.' "" Latiker was hesitant at first. She wanted to focus on being a grandmother and rebuilding her relationships with her older children. But after thinking and praying about it, she decided to make use of the natural rapport she had with young people. ""I invited them into my living room,"" she said. ""They all started saying: 'I want to be a doctor. I want to be a rapper. I want to be a singer.' They didn't want to be out here running up and down the street. They wanted to be involved in something."" Latiker told them her house was open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They could come over for food, or homework help, or just to talk about their hopes, dreams and fears. Kids Off the Block was born. ""It doesn't matter where they come from, what they've done,"" Latiker said. ""We've had six gangs in my living room at one time. ... But that was the safe place. And you know what? They respected that."" As Latiker began to see positive change in many of the kids, she quit her job as a cosmetologist to focus on them full-time. She set up tutoring sessions with teachers and retired educators. She provided job interview training and opportunities to play football, basketball and soccer. Latiker and volunteers also started taking the kids on field trips to museums, movies, skating rinks, water parks and professional sports games. In 2004, the group started traveling to other cities across the country, including Detroit and St. Louis, so they could talk to the young people living there. The experiences ""let them know there is something beyond their block,"" Latiker said. Latiker has also made many personal sacrifices along the way. She sold the family television to put extra money into the program, and she gave away her dining room set to make room for a computer station. ""We moved into the dining room, and then we moved into one of my bedrooms,"" she said. ""(At one point) there were 75 young people in my three rooms."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . In 2008, just when Latiker thought her home would burst at the seams, some potential donors came to her home for a visit. Impressed, several of them pooled their money to buy a bus for the program. But a few days later, Latiker learned the building next door was for sale -- for the same price as the bus. ""I prayed about it and finally called the donors and asked if the money for the bus could be spent on the building next door instead,"" Latiker said. Her prayers were answered. The building was hers, and Kids Off the Block opened the doors of its new home on July 15, 2010. ""We call it The KOB Youth Community Center, and we invite everyone -- all of the youth in the community -- to come,"" she said. With 301 members from Roseland, Latiker said the center has brought community outreach to ""a whole new level."" Every day, 30 to 50 young people show up at the center for tutoring, counseling or activities such as sports, drama, dance or music. ""KOB"" caters to people age 11 to 24, but 80% of those in the program are male, Latiker said. She emphasizes activities that target males because they are most often perpetrating or confronting the violence of the streets. Maurice Gilchrist, 15, is one teenager who credits Kids Off the Block with turning his life around. Gilchrist joined a gang when he was 12, and he says life in a gang meant looking behind his back every day. ""We always used to jump on people, rob everything, steal,"" he said. Gilchrist discovered Kids Off the Block when he went to Latiker's house after school with a friend, Latiker's grandson. There, Gilchrist connected with others his age, ate pizza, did his homework, and talked with Latiker, who invited him to join the group. Today, Gilchrist's grades have improved and he has set his sights on playing football in college. Without Latiker and her program, ""I would be locked up, (or) dead, somewhere beat up, in a hospital,"" he said. ""You name it, I would be there. ""Miss Diane, she changed my life. I love her for that."" For Latiker, opening up her door was the first step toward change. And she hopes other people will follow her lead. ""If we came outside, we could change so many things,"" she said. ""This community -- if it was once vibrant and safe -- how did it get to this point? Because people started going inside."" To help ""shock the community"" into action, Latiker set up a stone memorial in front of the community center for all the young people who have lost their lives to violence since 2007. There are 220 stones lining the memorial, each representing a victim, and Latiker said they are still 150 stones behind. Through her efforts, Latiker has become a voice for local youth and she wishes more people would take the time to listen to them. ""Our young people need help,"" Latiker said. ""All of them are not gang-bangers. All of them are not dropouts. But the ones that are, they need our help. Somehow or another, something ain't right here. And why don't we ask them about it?""

"London (CNN) -- Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, presented medals Saturday to soldiers of the Irish Guards who have served in Afghanistan. The ceremony in the town of Windsor was the first time Prince William had visited the regiment since he was appointed colonel of the Irish Guards in February. Six soldiers from the regiment performed ceremonial duties at the couple's wedding in April. About 400 Irish Guards received operational medals during the ceremony, British media reported, with the duke and duchess pausing to speak to each soldier as they presented them. Afterwards, Prince William spoke of his ""pride and humility"" as he paid tribute to the soldiers' service. ""I am proud to be your colonel. I am humbled by the thought of the sacrifices that you and your families have made and the losses that you have suffered -- all in the service of our country,"" he said. ""Along with thousands of others back home, I followed your tour in Afghanistan with a mounting sense of awe."" The duke and duchess also presented the families of three fallen servicemen with the Elizabeth Cross, a medal granted to the relatives of military personnel killed on operations. The couple spoke to the families privately before the medal parade. It was the first time the duchess had carried out a military role as a member of the royal family. The 1st Battalion Irish Guards returned in April from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Their responsibilities included helping mentor the Afghan National Army. The regiment, which is based at the Victoria Barracks in Windsor, was formed in 1900 by order of Queen Victoria.","NEW: Prince William speaks of his ""pride and humility"" as he meets troops .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- It's official: Ashton Kutcher is filling the gap left by Charlie Sheen on ""Two and a Half Men."" ""I can't wait to get to work with this ridiculously talented 2.5 team and I believe we can fill the stage with laughter that will echo in viewers' homes,"" Kutcher said Friday in a statement released by CBS and Warner Bros. Television. ""I can't replace Charlie Sheen but I'm going to work my ass off to entertain the hell out of people!"" Kutcher, who gained his early fame on a TV sitcom, ""That 70s Show,"" has more recently been seen on the big screen. His last film was ""No Strings Attached,"" which hit theaters in January. He's also made his mark as a TV executive producer, most notably for MTV's hidden-camera show ""Punk'd."" ""Ashton is a pop culture triple threat -- film star, cutting-edge producer and a social media pioneer,"" said Nina Tassler, the head of CBS Entertainment. ""He brings creativity, energy and personality to everything he touches. We are thrilled to have him."" CBS and Warner Bros. did not disclose how much Kutcher will earn. Sheen, who is embroiled in a lawsuit over his sudden dismissal from the show in March, was earning a reported $2 million for each episode. Sheen responded to the news by praising Kutcher while taking a shot at the show's executive producer, Chuck Lorre. ""Ashton Kutcher is a sweetheart and a brilliant comedic performer. Oh wait, so am I!!,"" Sheen said in a written statement.  ""Enjoy the show America.  Enjoy seeing 2.0 in the demo every Monday, WB.  Enjoy planet Chuck, Ashton.  There is no air, laughter, loyalty, or love there.""

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather is returning to boxing after a year out of the ring, announcing he is to fight Victor Ortiz. The five-time world champion's last bout was against Shane Mosley in May 2010 as he won a unanimous decision in Las Vegas. Mayweather, 34, has won all 41 of his professional fights and is a six-time world champion at five different weights. Ortiz became the current World Boxing Council (WBC) welterweight champion after beating Andre Berto in April and the bout has been set for September 17. ""I am ready to return to the ring and give my fans a fantastic night of boxing by fighting the best out there,"" Mayweather said in a statement. ""For me, that is Victor Ortiz. He is the current champion and an extremely talented fighter, who showed amazing skills and heart in his last performance. ""At this stage of my career, these are the challenges I look for -- a young, strong, rising star looking to make his mark in boxing by beating me. ""Ortiz is just going to be another casualty, the 42nd one who tried and failed. Trust me. I will be ready."" Mayweather has recorded 25 knockouts in his 41 bouts, while Ortiz has suffered two defeats and two draws in his 33 fights. The 24-year-old American said: ""I respect Mayweather because he has been a champion for many years and I know he will be ready but so will I. ""I'm a world champion for a reason and I am not going to let go of my title any time soon. This is going to be a great fight, but I will remain a world champion for many years to come."" Mayweather's return to the ring will again raise the prospect of a so-called ""superbout"" with eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. Since Mayweather last fought he was arrested at a Las Vegas casino in December last year on a misdemeanor battery charge after he allegedly assaulted a security guard at his housing complex . He has also been embroiled in domestic violence claims from his former girlfriend. He faces criminal charges in court in January.","Floyd Mayweather announces he is to fight Victor Ortiz on September 17 .

"(CNN) -- A judge has ordered Jared Lee Loughner to undergo a mental evaluation at a specialized facility in Springfield, Missouri, as soon as possible to help determine if he is competent to stand trial, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tucson, Arizona. Loughner, an Arizona man, faces 49 counts -- including murder and attempted murder -- related to the January 8 mass shooting in a grocery store parking lot. Six people were killed in the shooting and 13 others were wounded, including Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Loughner's defense attorneys argued that the suspect should not be moved to Springfield because he is ""'seriously ill' and that physically transferring him from Tuscon could worsen his mental state and disrupt counsel's relationship with him,"" according to court documents. But U.S. District Judge Larry Burns sided with prosecutors stating in his order that he ""acknowledges that moving the defendant to Springfield for a relatively short period of time will be temporarily inconvenient for the defense team. But the inconvenience is unavoidable ..."" Burns said the mental evaluation should happen no later than April 29. A competency hearing in the case has been scheduled for May 25.

"(Fast Company) -- Users in China are reporting that access to LinkedIn has been blocked throughout the country. By all indications, it seems that the popular career networking site has run afoul of the country's infamous Great Firewall. According to LinkedIn's Hani Durzy, the company is aware of a blockage in China and is ""currently in the process of investigating the situation further."" The shutdown follows days of calls for a ""Jasmine Revolution"" in China, on the model of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. Access to Twitter and Facebook has been blocked throughout China for some time; Chinese internet users seeking to use Twitter have been forced to access the site through difficult-to-use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). However, Chinese dissidents have another way of accessing Twitter... LinkedIn. Use of LinkedIn, which is fully integrated with Twitter, was by far the easiest way to access Twitter in China. Messages can be easily read and posted through Twitter via LinkedIn. One Chinese Twitter user who accesses both Twitter and LinkedIn through a proxy posted photos to Twitpic that seem to confirm a Chinese LinkedIn outage. Adding credence to the LinkedIn-shutdown-to-block-Twitter strategy is the news that the Chinese government has started censoring the name of U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman from search results on the wildly popular homegrown Twitter/Tumblr clones Sina Weibo/QQ Weibo. Weibo means ""microblog"" in Chinese. Huntsman faces widespread charges in China of support for the Jasmine Revolution after a citizen journalist spotted him watching a pro-democracy protest from within a crowd this past Sunday. Like any good American abroad, Huntsman was standing outside a McDonald's. According to The Wall Street Journal, Chinese dissidents have been disseminating calls to protest and organizing events via LinkedIn. Reuters notes that the LinkedIn outagecould hurt the firm's chances at an IPO: . ""If the disruption for LinkedIn is permanent in China, it could hurt the company's prospects at an IPO as a ban would exclude the company from the world's largest Internet market--about 450 million users and growing."" ""It certainly would be a negative in terms of the company's future growth and profitability,"" said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. ""This is something where investors would take it into account and be willing to pay a little lower price per share."" Luckily for LinkedIn, China's Internet censors are notoriously fickle: Sites blip on and off the Great Firewall frequently, with no prior warning.

"(Rolling Stone) -- It's one thing to sing about a motorcycle, and it's another to sing about a unicorn. But when you put your motorcycle song and your unicorn song in the same song? And call it ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)""? Now that's a pop visionary. Lady Gaga knew it was time to crank up the crazy, and she didn't hold back: ""Born This Way"" is her Eighties arena-rock move, going for maximum goth Catholic bombast. The whole album thumps like the soundtrack to a lost ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" sequel, one where Eddie gets crucified by Roman soldiers, while Gaga stands under the cross weeping and sending dirty texts to the DJ. ""Born This Way"" has all the electro-sleaze beats and Eurodisco chorus chants that made her the Fame Monster. But the big surprise is the way Gaga pillages the Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar and Eddie Money records of her childhood. In the 1980s, radio was full of tormented Catholic kids, from Madonna to Springsteen. Gaga clearly grew up on that stuff. She doesn't just give her Springsteen homage ""The Edge of Glory"" a sax solo -- she gets Clarence Clemons himself to play it. Exclusive: How E Street Band Saxophonist Clarence Clemons Ended Up on Lady Gaga's New Album . All over ""Born This Way,"" she takes on the big topics dear to her heart: sex, religion, muscle cars, her hair. She sings in French, German, Spanish and whatever language wants to claim ""punk-tious."" She seduces men, women, deities and dead presidents. (""Put your hands on me/John F. Kennedy"" -- hey, it rhymes.) And in ""Heavy Metal Lover,"" Gaga purrs the immortal pickup line ""I want your whiskey mouth/All over my blond south."" Some songs are already familiar -- at this point you could hum the Tarzan-boy yodels of ""Judas"" in your sleep. But the singles gain resonance on the album, where they're surrounded by similar-minded psychosexual turmoil. ""Born This Way"" pulls an expert (expletive)-stole-my-look on Madonna's ""Express Yourself."" But that isn't even the most brazen Madonna rip here: That honor goes to ""Judas."" And if you thought the Catholic angst of ""Judas"" was over-the-top, check out ""Bloody Mary,"" where Gaga does the Stations of the Cross to a Chic bass line. Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way': A Track-by-Track Breakdown . What makes ""Born This Way"" so disarmingly great is how warm and humane Gaga sounds. There isn't a subtle moment on the album, but even at its nuttiest, the music is full of wide-awake emotional details. The friendliest cut is ""Yoü & I,"" her love song to a ""cool Nebraska guy."" She has been playing it live for a while, but who knew she would let Mutt Lange put ""We Will Rock You"" drums all over it? Or bring in Queen's Brian May to play guitar? All that excess just amps up the emotion in the song, especially when Gaga wails, ""There's only three men that I'm-a serve my whole life/It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ."" Gaga loves overheated cosmic statements for the same reason she loves dance pop and metal guitars -- because she hears them as echoes of her twisted rock & roll heart. That's the achievement of ""Born This Way"": The more excessive Gaga gets, the more honest she sounds.

"(CNN) -- Ten years after last voicing Autobot leader Optimus Prime on the original ""Transformers"" animated series, Peter Cullen decided to go to his first fan convention, BotCon, in Rochester, New York, after some coaxing from his daughter. ""I was taken aback by the response and the sheer love that was in the audience,"" he said. ""It became quite evident that (voicing this character) was a responsibility that I wanted to fulfill. I had no idea he was so popular."" That 1997 convention was the first of many for Cullen, who said that Optimus' influence over the lives of children made the character his favorite. ""It's been wonderful to listen to the experience of growing up and how the character affected their lives in a good, positive way. It's a joy to know that I made a difference."" So, why all the adoration? ""Optimus Prime is basically a bulletproof Abraham Lincoln,"" said iReporter and ""Transformers"" toy collector Shaun Martens. ""(He's) someone so competent, virtuous and level headed that you trust him more than yourself. To kids he represents the perfect father figure, someone who is strong in every way and holds the best interests of others above those of himself,"" Martens said. ""Optimus Prime is capable, loyal, forgiving, just, approachable, a brilliant strategist, merciful, selfless,"" said iReporter Kevin Farren. ""Optimus Prime can do no wrong. He can't even stay dead. If you ever needed a leader you'd want him to be Optimus Prime."" Ten years after that first convention, Cullen was asked to voice Optimus in the first of the wildly popular ""Transformers"" movie series, something for which he gives full credit to the fan base. This summer, he is playing the character in the third film, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" as well as the new animated series on the Hub network, ""Transformers: Prime."" ""It was very important to me that he voice the character of Prime in the movie,"" said iReporter Cody Helms, who like Martens and Farren often check sites like Seibertron.com to interact with other fans and find out the latest ""Transformers"" news. ""I believe he gives the character a better sense of humanity."" Like classic characters Bugs Bunny and Fred Flintstone, the voice of Optimus Prime is instantly recognizable for a certain generation. ""You know it's him when you hear the voice,"" said Farren, who added that despite his disappointment in the movies overall, the highlight is hearing Cullen's performance. Martens described Cullen's voice as ""a perfect balance between warmth and authority."" Cullen said he is personally touched by how strong the response has been. ""I remember an officer in the Marine Corps who had just returned from Iraq, and he gave me his golden anchor emblem from his officer's hat,"" he said. ""He presented that to me and said this is how much you mean to me. There are no words to describe it, but I was humbled. That sticks with me forever."" Cullen -- who said that police officers have made similar gestures toward him -- came up with the voice because of his brother Larry, an officer in the Marine Corps. ""I saw a difference in him when he came home. There was a maturity and calmness and understanding, and a very strong source of confidence, respect, caring and dignity,"" he said. ""I was called to audition and said goodbye to Larry, and I said I was auditioning for a hero. He said, 'Be tough enough to be gentle, you don't have to always be loud.' It stuck with me when I read the character description. I just echoed Larry's voice in the first few lines, and fell right into it. And I thought, boy, this feels like home."" When the producers of ""Transformers: Prime"" began casting, they knew that it was very important to get Cullen to play Optimus once again... and along with that, they felt strongly that they needed to get the original Megatron, Frank Welker, as well. ""Those two guys love each other,"" said executive producer Jeff Kline. ""They're so obviously happy together that you get better stuff from the cast. That stamp of approval on what we were doing went a long way with the fan community, as well."" Cullen said that he and Welker go back to the 1979 Saturday morning cartoon, ""Mighty Man and Yukk,"" about a miniature superhero and a dog so ugly he had to cover his face with a dog house. ""He played the dog, and I played Mighty Man,"" he said. ""Now, sometimes we won't see each other for a while, but we'll inevitably end up in the same studio together and reinforce our great appreciation for each other."" That camaraderie extends to younger members of the ""Prime"" cast, as well. ""The most surprising thing is being in the room with Peter and Frank and all of these guys whose careers I've followed for so long and the fact that they were still so excited to be there, and so grateful after all these years -- especially Peter, he's done it all, and he's like a little kid in there and just as excited as we are,"" said Steven Blum, who plays the villainous Starscream. ""He's not the huge man you would expect him to be listening to his voice. He's a normal size guy, but he opens his mouth and it's almost as though the jaw would unhinge and the windows start to flex with all the vibrations coming out. It's just astonishing."" On the flip side from Optimus' heroism, anime veteran Blum explores the darkness of Starscream while getting into character. ""I just go as dark and delusional as I possibly can and sort of build my way up from there,"" he said. ""Sprinkle in a little deviant and cowardly and megalomaniacal and I think from moment to moment, he's one or all of those things."" ""He's a villain that is so completely out for himself that it actually works against him,"" said Martens, who counts Starscream as his favorite ""Transformers"" character. ""You never know if he's going to follow Megatron's plan against the Autobots, or try to off Megatron and take control of the Decepticons himself."" Between good and evil, Blum is somewhat on the fence as to which he prefers. ""The villains are certainly therapeutic. I get to act out all the badness that I am not really allowed to do in my day to day life,"" he said. ""But I like the heroes too, I do like setting a good example for kids once in a while instead of turning them into demented monsters. They both have their charm, but I would say more days than not, the villain is more fun to play."" Not surprisingly, Cullen feels differently: ""I played a villain - Venger in 'Dungeons and Dragons' - and I got some feedback that it was pretty scary. I'm not the kind of guy that likes to scare people. If it's going to have an entertaining value, it's got to be funny or inspiring. The evil part of it is part of the acting generator but it's not one of my favorites."" One burning question for both actors: do they own action figures of themselves? ""I used to have Transformers figures, and I think I broke them because I played with them too much,"" said Blum. ""I have the original G1 figure (from the 1980s),"" said Cullen. ""I even broke a portion trying to configure it -- it ended up on a shelf where it remains in pieces, several pieces I might add. Nonetheless, it's quite important to me, it was my first one and I cherish it."" Nowadays, Cullen keeps the figures in a closet, to bring out during birthdays and holidays for his grandson. ""I love the 18 wheeler that transforms and speaks at the same time. I was knocked out by that one. He will get that at Christmas."" True enough, ""Transformers"" transcends generations, as Cullen has seen for himself. ""My grandson is turning five in August and we were at dinner at a pizza house several days ago.

"(CNN) -- Support from the United States, Pakistan and other Afghan allies is crucial to the success of reconciliation talks with the Taliban, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday. ""The High Council for Peace is authorized by the Afghan people to talk with the Taliban,"" Karzai said. ""These are initial contacts being made, but these contacts would not yield results, would not give us the results that we seek, unless and until the United States and Pakistan, especially, with our other allies, back it with practical application of the means that they have in their disposal."" Last week, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, ""there's been outreach (to the Taliban) on the part of a number of countries, including the United States. I would say that these contacts are very preliminary."" ""My own view is that real reconciliation talks are not likely to be able to make any substantive headway until at least this winter,"" Gates said. Among the conditions required by the United States of the Taliban: complete disassociation from al Qaeda and ""meeting the redlines that President Karzai and the coalition have laid down."" Karzai said earlier this month that ""peace negotiations with the Taliban and with other countrymen have been started. Those who accept the constitution, freedom, democracy and development of Afghanistan can take part in this negotiation."" ""The Afghan people need peace,"" Karzai said in the CNN interview. ""The Afghan people want peace. They want their children sent to school. Mothers want to be without worry when they have their children go to school or their husbands to (a) job, or when the women go out to work. This country needs to live like all other nations live."" ""... We must reach this human desire through a reasonable means, through a realistic approach,"" he said. ""And that is dialogue with a condition that the gains of Afghanistan over the past 10 years not be compromised, that the gains of our women not be compromised, that our children must continue to go to school, that our constitution be respected and recognized. And that having fulfilled that, that the Taliban, who agree to this -- and the absolute majority of them agree to this -- will return to their homes in dignity."" Karzai also said he welcomes U.S. President Barack Obama's plans for a drawdown of American troops, calling it a sign that Afghanistan is ready to take control of security in the war-torn nation. ""The number of troops that he has announced to be withdrawn is a sign that Afghanistan is taking over its own security and is trying to defend it territory by its own means,"" Karzai said. ""So we are happy about the announcement."" As the United States pulls back, Karzai painted a picture of a more stable Afghanistan, despite the fact that May was the bloodiest month for Afghan civilians since 2007. Karzai, who spoke to Zakaria earlier this week, said Afghans were ready to take the reins of their own country. ""It is the responsibility of the Afghan people to protect their country and to provide security for the citizens of the country,"" Karzai said. ""If you fail in fulfilling our most important responsibility with regard to our country and our people, then somebody else should take over."" Obama announced Wednesday night that 10,000 U.S. troops would leave Afghanistan this year and all 33,000 forces, sent as part of a 2009 surge, would return home by the summer of 2012. Karzai also defended his public criticisms of NATO, which in recent weeks have taken on a more angry tone. Karzai blasted the alliance for civilian deaths and nighttime raids. He said his comment on NATO becoming an ""occupying force"" was taken out of context. ""No I don't regret having made that comment,"" he said. ""That comment was not seen in the full sentence that I spoke. It was after the incident of civilian casualties in Afghanistan where children were killed in an aerial bombing, where I said, 'No more of such aerial bombings on our residents.' ""The question was what if they continue?"" Karzai said. ""When Afghanistan asks that these operations cease and even then, if they continue, this means we are not in charge of our country,"" he said. ""And that, of course, becomes an occupation. It was in this context that I spoke, and I stand by that."" ""My statements are neither hostile nor inflammatory nor designed to get anything but an understanding from our partners that the Afghan people need to feel secure, they need to see this war take a direction in which they can see the end of the tunnel,"" Karzai said. He said Afghanistan, dependent on U.S. dollars for security and development, was grateful to American taxpayers but expressed dismay that U.S. humanitarian efforts have not always taken Afghan wishes into account. He cited a Kandahar electricity project in which he said the United States spent $250 million to buy generators. Karzai said Afghanistan would have preferred the construction of a dam, which he called a more lasting solution.","NEW: President Hamid Karzai says the United States, Pakistan should support Taliban talks .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan failed a court-ordered alcohol test last week, requiring her to go before a judge for a probation violation hearing Thursday morning, according to a source close to the case. Lohan's failed test, which the source said happened on June 13, comes while the actress is confined to her Venice Beach, California home because of a jail sentence imposed last month. The actress will appear before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner at 10 a.m. Thursday, the same judge who sentenced her to 120 days in jail after she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace, a prosecution spokeswoman said Wednesday. Lohan was allowed to serve a reduce sentence at home because, as a non-violent offender, she qualified a home confinement program intended to reduce overcrowding. But it is not likely Judge Sautner has missed seeing media reports showing Lohan socializing on the roof of her luxury home in recent days. ""When my friends come over, they're not drinking,"" Lohan told an interviewer with Life & Style magazine. ""Alcohol is not in my house, so it's just not a part of my life."" That interview was given on June 18, five days after she failed test. The actress, who turns 25 on July 2, has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunk driving convictions, a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction. ""Because of budget constraints and because we're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation, nonviolent offenders, lesser crimes, get 20% of their sentence,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Without the latest violation, it was expected she would be released from home confinement in early July. She would then resume her work on 480 hours of community service the judge imposed. Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge, but Sautner made it clear in court last month that she didn't think drugs and alcohol were not the root of Lohan's legal troubles. ""She's got other problems for which she self-medicates,"" Judge Sautner said. Lohan's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007. Since then, she's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehabilitation programs. A probation report released last month said the actress ""appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues."" ""It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity,"" the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines. HLN's Selin Darkalstanian contributed to this report.","NEW: Lohan failed a June 13th alcohol test, a source says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan(CNN) -- A suicide bomb attack targeting a hospital in eastern Afghanistan killed at least 35 people and wounded more than two dozen, a brazen strike that rocked a maternity ward and claimed the lives of numerous women and children. The incident occurred Saturday in the Azra district of Logar province when a truck packed with explosives detonated, according to Sifatiullah Haqmal, a member of the provincial council. The head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said ""much of the damage was in the maternity ward of the hospital, and many of those killed and injured were women and children."" The mission noted that assaults on hospitals ""are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law"" and that ""medical workers, clinics and hospitals must be respected and protected in all circumstances."" Dr. Khaliq Yar, head of the provincial projects for a national medical program, described the hospital as a four-ward comprehensive health center, including a section for mothers and children and ten beds for maternity patients. The Logar assault follows a similar strike last month when a suicide bombing tore through a military hospital in Kabul, killing six people and injuring others. ""This is a despicable attack against civilians who were seeking medical care, as well as visiting family members and health workers,"" Staffan de Mistura, the special representative of the secretary-general for Afghanistan, said in a statement on Saturday. ""The terrorists demonstrated a disregard for human life when they targeted Afghans who were patients in a hospital and their visitors and relatives, and hospital personnel,"" the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said in a statement. Casualty reports fluctuated in the hours after the attack. Logar governor's spokesman Den Mohammad Darwish told CNN that along with the 35 deaths, 25 others were wounded. The Logar strike is the second attack in as many days in Afghanistan that targeted civilians, just days after President Barack Obama outlined a plan to withdraw 30,000 troops from the country by September 2012. Along with the Logar strike, a bomb attack in the northern province of Kunduz on Friday killed at least 10 people,  actions the embassy called ""devastating."" The Afghan President Hamid Karzai and NATO's International Security Assistance Force also issued statements condemning both incidents, and said the violence underscores warnings from military commanders that insurgents are intent on pursuing large-scale strikes. ""The insurgents have a complete disregard for the innocent people of Afghanistan who are trying to live in peace,"" ISAF spokesman Rear Adm. Vic Beck said. The Kunduz incident on Friday occurred in the province's Khan Abad district square, said Mohibullah Saidi, a spokesman for the provincial governor. Along with the 10 deaths, 24 people were wounded in the attack, the Ministry of Interior said. The bomb was placed in a bicycle and was detonated by remote control, Saidi said. ISAF also reported the deaths of two service members on Saturday in separate insurgent attacks in eastern Afghanistan, and the alliance confirmed that one of them was a French service member. The nationality of the other soldier was not immediately available. There have been 48 international troop deaths in June and 264 this year, according to a CNN count of casualties. The French government said its soldier was wounded by insurgent fire in a fight during a reconnaissance mission in Kapisa province and died later at a hospital. He is the 63rd French soldier to die in the Afghan war. France announced Thursday that it would also begin to reduce troop numbers, saying it ""will initiate a progressive withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, and will follow a timetable comparable to the withdrawal of the American troops."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said the withdrawal will be done in consultation with NATO allies and the Afghan government. All French soldiers could be out of Afghanistan by 2013, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told France Info radio Thursday.

"(CNN) -- French workers on Thursday freed the manager of a factory run by U.S. company 3M held hostage in his office for more than 24 hours in a labor dispute over terms for laid-off staff. The manager of 3M's French operations, Luc Rousselet, eats in his office while he was held hostage. Luc Rousselet, who was unharmed, was allowed to leave the plant in Pithiviers, central France, early on Thursday morning after talks between unions and officials from 3M France. ""We have an agreement with 3M that they will provide the means to respond to our demands,"" union representative Jean-Francois Caparros told news agency AFP. ""The negotiations will resume and that's a very good thing,"" said Rousselet as he left an office where he took refuge on Tuesday afternoon. ""I am very happy for the employees of the Pithiviers factory. I know that this was a very difficult lay-off plan for them,"" he said as workers shouted ""Scoundrel boss!"" Is there any justification for taking this action? The 3M factory at the center of the dispute makes pharmaceutical products and employs 235 people. Of those 110 are being cut this year and 40 more are being transferred to another plant. Rousselet was briefing the laid-off workers about a compensation package but retreated to his office after feeling threatened. Maryse Bulte, 44, one of the employees, said: ""Initially we didn't want to hold him. We just sought talks and concrete results. ""It was despair and distress which made us do this,"" added Cyril Foufelle, 36. The manufacturer 3M, based in Minnesota, has announced thousands of job cuts around the world amid the economic downturn. Anger has been growing in the U.S. and Europe over job cuts and high bonuses for executives whose companies have been rescued with taxpayers' money. Earlier this month the boss of Sony France was held overnight before workers freed him after he agreed to reopen talks on compensation when the factory closed. And last week angry tire factory workers threw eggs at their bosses in a protest over the closure of their plant. The drama at Pithiviers, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Paris, came as figures showed the number of jobless in France rose nearly 80,000 in February to reach 2.38 million. More than a million striking workers protested last week urging President Nicolas Sarkozy to do more to protect their jobs.","French workers free manager held hostage for 24 hours in labor dispute .

"New York (CNN) -- The bus company involved in an accident that left 15 people dead in New York this weekend has been involved in at least two other crashes with injuries in the past two years, government records show. World Wide Travel was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury, and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in one injury, according to records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website. The company has been cited five times for ""fatigued driving"" between December 2009 and October 2010 -- twice in in New Jersey, twice in Pennsylvania and once in Connecticut, records show. At least 14 passengers died early Saturday after the driver of their tour bus lost control of the vehicle and struck two sign poles, one located directly behind the other, on Interstate 95 in the Bronx, New York police said. World Wide Travel declined to comment to CNN, despite repeated calls, other than to refer to a published statement saying the company was ""heartbroken"" at the deaths and injuries. ""We are a family owned company and realize words cannot begin to express our sorrow to the families of those who lost their lives or were injured in this tragic accident,"" the company statement said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with them. We will continue to use every resource at our disposal to assist and work with investigators to determine what happened."" The crash occurred about 5:30 a.m. on a stretch of I-95 called the New England Thruway near the Bronx-Westchester County line, officials said. The accident forced the closing of I-95 in both directions until late Saturday, police said. Along with those who were killed, eight of the 31 passengers suffered severe injuries and were transported to area hospitals with the remaining survivors. At least five people being treated at New York's St. Barnabas Hospital suffered skull and spinal fractures, internal bleeding and broken bones, Dr. Ernest Patti told reporters. The bus, which had departed from the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, was bound for Chinatown in Manhattan, according to news reports. The bus driver, Ophadel E. Williams, 40, of Brooklyn suffered ""non-life-threatening injuries,"" police said. Five of the injured were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, 14 were transported to Jacobi Medical Center. Passenger Chung Ninh, 59, who suffered only a hand inury, told reporters he was asleep when the accident occured. Ninh said he woke to find himself hanging upside down in his seat belt, surrounded by other passengers either screaming or dead and covered in broken glass. Ninh he said he tried to help an unconscious woman nearby. ""I put my hand on the neck and no movement, no nothing,"" Ninh told reporters. Police said Williams told investigators that the accident occurred after he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer that might have clipped the bus. The bus then flipped on its side and smashed into the poles, which cut through two thirds of the vehicle. Police recovered a tractor-trailer that was traveling through the area at the time and interviewed the vehicle's driver. The driver of the tractor trailer denied that two vehicles collided before the bus crashed, the law enforcement source told CNN. ""We're treating him as a witness, not a suspect,"" according to the the law enforcement source, who is involved in the investigation. Meanwhile, federal investigators are considering other potential causes of the crash, including mechanical problems, steering and brake issues as well as the possibility the driver fell asleep. Some surviving passengers, according to news reports, told police that they felt the bus roll over rumble strips before the crash. At a Sunday afternoon press conference, National Transportation Safety Board Vice-Chairman Christopher Hart said investigators are looking for video recordings taken at the casino and, possibly, an electronic hotel key card that might track some of Williams' activities within 72 hours of the accident. Police officials have said they are also looking into the possibility that the bus driver had been speeding prior to the accident. Two UPS couriers told CNN affiliate WABC-TV that they twice saw the bus traveling very fast on the highway before the accident. ""I felt my vehicle shake from the turbulence of the wind,"" driver Joe Insalata told WABC . Insalata's co-worker, Ira Berman said they saw the bus a second time. ""When we saw the logo on the back of the bus, we were like, 'World Wide Tours,'"" Berman told WABC. ""'That's the guy that passed us about 15 minutes ago at a very high rate of speed.'"" ""And that was when Joe was like, ""I'm calling the cops,'"" Berman said. Investigators are examining Williams' background and testing his blood for the presence of alcohol. New York State Police Maj. Michael Kopy said Saturday a video camera had been recovered from the bus, but that investigators had not yet viewed it. Hart described the video as coming from a ""forward looking camera"" that had been installed on the bus. Meanwhile, the bus engine control module, also known as the black box, was sent to an NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C. NTSB investigators visited the crash site for the first time Sunday. According to Hart, skid marks left by the bus show the vehicle hit the guardrail on the right of I-95 ""at least three times"" over the course of 480 feet before crashing into sign posts that sliced through the vehicle. At least seven passengers had to be extracted by removing seats and cutting a hole in the remaining roof. Most of the passengers were thrust to the forward third of the bus as it split open, suffering injuries mainly from the chest up, Fire Chief Edward Kilduff said. ""Our -- and the entire city's -- prayers, thoughts and sympathies are with the victims, and their families and loved ones,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a written statement Saturday. ""Many of the victims are Chinese, and we have brought in translators to help assist the families.""

"(CNN) -- Venus Williams will have the chance to avenge last year's shock Wimbledon defeat by Tsvetana Pironkova after the Bulgarian pulled off another upset victory to reach the fourth round in London on Friday. Pironkova earned her own revenge as she knocked out second seed Vera Zvonareva, who beat her in the 2010 semifinals before losing to Serena Williams in the title match. Venus, a five-time winner of the English grass-court grand slam, had few problems in continuing her winning form in just her second tournament since January as she crushed Spain's Maria Jose Martinez 6-0 6-2. Rain late in the day meant that her sister Serena was unable to start her third-round match against Russian 26th seed Maria Kirilenko, which will be played on Saturday. Can the Williams sisters triumph after a troubled year? Venus was relieved not to repeat her hard-fought win over Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm in the previous round. ""Today I played a similar player -- thankfully I was able to get through a bit easier today. I was able to take her volley away, which felt great,"" the 31-year-old told reporters. ""I'm feeling great and now I've got a couple of days off to get things in order."" The American will next take on a player who has risen to 33rd in the rankings, despite this being her first appearance past the second round of a grand slam since that semi last year. She also beat Williams at the 2006 Australian Open. The 23-year-old Pironkova won through in straight sets, beating world No. 3 Zvonareva 6-2 6-3 to end the Russian's hopes of landing a first major title. Zvonareva slipped in the fourth game and had her ankle strapped after losing the first set, and capitulated after having more treatment at 3-2 down in the second. Fourth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus also progressed into the last 16 as she beat Slovakia's No. 25 Daniela Hantuchova 6-3 3-6 6-2. The 21-year-old will next face Russia's two-time quarterfinalist Nadia Petrova, who eliminated Ukraine's Kateryna Bondarenko 6-3 6-2. Eighth seed Petra Kvitova ended the run of Italy's No. 29 Roberta Vinci, with the Czech winning 6-3 6-3 to set up a clash with Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer. Wickmayer, seeded 19th, came from behind to defeat Russia's two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova 4-6 6-3 6-4. German 11th seed Andrea Petkovic crashed out, losing 6-4 7-6 (7-2) to Russian debutant Ksenia Pervak. The 20-year-old earned a clash with either Italian sixth seed Francesca Schiavone or Austria's world No. 80 Tamira Paszek. French Open runner-up Schiavone was battling to stay in the tournament as she trailed 6-3 4-6 2-3 when rain halted. In second-round matches, world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki kept alive her hopes of a first grand slam title as the Dane dispatched unseeded French player Virginie Razzano 6-1 6-3 in a second-round match. The 20-year-old will next play Australia's 27th seed Jarmila Gajdosova, who reached the fourth round last year. Fifth seed Maria Sharapova also moved into round three, beating British 17-year-old Laura Robson 7-6 (7-4) 6-3. The Russian, champion as a 17-year-old herself in 2004, will next play Czech world No. 35 Klara Zakopalova as she seeks to build on the form that took her to the French Open semifinals earlier this month. Marion Bartoli, the 2007 runner-up, came from behind to beat Spain's Lourdes Dominguez Lion 4-6 7-5 6-2 to earn a third-round clash with Italy's Flavia Pennetta. Peng Shuai is the only Chinese player left in the draw following French Open champion Li Na's exit on Thursday, with the 20th seed moving into the third round with a battling 4-6 6-2 7-5 win over Britain's Elena Baltacha. The 25-year-old will seek to reach the last 16 for the first time as she takes on Hungary's Melinda Czink.","Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams through to the fourth round .

"Dawu, Taiwan (CNN) -- Typhoon Nanmadol pounded Taiwan with heavy rains Monday before it was downgraded to a tropical storm and headed toward China. The storm made landfall in the southern portion of Taiwan about 3 a.m. Monday, dousing some areas with up to 300 mm (11 inches) of rain, officials said. There were no immediate reports of casualties, although officials closed several highways in the landslide-prone region. Nanmadol reached Taiwan after pummeling the Philippines over the weekend. By Monday, the death toll in the Philippines had climbed to 12. Among them were two children who died when Nanmadol, known locally as Mina, triggered a landslide in northern Philippines on Saturday, authorities said. The landslide buried the victims in Pangasinan province, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Ten others were killed in different incidents, 21 people were injured, and nine remain missing, the council said in a statement Monday.

"(CNN) -- Southwest Airlines announced Saturday that it is grounding 79 planes for inspection after a 3- to 4-foot hole tore open in the fuselage of one of its planes, bringing a view of the blue sky and a white-knuckled emergency descent. The plane -- which had been traveling from Phoenix to Sacramento, California -- managed to make an emergency landing at a military base in Yuma, Arizona, on Friday. There authorities ""discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft,"" the company said earlier. Investigators are trying to determine what caused the ""depressurization event"" and have ""decided to keep a subset of its Boeing 737 fleet out of the flying schedule to begin an aggressive inspection effort in cooperation with Boeing engineers,"" according to a company statement. ""The safety of our customers and employees is our primary concern, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries,"" said Mike Van de Ven, Southwest's executive vice president and chief operating officer. The airline initially reported that 81 of its Boeing 737 aircraft would be grounded, but later decreased the number of planes to be inspected for what it called ""aircraft skin fatigue."" The inspections will take place at five locations over the course of the next several days, the airline said. Southwest expected to cancel about 300 flights Saturday to accommodate the inspections. It advised customers to check the status of their particular flight or rebook their trip before heading to the airport. They may ""experience sporadic delays of up to two hours on some flights."" National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said a preliminary investigation showed the aircraft suffered a ""structural failure"" and ""depressurization"" that prompted the emergency landing. A subsequent review will investigate the aircraft's structure, metallurgical aspects of the plane, flight data recordings and its maintenance records, he said. ""We're in the beginning stages of the investigation,"" Sumwalt added. Meanwhile, some of the 118 passengers who were aboard the crippled Boeing 737 said they had feared for their lives. ""We were in shock,"" passenger Debbie Downey told CNN Saturday. ""We were in row 16 and my husband and I could see blue sky ... the wiring, the cabling. It actually was terrifying."" She said. ""a lot of people were crying and holding hands"" but had trouble hearing due to the noise of air rushing through the plane's opening. ""It was very, very scary."" ""I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us,"" passenger Greg Hansen said. ""(Then) a big explosion happened. A big noise, and from there, you felt some of the air being sucked out. It happened right behind me, in the row behind me and it covers about 2 1/2 rows,"" he said from seat 11C. Hansen, 41, a regional sales manager for a biotech company, was flying home to Sacramento, California, from a business trip. Some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in midflight, he said. ""Most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests. The pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level,"" he said. But just behind him, Hansen said he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be. ""You can see the insulation and wiring. The interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air,"" he said. ""It was surreal, when you're riding in a modern aircraft. You're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down,"" he said. Hansen described the hole as being about 3 or 4 feet long and about a foot wide. Passenger Brenda Reese told CNN affiliates KCRA and KOVR she began to fear for her life. ""I was texting my sister to make certain that she told my kids that I loved them,"" Reese said. Southwest Flight 812, which had a five-member crew, then made an emergency landing at Yuma Marine Corps Air Station/International Airport at 5:07 p.m. (7:07 p.m. ET.) The Federal Aviation Administration said the captain made a rapid, controlled descent from 36,000 feet to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure. ""We do not know the cause of the decompression,"" said Ian Gregor of the FAA. Hansen said the incident took place about 35 minutes into the flight. He said it took about 45 seconds or a minute before the oxygen masks came down after the hole blew open. ""The crew was pretty calm about it. They walked around and checked on everyone,"" he said. ""But it wasn't like the movies where papers get sucked out of the hole, but you could feel it and hear the noise."" Hansen said most of the passengers were complaining of a pain in their eardrums from a rapid descent. Southwest said Saturday at least two minor injuries were reported, but neither the flight attendant nor the passenger were taken to a hospital. Hansen said one male flight attendant appeared to fall and was bleeding from a facial injury. Yuma International Airport spokeswoman Gen Grosse said passengers were tended to and given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac was close to 100 degrees. Southwest said it provided a full refund, an apology and two complimentary round-trip passes on the airline for future flights. The second flight landed in Sacramento on Friday night. Boeing spokeswoman Julie O'Donnell declined to comment on possible causes of the incident. ""Boeing is committed to ensuring safe flight and to supporting our customers,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are working closely with Southwest and are providing technical assistance to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board as it investigates the incident."" An NTSB investigative team arrived Saturday in Yuma and entered the plane. A total of 288 Boeing 737-300s are currently operating in the U.S. fleet, and 931 operate worldwide, according to the FAA.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh plans to return to Yemen following the investigation into his attempted assassination, a government spokesman said. The announcement follows claims weeks ago by the Yemeni government it had completed the investigation, accusing two leading opposition figures of planning the June palace bombing that left Saleh with severe burns and shrapnel wounds. The Yemeni government switched gears Sunday, saying the investigation was nearly complete. Abdu Ganadi, the government spokesman, did not say when it would be finished nor whether those accused earlier were still considered suspects. ""I cannot give you a specific time of when President Saleh will arrive. But I can assure you that after the palace bombing investigation is over, the president will be back,"" Ganadi said. The Yemeni political crisis started January 16, when youth protesters took to the streets demanding Saleh's resignation. Fears of all-out civil war have spiked in recent months as government forces and people alleged to be Hashed tribesmen slugged it out in the capital. Saleh, who has been faced with widespread anti-government sentiment and militant activity, has been urged to accept a political transition plan that will lead to his departure. He has been in Saudi Arabia for treatment of wounds he suffered in a June 3 attack on his palace. Some see the timing of Ganadi's announcement as a tactic by Saleh to delay stepping down from power. Saleh said in March he would leave office by the end of the year. ""If Saleh leaves office before the end of the year, history will report it that he was ousted by the revolution,"" said Ali Abdul Jabbar, an analyst and the director of the Sanaa-based Dar Ashraf Research Center. Opposition members, though, see it as a way for Saleh to avoid returning to Yemen to face possible criminal prosecution. ""The opposition and revolution youth hope that Ali Abdullah Saleh comes back to Yemen so that they can try him for all the crimes he committed against the people over the last 33 years,"" said Hamid al-Ahmar, a leading opposition figure. Ahmar, the opposition's wealthiest businessman, and Ali Mohsen, the most powerful military leader in the country, were accused by the Yemeni government on August 18 of planning the palace attack.","Official: ""I cannot give you a specific time of when President Saleh will arrive""
An official backtracks on claim that investigation into the attack on Saleh is complete .
Earlier, the government accused two opposition members of planning the attack .
President Saleh is said to be in Saudi Arabia recovering from burn wounds ."
"(WIRED) -- Research In Motion is preparing to release its much-awaited response to the iPad, the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, a month behind schedule. Among other reasons, Adobe Flash is probably contributing to the delay. The PlayBook was supposed to be out the first quarter of 2011 but is now set to release April 19. Some publications speculated on Thursday that the PlayBook's late launch is related to touchscreen supply. The PlayBook also lacks a finished software development kit for making apps, and won't have native mail, messaging and contacts apps. Difficulty getting Flash to work properly on the PlayBook is probably another one of RIM's woes. Let's take a look at the evidence. First, other tablet makers have had trouble with Flash. Motorola's Xoom launched without it, despite the fact that Motorola highlighted Flash support as a key feature. Even though Flash Player 10.2 for Android is now available in the Android Market, the version meant for Android 3.0 Honeycomb (which the Xoom runs) is a prerelease version with significant limitations and lots of instability. Second, sluggish performance and battery drainage have been problems for Flash before, and they're the reason Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave for nixing Flash support on Apple's mobile products. The Samsung Galaxy Tab, which runs an earlier version of Android, is the only major tablet that currently supports a shipping version of the Adobe plugin. Finally, Wired.com's Erik Malinowski tried a PlayBook tablet at CES and reported that Flash performance proved to be a ""choppy and (ironically) limiting experience."" RIM officials at the time were tight-lipped about the tablet's expected battery life, saying only that it would be more than an hour. That was an early version of the tablet, but choppiness in one of its key features doesn't bode well. Without great Flash support, a PlayBook tablet would practically have nothing to do. Last year RIM drummed up Flash support for the upcoming PlayBook, saying that it was going to deliver the full internet experience. That would, in theory, give the PlayBook an edge over the iPad. ""We're not trying to dumb down the internet for a small mobile device,"" says Mike Lazaridis, RIM's CEO, during the PlayBook demonstration. ""What we're trying to do is bring up the performance and capability of the mobile device to the internet."" RIM's planned April 19 launch lines up with Adobe's claims that Flash will be available for tablets ""within a few weeks of Android 3 Honeycomb devices becoming available."" It's been six weeks since Motorola released the Xoom, and April 19 is probably as long as Adobe can wait before Flash can no longer be considered ""a few weeks"" late.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. SOUTH KOREAN CNN STUDENT NEWS VIEWERS: Annyeonghaseyo! We love CNN Student News. We are watching CNN Student News from South Korea. Yay! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Someone introducing our show from half a world away? Might have found something that's more awesome than Fridays. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's get started. First Up: Middle East Policy . AZUZ: First up, President Obama announces a ""new chapter"" in the U.S. policy toward the Middle East. In yesterday's speech, the president talked about all of the upheaval that's been sweeping across that part of the world. He called the revolutions and political protests a wave of change that cannot be denied. President Obama said the U.S. does and will support reforms in the Middle East and North Africa that help ordinary people in the nations there. And he spoke out harshly against governments that have used force on protesters. He also pushed to re-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, saying that the demand for change in the region might help kick-start negotiations. In terms of changes across the entire Middle East, the president said ""it will be years before this story reaches its end."" But he explained why the U.S. supports change. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There's no straight line to progress, and hardship always accompanies a season of hope. The United States of America was founded on the belief that people should govern themselves. And now, we cannot hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who are reaching for their rights, knowing that their success will bring about a world that is more peaceful, more stable and more just. Severe Flooding . AZUZ: The Mississippi River is setting a record in the city of Vicksburg. But not the kind anyone wants to celebrate. The river crested -- reached its highest point -- at just over 57 feet. That's more than a foot higher than the old record, set in 1927. What you should be seeing here is a runway. This is a small airport. These hangars are the only sign of that now. Mississippi also suffered its first flood-related death yesterday. We've reported on some of the people affected by the Mississippi's rising waters. There are also concerns about wildlife, like this coyote you saw a moment ago, who's searching for higher ground. This Day in History . AZUZ: It's May 20th, and on this day in history in 1902, Cuba gained its independence after being ruled by Spain. In 1927, American aviator Charles Lindbergh took off for his famous flight across the Atlantic Ocean. It was the world's first solo, non-stop, transatlantic flight. And five years later, in 1932, Amelia Earhart made her solo, non-stop flight across the Atlantic. It was the first time that goal was accomplished by a female pilot. Japan's Economy . AZUZ: Next up, we have a report from Kyung Lah that's related to Japan's gross domestic product, or GDP. That's the total value of all the goods and services that a country produces in a given amount of time. Japan's GDP is down. And to find out one of the big reasons why, you just need to look back at what happened a couple months ago. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The tsunami that leveled Japan's northern coastline on March 11th is now, two months later, destroying a new terrain: the country's economy. Japan's government announced the nation's gross domestic product fell at a surprising 3.7% annualized rate in the first quarter of 2011. It's the second quarter in a row the GDP has fallen, meaning Japan is now in a recession. Look deeper into the GDP fall, and the numbers are even more grim. Industrial output, which includes all the consumer products Japan sends around the world, plunged 15.3% in March, the worst ever recorded in Japan's history. The auto industry hurt the most. Car production fell almost 60 percent in March. Nissan's President and CEO Carlos Ghosn re-opened a hard-hit factory in the tsunami zone just this week, leading workers in a rah-rah session, but acknowledging full recovery for the company is still months away. In the hard-hit region of Miyagi Prefecture, half of the companies and factories -- 10,000 of them -- are affected by the earthquake and tsunami; 600 expected to close. Japan's government says a quarter of a million foreigners left Japan in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. As far as tourism coming in, it's fallen off a cliff. Airports are reporting a 35 to 60 percent drop in travelers. The nuclear crisis at Fukushima is also fueling concerns of an energy shortage, impacting Japan's ability to produce cars, electronics and parts for months to come. Experts say Japan's economy was already struggling before the disaster. HSBC Senior Economist Frederic Neumann believes there is a chance the disaster could have an unintended positive outcome. FREDERIC NEUMANN, HSBC SENIOR ECONOMIST: The silver lining of this earthquake was that perhaps this will accelerate the reform pressures, and that Japan, then, in a year or two years from now, emerges stronger than it actually had been in the run-up to the earthquake. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Griffin's social studies classes at Faith Middle School in Fort Benning, Georgia! What does an odometer measure? You know what to do! Is it: A) Speed, B) Distance, C) Rotation or D) Temperature? You've got three seconds -- GO! An odometer measures distance, like how far your car has traveled. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Tax on Driving? AZUZ: Some lawmakers are looking into the idea of charging drivers based on their odometers. Right now, part of what you pay to fill up your car is a federal gas tax. That money gets used to build and maintain highways and to help pay for mass transit systems. But with more fuel-efficient cars on the road, people are driving more miles using less gas. So this ""driving tax"" would charge people by the mile, either instead of or in addition to the gas they buy. The more you drive, the more you pay. It might help bring in money to the government, but some critics say collecting mileage information raises concerns about privacy. Should the government know how much you drive? Also, they're worried that this could be unfair to drivers in more rural areas who have to drive farther. Blog Promo . AZUZ: Now, this isn't an official proposal; it's just an idea at this point that some people are talking about. We want you to talk about it! Do you think it's better to tax drivers by the mile or the gallon? Zoom on over to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com and share your opinions. Around in Circles . AZUZ: All right, we're going to stay in the driving lane here and look at something called a roundabout. It's a kind of intersection, but not one with a traditional crossing. A roundabout -- as the name suggests -- is a circle. Officials say they don't make sense in every situation. But Tom Foreman steers us toward one mayor who's all about the circular logic. (BEGIN VIDEO) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: North of Indianapolis, in the suburb of Carmel, Mayor James Brainard has been going around in circles for years over traffic jams. MAYOR JAMES BRAINARD, (R) CARMEL, INDIANA: Roundabouts work everywhere . FOREMAN: He has done away with traffic lights at 80% of his town's major intersections, replacing them with roundabouts. Whirlpools of traffic that keep people moving. BRAINARD: It's made a huge difference in the way our city looks and feels, and the way people get around. FOREMAN: Roundabouts, not to be confused with bigger, more intimidating rotaries on the East Coast, are designed to smoothly sweep drivers in from any direction, slowly guide them around, and just as easily let them out and on their way. Since cars don't stop, commuters save time and, officials say, use 30% less gas at intersections. BRAINARD: A roundabout can handle about 4 to 5 times the amount of traffic in the same amount of time as a stop light intersection can have. FOREMAN: The mayor says intersection accidents are also way down, improving insurance rates. And the city saves money, too. BRAINARD: We don't have to buy a $150,000 signal. We don't have to buy electricity every year. And we don't have to replace it after 15 years when all that mechanical equipment wears out. FOREMAN: Some drivers and pedestrians don't like roundabouts, but local officials insist this simple idea is building up the quality of life here, and that's building up the business climate all around. Tom Foreman, CNN. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: The CNN documentary ""Don't Fail Me"" looks at the state of education in America. If you didn't catch the premiere, the program is re-airing this Saturday, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on CNN. Our educator guide for ""Don't Fail Me"" is in the Spotlight section at CNNStudentNews.com. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, you might be planning a trip to the beach for this summer. These dogs get to take one every day. And it's all thanks to the Doggie Beach Bus. The driver picks up her passengers in the morning. Some of them even wait for her out on the street. Once the beach bus rounds up all of its canine companions, it heads out to the water for an hour of fun. Then it's back on the bus to head home. Daily delivery service to and from the beach? Goodbye . AZUZ: Those are some lucky dogs, fur-real. They even have a designated place to leave the bus: a barking lot. Aack! We just hope they behave during the ride, 'cause a dog who's acting up can be a real pet peeve. All right! For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.

"(CNN) -- For decades, Harlem has been a hub of African-American culture and the NAACP. But this month, the issue of charter schools has turned the New York City neighborhood into a battleground between activists and the 101-year-old civil rights organization. The strain was as clear as the signs and chants during a rally Thursday in Harlem -- ""NAACP, Don't Divide Us, Unite Us!"" About 4% of New York City's roughly 1 million students currently attend charter schools -- which are paid with public funds but typically have different mandates, approaches and staffing arrangements that traditional schools. Another 50,000 students are on waiting lists. A proposal to expand access to charter schools and allow charters to co-locate -- or be based in the same building -- as regular schools has turned some traditional allies against each other. The rift accelerated in May, when the NAACP and the United Federation of Teachers -- a union of 200,000 New York City teachers and school staff -- filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court. Besides asking to stop 22 school closings, the lawsuit urged halting the plan to expand or co-locate 20 charter schools. On its website, the teachers' union calls the initiative illegal and claims it would give ""charter school students more access to school facilities, including libraries, auditoriums and lunchrooms, than students in the public schools that would share the buildings."" While a teachers union opposing charter schools is hardly unprecedented, leaders of the local NAACP said they decided to step in and support the lawsuit in order to best ensure a level playing field for all New York City students. Hazel Dukes, president of the NAACP's New York chapter, said the group is fighting for equal education for all -- similar to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on Brown v. Board of Education, which mandated equal education regardless of race. ""The facilities should be in good condition on both sides,"" said Dukes. ""There should not be a 10 o'clock lunch hour and a 12 o'clock lunch hour. There should be one 12 o'clock lunch hour."" Yet Geoffrey Canada, a nationally renowned educator who is the president and CEO of Harlem Children's Zone, thinks more charter schools in New York City are the solution -- not the problem. That's why he joined parents Thursday calling for the NAACP and teachers' union to drop the lawsuit, or at least the part pertaining to charter schools. Aisha Moore, who attended the rally, said the NAACP's stance is counterproductive if its goal is to support the rejuvenation of New York City schools. ""The NAACP has always backed minorities and African-Americans, so it's just surprising they're moving against us now,"" she said. ""It's like moving backwards, when we should be pushing forward."" Keona Moore, a single parent whose daughter attends a charter school, said that the trickle-down effect of closing schools and limiting options could be devastating. ""I'm not going to put her in a failing public school,"" Moore said. Zakiyah Ansari said that's where the efforts should be focused: on making sure no existing public schools are failing, not to create more charter schools at the expense of traditional ones. The mother of eight insisted that those rallying in Harlem on Thursday and those behind the lawsuit -- like herself -- have more in common than they might think. ""Now we're engaged with parents and having them come out in busloads to fight against other parents fighting for the same thing -- the right for a quality education,"" said Ansari, an organizer with the Alliance for Quality Education. ""We're not asking for more.""","The NAACP and a New York City teachers' union are trying to stop 22 school closures .

"(CNN) -- The New York Yankees made Major League Baseball (MLB) history on Thursday when they became the first team to hit three grand slams in a single game. The match at the Yankee Stadium saw the home team run out 22-9 winners against the Oakland Athletics, with the Yankees hitting home runs with the bases loaded on three occasions. A grand slam is when a team's batter hits a home run with three of his teammates already stood on the bases, resulting in four runs being scored. Robinson Cano, Curtis Granderson and Russell Martin were the three men on the plate to hit the grand slams for the Yankees -- who sit second in the Eastern Conference behind the Boston Red Sox. ""It's pretty amazing,"" Martin, 28, told the MLB's official web site. ""This game has been played for a long time. Pretty much everything has already happened. ""I'm waiting to see who's going to hit four -- I don't know if it's ever going to happen, but we'll see. Three is pretty cool."" Center-fielder Granderson connected with the hit which sealed the historic achievement, and the 30-year-old had to look at the stadium's scoreboard to be sure of what the Yankees had accomplished. ""When I saw it, I was like, 'Oh, wow,'"" Granderson said. ""I'm surprised it hasn't been done before, just with all the great teams and great individual hitters that have come throughout the course of the game."" In the 108-year history of the New York Yankees, the team have only ever hit two grand slams in a match on three occasions -- and never at their own ballpark. Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams were the last two players to record grand slams in the same game, during a trip to the Toronto Blue Jays on September 14 1999.","The New York Yankees have become the first team in MLB history to hit three grand slams .

"Cape Girardeau, Missouri (CNN) -- The comeback story of the one-eyed pitcher is the buzz of baseball dugouts in the Mississippi River Valley, passed down the bench like a bag of sunflower seeds. No one would have called Jordan Underwood a quitter if he had never walked onto a pitcher's mound again. But two years after a line drive smashed his cheekbone and destroyed his left eye, Underwood is back up on the hill, starting games. And winning. Underwood, who now pitches with tinted safety glasses covering his acrylic left eye, is undefeated this season, 4-0, for Southeast Missouri State. ""To me, it doesn't seem like a big deal. I guess I am kind of a modest guy,"" Underwood, a senior, told CNN. ""I just hope this is a teaching tool. Maybe if someone else is having a tough time -- not necessarily losing an eye -- and my story can inspire somebody else and motivate them, guess it's all worth it in the end."" Two years ago, when Underwood played for Seminole Junior College in Oklahoma, one of his pitches was launched back at his head by the batter. Ky Burgess catches for Underwood at Southeast Missouri State now and was behind the plate to see and hear a baseball obliterate an eye-socket, but not a young man's will. ""I heard this smack when it hit his face,"" Ky recalls. ""My first thought was: 'Oh my God! Is he alive?' He was not moving. We did not know if he was conscious. It's one of the scariest things I have seen in my life, and I am still jumpy when I see a ball hit back through the box."" Underwood says doctors told him if the ball had struck a few inches away, on his temple, he might have died. ""It took about a month or six weeks after that (accident) for me to realize I still wanted to play,"" Underwood said. ""I told myself I at least want to try to make this work."" Underwood said he started from scratch, adapting in practice to pitching with one eye. The 22-year-old explains he needed to focus more on certain spots around home plate to make up for the change in depth perception. Underwood is left handed, so his remaining good right eye has a wide open view of the plate. The baseball experts say he would not be pitching if the line drive had crushed that closer-to-home-plate right eye. ""I wasn't afraid of signing him,"" said Mark Hogan, his current coach at Southeast Missouri. ""I knew nothing was wrong with his arm. And after I met him I was 100 percent in. ""He was looking for an opportunity and was serious about it. He was sort of dealt a bad hand. But he said he would give it his best shot. So he was my kind of guy."" Underwood's journey back almost got derailed by an obscure NCAA rule concerning all athletes missing one of a pair of organs, such as a kidney. Those players must get waivers and signed paperwork confirming they are aware of the risk of accidentally losing the remaining organ. Underwood, his parents, doctors and others have signed that they are aware an accident to his right eye would leave him blind. ""He hung in there,"" Hogan told CNN, admiring the way Hogan also took on the regulatory obstacles to his return. Some 10 separate signatures and a batter's box full of NCAA paperwork later, Underwood got cleared and began fooling hitters again last spring. Burgess, the catcher, describes Underwood's assortment of pitches as moving fastball, a sharp-breaking slider, a great curve ball and a change up ""looking just like his fastball until it dives down at the last second."" Underwood's fastball is timed out at 84 or 85 miles per hour. Underwood says he's not heard a lot from any teams about being picked in the major league draft in June, but adds there is always a chance. ""I'd really like to work in public relations,"" Underwood, a marketing major, said. ""Maybe I could do this for a team or sports organization, something in that area."" But graduation is still a few weeks off and until then, Underwood still has the final weekend of this season and the possibility of the NCAA playoffs. For every batter who will face Underwood, there's dealing with those four pitches and a competitive edge built up from losing an eye and regaining his swagger on the mound.","Two years ago, a line drive smashed into Jordan Underwood, destroying his left eye .

"Washington (CNN) -- As winds, rains and fears calmed in the Washington, D.C., area Sunday, hundreds arrived at the newly opened Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Sunday afternoon to revel, share stories and celebrate. Sunday's planned dedication of the $120 million Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial in Washington was to coincide with the 48th anniversary of the historic March on Washington and King's famed ""I Have A Dream"" speech. But while many of the MLK weekend events went ahead, the centerpiece Sunday dedication was postponed as the East Coast hunkered down for the battering winds and rains of Hurricane Irene. As the clouds cleared Sunday afternoon, visitors to the memorial were greeted by blue skies and mostly intact bleachers that had been placed ahead of the ceremonies. Officials on site say there was little debris left by the time crowds began to swell, which meant a pleasant experience for revelers. ""I'm very impressed. It is done just right,"" said visitor Daniel Boyle from Virginia. ""It's a powerful projection of Martin Luther King's personality and achievements. It captures it."" Boyle was accompanied by his daughter Ann from Washington, who noted that the atmosphere in the crowds was friendly and hopeful. Many of the visitors had come from around the country for this weekend's events only to be stuck inside during the rains. Al Lee, a teacher from California, says he made the decision in January to attend the dedication and, despite the event cancellation, he made the most of the weekend. ""I'm glad to be here. I'm glad to have enjoyed the opportunity to be here. I'm blessed."" The memorial site, which features a striking 30-foot statue of King gazing out on the iconic Tidal Basin, lies between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial on the National Mall. The statue, representing a ""Stone of Hope,"" sits forward from a ""Mountain of Despair."" Visitors pass through the mountain on their way to King's statue and an expanse along the Basin rimmed with an inscription wall covered with stone carvings of some of his most famous quotes. The 4-acre area will also feature the iconic cherry blossom trees that draw thousands of tourists to the Mall each spring. In between snapping jubilant photos, visitors Sunday found much to reflect on in the writings and visuals of the memorial. Teacher Travis Parker spoke of feeling ""refueled"" after his visit, ready to take lessons from the memorial home with him. ""We've come quite a ways, but not far enough,"" Parker said. ""The fact that we have an African-American president doesn't mean that we've arrived, but that there are possibilities.""","Dedication postponed because of Hurricane Irene .

"Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina (CNN) -- Hurricane Irene lashed coastal North Carolina late Friday and had metropolitan New York in its sights, staying on an unusual track that could bring deadly storm surge, heavy rainfall and misery to millions. With winds at 100 mph, Irene churned toward an anticipated 7 to 8 a.m. landfall Saturday between Beaufort and Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. The latter had a curfew in effect. But the massive storm -- which is shutting down hundreds of airline flights, Broadway shows and the New York subway system -- won't be content to curve away from the mainland after striking North Carolina. Instead, a weakening Irene will head for the Jersey shore, New York and southern New England, dangerous conditions in tow, forecasters said. ""We're going to see tropical storm-force winds for as much as 24 hours in some places and, in North Carolina, near and to the east of the center, they could experience hurricane force winds for as much as 10 hours,"" Ed Rappaport of the National Hurricane Center told CNN. Irene roiled the surf and blew strong gusts of rain into the Carolinas as it neared landfall. Ernie Seneca, a North Carolina spokesman, said authorities were concerned about the ""entire eastern half of the state. This hurricane could potentially impact an area that includes 20 counties and 3.5 million people."" Irene was about 195 miles south-southwest of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 11 p.m. ET Friday, according to the hurricane center. Hurricane warnings were in effect from Little River Inlet, North Carolina, to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. A hurricane warning means sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are expected within 36 hours. President Barack Obama warned that Irene could be a ""hurricane of historic proportions."" The Category 2 storm had top sustained winds of 100 mph, and it is expected to be borderline Category 1, with maximum winds of 95 mph, when it comes ashore Saturday and moves toward the Mid-Atlantic states, according to forecasters. ""This could still be a large and powerful storm,"" North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue said. Evacuations were ongoing in 19 counties. An ocean surge of up to 11 feet is possible in coastal North Carolina, tearing away beaches and probably damaging homes, businesses and other structures before sliding up the East Coast to New England, Hurricane Center Director Bill Read said. Storm surges of 4 feet to 8 feet are possible in the Virginia Tidewater region, with 3- to 6-foot surges farther north along the New Jersey shore, Read said. Other areas were under tropical storm warnings or watches. A tropical storm warning indicates that sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph are expected within 36 hours. A watch means such winds are possible. New York City issued what Mayor Michael Bloomberg said was its first mandatory evacuation order, covering low-lying areas of all five of the city's boroughs. About 250,000 people are affected. Authorities warned of widespread and prolonged power outages, flash flooding and storm surges that could flood low-lying communities and possibly inundate subway systems. The New York Metropolitan Transit Authority will shut down its system at noon Saturday. Five airports in metropolitan New York will close to arriving flights beginning at noon Saturday. New Jersey Transit will shut down at noon, and the transit system in Philadelphia will halt service at 12:30 a.m. Boston said it intends to keep its system operating. The Garden State Parkway in New Jersey closed 98 miles of southbound lanes Friday night. The storm also was forcing cancellations of concerts, sporting events and, in New York, all the weekend's Broadway shows. Authorities on Friday urged residents who needed to leave to do so immediately. ""The sun is shining, but don't be misled,"" Bloomberg said. ""There is a very dangerous storm headed in our direction."" Even guests in Atlantic City's iconic casinos were being asked to go. And the boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland, will be quiet during one of the busiest times of the year. Some plucky businesses were digging in. A restaurant in Wilmington, North Carolina, posted a message reading, ""We are open until the letters fly off this sign,"" CNN affiliate WRAL reported. Steve Aarthun, a resident of Wilmington, was preparing for his first hurricane. His wife, Sally, has seen three. They bought a generator, stocked up on bottled water and flashlights, and filled the bathtub with water. ""I feel the lull,"" Aarthun said mid-afternoon Friday. ""You just have the sense it is coming."" The couple lives about a mile from the ocean and were hopeful they could avoid the storm surge. Drew Goulde, a Kill Devil Hills resident and a maintenance worker at a hotel, was surfing, taking advantage of a higher-than-usual tide. ""It is fun,"" Goulde said. ""I'm just messing around right now. It's kind of heavy out there, though."" Governments and private agencies launched an immense effort to prepare for the storm. ""All indications point to this being a historic hurricane,"" Obama said from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, shortly before cutting short his vacation to return to Washington. The mayor of Washington declared a state of emergency. The move opens up additional resources to deal with a storm that Vincent Gray said would ""bring heavy rain, flash floods and high winds to the area."" The federal government began moving tons of supplies to military bases and other staging areas. The U.S. Navy was sending 38 ships to sea, 13% percent of the deployable battle force vessels, a U.S. Navy official said. Tens of millions of people could be affected by the storm as it moves up the densely populated East Coast, and officials urged residents to be prepared for the worst. In New York, Bloomberg said, ""The low-lying coastal areas that will be endangered most by storm surge include Coney Island and Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn, Far Rockaway and Broad Channel in Queens, South Beach, Midland Beach, and other low-lying areas on Staten Island, Battery Park City in Manhattan, and some small sections of the Bronx."" He added, ""Now, we have never done a mandatory evacuation before, and we wouldn't be doing this now if we didn't think the storm had the potential to be very serious."" Amtrak, Greyhound and major U.S. airlines canceled routes and flights. American Airlines canceled all flights in the Washington area from noon Saturday to noon Sunday, said spokesman Ed Martelle. AirTran Airways has canceled 308 flights through Monday, according to an airline spokeswoman. JetBlue Airways has canceled almost 900 flights in the Northeast ahead of the storm. Most of those are Sunday and Monday flights out of the New York metro area and Boston, said spokesman Mateo Lleras. Delta Air Lines will cancel 1,300 flights from Saturday to Monday, spokesman Anthony Black said. Southwest Airlines said it is canceling scores of flights to and from the East Coast. US Airways is planning ""significant flight schedule reductions"" at a number of airports, including Reagan Washington National, John F. Kennedy International and Newark International.

"(CNN) -- The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center canceled a tsunami warning less than an hour after it was issued Wednesday for Kermadec Island, Tonga and New Zealand. A tsunami was detected following a major earthquake nearby. A 1-meter-high tsunami washed ashore at Raoul Island, the largest and northernmost of the main Kermadec Islands, said Vinhlu Hsu, a geophysicist with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii. It caused no damage, he said. The tsunami formed after an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 shook the Kermadec Islands at 7:03 a.m. Thursday (3:03 p.m. ET Wednesday), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake was centered 163 kilometers (101 miles) east of Raoul Island, and 913 kilometers (567 miles) south of Nuku'alofa, Tonga, the survey said. The depth was a relatively shallow 20 kilometers (12.4 miles). ""Sea-level readings confirm that a tsunami was generated,"" the center said. New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defense and Emergency Management said it was keeping a marine threat warning in place throughout Thursday for waters off northern New Zealand. Spokesman Vince Cholewa told CNN that boaters should not take to sea or operate in estuaries and people should stay off the beaches and coasts. ""There's no foreseen threat of inundation, but tides and waves could cause serious problems for boaters,"" said Cholewa.  ""We don't want people sightseeing down along the beaches today."" Boaters should take extra care to secure their ships in harbor, and should contact portmasters for the latest conditions, he urged. The West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunami was expected along the Pacific Coast in the U.S. or Canada. In coastal locations that have experienced strong shaking, underwater landslides can trigger local tsunamis, the center said. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","1-meter-high tsunami washes ashore at Raoul Island .

"(WIRED) -- From the results of the Pwn2Own hacking competition, it looks like Android and Windows Phone 7 are tough nuts to crack. It took only two days for hackers to crack into the Apple and Blackberry operating systems during the three-day Pwn2Own tournament last week, while Android and Windows Phone 7 models were abandoned and left unhacked by the end of the contest. Is this because their operating systems are more secure? Yes and no. ""The survival of a target at Pwn2Own does not automatically declare it safer than a target that went down,"" last year's Internet Explorer Pwn2Own winner Peter Vreugdenhil cautions. The contestants who were lined up to beat the Android and WP7 devices in the competition withdrew for a variety of reasons. Pwn2Own, now in its fifth year, is a hacking competition divided into two areas: web browsers and mobile phones. This year, Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, Apple Safari 5.0.3, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome were the web-browser targets. In the mobile phone category, the Dell Venue Pro (Windows Phone 7), Apple iPhone 4 (iOS), BlackBerry Torch 9800 (Blackberry 6) and Nexus S (Android) were targeted. The OS and browser versions were frozen last week (so for example, Apple's Safari 5.0.4 update was not used), ensuring that all contestants are working on the same version of each OS. Pwning and owning occurs if the hacker defeats the frozen version. If the exploit they used still exists in the current firmware, they are also eligible to receive a monetary prize. The 2011 Pwn2Own competition ran March 9 to 11. Vreugdenhil says many different factors determine how hard a target is to hack. There's the safety of the software itself, the exploit mitigations that are already in place for that software, and then the amount of research that has already been conducted (which can speed up the process of writing an actual exploit). Firefox and Chrome web browsers were also left undefeated because contestants withdrew from Pwn2Own. ""Chrome has the advantages of having multiple exploit-mitigation techniques that certainly make it more difficult to hack. As for Android, we see no particular reason why Android would be harder to hack than one of the other targets."" Safari, Chrome, iPhone, Android and Blackberry all use WebKit in their browsers, which means that they are all susceptible to exploitation through the browser -- and that's exactly how the iPhone and Blackberry were attacked. Charlie Miller, a Pwn2Own veteran, worked with Dion Blazakis to hack the iPhone 4 in this year's competition using a flaw in its Mobile Safari Web browser and a ""specially-crafted webpage."" A team of 3 (Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and Ralf Philipp Weinmenn) defeated the BlackBerry Torch using a similar technique. So what did the contest's organizers think of the outcome of 2011's Pwn2Own? Vreugdenhil and other organizers were not surprised that the iPhone went down quickly. It has been a major target and a lot of research has already been done on that platform. Android's survival was a bit of a surprise, since it is also a big target and had four contestants lined up. Although no device is unhackable, some factors contribute to a safer product. For those that are out to find the safest phone on the market, Vreugdenhil says you'll want to compare features such as DEP (Data Execution Prevention), ASLR (address space layout randomization), Sandboxing, code signing and the ease with which software can be updated on the device.

"(OPRAH.com) -- One afternoon a few months ago, my husband walked into the house carrying a cookbook and then stood in the kitchen for a long time, turning the pages, reading it. This was interesting. He looked deeply absorbed. When his cell phone rang, he went out onto the porch for a minute, the cookbook still opened on the counter, and I came over to inspect. He had been interrupted in the midst of ""How to Choose a Pork Roast."" There was a silhouette of a pig, connected by arrows to detailed line drawings of 13 hefty-looking cuts of raw meat. In retrospect I see that I was completely dim about what was already under way in our household, but I remember nodding to myself and thinking, ""Oh, okay. Meat."" The whole book was about meat, serious meat, the kind I'd never been any good at cooking: beef chuck, short ribs, leg of lamb, brisket. Bill wanted more meat in our dinner menus, apparently, and had brought me an instruction manual -- 600 pages long, I couldn't help noticing, and with the same sort of heft as the sirloin pork roast in the picture. I was studying the corned beef recipe, which called for boiling up your own brine and then submerging the meat in it for 12 days, when Bill came back in and made a complicated spousal throat-clearing noise. ""Uh, that's for me,"" he said. ""My cookbook."" I might have been more startled if Bill had said ""My mascara,"" or ""My pedicure kit,"" but I doubt it. Every domestic arrangement that works reasonably well is stretched out over a web of understandings about who does what, and for 24 years -- three houses, that is, and two children and two extended families and a long, noisy, generally good-natured parade of teenagers and exchange students and visiting nephews and whole soccer teams clumping in and out -- I have been the one who cooks. Oprah.com: How chocolate cake can help you win over the men in your life . I don't want to give the wrong impression here: I'm a slovenly housekeeper, blessed with a gratifying inability to see grime at all until the hour before a fussy relative is about to arrive. But I can follow a recipe. I keep a stack of CDs in the corner of the kitchen, because I like singing to Ella Fitzgerald or the Rolling Stones while I'm dropping cut-up things into a hot frying pan. In the days when carbohydrates were fashionable, I used to make risotto with fresh corn and goat cheese; and one of my daughter's friends once told me he craved my chocolate chip cookies so much that if I made some for the school ski bus, he wouldn't smoke any pot for the entire trip. I had a really muscular period a while back that involved twice-risen whole wheat bread and home-canned apricot preserves. Not that I'm invested in this. It was clear, is all I'm saying. Delineated. Mom tears recipes from the food pages and puts a green vegetable on the plates every night; Dad does barbecue on the weekends and on the nights when Mom's away takes a pizza out of the freezer or makes boiled noodles with sliced hot dogs on top. Bill did have a way of broiling chicken that I never quite understood, something with kosher salt and high heat so that even the breasts were juicy and crispy at the same time, but I elected not to think about that. It was much more satisfactory to smile gently at him, making a visible effort not to roll my eyes, when he asked where we kept the spatulas. If Bill were reading over my shoulder right now, he'd try to sell you some story about how every time he offered to help I would wave my large kitchen knife at him and tell him everything was under control, but this would be a tremendous, tremendous exaggeration. Often I didn't have a knife. Or if I did, I wouldn't say I waved it. I was busy slicing things with it in exactly the right way, which was essential to whatever I was cooking and difficult to explain clearly to anybody else, unless, of course, that person happened to be doing it wrong. Why a sensible adult would want to interfere with this simple and fully understandable system of household order I cannot really say, except that it might be like that part in the action thrillers when the cable starts to fray on the mountain gondola with 13 passengers inside and then shot by shot the metal threads snap off in slow-mo and the gondola's tipping and people are shrieking and finally the butcher sets a new meat cookbook out on the counter where a husband can spot it while his wife is next door buying flowers. Oprah.com: How cooking with cardamom spiced up a marriage . I think that's what happened. Anyway, here's what Bill made for dinner one week after bringing home his cookbook, having waited until an afternoon when I was gone so that he could conduct a stealth sortie into the kitchen: Oven-Roasted Tri-Tip. He used the meat thermometer. He served the tri-tip already sliced thin, perfectly rare, in its juices. I poked at it suspiciously, made a polite remark regarding its flavor, and then ate about 18 slices. Two days later: Oven-Roasted Tri-Tip with Southwestern Spice Rub. Three days after that: Sautéed Pork Chops with Wilted Greens, Pine Nuts, and Raisins. By the time he got to Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Dried Cranberry and Apple Stuffing and Cranberry-White Wine Reduction Sauce, Bill had bought a new meat thermometer, digital, with protruding wires and flashing lights that made it look as though he'd lifted the whole apparatus from an intensive care unit. He had driven to the Indo-Pakistani food store one city over, brought home a dozen bags of spices, and rooted around in the cupboards for empty jars to store them in. Six o'clock had become a delicate, perilous time at the kitchen end of our house; a white-wrapped butcher package would show up on the counter, and I would say to myself, ""Ah! We should talk about this!"" But then we wouldn't. I would stand around the kitchen for a while, looking for some lettuce to wash, and finally Bill would stride in and start pulling out frying pans and turning on three burners at once and flipping through measuring cups. I couldn't figure out how he had found the measuring cups, but he had, and furthermore he appeared to have mastered the trick of opening that cabinet door slowly, so the bud vases and the tea bag boxes don't fall out on your head. Oprah.com: Lunch at Bergdorf's - A promising recipe for a lifelong friendship . And now here he was on Roasted Pork Tenderloin night with his dried cranberries and his apples and his big damn cookbook, and he was holding a measuring cup up to the light, pouring wine precisely to the three-quarters mark, and he glanced over and saw the expression on my face. We regarded each other for a minute. He scooped a wooden spoon into the stuffing, keeping his eyes on me; he had already sliced the meat, I noted stiffly, and fanned the pieces down the length of my grandmother's china serving platter. ""You should taste this,"" he said. It smelled ridiculously good -- sage, I guessed, and butter and garlic and onion, and maybe some thyme, and the faint sweetness of the fruit. I did a rapid calculation of the number of holiday tables at which Bill must have watched me push turkey around my plate while taking thirds on stuffing, and somewhere in the back of my head a tiny cloud of reason began to form. I thought about gratitude, about adaptability, about the splendid and infinite reach of marital give-and-take. I thought about compromise. I thought about grace. I thought about pecans, which it seemed to me the stuffing needed, you know, for the crunch, and not cut too big, and perhaps a bit more pepper. But did I say that? I did not. What I said was, ""If you start baking desserts, I will blow up the kitchen."" Get the recipe for Cynthia Gorney's Chocolate Chip Cookies .

"(CNN) -- Scores of people died Thursday in and around the restive Syrian city of Hama, activists said, corroborating reports of widespread casualties a day after the start of a new military clampdown targeting protesters. At least 109 people died in and around Hama, said Avaaz, a global activist group, citing a medical source. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 30 people were killed Wednesday. ""The brutality continues in Hama on the fourth day of Ramadan. Communication with the city and surrounding area is very difficult as the electricity supply has been cut off,""  Avaaz said. The activist group, citing the medical source, said scores more were wounded. ""Bodies are lying in the streets as ambulances and private vehicles are unable to get through,"" the group said. The western Syrian city is the center of the country's anti-government movement, whose efforts have prompted a crackdown by security personnel on the huge demonstrations there in an effort to secure the city. Citing the medical source, Avaaz said bodies taken to al Hourani Hospital had been shot at close range, most of them in the head. The geographic breakdown was 48 dead in the town of Hai al Hadyr, 31 in the town of Janoub al Manaab, and 30 in the northern part of Hama and the Hamidia area, it said. One resident who spoke to CNN by satellite phone said some of the casualties who were taken to hospitals died there because the facilities were without electricity. There were reports of a breakdown and cutoff in communications and electricity accompanying the siege, and of the military bombing the city. The resident said entrances of the city were blocked, with no one getting in or out, and snipers were stationed across the city. People who tried to leave, he said, were being shot. The man said about 10 people had been killed and dozens more were wounded. Hama, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising. Memories of that siege, carried out by late President Hafez al-Assad, the father of President Bashar al-Assad, have reverberated during the nearly five-month uprising, and the ongoing violence in Hama has prompted international anger against the al-Assad regime. Reports of violence also emanated from the capital. Four people who were at al-Rifai Mosque in Kafr Sousa Square in the suburbs of Damascus offered separate but similar accounts. One of the sources is a representative of the Syrian Revolution Coordination Union, an opposition group. Two of the others were among the protesters. After prayers, worshipers exited the rear of the mosque to join an anti-government demonstration, but were met by about 24 thugs -- men in civilian clothes armed with guns and batons, the sources told CNN in telephone interviews. The men fired into the air and beat some of the worshipers as they left the buildings, the sources said. Upon reaching Kafr Sousa Square, where they chanted for freedom and the fall of the regime, they were set upon by gunmen and others who threw rocks at them. At that point, the demonstrators returned to the mosque and closed themselves inside, the sources said. A few militia members entered the front yard of the mosque carrying batons and stun guns and attacked the protesters who were there, the sources said. The protesters were allowed safe passage out of the mosque after they promised to end their protests, the sources said. But the protesters were expected to resume Friday, when rebels said the theme would be ""God is With Us."" CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to the country by international journalists, including CNN's. The move came a day after the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties. But Amnesty International on Thursday slammed the council's response as ""completely inadequate"" and ""limp"" because it failed to take action. The council issued a presidential statement, which carries no enforcement weight. ""It's crucial that a U.N. Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible,"" said Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations. ""Unfortunately, the Security Council has also failed to provide support for such a mission."" He noted that Syrian authorities have not permitted a U.N. fact-finding delegation into the country to investigate the situation. ""The U.N. must act now, with a firm and legally binding position. At the very least, its position must include imposing an arms embargo, freezing the assets of President al-Assad and other officials suspected of responsibility for crimes against humanity, and referring the situation to the ICC prosecutor,"" he said, in reference to the International Criminal Court. Two permanent members of the Security Council weighed in on how to proceed. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Syria's citizens should solve their problems themselves, state-run RIA Novosti said. ""The settlement in this country should be carried out by the Syrians themselves without outside interference and should be based on an all-Syria dialogue, which is the only way to resolve the conflict,"" the ministry said in a statement. But later Thursday, RIA Novosti said that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told reporters that he had told al-Assad during meetings and in letters that ""it is necessary to hold a referendum, put up with the opposition, restore peace and create a modern state."" Medvedev added that if al-Assad were to fail, he would be destined to ""a sad fate, and ultimately we will also have to make some kind of decisions."" French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday that the Security Council may take a tougher stance on Syria ""if nothing changes on the Syrian side."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, issued on Thursday an update about Deir Ezzor, a city in the country's northeastern region. It said an opposition leader in the city reported that the government had launched a series of measures to punish residents. They include not paying government employees, halting wheat deliveries to bakeries, preventing hospitals from rescuing wounded protesters, and asking governmental medical staff to leave their posts. Some pharmacists have closed their shops over fears that they will be detained for giving medications to wounded protesters. Meanwhile, al-Assad has issued a decree authorizing a multiple-party political system, state media reported Thursday. Syrian lawmakers had already passed a law granting citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life ""through peaceful and democratic means,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. However, the Syrian opposition has argued the decrees are intended for show and will not effect real change. That's because it is questionable whether the move, absent constitutional reform, could end decades of single-party Baathist rule. One of the articles of the Syrian constitution guarantees supremacy for the ruling Baath party. CNN's Kamal Ghattas and Jack Maddox contributed to this story .","NEW: Friday's theme will be ""God is With Us""

"(Rolling Stone)  -- When Adele finished a soaring rendition of ""Hometown Glory"" to open her set at Washington D.C.'s 9:30 Club last night -- the kickoff gig for her North American tour -- she did a mini-curtsy and took a long swig from a teacup. ""I'm really, really, really nervous,"" she told the mostly female sell-out crowd. ""The last time I was here, the guy who inspired '21' was with me."" The assembled roared in solidarity. It was the beginning of a non-stop monologue that continued between the set's 16 songs, drawn mostly from ""21,"" the deeply personal break-up album that has sold 1.5 million copies this year. It seemed that if she stopped talking, even for a moment, the emotions that clearly simmered just below the surface might explode. Her fans could easily have filled a venue much larger than the 1,200-capacity club -- as, clearly, could her voice. But Adele's nerves might not be ready for anything less intimate. Choose the cover of Rolling Stone: Vote now! Wearing a high-belted black dress and standing mostly still on a set seemingly designed to look like a retro London flat, with Persian rugs and two dozen vintage lampshades dangling at various heights, Adele belted out her heartache in song after earnest song. The material might have turned grating or repetitive in the hands of a lesser talent, but the 23-year-old Brit's reservoir is so deep and the passion so palpable that it's hard to take your eyes off her. ""I don't know why I get so hot -- it's not like I'm dancing like Beyoncé,"" she quipped after the particularly melancholic ""Don't You Remember"" before releasing a signature laugh-honk and moving on to gabbing about the royal wedding. ""I liked the kissing bit best,"" she said. ""They just seemed like any boyfriend and girlfriend."" ""Turning Tables,"" one of the angrier tracks on 21, was given a smart, spare arrangement that highlighted the power of Adele's voice, which carried effortlessly into the high rafters, pulling goosebumps from hundreds of arms -- and more than a few tears. Read excerpts from Rolling Stone's cover story on Adele . One of the night's biggest ovations came when the singer introduced her cover of ""If It Hadn't Been for Love,"" by bluegrass band the Steeldrivers. ""It's about shooting your wife,"" she said. ""I'm not condoning it, but I want to shoot a few f***ing men in my life."" When she played the re-imagined cover of the Cure's ""Lovesong"" from 21, she mentioned that the arrangement was originally written for Barbra Streisand, who passed on it. She went on to list her ""favorites"" as Streisand, Bette Midler, Etta James, and June Carter -- a list that accurately reflects Adele's own potent mix of soul and schmaltz. Rolling Stone: Before Adele -- a history of British soul divas . As the set wound down, it was clear the weight was lifting off her shoulders. ""I can't believe I've managed to wear my high heels throughout the whole show!"" she blurted before launching into ""Someone Like You,"" perhaps the most devastating song on 21, in which she confronts her former lover's marriage. ""Nevermind, I'll find someone like you/I wish nothing but the best for you too,"" she sang with shaking hands. ""Don't forget me, I beg."" Returning for a triumphant encore -- ""The shoes are off!"" she declared -- Adele didn't so much deliver her propulsive, bitter signature hit ""Rolling in the Deep"" as introduce it. This time, her booming voice was just the loudest in a sing-along in which her thousand-plus tribe shared the cathartic joy of acceptance and resilience. Adele, in all her pop-culture referencing, quippy glory, delivers that as well as anyone. Copyright © 2010 Rolling Stone.","Adele gave a non-stop monologue that continued between her set's 16 songs .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Do you ever wonder who decided potato chips should come in such a loud, crinkly package? And why a bag of chips? Why not a box? Or a can? Someone had to decide. Luckily, you can take comfort in knowing that the ""bag of chips"" decision was made by an expert. Packaging, the art of developing appropriate vehicles for consumer goods to arrive safely at our homes in, is actually a major at multiple colleges in the U.S. And packaging isn't even the strangest college degree out there. We rounded up some of the most unique and interesting degrees offered at colleges and universities around the country, and then went a step further to find out what, exactly, people do with these degrees when they graduate. Here, a look at some of the nation's most interesting college programs, and the post-grad job possibilities. CareerBuilder.com: An entire career at one company . 1. Race track management . The Race Track Industry Program at the University of Arizona is the only program of its kind, providing students with the background necessary for a number of career paths in the horse racing industry. Should students choose the ""animal path,"" they will graduate prepared to work as a horse trainer or breeder. Those opting for the ""business path`"" will be suited to work on the management side of the industry. So how do students fare in the real world after graduating from such a unique program? According to Douglas Reed, the program's director, graduates do pretty well. ""We have a placement rate in excess of 80 percent immediately upon graduation and [students] receive jobs in all facets of the industry due to the nature of the two paths and the broad based knowledge they receive,"" Reed says. ""Some students start at a racetrack in mid-level management or entry level jobs, others work with the horses either on farms or at the track for a trainer. Still others enter the business in related companies [like those] that process wagers or service the industry."" Interested in finding out more about what can be done with the degree? A list of alum can be found on the program's website. 2. Packaging . Students who enroll in one of the nation's few undergraduate packaging programs don't spend four years learning to think outside the box. They learn to think about the box. A degree in packaging teaches students how to create the most economically, aesthetically, environmentally and technically sound packages for the good we use on a daily basis. According to the University of Wisconsin-Stout, graduates of its packaging program go on to work for companies like Snap-on Tools, Frito-Lay, Kohler and FedEx. In a survey on 2009 graduates of the UWS program, in the months following graduation, 95 percent of packaging graduates were employed, 90 percent in a field related to their major. 3. Viticulture and enology . In laymen's terms, Cornell University's Viticulture and Enology Program is it's school of Grapes and Wine. Though the school began offering coursework in the discipline in the early 1990s, Viticulture and Enology only recently became an official major at Cornell. According to Kari Richards, Cornell's Viticulture and Enology Major Coordinator, there are currently about 35 students enrolled in the major and 20 enrolled in the minor. ""Of the approximately 20 graduates over the past five years, the majority are involved in the industry,"" Richards says. ""Some have continued enology-related studies in graduate school, others travel worldwide to gain experience in harvest and crush, [and a] few will or have returned to the home winery/vineyard."" CareerBuilder.com: Get the most out of a fall-back job . 4. Puppetry . The University of Connecticut is one of only two schools in the country to offer an undergraduate degree in puppetry arts, and the only school in the country offering a Master's program. According to the program's website, enrollment is limited to only 22 students, who take classes like ""Trends in Contemporary American Puppetry"" and ""Marionette Construction."" According to the site, ""graduates of the program perform and design for theatres around the world; appear in, build for and manage internationally recognized television programs and films; write books; design toys; teach children; and direct prominent schools and museums."" 5. Decision making . Indiana University's Kelley School of Business offers a Doctorate degree in decision sciences, a program literally designed to help future business leaders analyze and make decisions. Though the name may make this degree sound like fluff, the course of study is quite rigorous. According to the program's website, ""Decision Sciences is devoted to the study of quantitative methods used to aid decision making in business environments.

"(CNN) -- After months of not-so-coy will-he-or-won't-he political flirtation, Fred Thompson has finally and officially announced that he is a candidate for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. Fred Thompson joins the race for the GOP nomination only four months before the first voting. ""I am running for president of the United States,"" he said during a taping of NBC's ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" Wednesday evening, drawing applause and cheers from the audience. It's the same venue that helped launch the electoral career of another celebrity-turned-politician, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thompson also talked about his decision to join the race in a webcast that went online early Thursday. ""I'm going to give this campaign all that I have to give, and I hope that you'll join me,"" Thompson said in the video announcement posted on his campaign Web site. ""Our country needs us to win next year, and I'm ready to lead that effort."" Thompson, 65, who has had a multifaceted career as a prosecutor, lobbyist, actor and U.S. senator from Tennessee, is angling for a conservative base that has yet to coalesce around a favorite. His decision to run was widely expected, after he formed an exploratory committee in June to begin raising money. But political observers say Thompson may be late by entering the race months after his GOP rivals. The first voting is only four months away and the other candidates have been in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond for months. But Thompson dismissed suggestions that he took too long to make the decision. ""I don't think people are going to say, 'You know, that guy would make a very good president, but he just didn't get in soon enough,""' Thompson told Leno. ""If you can't get your message out in a few months, you're probably not ever going to get it out."" In his video announcement, Thompson touted his support for what he termed common-sense conservative principles, including low taxes, free markets, balanced budgets and the ""sanctity of life."" ""These principles made our country great, and we should re-dedicate ourselves to them, not abandon them,"" he said. On the Iraq war, Thompson also challenged Democrats pushing for a withdrawal of U.S. forces, embracing President Bush's view that the U.S. effort in Iraq is a central front in the war on terror. ""Our courage as a people must match that of the brave men and women in uniform fighting for us,"" he said. ""They know if we abandon our efforts, or appear weak and divided, we'll pay a heavy price for it in the future."" Even before he became a candidate, Thompson showed well in recent national poll averages, trailing only the front-runner, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. His acting role on NBC's popular ""Law and Order"" TV shows has buoyed his name recognition and prompted comparisons to another actor-turned-president beloved by conservatives, Ronald Reagan. Thursday morning, Thompson will begin a two-day tour across Iowa, whose precinct caucuses traditionally kick off the nominating season in January.  See Thompson's new presidential campaign buses » . He will travel from Des Moines to Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Mason City, Cedar Rapids and Davenport on a brown, yellow and red bus festooned with the slogan ""United By Our Core Beliefs."" After his Iowa tour, Thompson will take his campaign to three other states with early primary contests -- New Hampshire, Florida and South Carolina. ""Expectations are sky high, which means he'd better perform flawlessly out of the box or a lot of people are going to start grumbling that he's not the great savior we thought he was,"" said Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Thompson's virtual campaign kickoff came just hours after his GOP rivals held their latest campaign debate Wednesday night in New Hampshire -- an event he skipped to unveil his political plans on the set of ""The Tonight Show."" Thompson joked that while he meant no disrespect to the organizers of Wednesday's Granite State event, ""It's a lot more difficult to get on 'The Tonight Show' than it is to get into a presidential debate."" Over the summer, Thompson's nascent non-campaign campaign ran into turbulence with the departure of several staffers, including veteran Republican campaign adviser Tom Collamore, who left after disagreements with the candidate's wife, Jeri, over organization and staffing decisions, according to Republican sources familiar with Collamore's decision. Jeri Thompson, 40, was a GOP media consultant before marrying Thompson in 2002. The political world was also roundly unimpressed with the $3.4 million Thompson's exploratory committee raised during its first month of operation in June -- a fundraising pace far weaker than his GOP competitors. Despite those bumps and his late start, Thompson has said he believes his campaign is still well-positioned to win the nomination. Thompson's government service goes back to 1969, when he became a federal prosecutor in Nashville. His profile went national in 1973, when he was appointed as the Republican counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee investigating misdeeds by President Richard Nixon and members of his staff. During televised hearings that riveted the nation, it was Thompson who famously and dramatically asked White House aide Alexander Butterfield about the existence of tapes made of Oval Office conversations, which would eventually turn out to be Nixon's undoing. After Watergate, Thompson returned to Tennessee to practice law. He fell into a career as an actor when he was asked to play himself in the 1985 movie ""Marie,"" which was based on a real-life case in which he represented a whistleblower who exposed corruption. His performance in the film led to other film and TV roles. In 1994, Thompson sought political office for the first time, running for the remaining two years of the Senate term that Democrat Al Gore gave up when he was elected vice president in 1992. After barnstorming the Volunteer State in a red pickup truck while wearing cowboy boots, Thompson won in a landslide, and, in 1996, easily won re-election to a full six-year term. In 2002, however, Thompson decided not to seek re-election and left the Senate. He worked as a lawyer-lobbyist in Washington and also took on the role of the gruff, conservative New York District Attorney Arthur Branch on ""Law and Order."" Thompson left the show earlier this year when he began considering a presidential bid. In April, Thompson disclosed that in 2004, he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. However, he said the cancer was in remission and he was suffering no symptoms. E-mail to a friend .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- An environmental group on Monday urged the incoming Japanese prime minister to delay the start of school near a nuclear plant crippled by a massive earthquake and tsunami six months ago. Fukushima city schools are scheduled to reopen Thursday. The March 11 disaster triggered the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl, as cores overheated and spewed radioactive material into surrounding areas. Greenpeace said the government's decontamination plan is lacking, adding that its team found average radiation doses remained high in areas decontaminated by the government. Areas where local communities had conducted further cleanups contained decreased radiation levels, the group said in a statement. ""No parent should have to choose between radiation exposure and education for their child,"" said Kazue Suzuki, Greenpeace Japan nuclear campaigner. A foreign affairs spokesman said it was premature to ask the incoming prime minister to delay school. ""Mr. Yoshihiko Noda was just elected as Democratic Party leader. He has not assumed the post of prime minister yet, therefore he cannot comment on this,"" said Kazuhiro Kawase, the spokesman. Japan's ruling party on Monday picked Noda, the finance minister, as its new leader, bringing him a step closer to becoming the prime minister. Parliament will vote Tuesday on whether he will assume the position of prime minister -- the country's sixth in five years. Japan has launched a sweeping review of nuclear power since the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi, which displaced more than 100,000 residents.","Fukushima city schools are scheduled to reopen Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Larry Smith's desire to make sure he's alive to watch his grandchildren grow up was his light bulb moment. ""I was on the path to not living old and this bothered me,"" he said. ""I want to live long enough to see my young grandkids reach big milestones like graduate from school and get married, or even enjoy simple activities like playing in the yard with them. My grandkids mean the world to me."" The 63-year-old epidemiologist from Jackson, Mississippi, recently dropped 58 pounds in a 12-week fitness challenge involving 200 people from the Mississippi governor's office, state legislature workers and civilians. ""When they announced I was the winner of the challenge, it was a very emotional experience for me,"" Smith said. ""I've never won any kind of athletic event, and it felt like a huge achievement to do it,"" he said. Smith, who is 5-foot-10, started the boot camp at 261 pounds and with much hesitation. ""During the first day of the program I thought I wouldn't be able to keep up with it because it felt very intimidating and I worried about my weak knees,"" he said. Smith has struggled with his weight most of his adult life. Before the fitness program, he led a very sedentary lifestyle. He often felt sluggish, lacked energy and felt ""miserable."" He always dreamed of losing weight, but kept putting it off. ""By nature, I think many people are procrastinators, and losing weight was something I always wanted to do but was on my procrastination list,"" he said. The grandfather of three said an e-mail in his work inbox announcing the ""Fit 4 Change Mississippi Fitness Challenge"" was the final push he needed to jumpstart his journey toward a healthier lifestyle. ""I had known people who participated in the challenge last year and were successful at it, so I thought I'd give it a try,"" he said. ""I thought it would be worth it for both me and my grandkids."" The program was led by Mississippian Paul Lacoste, a former pro football player turned fitness coach, with a vision to help slim down the Magnolia State, which has an adult obesity rate of 33% - the highest in the United States. Participants shed a collective 3,043 pounds and 714 inches from their waists by the end of this year's challenge. ""The fitness event was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life,"" Smith said. ""Paul worked us really hard during our early morning workout sessions and pushed us to our limits,"" he said. Weight lifting and various cardiovascular exercises were a major part of the fitness plan. Smith and other participants met four days a week for intense one-hour workouts. Before the challenge started, Smith had high blood pressure, high sugar glucose levels and did not eat well-balanced meals. After he started the fitness challenge, he added healthy food to his diet, such as fruits, vegetables, fish and chicken, and he eliminated fatty foods and red meats. ""One of my favorite things to add to food is mayonnaise, but I substituted it with Greek yogurt during the program and this helped me reduce calories,"" he said. ""I'm still eating the yogurt, and enjoy it."" Smith said the first few weeks of the program were the most challenging, but after a while he adjusted to his new routine and diet and appreciated the opportunity to get fit. ""It took a lot of effort for me to change my lifestyle, but once I started seeing the pounds shed away, it gave me the motivation I needed to keep going,"" Smith said. Smith said his goal was simply to get in shape, and he never aspired to win the fitness challenge. He was pleasantly surprised when he did. His blood pressure and sugar glucose levels are normal now, and he feels much better since dropping his weight. Since the program has ended, he continues to work out and has dropped eight more pounds. ""I just joined the 'Y,' signed up for kick boxing, step and Pilates classes and continue to both walk and run every day,"" he said. ""Paul's program was the jumpstart I needed, and now I am continuing my weight loss journey on my own,"" he said. Smith said everyone needs to find their own way to a healthy lifestyle and says his best advice is to ""just do it,"" find something you like and don't procrastinate or ""wait for tomorrow"" like he once did. ""I look forward to spending many healthy years into the future with my grandkids, and am glad I am taking the necessary steps to do it,"" he said.","Larry Smith dropped 58 pounds in 12 weeks and explains how he did it .

"(OPRAH.com) -- What do you most want to know about your mom but would never ask? When psychoanalyst Joyce McFadden posed this question to hundreds of women in an online survey that began in 2006, she was surprised by their answers: Half of the respondents wanted to know more about their mothers' sexuality. The queries ranged from the seemingly straightforward to the profound: ""Did she date other men before my dad?"" ""Had she had an abortion?"" ""Why did she have an affair?"" In her new book, ""Your Daughter's Bedroom,"" McFadden explores the great value in sharing these kinds of intimate secrets -- even when it's awkward to do so. Oprah.com: How to get your daughter to talk to you . Understanding our mothers, she says, is vital to understanding ourselves. We asked McFadden how to get the conversation started. Q: Why are these discussions so hard? It's not easy to blurt out the private details of your life to anyone. But moms often don't discuss their sexual pasts because they're embarrassed about things that happened, or worried they'll scare their daughters. The daughters then withhold from their moms for fear of being judged. It's a cycle. We're not allowing ourselves to be real, whole women together. Oprah.com: 14 really good sex questions . Q: What are we missing out on? We lose our moms as advisers, for one. Intimate relationships are bafflingly complex, and when things go wrong, many women consider themselves failures. But if they could talk about it, they might be able to move past that shame. Q: What were your survey respondents hoping to learn about their moms? Many were hoping that certain aspects of their mothers' personalities might be illuminated. They said things like ""I think she must have been abused"" and ""I have to assume she was sexually unhappy with my father."" They wanted to get to know their mothers better as women, because we look to our moms as guides. We study them all the time as we grapple with our own identity. Oprah.com: What is your daughter thinking? Q: Any advice on approaching Mom? Make sure you consider the risks first, because you may learn things that you're not prepared to know. If you feel ready, try looking for conversation starters in your everyday life -- like a movie that touched on sexual relationships or a friend who is going through a divorce. I find that mothers are often happy to talk once their daughters give them an opening. Oprah.com: The ""Eew"" factor . Q: How did you start talking about sex with your own daughter? When she was little, I made sure she knew the correct names of her body parts. I didn't know what a vulva was till I was, like, 30. Q: Now that she's a teenager, has it become more difficult? She comes to me with questions, but there are definitely topics I have to broach. Before she started high school, I said, ""We're going to have a conversation about oral sex."" And she said, ""I'm going to jump out of this car."" But I made the conversation happen. It's my responsibility to teach her. Now we don't have to talk about it again -- unless she wants to. Oprah.com: Adventures in sex education . Unspoken Questions . McFadden asked the women in her survey what they most wanted to know about their moms. This is what some of them wrote: . • If she's ever loved anyone as much as she loves my dad. • Why she stayed with my father. • Why she never told us that she married my dad after my older brother was born. • Why did she allow Grandma to push her into a marriage she wasn't sure was right? • I want to know about her desire for sex. • Why she never had an affair after my father became ill. • Why doesn't she get help for her marriage?

"(CNN Student News) -- March 14, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Japan  • Santa Cruz, California . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We're dedicating this edition of CNN Student News to our audience in Japan. The world is watching in support, and you are not alone. First Up: Japan Earthquake . AZUZ: The nation of Japan is reeling today, trying to recover from a devastating natural disaster. The earthquake hit the island nation on Friday. It registered a magnitude of 8.9. That makes it the most powerful quake to hit Japan in at least 100 years. There were reports over the weekend that the quake moved the main of island of Japan -- the entire island -- by 8 feet! And this is what it left behind: scenes of destruction. On Sunday, officials estimated that more than 1,500 people had been killed; more than 1,900 injured; more than 1,500 more missing. Those estimates all expected to go up. And the worst may not be over. Witnesses have reported feeling aftershocks. And scientists in Japan say that there's a strong chance of another quake, one with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher, hitting in the next few days. Just to get a sense of what this was like, take a listen to this iReport. This was shot by someone outside his house. You can hear the crashes as the area is rattled by the quake. Something just as devastating as the quake was the tsunami -- this giant ocean wave -- that the quake caused. It slammed into the Japanese coast, washing over cities and leaving death and destruction behind it. Tsunami Strikes Japan . AZUZ: The northeastern part of the country took the worst of it. This is what the water looked like rushing into one city. Some areas were completely flattened, with foundations the only sign of the buildings that once stood on them. You might think of a tsunami as this towering tidal wave that crashes down on shore. That's not what this was. Tsunamis are more accurately described as these ""walls of water"" that push onto shore and plow through anything they hit. Scientists believe that when there's friction between two plates below the ocean's surface, like in an earthquake, energy is released. That energy shoots up to the surface, spreads out in a wave. And it travels very fast, as fast as 500 miles per hour! You can see it spreading right here. Now, if you're in a boat out at sea, you might not even feel it. It's incredibly powerful, but not necessarily very high. But look at what happens when that wave gets closer to shore: it slows down and builds up. And that wall of water just bulldozes inland. Look at how this tsunami wave spread. This animation shows you just how far these things can travel. It stretched out in all directions, spanning the Pacific Ocean. It hit Hawaii, causing millions of dollars in damage there. And it even reached the California coast, 5,000 miles from the area near Japan where the quake hit. And when the wave did reach Santa Cruz, California, it was still strong enough to do this: boats tossed like toys in the tub. It's not nearly as destructive as what happened in Japan, but a clear illustration of ocean energy radiated across the world. Japan Earthquake . AZUZ: Trying to put the impact of this earthquake in perspective. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, called it ""the toughest and most difficult crisis"" for his country since the end of World War II, more than 65 years ago. He said he's confident that the Japanese people can work together to overcome the crisis. That could include making sacrifices, like dealing with electrical blackouts for one thing. The government is planning to run these rolling blackouts in order to save electricity while workers repair power plants. But Prime Minister Kan says right now, Japan has one main goal. NAOTO KAN, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER: Saving people's lives must be our first priority. We must do all that we are able to do to save as many lives as we can now. Just the Facts . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Just the facts! Nuclear power plants generate power through a process called nuclear fission. This is when atoms of uranium, a radioactive element, are split apart. Fission produces a lot of heat energy, and that energy produces steam. The steam turns a turbine, and that's how the plants generate electricity. Meltdown Concerns . AZUZ: Officials in Japan are worried about what's happening at one of the country's nuclear power plants. It has six reactors, six facilities where that fission happens. And three of those reactors were running when the quake hit. The plant has safeguards in place for this kind of a situation. The reactors are supposed to shut down, and emergency generators are supposed to pump water into the reactors to cool them down. Remember, fission generates heat, so if you want it to stop heat quickly, you need to cool it down. But in one of those three reactors, the back-up generators failed. Experts are blaming that on flooding from the tsunami. Another element -- hydrogen -- started building up inside the facility until it caused an explosion that blew the roof off. The reactor was not damaged in the explosion. But that's the big concern here: a problem with the reactor. Like we said, the uranium inside of it is radioactive. And if too much of that radiation gets out, it could contaminate air or water and lead to very serious health problems. World Response . AZUZ: You heard Japan's prime minister say that the number one priority is saving lives. Rescue crews have been working furiously to try to find and help the victims of this earthquake. And the world is coming to Japan's aid as well. The United States, United Kingdom, China, South Korea: just a handful of the nearly 70 countries that have offered to help. Some search-and-rescue teams have already arrived in Japan. More are on the way. International aid groups, like the Red Cross, Save the Children and Doctors Without Borders are getting involved, too. The USS Ronald Reagan -- the warship that you see here -- is also on the scene. Crew members are working with Japanese forces to fly supplies and equipment into the areas that were hit hard by the quake. They're hoping to deliver 30,000 portions of emergency food supplies in the first run. Impact Your World . AZUZ: Sometimes, you hear about a crisis somewhere in the world and wonder ""What can I do?"" We have a way for you. CNN's ""Impact Your World"" program has information on some of the groups that are helping the victims of this quake, and it has ways for you to get involved. You'll find a link to ""Impact Your World"" in the Spotlight section of our home page, CNNStudentNews.com. Goodbye . AZUZ: This is a huge story, and one that we'll certainly be covering more on our show. But there's also a lot of information up on our web site. We have In Depth Coverage on the quake itself and explainers on things like earthquake magnitudes and how nuclear reactors work. Finally today, we have a video that demonstrates the power of this natural disaster and its impact on Japan. We're going to let that close out the show, and we'll see you again tomorrow.

The reports, which are being produced solely by Vice, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process.

Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- Tucked between a bodega and a bar in a former industrial neighborhood on the border of Brooklyn and Queens, an unassuming door leads to New York's newest, most radical punk scene. But the slouched-over kids and bearded scenesters who slide into the cavernous space, known as Silent Barn, aren't just here for the fine underground music. They really come for the video games. This is the home of Babycastles, an underground collective and gallery dedicated to pressing the reset button on the concept of the video game arcade, with loving help from a growing culture of independent developers, players and fans. Don't expect any change machines, prizes, or incessant video game musak wafting across a linoleum-lined room full of pale adolescents. Descend into the basement of Silent Barn on any given night, and you're likely to encounter a rowdy scene that looks more like CBGBs if it had been founded by hackers with a predilection for florescent neon. That's how you might describe Kunal Gupta and Syed Salahuddin, who met each other through the independent gaming scene after college and launched Babycastles with a smattering of music and beer-soaked events in 2009. They grew up in the 1980s and '90s, as a steady stream of home gaming consoles were eclipsing the arcade and the privacy of the living room was replacing a lively -- if not completely functional -- public space. ""It was a dark, dingy place with a lot of teenagers who were really into arcade games,"" Salahuddin says of his favorite arcade from childhood, the recently-closed Chinatown Arcade. ""There were a lot of random strangers and friends you made that night. People stood around these machines discussing the games, talking about the games, deconstructing these games."" In Babycastles' cozy underground space, visitors gather around homemade games, installed on often aging computers that are embedded inside ramshackle cabinets. The games -- often constructed around an array of silly, bizarre and downright fascinating conceits and told in a vibrant, minimalist aesthetic, are designed by young developers from New York and around the world whose clever antics are more accustomed to internet message boards, blogs and IRC channels. The cabinets are lovingly decorated in all manner of artwork, from intricate painted cardboard panels to collage-covered wood panels. See the rest of Babycastles: DIY Arcade at Motherboard.tv . For the opening exhibition at a temporary space near Times Square last year, Thu Tran, the inimitable maestro of the IFC show ""Food Party,"" turned a former storefront into a veritable zoo of brightly-colored furniture and cabinets. In painted wood and styrofoam, it was a masterful and whimsical refusal to answer that pesky question of whether games can be art. Here was a kind of proof that you don't have to choose. Nor do you have to play by the rules -- in fact, often no one knows what they are. In B.U.T.T.O.N., a staple of the gallery, players are left guessing at the objective: will they be asked to beat their opponents to a single magic button, to force their opponents to press the button, or to carry out instructions printed on the screen in Danish? In the current exhibition, hosted at a separate music venue in Williamsburg, a game by Ivan Safrin lets players reenact a popular YouTube video showing a zealous ATV-rider with a giant American flag who celebrates the death of Osama bin Laden by firing his shotgun aimlessly. A game by Adam Saltsman simply asks users to press any key -- they win when they find the correct one. Doing things the wrong way -- an ethos obvious in the eccentric, sometimes iconoclastic design of many of the gallery's games -- echoes the progenitors of other devil-may-care and do-it-yourself artistic movements. That's why the music and games at Babycastles events play together so nicely. Indie rock and punk fare isn't the only soundtrack at Babycastles -- the collective also pairs up with a steady global roster of chiptune musicians, who, with their hacked Game Boy controllers and Genesis consoles, are in many ways the musical breatheren of today's lo-fi game developers. (Babycastles launched as a party alongside the Blip Festival, a showcase of chiptune musicians; this year's festival begins this week in New York.) Meanwhile, the patrons of both of these independent communities are in one way or another striving to experience something new -- something that can't be bought in a store, but that is available for anyone to see and hear if they look in the right places. Just like indie music, the independent gaming scene is trading in neat, mass-produced convenience for a rough-hewn, playful provocation. ""[At big gaming studios] games have become massive undertakings in which each developer acts like a cog. The budget for games has increased by billions of dollars, and developers don't take as much risk anymore,"" says Salahuddin. ""So you see a lot of rehashed games from the same video game engine, like another ""Unreal"" clone."" The independent gaming movement ""is in response to that."" The implications of Babycastles remixing go wider than the music, art and gaming worlds. The hope, says Salahuddin, is to build a kind of economy for independent gaming developers outside the large studios, something akin to what supports indie musicians who make much of their money through touring and merchandise. Babycastles' other mission is to bring an obscured world of hobbyist game development to a larger audience -- a public that may be jaded with a culture often built on testosterone-fueled first-person shooters, or that tends to roll its eyes at the premise of games altogether. It's a formidable challenge, but, as the gallery's raucous and diverse gatherings prove, one that isn't so hard to beat. Still, mixing games with the underground music scene can have its downside too -- some musicians who come to play fall in love with the games in the basement, Salahuddin says. ""So bands started missing their sets.""","Underground space in nondescript New York building home to indie video game arcade .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A member of Pakistan's paramilitary Sindh Rangers has been sentenced to death in the killing of an unarmed teenager whose fatal shooting was caught on video, a prosecutor told CNN. Five other soldiers, also members of the Sindh Rangers, and a civilian were given life sentences for their roles in the June killing of 17-year-old Sarfraz Shah, Muhammed Khan Buriro, a special public prosecutor with the Anti-Terrorism Court, said Friday. The sentences of the seven men still must be confirmed by the Pakistan's higher court, Buriro said. All seven also were ordered to restitution, ranging from $1,162 to $2,325 each to Shah's family, he said. The case prompted a public outcry after a chilling video captured by a local television cameraman showed Shah pleading for his life before being shot twice in a park in Karachi. In the video, which was broadcast across Pakistan's networks, Shah cries ""I am helpless"" and ""please do not fire."" After being shot twice, Shah then begs to be taken to a hospital before bleeding to death. The shooting death was the latest in a series of human rights incidents that has deeply eroded public confidence in security agencies. Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered transfers for the heads of the Sindh Rangers and the provincial police force after the shooting. Pakistan's Supreme Court also ordered the six soldiers and the civilian to be tried before the country's Anti-Terrorism Court,, a special court where hearings are expedited and decisions come more quickly than in the regular court system. Authorities, at the time of the shooting, said Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. They said Shah had pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones. Authorities said he was handed over to park security and then to the Rangers. Shah apparently tried to snatch the Rangers' guns, authorities said at the time. That's when the soldiers opened fire. The video shows Shah reaching for their weapons before backing away. Shah's family has repeatedly said he was innocent.","Six soldiers and one civilian are convicted in the shooting death of Sarfraz Shah .

"(Mashable) -- Twitter has rolled out an update to its search tool that makes it easier to find new people to follow. Now, when you search for a given topic on the microblogging site, you'll get suggestions of people and accounts that tweet about that topic. For instance, a search for ""movies"" yields Roger Ebert, Judd Apatow, Jon Favreau and the iTunes Trailer account under the ""People results for movies"" sidebar. You can get further suggestions by clicking on the ""People"" tab on the left-hand side search results where you can also browse recent tweets about the queried topic. In the movies example, further results include Tom Hanks, Disney-Pixar and Kevin Smith. Previously, people results used a far simpler algorithm, showing people and accounts to follow based on keywords, the company said in a blog post. Though a relatively small and obvious move, it's yet another addition to Twitter's web interface that makes third-party tools for performing the same task a little less relevant (though the service has also been offering personalized follow suggestions for some time). © 2010 MASHABLE.com.
