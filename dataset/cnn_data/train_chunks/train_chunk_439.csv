"(CNN)The protected Bay of Pemba in northern Mozambique may look like a sea of tranquility, but this area is surging with change. As boats bob just outside the port terminal dedicated to oil and gas companies, commercial divers check the welds and make sure the barges are ship shape. One of them is Cremildo Marsena. ""To become a diver is something that I had as a dream,"" he says. ""It's good money, which makes me happy...Mozambicans love the sea and we have to stand up and try to make money when it's the time to make money."" In Pemba, the time to make money is now. Major gas reserves have been identified off the coast and big multinationals, who started drilling in 2010, have started to transform the region's economy. According to Standard Bank, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) will add $39 billion to the Mozambican economy over the next 20 years, boosting GDP per capita from approximately $650 in 2013, to $4500 by 2035. Changing landscape . Once a dusty regional backwater, Pemba town is already changing as a result of the country's enviable natural resources. In the two years since commercial diver Ornelo Maunde moved to the area he's witnessed a lot of change. Pointing to the new buildings rising near the coastline, he says the construction boom is going to benefit Pemba. ""For sure there's a lot coming for Mozambicans here,"" he says. Both Marsena and Maunde work for the South Africa-based Subtech Group  -- a marine services company which works both above and below water. Their interest in Mozambique began in late 2009, when the gas industry was starting to expand. The business has since registered a Mozambican entity and opened a branch in Pemba. But moving into a new market wasn't all plain sailing for the marine company. Despite a thriving fishing industry in Pemba, the company found few locals were willing to work below the surface because of superstitions. Subtech had to source staff from other areas of the country and train them to work underwater. When locals in Pemba saw other Mozambicans working with Subtech, attitudes changed. ""Suddenly from having no enquiries and having no one wanting to work for us... we are getting approached every single day for job opportunities,"" says Paul Bevis, Subtech Group's operations manager. Brighter futures . But the gas money is not just having impact at sea. The whole town is going through a metamorphosis, and the region is set for a major economic boost. Anadarko is one of the major international companies involved with drilling deep water wells off the coast, and the firms' former executive chairman Jim Hackett, has said this gas field could be the most significant find in a decade. He has also claimed there will be ""significant long-term benefits for Mozambique."" But these benefits could take time to materialize, as some estimates say first gas from Mozambique LNG will likely be ready for export in 2019 or 2020. This timeline could be extended after major floods affected thousands of people in central and northern regions in early January, and left over 100 people dead. But despite climatic conditions, movement on the ground in Pemba continues. Roadworks can be seen on most corners and cranes dot the skyline, creating work for the largely subsistence local population. Indeed, Standard Bank says the natural gas industry will help create over 700,000 jobs by 2035, but only 15.000 will be directly connected to gas. The rest will be ""indirect and induced."" One example of these indirect employment opportunities is the construction site in the middle of Pemba town. When completed, the 11 storeys will be among the tallest buildings in the province, and the vertical space will be both apartments and businesses. Construction safety officer Tomas Portugal had expected to follow his father and grandfather into the fishing industry, and live a subsistence lifestyle. But now he's focused on a brighter future. ""For my son... the future will be better,"" Portugal explains. ""We are here to make money, to work, build, to improve yourself also. Because if you have a lot of money, you can improve your house... You can give good things for your kids."" With all the changes happening in the region, the hope is that everyone will benefit. ""The Mozambicans have employed a very very high profile department of environmental affairs and they're really looking into the background of the oil and gas as to what effect it's going to have on the population,"" explains Bevis. ""Now that the new president [Filipe Nyusi] is in, we just see progress...that's what we want and that's what we see."" More from Marketplace Africa .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN)On the sandstone façade of a two-storey building, a man's cheeks bulge as he bites on a fork-load of food. A companion opposite licks his lips in anticipation of the leg of lamb before him and a chef looks flummoxed with a goose that's taken refuge in a saucepan. It could be a scene from a cartoon strip and in some ways it is -- albeit one that has been plastered across the walls of a Chilean restaurant and its car park entrance in the heart of Santiago. Snapshots of social interactions like this are captured on some of the hundreds of murals that have been commissioned across the city over the past year, reflecting a growing trend towards the commercialization of underground culture in the country. Graffiti used to be seen as merely an underground expression of youthful rebellion, an image reinforced during the years of the dictatorship between 1973 and 1989. Now, however, it has undergone a makeover as business owners have recognized the potential for using the enduring appeal of this often forbidden art form in advertising. More than a hundred muralists now work in the city, according to local estimates, and the number is rising as more artists seek to cash in on the mainstream's fascination with guerrilla art. Wearing two-day stubble and a baseball cap on backwards, Alan Zárate sprays yellow paint on the walls of a hip-hop nightclub. The 31-year-old from Puente Alto, a neighborhood on the fringes of the city, is one of the capital's most sought after muralists. His mantra in life is simple: ""siempre para adelante"" -- always go forward. With a waiting list and monthly income averaging 750,000 pesos ($1,211), he now finds himself with semi-regular work in a field notorious for not knowing where the next peso will come from. It's for this reason perhaps that he seems unfazed when a friend calls in the middle of the interview to tell him he's got yet another commission -- this one for a mechanic's store in the central Santiago neighborhood of San Joaquín. He's seen demand for his work increase lately but has not lost sight of how unpredictable its ebbs and flows can be. ""It's a risky business and there's a lot of competition,"" he says. ""A lot of street artists do this kind of work -- several at a high level. There are other jobs that guarantee higher pay."" Fascinated with drawing from a young age, Zárate began sketching cartoons and stylized lettering before going on to create his first street mural with a school friend at the age of 15. He went on to study graphic design at university and since then has racked up a portfolio of clients ranging from owners of bars and restaurants to night clubs, a local council and even a hospital. What's behind the surge in business? ""Globalization,"" he says. ""Advertising these days needs new ideas for how to show your brand or service. Graffiti murals have many characteristics: they're fresh, modern and huge. Public spaces make an ideal setting for them."" Nowhere is the shift in the public's perception of graffiti more visible than on the 2,600 square meter underpass bracketing one of the main arteries in the southeast of the city. On either side of a four-lane highway, a sea of faces and local landmarks appear to jump out of what were previously two blank concrete walls. As part of a renovation program funded by the government, the local council of La Florida commissioned ten artists with the brief to create ""the biggest mural in Santiago"" depicting the diverse cultural heritage of the 30,000-strong neighborhood. It might sound like an unorthodox way of spending state funds but in a middle class neighborhood through which a sixth of the city's population (800,000 people) commute daily, it is also a way of sending a social message. When the mural was completed in February, local mayor Rodolfo Carter proclaimed it a demonstration of ""the integration of different lifestyles."" It took the muralists six weeks to produce the finished image, going through 500 aerosol cans in the process. When complete, the result was quite personal. ""Each artist put something into his bit. For example there are dollar signs on the image of the hospital which clearly refer to the high cost of public health in our country,"" said Alan. For the private sector, graffiti art has become an effective way of capturing the attention of potential clients and generating a buzz on social media. Across town, in upmarket neighborhoods as well as in historic quarters, giant murals have become a permanent fixture on the walls of small and large establishments alike. For Gonzalo Rodriguez, the owner of La Chimba, a hostel, giving his business the graffiti treatment was a no-brainer. ""Lots of people flip out over good street art these days and if your business has something really cool painted on it people acknowledge you more,"" he said. ""I gave the artist carte blanche to do whatever he wanted. I just told him it should have a Latin American feel to it."" Has it generated more business for him? ""It's tricky to attribute any increase in business to the mural,"" he says. ""But I see our guests and tourists walking by constantly photographing the hostel and posting the photos on social media. That can only be beneficial for business in the long run."" A few blocks away, Gnomo, another hostel, sports a different kind of mural. It has an impressionist feel that makes it easier to take in from a distance than up close. It depicts tall trees in a vast forest interspersed with signposts to faraway places: Buenos Aires, Berlin, Mumbai. Lucas Nettle, who commissioned the mural says he wanted to make his business stand out. ""We felt that through a mural we could represent what we are as a youth hostel -- a relaxed, friendly place where we have a lot of fun. This is represented in the colors."" But not everyone in Santiago has embraced the surge in graffiti art. As the number of street murals increases, some are now questioning whether the commodification of what was once a not-for-profit channel of self-expression has gone a step too far. As enterprises piggyback on the creativity of others, some people are asking whether the authenticity of graffiti art is being eroded -- whether something that once representing non-conformity has been tamed to promote the conformity involved in mass consumption. ""Many graffiti artists criticize us because we are doing this professionally,"" says Zárate. ""They're against the system and they don't like it that we're working for government agencies and brands."" It's an ongoing debate with implications for other forms of self-expression that have recently been commercialized such as sand animation, a form of performance art that involves the manipulation of sand. But the argument often overlooks the practical need to survive in a world where survival is decided by money. In Chile and many countries in Latin America, poverty remains a reality for significant portions of the population. With 15% of the urban population living below the poverty line as recently as 2011, 6.4% of the population currently out of work and many struggling to get by on the minimum wage of 220,000 pesos a month ($355), the opportunity to turn a hobby into an income is a compelling one. For muralists like Zárate, though, what makes him fill his rucksack full of aerosols each morning is less a question of riches than the satisfaction of expressing himself on concrete. ""There are more profitable ways of making money but they're monotonous. This is my passion. At its best, it's like a form of therapy. It's using artistic creation to represent the imagination in a visible way. I find it a very interesting challenge."" The decaying splendor (and strange finds) of abandoned Italian nightclubs .

"(CNN)A soldier and a comrade who came to his aid were stabbed Tuesday on the streets of Nice in southern France, officials said, the latest instance of French authorities coming under attack on their native soil. The suspect -- Moussa Coulibaly, according to a representative in the Nice mayor's office -- shares the same last name as one of the three terrorists behind last month's deadly attacks in and around Paris. Officials cannot confirm he's related to Amedy Coulibaly, the man who killed a police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge, then took hostages in a kosher grocery in the French capital, a standoff that ended with him and four hostages dead. Coulibaly is a common name for families of Malian descent. ""(The) assault ... seemed extremely deliberate or even premeditated against the military,"" Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi told CNN affiliate BFMTV. ""... Justice must be extremely severe."" They were among the French military forces who have been out on the streets around sensitive sites following last month's terror attacks that included the massacre at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Philippe Pradal, Nice's deputy head of security, told BFMTV that the assailant initially didn't do much harm because the soldier he attacked had on a bulletproof vest. ""After realizing the inefficiency of his stabs,... he tried to hurt him in the face,"" Pradal said. The attacker injured another soldier trying to assist before he was stopped, with help from a passer-by, public transit officers and municipal police. French intelligence was aware of Moussa Coulibaly, 30, and alerted Turkish officials when he flew to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport from Rome on January 29, said an official in the Turkish prime ministry. He was put on a flight back to Rome that same day, the source said. Nice's mayor said the attack shows the importance of the stepped-up security measures put in place in recent weeks. Estrosi tweeted that he wants French troops in Nice to be supplemented by reinforcements. CNN's Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","Suspect flew to Turkey on January 29 but was turned back, a Turkish official said .

"President Barack Obama didn't know the United States was collecting communications of allied leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Monday. Moreover, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that her panel was unaware of the sweeping intelligence effort and said that the White House had told her that such data collection ""will not continue."" Feinstein's overall comments confirmed recent news reports on the National Security Agency electronic surveillance network revealed in classified leaks by former agency Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Separately, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said late Monday that he was authorizing the release of more details about the government's collection of telephone records under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, in an effort to show the extent the spying program was overseen by a secret federal court and Congress. Clapper testifies on Tuesday before the House Select Intelligence Committee about the program. The documents date mostly to 2009, when the administration was pushing lawmakers to reauthorize sections of the Patriot Act that were set to expire. House committee to question spy chiefs about phone tapping allegations . One document from 2011 notifies the House and Senate intelligence and judiciary committees of the NSA's testing in 2010-2011 of a program to collect cell phone tower data that could track mobile phone users. The NSA acknowledged this month that it tested such collection but discontinued it. The document says the Justice Department prepared a memorandum authorizing the program, which the document said fell legally within guidelines of another existing program under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Most of the newly-declassified documents describe the aggressive push by the NSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department for lawmakers to save the bulk telephone-data collection effort, known as the 215 program, because it was important for their efforts to thwart terrorist threats. Lawmakers were urged not to discuss the classified program for fear it would hurt national security, the documents show. With the latest revelations from Snowden threatening to roil diplomatic relations in Europe, South America and elsewhere, the Obama administration maintained its firm and consistent response to all seeking answers -- we're not admitting anything, but we'll change it for the better. ""I'm not here to talk about classified information. What I am confirming is the fact that we're undergoing a complete review of how our intelligence operates outside of the country,"" the President told Fusion TV. ""We give them policy direction, but what we've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand, and that's why I'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing,"" he said. The latest protest . Spain became the latest to protest, summoning U.S. Ambssador James Costos for a Madrid meeting Monday to discuss an El Pais newspaper report that quoted unnamed sources as saying the NSA spied on Spanish officials and politicians. Much of the focus is on expanded surveillance under the Patriot Act passed in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Snowden's leaks in June have led to continued reports of collecting millions of phone and Internet records from around the world, as well as the reports of monitoring communications of governments and even leaders in Germany, Brazil and other countries. Obama did not learn until recently of the NSA surveillance of other world leaders, including allies, a senior administration official told CNN on Monday. However, other officials said the president or at least his White House staff did know about it. NSA spying claims: Five things you need to know . White House spokesman Jay Carney refused to discuss particular reported operations on Monday, but went on at some length on changes ordered by Obama in response to the Snowden leaks, including a review of surveillance programs to be completed in December. ""There are a number of efforts under way that are designed to increase transparency, to work with Congress to look at reforms to the Patriot Act, to look at ways that we can increase oversight and increase constraints on the authorities provided by these programs,"" Carney told reporters. Without confirming any of the news reports about alleged U.S. spying on foreign leaders, Carney also said that also was being addressed. ""There's a review under way that will look at, among other issues, some of the very specific things with regards to intelligence-gathering, including matters that deal with heads of state and other governments,"" he said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the president was unaware of the full scope of the surveillance programs involving heads of state. A senior administration official confirmed some of the details in the newspaper's report. In particular, the official said the White House didn't learn of all of the surveillance programs until its internal review over the summer, after which some of them were stopped. The targeting of Merkel's phone did not end until more recently, the official said. Saying Feinstein's statement was not completely accurate, a senior administration official said some changes have been made but they are not across-the-board changes in policy like terminating intelligence collection aimed at allies. Another U.S. official said Obama, like every president, received detailed documents on the framework of the programs as part of his briefing when he took office in 2009. One of the programs targeted leaders in specific countries, which would have been a focus of the briefing, according to the official. Another senior administration official argued the president approves a set of intelligence priorities, and then it's the responsibility of his administration to determine how to carry those out, making it unreasonable to expect Obama to know every detail of exactly how that happened. ""I really doubt he had to sign off on something like that or get into the details,"" said a former senior administration official who worked on national security for the Obama White House. To Feinstein, the fact that neither Obama nor her committee knew about the program was a ""big problem."" ""As far as I'm concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing,"" her statement said. ""To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs."" White House: Reviewing surveillance of allies . Merkel said last week that reports of American spying on her and other leaders had ""severely shaken"" relationships between the United States and European nations. The German leader said she told Obama last week that eavesdropping among friends ""is never acceptable."" Carney repeated Monday the White House line that Merkel was not being monitored now and would not be in the future -- without saying whether she had been targeted in the past. Also Monday, Sen. Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she knew of ""no justification for the Administration's collection of intelligence on the leaders of our closest allies,"" such as Merkel. ""I will be seeing the German Ambassador tomorrow night and will express directly to him my belief that it was wrong for the Administration to engage in monitoring of the Chancellor's telephone calls,"" she said in a statement. Should the president know wiretap details? Separately, the NSA on Sunday denied a report by the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag that NSA Director Keith Alexander told Obama about the surveillance of Merkel in 2010. ""Gen. Alexander did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German Chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Chancellor Merkel,"" NSA spokeswoman Vanee' Vines told CNN. German intelligence officials are scheduled to meet with their American counterparts in Washington this week to ask about surveillance programs. Other news media reports, based on documents leaked by Snowden, have said the NSA monitored the communications of the leaders of Brazil and Mexico. Germany and Brazil are drafting a United Nations resolution on privacy in electronic communication, officials in those countries said last week. Report: NSA monitored 60 million Spanish calls in 30 days . The Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported Monday that the NSA collected data from 60 million phone calls in Spain in one 30-day period. One of the authors of the El Mundo article was Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who first reported on documents supplied by Snowden for the British newspaper The Guardian. The El Mundo article cited what it said was an NSA report titled, ""Spain -- last 30 days."" The 60 million calls were not recorded, but the NSA collected serial numbers of devices, phone numbers, locations and durations of calls, the newspaper said. In an interview Monday with CNN, Greenwald denied assertions by U.S. officials that the surveillance program was purely for security reasons. ""None of this has to do with terrorism,"" he said. ""Is Angela Merkel a terrorist? Are 60 or 70 million Spanish or French citizens terrorists? This is clearly about political power and economic espionage and the claim that this is all about terrorism is seen for what it is all around the world, which is pure deceit."" Carney denied any economic motivation, telling reporters that ""we do not use our intelligence capabilities for that purpose."" ""It's very important to recall, too, that we have extraordinarily strong and important intelligence and security relationships with our allies,"" he said, adding that the White House review of surveillance issues would ""look at how we can better balance our security needs, and the security needs of our allies, against the real privacy concerns that we all share."" In Spain, a Foreign Ministry statement said Monday that in the meeting with Costos, the government ""conveyed to the United States the importance of preserving a climate of confidence"" in bilateral relations, adding that ""some practices, which if they are true, are inappropriate and unacceptable between partners and friendly nations."" A statement by Costos repeated the administration's past statements that the surveillance policies are under review. It said the policies have ""played a critical role in protecting citizens of the United States"" and played ""an instrumental role in our coordination with our allies and in protecting their interests as well."" ""We will continue to confer with our allies, such as Spain, through our regular diplomatic channels to address the concerns that they have raised,"" the Costos statement said. ""Ultimately, the United States needs to balance the important role that these programs play in protecting our national security and protecting the security of our allies with legitimate privacy concerns."" The French daily newspaper Le Monde reported last week on claims that the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in France in 30 days. That report did not specify whether the calls were recorded or whether the interceptions were limited to data about calls.","Review under way of how intelligence operates outside of the country, Obama says .

"(CNN)French counter terrorism police arrested eight people with alleged links to jihadist cells in Lyon and the Paris suburbs Tuesday morning, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said at a Paris press conference. He said 161 legal investigations into terrorism are currently ongoing, with 547 people implicated in the inquiries. Of those 547 people, 167 people have been arrested, 95 are under investigation and 80 are in jail, he said. Cazeneuve also announced that ""a new counter-terrorism"" decree would go into effect on Wednesday. He plans to travel to Brussels, Belgium, on the same day to persuade the EU Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to move forward with the EU Passenger Name Record. This is a draft law currently under debate that would require airlines to maintain and share data on passengers entering and leaving the European Union, in an effort to fight crime and terrorism. ""The fight against terrorism, is a race against time -- we are fully determined,"" Cazeneuve said. France last month suffered its worst terror attacks in decades when 17 people were killed in shooting incidents in Paris. Since then, it has been cracking down on those with suspected jihadist links.

"Nigeria's president has declared a state of emergency in parts of the country afflicted by violence from the militant Islamist group Boko Haram. ""It has become imperative to take some decisive measures necessary to restore normalcy in the country, especially within the affected communities,"" President Goodluck Jonathan said in a Saturday address. His order includes the closure of the country's borders in affected areas. The last two months have seen widespread bloodshed in northern Nigeria, with churches and police stations among the targets. Boko Haram (which according to the group means ""Western civilization is forbidden"") has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on churches in central and northern Nigeria on Christmas Day, including one near the capital, Abuja, which killed nearly 30 people. Two days later, a bomb attack at an Islamic school -- or madrassa -- in the southern Delta state injured several children. It's not clear whether it was intended as revenge, but such sectarian attacks are rare in Delta state. Jonathan said he instructed military and police chiefs in the violence-stricken areas to ensure that life and property there are protected.","The president called for a state of emergency in certain parts of the country .

"(CNN)Fifty-five years after ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" Harper Lee is publishing a second book, her publisher said Tuesday. ""Go Set a Watchman,"" which Lee completed in the 1950s and then set aside in favor of ""Mockingbird,"" will be published July 14. It follows Scout, the little girl of ""Mockingbird,"" as an adult. The manuscript was rediscovered last year, Lee, 88, said in a statement from her publisher, Harper. ""In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called 'Go Set a Watchman,' "" she said. ""It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became 'To Kill a Mockingbird') from the point of view of the young Scout. ""I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it (the original book) had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. After much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years."" ""Watchman"" is set in the 1950s and is about Scout -- Jean Louise Finch -- returning to her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama (a fictional version of Lee's hometown of Monroeville), to see her father, the upright lawyer Atticus Finch. ""She is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood,"" the press release said. ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" which Lee wrote after she moved to New York, made her name. The book, published in 1960, won the Pulitzer Prize and was made into a beloved 1962 film. Gregory Peck won the Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of Atticus Finch. It's a mainstay of high school reading lists and, as of 2006, had sold more than 30 million copies. Lee, who returned to Monroeville several years ago, remembers being caught off-guard by its overwhelming success. ""I can't say that (my reaction) was one of surprise. It was one of sheer numbness. It was like being hit over the head and knocked cold,"" she said in 1964. Until now, it had been her only published novel. Jonathan Burnham, Harper's senior vice president and publisher, called ""Go Set a Watchman"" ""a remarkable literary event."" ""The existence of 'Go Set a Watchman' was unknown until recently, and its discovery is an extraordinary gift to the many readers and fans of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' "" he said in the statement. ""Reading in many ways like a sequel to Harper Lee's classic novel, it is a compelling and ultimately moving narrative about a father and a daughter's relationship, and the life of a small Alabama town living through the racial tensions of the 1950s."" Sandy Smith at Monroeville's chamber of commerce said news of the book was ""great news."" ""Our main street director told me and she had heard it from the book store. It's definitely great news,"" she told CNN. ""Everyone has always speculated about a second book.  Everyone who read ('Mockingbird') has said, 'Oh I wish she had written another book.'  It's good for Monroeville.  Her book brings people here every day."" However, Smith honored Lee's desire to maintain a low profile. The author has been a quiet presence for years. ""Oh, I don't talk about Ms. Lee,"" Smith said when asked if she ever sees Lee around town. ""Our policy is not to comment on Ms. Lee personally."" CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this story.","Harper Lee's new novel is ""Go Set a Watchman""

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton jumped into the political story of the day late on Monday night with a tweet that compared people who deny the power of vaccines to those who question whether the earth is round or the sky is blue. Clinton is the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and the tweet was seemingly aimed Republican presidential hopefuls who have questioned whether vaccinations should be required and whether they are tied to mental disorders. Clinton ends the tweet with a nod to her granddaughter, Charlotte, who was born late last year. Clinton regularly used her grandmother status as a rhetorical tool while campaigning for Democrats in 2014. Federal health officials have expressed concern over a recent measles outbreak that has been fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant vaccination schedules. Measles is a disease that children a regularly vaccinated against. The issue has become political, despite the fact that claims like vaccines leading to childhood autism have been debunked by scientific research. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky questioned the safety of vaccines when he said he had ""heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."" ""I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they're a good thing. But I think the parents should have some input,"" he said during an interview on CNBC. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, when asked about the issue, said that he choose to vaccinate his children, but added, ""Parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide."" Parents: What is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids? Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, who is also exploring a 2016 run, told Buzzfeed that while she thinks vaccinating for the measles makes sense, the decisions should be up to the parents. But renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson, also a potential Republican presidential candidate, broke from the pack and defended mandatory vaccinations. ""Certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return by foregoing safe immunization programs, for philosophical, religious or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them,"" he told Buzzfeed. But Carson aside, these comments from Paul, Christie and Fiorina contradict with what Clinton tweeted and President Barack Obama said in an interview on Sunday. ""I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned about the effect of vaccinations,"" Obama told NBC News before the Super Bowl. ""The science is, you know, pretty indisputable."" Both Obama and Clinton have altered their opinions on this issue, though, because during the 2008 presidential nomination fight, the two left the door open to vaccines causing autism and other issues. Obama said the science was ""inconclusive,"" while Clinton wrote in an anti-vaccine questionnaire that she was ""committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccine."" The Republican National Committee noted that Clinton altered her position in a statement to CNN on Tuesday.

"(CNN)A female juror in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was dismissed Tuesday by Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh for talking about the case. The juror had said it would be difficult to convict the ex-player without a murder weapon and discussed inadmissible evidence, Garsh noted. The judge dismissed the juror after ordering the public out of the Massachusetts courtroom for a hearing that included defense lawyers, prosecutors, witnesses and the juror. The closed-door session was ""no broader than necessary to protect Hernandez's right to a fair trial,"" Garsh said. After the hearing, Garsh also said there was ""credible evidence"" that the dismissed juror had expressed interest in being part of the Hernandez jury and had attended more Patriots games than the juror admitted on a questionnaire. ""The juror's recollection of conversations is not supported by the credible evidence,"" the judge said. The juror's presence on the jury ""posed a substantial risk"" to the fairness of the trial, she added, and the dismissal was necessary in ""the best interest of justice."" Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of former semipro football player Odin Lloyd, 27, who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Two alleged accomplices, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. The trial resumed Tuesday afternoon, with Shaneah Jenkins, 23, who was dating Lloyd at the time of his death, returning to the witness stand. Her sister, Shayanna, is Hernandez's fiancee and mother of his child. On Tuesday, Shaneah Jenkins broke into tears when she recalled a call from a state trooper with word that ""Odin was dead."" Shaneah Jenkins testified that she later visited her sister and saw Hernandez, who placed his hand on her shoulder to console her. Hernandez told her ""he's been through this death thing before and it would all get better with time,"" she testified. After Hernandez left the home, Shaneah Jenkins testified, her sister Shayanna kept receiving cell phone calls and text messages. Shaneah Jenkins said her sister seemed ""secretive,"" her responses ""very short."" Shayanna Jenkins would go to the basement to continue the conversations, her sister testified. One time, Shaneah Jenkins told the jury, her sister went down to the basement with what appeared to be a new garbage bag folded in her hand. Shayanna later left the house, returned and asked to borrow her sister's car, Shaneah Jenkins testified. The sister, who had never borrowed Shaneah Jenkins' car before, said she was going to the bank to get money for the housekeepers, according to Shaneah Jenkins. Last week, Shaneah Jenkins testified that she introduced Lloyd to Hernandez on her birthday in August 2012. Jenkins told the jury that Lloyd and Hernandez were in the ""beginning stages of a friendship."" She said the two men and others would gather in Hernandez's basement ""man cave"" -- with fitness and theater rooms, a bar and pool table emblazoned with the Patriots' logo -- to smoke marijuana. But Jenkins said she was not aware of her boyfriend and Hernandez ever getting together outside of the home except for the day Lloyd was killed. In opening statements Thursday, defense lawyer Michael Fee said the two men were close friends and that Hernandez had no reason to kill Lloyd. Fee described the victim as one of his client's ""partying pals"" who was known as the ""blunt master'' for the marijuana cigars he often procured for Hernandez. The two men could have been brothers-in-law, he said. ""Aaron Hernandez is not the murderer of his friend,"" Fee said. ""In June 2013, Aaron Hernandez was planning his future, not a murder."" The case has divided the Jenkins sisters, who sit on opposite sides of the courtroom -- Shaneah with Lloyd's mother and Shayanna with Hernandez's family. Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg has told the jury that Hernandez not only orchestrated the killing, but also participated in it and covered it up. Bomberg summed up the prosecution's largely circumstantial case, telling the jury that Hernandez and his associates killed Lloyd and then ""took evidence with them and tried to and, in some cases, were successful in destroying evidence."" The three picked up Lloyd and drove to a secluded area where he was shot and killed, Bomberg said. A marijuana blunt found near Lloyd's body had traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, Bomberg said. Hernandez's DNA also was found on a .45-caliber shell casing found in a car he had rented. A footprint at the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found matched sneakers worn by Hernandez, the prosecutor said. Lloyd, who was shot six times, was shown in photos on his back in the industrial park where his body was found. The defense said the one-time NFL star worth $40 million was targeted by police and prosecutors in the death of the semipro football player because of celebrity status. Hernandez ""never had a chance"" as authorities zeroed in, Fee told the jury. ""As soon as they found out Aaron Hernandez -- a celebrity football player for the New England Patriots -- was a friend of Odin Lloyd's, it was over,"" he said. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in a black Chevrolet Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. Lloyd's body was found the next day. The judge has blocked any mention that Hernandez was indicted in two other killings in Boston. Hernandez pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of Ernesto Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside a bar in Boston in 2012. A trial date hasn't been set.

"(CNN)During the Super Bowl halftime show, Chinese Internet users were abuzz about a woman called ""Fruit Sister."" Sounds mysterious, but you already know who she is. ""Fruit Sister,"" or ""shui guo jie,"" is what people in China call Katy Perry -- referring to her tendency to wear fruit costumes and bring giant fruit with her on stage. In the past, the pop star has performed in sparkly watermelon-cup bras, sung while holding a large inflatable strawberry and even burst out of a giant banana. She's also talked about growing and eating her own fruit, so it's a pretty fair nickname. But ""Fruit Sister"" isn't the only Western celeb to get an interesting Chinese alias. Here are a few others and the stories behind them: . A popular nickname for Jennifer Lopez in Hong Kong and China is ""luo ba,"" which translates to ""Lord of Butt."" It's actually a bit of a pun. ""Luo ba"" sounds similar to how Chinese people transliterate J-Lo's last name, ""Luo pei zi."" Either way, it's a fitting moniker for the superstar who revealed her bare behind in the music video for her song ""Booty."" Benedict Cumberbatch is known as ""Curly Blessing,"" or ""juan fu."" In Mandarin, ""juan"" means curly, referring to Cumberbatch's curly hairstyle in his role as Sherlock Holmes. ""Fu"" means happiness, fortune, or blessing -- and it's the first part of the Chinese name for Sherlock Holmes. Put those two together, and you get something like ""Curly Sherlock"" or, more poetically, ""Curly Blessing."" Many Chinese dishes aren't just spicy. Thanks to a special peppercorn, Sichuan cuisine carries an extra kick and will actually numb your tongue. That's why Chinese fans have nicknamed Nicki Minaj ""Numbing-Spicy Chicken,"" or ""ma la ji"": She's spicy hot; she'll stun your senses and leave you wanting more. Americans aren't the only ones who swoon over Adam Levine; Chinese people call him ""Flirty Adam,"" or ""sao dang."" ""His voice is very 'unique' and kind of arousing, and his fans always refer to his numerous half naked photo shoots, which gives him the name,"" explains CNN's Beijing intern Sherry Ju. But sao, the Chinese word for ""flirty,"" can also mean frivolous, silly or shallow. Mariah Carey's popular Chinese nickname is ""Cow Sister,"" or ""niu jie."" Here's why: . There's a crude but popular Chinese slang phrase, ""cow's vagina"" or ""niubi,"" that means ""f***ing awesome."" So ""Cow sister,"" despite the sound of it, is really a compliment, a nod to Carey's incredible singing talent. Another explanation is that it refers to a 1992 episode of ""Sesame Street"" that featured a singing cow named Mariah Cowey. Chinese people call Ariana Grande ""little cow"" or ""xiao niu"" because her voice reminds them of Mariah Carey's (Cow Sister). As one Chinese Internet user says, watch Grande's cover of Mariah Carey's ""Emotions,"" and you'll be tempted to agree. To get why Jennifer Lawrence is nicknamed ""Cousin,"" or ""biao jie,"" you'll have to get Chinese humor. In the run-up to the 2011 Oscars, hundreds of Chinese Internet users made joke announcements about the results, all claiming they heard them from a ""cousin in the Academy."" It was a playful dig at how some Chinese people are desperate to show they have powerful family members. But one Chinese Internet user upped the ante, boldly declaring that Lawrence was his cousin and that she had won the Best Actress award. Well, she didn't, but the nickname stuck. Yep, Justin Timberlake is simply known as ""Boss,"" or ""lao ban."" It's an awed reference to the entertainer's investments: From clothing companies to tech startups to golf courses to record labels, the Boss owns it all. Leonardo DiCaprio is called ""Pikachu"" in Taiwan. The joke took off in 2011 after a Taiwanese news anchor struggled with DiCaprio's name, calling him ""Leonardo Pikachu"" on TV. Even today, tongue-in-cheek Taiwanese media and their counterparts in Hong Kong still refer to the actor's Pokemon-inspired nickname. CNN interns Harvard Zihao Zhang, Sherry Ju, CNN's Maggie Wong and Yuli Yang contributed to this report.","In China, Katy Perry is known as ""Fruit Sister"" because of her fruity costumes .

"(CNN)A Norwegian teenager, who has only just turned 16, generated the second highest volume of tweets during the January transfer window. Which means either that Martin Odegaard, who joined European champions Real Madrid, is an even better footballer than is being touted, or the January transfer window was very, very quiet. Juan Cuadrado's move from Italian club Fiorentina to English Premier League team Chelsea was the most discussed on Twitter, with former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes, who signed for Manchester United, the third most tweeted move. The transfers of Cuadrado and Valdes had the knock on effect of boosting the Twitter following of both players, with the Colombian international adding 100,000 followers and Valdes gaining 145,000. Odegaard has has only tweeted 80 times, but already he's collected 102,000 followers. Watch this space. Meanwhile a predicted flurry of late big-money deals failed to materialize as this January window saw spending remain at last year's level, with £130 million ($195m) lavished, way down on the record, set in the 2010/11 season, of £225m ($338m). Despite the relatively demure January figures, this has still been a record-breaking season in England's top flight, as its 20 clubs flexed their financial muscles. An estimated £950 million ($1.4 billion) has been spent on recruitment by Premier League's clubs this term, according to the sports business group at Deloitte. That is up on the previous benchmark, set last season, at £760 million ($1.1 bn) and is driven by the bumper revenue handed to each club thanks to the huge deals struck for domestic and overseas television rights. The three-year deal, which began at the start of last season, is worth £6.2 billion ($9.4 bn) and played a large part in the record revenue delivered by Premier League clubs in the 2012-13 season, £2.7 billion ($4.19 bn). This wealth was reflected in Deloitte's annual list of the world's richest clubs in which England had five in the top 10, eight in the top 20, and all 20 of its teams represented in the top 40. Manchester United were second only to Real Madrid in the rich list, recording revenue of £399 million ($602m) while Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool also made the top 10. A whopping £835 million ($1.25 bn) was spent in the Premier League before the summer transfer window closed on September 1, Manchester United accounting for about £150 million ($226m) of that themselves. Its purchase of Angel di Maria from Real Madrid cost £59.7 million ($90m) alone. That was 30 per cent up on the previous high, set during the same period the season before as £630 million ($949 bn) was put down. But while the final hours of August counted as a multi-million pound thrill ride for supporters, January was, in contrast, a snooze fest. ""Given the record level of spending seen in the summer, it is not entirely surprising that we haven't seen a new record for the January window,"" said Deloitte's Dan Jones in statement. ""However, with all Premier League clubs recording record revenues, we might have expected one or two more major deals in this window. ""Despite the relative restraint we have seen in the January window, 2014/15 is still a record season for Premier League spending. ""Last season saw Premier League spending surpass the £700m threshold for the first time, and the revenue growth at Premier League clubs is such that they have been able to record a combined transfer spend this season of over £950m.""","Transfer of 16-year-old Martin Odegaard second most Tweeted about in January .

"(CNN)A gleaming, modern airport terminal reduced to shattered concrete and twisted metal. Charred cars in the parking garage. The sound of artillery shells exploding nearby. These are the sights and sounds that CNN's Nick Paton Walsh observed in and around the besieged city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Six months ago, Donetsk's once proud Sergey Prokofiev International Airport was still in use. But the worsening conflict between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine has transformed it into a scene of devastation -- a symbol of the wider destruction that's left the Donetsk region reeling. Civilians are increasingly falling victim to the fighting, with at least 224 killed and more than 540 others injured in the final three weeks of January, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said Tuesday. The fighting has been among the fiercest in decades in Europe. In Debaltseve, about 45 miles northeast of the city of Donetsk, a stream of civilians has fled the shelling. The town has been the scene of bloody conflict in recent days as separatist forces seek to surround Ukrainian troops. A morgue in nearby Artyemovsk is full with the bodies of fighters and civilians who didn't make it to safety in time. There, CNN's Paton Walsh saw one soldier torn in half, placed in a body bag. Morgue staff who said they'd seen 200 bodies in the past month were working 24 hours a day to try to keep up with the number coming in. In Debaltseve, some civilians sought refuge underground in the basement of a building. But after a shell hit it, leaving a gaping hole in its side, they, too, fled. Some who spoke to CNN after evacuating to Artyemovsk aboard ramshackle buses say their politicians have failed them. One, who gave his name as Pavel, told CNN, ""Me, personally, I'll take any ruler, just don't kill me. All I want is bread and salt, just don't kill me."" A woman sitting next to him said, ""We're hostages of the situation."" Pavel added, ""Big politics is interested in killing simple people. They shoot and shoot and kill us."" The sense of anger is growing in Artyemovsk, where a group of women gathered in the town center despite the cold and rain to protest against the war. Ukraine's army is so underfunded that its politicians are hamstrung, but that has not exempted them from blame for the suffering of local people. ""We use snow to clean ourselves,"" said one young woman, clearly emotional. ""And our new president didn't do anything. Absolutely nothing. Nobody cares about anything."" Another woman said, ""When they bombed one town, I waited until 5 in the evening, just to move my 2-year-old granddaughter to the train. The Ukrainian army bombed us because separatists were there."" Meanwhile, the road to Debaltseve still heaves with Ukrainian armor as the government seeks to hold off the separatists' advance. Kiev and the West accuse Russia of sending military personnel and equipment across the border into Ukraine to bolster the separatist forces. Moscow denies the allegation. The conflict's total death toll since mid-April, including combatants and civilians, is now at least 5,358 -- an increase of 272 in less than two weeks -- with another 12,235 injured, the United Nations said Tuesday. Forces indiscriminately shelled residential areas in government-controlled territories such as Debaltseve and Avdiivka and rebel-held cities such as Donetsk and Horlivka as fighting escalated last month, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said. ""Bus stops and public transport, marketplaces, schools and kindergartens, hospitals and residential areas have become battlegrounds in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine -- in clear breach of international humanitarian law which governs the conduct of armed conflicts,"" the high commissioner said in a statement. Last month's most deadly single incident involving civilians occurred in the southeastern city of Mariupol when two attacks involving multiple-launch rocket systems killed at least 31 people and injured 112 others, the United Nations said. ""Any further escalation will prove catastrophic for the 5.2 million people living in the midst of conflict in eastern Ukraine,"" the high commissioner said. The U.N. official called on nations with influence in the region to pressure the combatants to return to a ceasefire agreement reached in September in Minsk, Belarus -- a deal that eroded long ago. His office also expressed concern about ""the implications of the harsh winter months on civilians in conflict-affected areas, with shortages of food and water and power cuts."" As the situation deteriorates, the United States is considering sending lethal aid to help the Ukrainian government fend off attacks from pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This assistance would come in the form of so-called defensive lethal aid, which could include anti-tank, anti-air and anti-mortar systems. The New York Times first reported the possible change in policy, saying NATO commander Gen. Philip Breedlove is in support of the new lethal assistance, and that Secretary of State John Kerry; Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and national security adviser Susan Rice are all open to considering the idea. A U.S. official told CNN that military leadership supports defensive lethal aid being part of the discussion, but the administration is still trying to assess what reaction it could elicit from the Russian government, which the United States maintains is backing rebels in eastern Ukraine.","At least 224 civilians killed and more than 540 hurt in last three weeks of January, U.N. says .

"(CNN)Way to put your thing down, flip it and reverse it, Missy Elliott! According to Mashable, the singer/rapper/producer has returned to the charts after her performance during Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday. Elliott joined main performer Katy Perry on stage at halftime and performed a medley of some of her hits, much to the delight of fans. Those same folks apparently rushed to iTunes to download Elliott's music. Eight of her songs cracked the iTunes top 200 chart, including 2002's ""Work It,"" 2001's ""Get Ur Freak On"" and 2005's ""Lose Control."" Those songs also electrified Spotify. Streams of Elliott's music increased a whopping 676%, the music service reported. Elliott also won the Internet if the tweet love is any indication; even fellow celebrities had fan moments. Elliott released her last album in 2005 and three years later went public with her battle with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid. On Monday,  she took to Twitter to express her gratitude for the outpouring of affection. But not everyone remembered the glory days of the trash bag outfit being ""Supa Dupa Fly."" Some viewers hailed the ""new artist,"" a move reminiscent of recent tweets celebrating Paul McCartney as ""one to watch"" after he released a song with rapper Kanye West. Elliott doesn't mind people just now discovering her. Looks like it won't be a problem for long: Billboard reports the artist is on track to have a 1,000% gain in sales for the week ending February 1.

"(CNN)Linda Kaoma is on the hunt in East Africa. Her tour of the region will see her travel to Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Not in search of lions, rhinos or other big game. Rather she's on a quest for a much more elusive creature -- the African poet. ""We have a rich oral tradition and it's important that we document what is happening in history poetry-wise,"" she explains. ""Africa has a history of a lack of documentation and we really didn't want this to happen to our poets."" Kaoma, 29, is part of the team behind the Badilisha Poetry X-Change, the largest online archive of African poetry, accessible via mobile phone, in the world. The Badilisha project was originally conceived as an annual poetry festival overseen by the Africa Centre, a pan-African organization based in Cape Town in 2008. Over the following years it grew to become a powerful mouthpiece for showcasing African wordsmiths. And by 2012, the institution decided to move online in an effort to break down geographical borders and open up their diverse anthology to a wider audience in Africa. Poetry in your phone . Following an overhaul of the site last year, Badilisha relaunched in September, making its immersive archive accessible to a broader international following through a ""mobile-first"" site. It's a shrewd move on a continent where mobile phones have revolutionized critical sectors such as education, healthcare and agriculture. Adoption of mobile phone use has been prolific in Africa with mobile data services going from strength to strength. Seven out of 10 mobile users in sub-Saharan Africa use their phones to browse the web, according to a recent report from Ericsson. Elsewhere, a study by analyst firm Ovum predicted in November that ""mobile broadband connections in Africa are set to rise from 96 million in 2013 to 950 million to cover 77.3% of all mobile subscriptions in the continent by the end of 2019."" Kaoma adds: ""A lot of Africans use their mobiles to go on the Internet and because they are own main target audience, we had to cater for them and make it easy for them to access this content."" To date, the project has collected almost 400 African poets from 31 countries in Africa and across the diaspora, in 14 different languages. Since the relaunch, users are able to navigate the site through a myriad of options including by theme, poet, country, language, emotion or by their ""Top 10"" list, a popular feature curated by a guest poet each month. And it seems their following has embraced the organization's decision to go forward on mobile with an average of 3,000 visitors to the site monthly. ""We want the archive to be a place where people can come and get educated about what other African poets are saying. A place for them to interact with one another,"" says Kaoma. ""There is great value in a Kenyan interacting with a Nigerian. A Nigerian interacting with a South African... ""Also the archive has now reached an international status and it has become a global stage. Poets can get the exposure that they usually do not get."" Cape Town-based poet Toni Stuart, who compiled this month's ""Top 10"" list, says: ""I don't think the importance of an archive like this can be overstated. It is the first 'living archive' focusing solely on poets from Africa and the diaspora. ""The archive serves a number of purposes: it makes poets available to an international audience -- and for less known poets, this is a chance to be heard beyond their own community, city or country. It raises the the profile of poetry from and of the continent, while allowing people to engage with the words through hearing and reading them."" Hot on the trail of poets . Two poets are introduced to the platform weekly and each poet profile features a short biography, two text poems, a photograph and audio podcast recordings of the wordsmith reading their works. Kaoma, a poet and writer herself, says: ""It adds so much value to actually hear the poet's voice recite their work. It adds a different dimension, it adds a texture. We really want to give our audience a holistic experience of poetry. ""If some people just choose to read it, that's fine. But if others want to hear it, (the podcast) really brings the work to life."" Meanwhile, Stuart, who also runs poetry and performance workshops, says the multi-layered format ""democratizes poetry"" by ""offering an equal platform to poets working in all languages on the continent, and to established and emerging poets."" Poets can supply their work directly to the organization via the project's submissions page. It is then evaluated by a rolling judging panel who determine whether the work is suitable for Badilisha. ""At any given time we have two or three poets sitting on the panel,"" says Kaoma. ""We try to have a mix of people so we will invite poets to come curate for us. It keeps the selection process exciting and diverse."" Conversely, the team also approach poets directly to inquire if they are interested in adding their work to the collection. Additionally, they travel to various nations in search of poets to connect with. ""We write to publishers or anybody who has access to these poets and build those profiles. We do, from time to time, have to travel to a specific country. We really have to do a lot of ploughing and digging of the poetry scene and that space."" One such voice on the platform is Ghanaian-born Jamaican poet Kwame Dawes. Having first encountered Badilisha while visiting Cape Town several years ago, he is thrilled to see how the organization has created a burgeoning poetry scene online. ""I had the chance to visit their studios and to learn more about what they intended to do. It was exciting to see this fledgling idea blossom into what is simply one of the best things to happen to African poetry in a long time. ""The concept is simple, but the impact is massive."" Existing in an online space . Dawes, who is also a distinguished actor, documentary writer and founder of the prestigious African Poetry Book Fund, has not only curated content for the site but he's also featured in this month's ""Top 10,"" compiled by South Africa's Toni Stuart. He adds: ""Of course it feels good to see that other poets are engaged by my work. I am not sure what it means really (to be included in the Top 10), but I have to think that the few poems on the site resonate with people in positive ways. I am in good company, frankly, and I find that an honor."" It's a sentiment project manager Kaoma says many poets share about their inclusion in Badilisha. ""When we first started there was obviously a bit of resistance. People not understanding how being online works. Now as a society, we are more accustomed to being online, a lot of our activities are based online -- we shop online -- so as society becomes more comfortable with the idea of the web, so do poets,"" explains the curator. ""Poets are very open to it and they appreciate having such a space there they can engage with one another."" Badilisha is principally funded by Spier, a South African wine estate, with additional financing from applications to the government and other private institutions. And in a time when traditional publishers are shying away from printing poetry due to lack of sales, the project offers poets a new outlet for presenting their work in a digital age. But Kaoma is quick to clarify Badilisha's position as an alternative literary publisher. ""A lot of publishers right now aren't publishing a lot of poetry, (and) we don't want that to be what stops us as poets from having thriving careers. I think we can exist online and maybe when people see how popular poetry really is, they can start increasing the number of books being published. I think we can coexist and work with one another.""

"(CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was charged Monday with murder and other counts in a hit-and-run in Compton, California, last week, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. He is being held without bail and is expected to be arraigned on Tuesday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted in the fatal hit-and-run. He is accused of running over two men and killing one following an argument. The man who died has been identified as Terry Carter, 55. The second man's name is Cle Sloan, 51. Knight, who was out on bail in a separate robbery case, is charged with with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of hit-and-run with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, the district attorney's office said in a statement. He has prior convictions, ""making this a third strike case,"" it said. Knight turned himself in to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department investigators early Friday. CNN affiliate KCAL-TV and the Los Angeles Times quoted his attorney, James Blatt, as saying Knight feared for his life and was trying to flee when the incident happened. ""We feel strongly Mr. Knight did not do anything wrong in this matter. He was attacked by a number of individuals; that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses. He left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life,"" he said. Knight founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991, signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.

"Paul Walker's death sent ""Fast & Furious"" producers to the editing room to find a way to salvage what they've shot for the franchise's seventh installment, a source close to the production told CNN. Walker's ex-cop character, Brian O'Conner, has been central to five of the first six ""Fast & Furious"" stories and was returning to the next release set to hit theaters July 11, 2014. Many millions of dollars are at stake, considering the franchise has sold $2.6 billion in tickets around the world since 2001.  But the filmmakers have to be careful in deciding how they bring Walker's character to an end in the series, unless they replace him with another actor. Walker, 40, and the rest of the cast were on a short break for Thanksgiving when he stepped into a red 2005 Porsche Carerra GT for a short ride around a Santa Clarita, California, business park Saturday afternoon.  Investigators believe the car, driven by Walker's friend Roger Rodas, was speeding when it clipped a light pole and was engulfed in flames, killing both men. Man arrested for stealing part of Paul Walker Porsche wreckage . Universal Pictures confirmed Tuesday that they've put production on hold ""for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise.""  A well-placed source shared details with CNN about what's gone on behind the scenes. Walker had been set to fly back to Atlanta by Monday for the resumption of filming.  Filming, which began in the Georgia capital three months ago, was already behind schedule and only about 50% completed, according to the source. His death left the producers, cast and crew in confusion, the source said. Editors began reviewing frame by frame what had already been shot with Walker, including outtakes, for footage that might be incorporated into a rewritten script, the source said.  They were looking for ways to piece together new scenes with Walker, perhaps using computer-generated imagery, or CGI. The script writers have been considering how to rewrite the story to end Walker's character.  If O'Conner is killed off while street racing -- a key element in each film -- Walker's fans could be offended. Stars who died during production . Without a creative answer, producers could be forced to start over without Walker's character, possibly delaying the film that Universal counted on to be a tent pole for its summer releases.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Just call it the anti-protest protest. Tens of thousands of people marched through Hong Kong yesterday in support of China and to protest Occupy Central, a pro-democracy movement that says it will plan to stage a civil disobedience sit-in unless the Chinese government allows the Hong Kong public to nominate and vote for its next leader. Robert Chow, the organizer of Sunday's march, said it represented Hong Kong's desire to work ""peacefully"" with the Chinese government in Beijing on political reform. ""We want universal suffrage, but not at any cost,"" he told CNN Monday. The pro-government march followed the same route as Hong Kong's massive annual anti-government, pro-democracy rally on July 1, but the tenor was markedly different: Sunday's marchers were arranged into organized groups wearing matching t-shirts, some emblazoned with names of mainland Chinese organizations. Many waved Chinese flags. Paid protester claim . Local media swirled with reports of marchers getting paid or bused in to attend the pro-government march. One video (Cantonese) purportedly showed cash being handed out to marchers. Other images appeared to show marchers getting paid and enjoying free food in a dim-sum restaurant. Chow said he took the bribery accusations ""seriously"" and would ""investigate"" but maintained that no laws were broken. There were also conflicting reports on the size of the march. Chow said his group counted a ""quarter million"" marchers, but an estimate by University of Hong Kong statisticians put the number much lower, between 79,000 and 88,000. By contrast, July's pro-democracy rally drew between 154,000 and 172,000, according to the university. Pictures taken by reporters appeared to show a noticeably thinner crowd on Sunday than the crowd in July, but Chow said the difference was because ""we were marching very, very fast."" Historic Hong Kong neighborhood fights to preserve its past . Different visions of democracy . Benny Tai, the organizer of Occupy Central, said Chow's rally offered ""nothing substantial"" in terms of new ideas. ""[Chow's supporters] talk about universal suffrage, but they never explain what they mean by universal suffrage."" Tai's group has proposed an electoral reform package in which every citizen would be allowed to vote for the city's next leader, with candidates freely nominated by the general public. But Beijing says it will only allow citizens to vote on candidates that are approved by a small, China-friendly committee. Chow, who supports the government's plan, said Hong Kongers should take the deal rather than risk a volatile showdown with China. ""We want universal suffrage, with peace. Iraq has universal suffrage -- has it got peace? No, we don't want that,"" he said. ""Benny Tai wants a specific way of election, or else. If we don't get it, then all hell breaks loose."" The current chief executive of Hong Kong, Leung Chun-ying, is favored by Beijing and has signed a petition in support of Chow's movement. Under the ""one country, two systems"" policy, the seven million residents of Hong Kong -- defined as a ""Special Administrative Region"" of China -- are afforded greater civil liberties than those in the mainland, under a leadership approved by Beijing. This reflects an agreement reached between China and the United Kingdom prior to the handover of the city in 1997, which promised Hong Kong a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years after its return. But there are increasing fears that those freedoms are being eroded. OPINION: Hong Kong's struggle for democracy matters . What is Beijing thinking? The future of Hong Kong could become clear soon. On August 31, China's powerful National People's Congress Standing Committee is expected to announce a decision on Hong Kong's electoral reform. If the decision seems to leave open the possibility for Hong Kongers to nominate their own leaders, then Tai has said he'll work with the government to produce an election reform plan that ""satisfies international standards."" But if not, ""there will be no more negotiation and we will have to plan for Occupy Central."" The threat of civil disobedience ""is our bargaining power,"" he explained. ""They take us seriously, though they will never admit that."" Democracy in China? Although at odds with one another, both Chow and Tai believe democracy in Hong Kong might one day lead to democracy in China. Tai said Hong Kong is a test case for the mainland's political future. ""For political reform, that is, introducing true elections, Hong Kong could be the experimental ground for the Communist Party. The Chinese government will closely observe how elections will be conducted. ""If Hong Kong gets the chance to have true universal suffrage, that may reflect that China has the intention to introduce political reform or some kind of election in the future -- maybe in five or ten years."" Chow said Chinese democracy might look ""very different from the western style of democracy. ""Maybe it'll turn out to be a better system.""

"Let's get this out of the way straight off:  The Transportation Security Administration is probably not going to top anyone's list of Favorite Federal Government Agencies. And the stories of its failures spread faster than a speeding jetliner: TSA officers stealing money from luggage, taking bribes from drug dealers, sleeping on the job. So it shouldn't come as any surprise that a new Government Accountability Office report, citing a 26% increase in misconduct among TSA employees between 2010 and 2012, is striking a nerve with some travelers who've had to endure the shoeless, beltless shuffle on the trip through security. ""Whenever you get an organization that has to be there, sometimes it just starts to take on a weight of its own,"" traveler Chris Simon said Wednesday at San Francisco International Airport. ""So maybe it's just not being managed."" ""This makes me never want to check my bag,"" Twitter user KathrynPowers1 posted Wednesday in response to the news. ""That's disgusting, "" tweeted user RidockKing. GAO report reveals increase in TSA employee misconduct . Among the report's findings: . -- Misconduct cases involving TSA employees -- everything from being late to skipping crucial security protocols -- rose from 2,691 a year in 2010 to 3,408 in 2012. -- About a third of the cases involved being late or not reporting for work, the largest single category of offenses. -- 10% of offenses involved inappropriate comments or abusive behavior. -- About a quarter involved screening and security failures -- including sleeping on the job -- or neglect of duty offenses that resulted in losses or careless inspections. Photos: 20 odd items confiscated by the TSA . Examples of violations . The report details one case of a TSA agent suspended for seven days after trying to carry a relative's bag past security without screening. A supervisor interceded and the bag was found to contain ""numerous prohibited items,"" according to the GAO report. It didn't say what the items were. In another case, a TSA agent was suspended for 30 days after a closed-circuit camera caught the officer failing to individually examine X-ray images of passenger items, as required by agency policy. Among the 9,622 offenses cataloged in the report, the GAO also found 384 ethics and integrity violations, 155 ""appearance and hygiene"" complaints and 56 cases of theft. While not specifically mentioned in the report, notable cases of theft by TSA agents include a 2012 case in which two former employees pleaded guilty to stealing $40,000 from a checked bag at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, and a 2011 guilty plea from an officer who admitted stealing between $10,000 and $30,000 from travelers at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. The officer in the 2011 case, Al Raimi, admitted he would ""kick up"" some of that money to a supervisor, who in turn allowed him to keep stealing. The supervisor, Michael Arato, also pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks and bribes. Airport officer claims he was fired for exposing sleeping guards . Taking it seriously . Overall, 47% of the offenses detailed in the report resulted in a letter of reprimand, at least 17% cost the employees their jobs and 31% ended with a suspension. ""If they're stealing, they're doing drugs or breaching the security system intentionally and I can prove it, they're out,"" TSA Deputy Administrator John W. Halinski told a joint hearing of two House Homeland Security subcommittees on Wednesday. But he said, even the letters of reprimand handed out in nearly half of the cases are serious punishment. Such letters can block employees from receiving a bonus or promotion, and stay with them their entire career, he told Rep. Richard Hudson, R-North Carolina, chair of the Transportation Security subcommittee. ""It's a serious thing, sir,"" Halinksi said. He  also defended his agency's 56,000 employee workforce as overwhelmingly upright. But Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican and longtime critic of the TSA who requested the audit, is skeptical. He told CNN that the report shows the TSA is not doing enough to respond to and prevent misconduct. ""There's not even a way to properly report some of the offenses, so this may be just the tip of the iceberg of some of the offenses,"" he said. TSA agents at Newark spared from firings after violations . Some other lawmakers stood by the agency Wednesday, saying the offenses represent a small percentage of TSA's 56,000 employees. ""Transportation security officers have an undeniably hard job and the overwhelming majority of them conduct themselves honorably and in accordance with TSA protocols,"" Rep. Cedric Richardson, D-Louisiana, said during Wednesday's hearing. Analyst: Turn the tables on TSA . Frost and Sullivan airport security analyst John Hernandez said the report isn't particularly surprising. The TSA has been plagued by uneven training for years, he said, resulting in a work force that isn't always properly educated about how to do their jobs. ""I think John Q. Traveler should not so much be concerned, but take an active role in security,"" he said. ""As they are willing to point out things we do wrong, we should be ready to report on the failure in their security operations, as well."" The government report calls on the TSA to improve how the agency monitors and follows up on allegations of misconduct. The agency has accepted the recommendations, Halinksi said.

"Rob Portman is mapping out a possible presidential run, creating a narrative, talking to fundraisers and looking to change his image from the senator who once ran George W. Bush's budget office to the anti-Obama from Ohio with a serious resume. ""I probably have more experience than other people who are running or thinking about running,"" he said. The first-term senator and policy wonk could run as a sort of anti-Obama -- a swing state pragmatist with a loaded resume. Portman certainly wouldn't run as an outsider. He embraces his previous White House experience having worked for both Bush administrations. He went so far as to point out his executive branch background is both foreign and domestic. He traveled overseas as counsel to the 41st president and later served as the U.S. Trade Representative under the 43rd. He worked in the legislative affairs office of the elder George Bush and was budget director for his son, developing relationships on Capitol Hill that span decades. His experience could also make a bid difficult in a GOP primary. Portman ran the White House budget office in t years when tax cuts and war spending spun up government spending and added to growing deficits. But his time in Washington is certainly a not-so-subtle counterpoint to that of President Obama, who clocked just two years, a month and six days in Washington before announcing his intention to run it -- and the country. Following President Obama's ""flash,"" as some Portman confidants describe it, the Ohioan would be the prototype of substance and competence. Next to hostility -- witness New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie shouting ""sit down and shut up"" to a heckler just before Election Day -- Portman offers civility. Bill Kilimnick, the general manager of the Portman family restaurant, Lebanon Ohio's Golden Lamb, gushes about how nice the senator is, saying he has ""a servant's heart."" For the last few weeks, he says his diners have been buzzing, ""Is Robby gonna be the president?"" Unknown . Purveyors of conventional wisdom in Washington don't dispute his qualifications or likability, but they dismiss the 58-year-old Midwestern lawyer as not electrifying enough to galvanize voters across the country. Supporters say he could be a foil to Obama. But they have also worked to alter the ""boring"" perception by sending Portman out to kayak and bike-ride in some of his recent media interviews. (He agreed to lunch on the lip-smacking ribs with this CNN reporter.) Perceptions can be a problem, but voters have to know you exist. Portman acknowledges that gaining attention would be his first obstacle. ""I'd be an asterisk in the polls,"" he said, adding that the national primary debates are his only chance to prove himself. Debates could be key for Portman. He was considered a top-notch stand-in twice for President Obama, as well as John Kerry and Al Gore in debate prep during the last four presidential elections. Portman says he has a national network of donors that could keep his campaign afloat until debate season arrives. The downside is the Republican National Committee has already pledged to limit the number of sanctioned debates. It wasn't lost on Portman's boosters that one of his contemporaries at the Republican Governors Association, Chris Christie, took a victory lap the morning after the election by appearing on all five of the network morning shows to claim credit for a Republican romp of statehouses coast-to-coast. Portman, too, has connections nationwide. Wearing one of Cincinnati's infamous Montgomery Inn bibs in front of a plate of pork, poultry and Saratoga chips, the senator said he's sent the restaurant's ribs all over the country. He's also sent cartons of the Oprah-approved Cincinnati Graeter's ice cream around the United States, most recently to Maine, for the enjoyment of the greater Bush family. Those connections come not only from his White House service or his vetting two years ago as a potential running mate to Mitt Romney, but from his recent vice chairmanship of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He was charged with fundraising for the competitive Senate races, but had a heavy hand in recruiting and counseling the top candidates who shocked the political world by swamping Democrats early this month. He said some of those donors he's been speaking with over the last few weeks have been pressing him on whether he's planning to take the plunge. His answer has been that the best way for Republicans to approach 2016 is to focus on a proactive agenda and show they can govern rather than simply obstruct. But he acknowledged that family, good friends and advisers are encouraging him to make the race, even as he prepares to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2016. According to sources close to him, conference calls about a potential presidential run are well under way. Those advisers are pushing him to get his name in the mix and get aggressive. Can a Republican beat Clinton? Portman thinks any Democratic candidate -- including Hillary Clinton -  can be beaten if the GOP shows it, too, can have a bigger tent and reach out to minorities and women. He's worried both about how polarized the country is and how narrowly the Republican Party has approached that division. ""I do think there's good people thinking about running, some folks who are in the mix, but I do want to be sure that we in the Republican Party also have strong candidates that can win in a general election,"" he said. He found President Obama's message of unity in 2008 ""really compelling,"" even though he didn't vote for him, and he thinks the red and blue states do need to find common ground. Portman casts himself as the solution to that problem. He deepened his Capitol Hill relationships during his twelve years as a congressman and four years as a senator. In the House, former President Bill Clinton signed 12 bipartisan bills he authored; in the Senate, President Obama has signed 10. Asked about the challenge of taking on Hillary Clinton in a general election, he didn't hesitate with this critique: ""I don't know Mrs. Clinton well personally, but I can tell you looking at her record as secretary of state, which is apparently what she intends to run on, I can't think of any place in the world that got better."" As examples, he listed the U.S. relationships with Iran and China, the Israeli-Palestian conflict, Russia's incursions into eastern Ukraine, and threats from North Korea, underscoring that she did not leave ""a more peaceful, stable world."" But he left Benghazi off his list, later explaining, ""I know some of my colleagues focus a lot on Benghazi, and it was a tragedy... but it's not just about Benghazi; it's a much broader issue."" Timing of a bid . Although he has declined to provide a timeline before, Portman said he'll think it through with his family and make his decision after the first of the year. ""That's true for a lot of these candidates.... That's kind of the timing for most people."" Family matters are most often cited as the reasons would-be candidates opt not to run. They tend to be the wake-up calls that can arrest presidential dreams, given how grueling two-year national campaigns have become and the toll they take on the families that pursue them. ""It's not about me, it's not about what I want or, frankly, what my family wants,"" he said. ""Running for president isn't good for your family. My family understands that. They support me doing what I'm doing. They would support me if I wanted to do the bigger campaign, but it's about what's best for the country."" His wife, Jane, and three children have encouraged him throughout his career. His son, Will, a recent Yale graduate and current Google employee revealed to him that he's always been gay, convincing him to support gay marriage. Related: Portman's dramatic reversal on gay marriage . While some Republican strategists wondered whether that would haunt him in future GOP primaries, Portman points out same-sex marriage is among the fastest-changing issues in politics.

"(CNN)Walking through the 400-acre Moerenuma Park on the outskirts of Sapporo can be a curious experience. Two perfectly geometric hills rise from the pancake-flat landscape, trees planted in rows form a circular copse, while a glass and steel pyramid looms nearby and three huge stainless steel columns point out of the ground like the antenna of a giant subterranean satellite dish. Seen from above the layout is less recognizable as a park and more akin to the ancient line drawings in the Peruvian Nazca desert. And all this built on top of a former sewage works. As far as municipal parks go, it might be one of the world's most understated yet intriguing -- a fusion of classic Japanese principles of quiet, natural beauty with 20th-century modernist art. It was the final act of Japanese-American sculptor Isuma Noguchi whose career spanned seven decades -- much of it spent fusing art, architecture and public spaces. But Noguchi did not live to see the park built. More than sculpture . Noguchi drew up plans for the park in November 1988, but died, aged 84, just one month later. It then took 17 years to complete his final project. ""It was thrilling to finally see all the ideas that hadn't been realized during his life,"" says Jenny Dixon, curator of the Isamu Noguchi Museum in New York, who was at the park's opening ceremony in 2005. Some of the concepts used in the park go back to some of Noguchi's ideas from the 1930s. Noguchi's training with celebrated Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi in the 1920s helped fix his desire to be a sculptor, but it wasn't until the 1940s that he found critical acclaim and larger commissions. Far from being solely an abstract sculptor, Noguchi designed playgrounds and gardens, turned his hand to industrial design (creating what's now regarded as a classic table top and lamp) and even designed sets and costumes for celebrated 20th-century dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. ""This was very much at a time when the canon was either you're a painter or you're a sculptor and only that. He very much wanted to prove that wrong,"" says Dixon. As well as moving across media he straddled two cultures. With an Irish-American mother and Japanese father, he spent much of his life promoting artist exchange between the two countries, often at times when relations between them were tense or downright hostile. Wartime disruptions . When Japanese-Americans were sent to internment camps in the United States during the Second World War, he volunteered to live in one in Arizona. Showing solidarity with those forcibly moved there, he tried to design camp equipment to make them better places to live. However it proved easier getting in than out, and after seven months he moved back to New York. After the war he was one of the first American artists to visit and engage with Japanese architects and artists, which led to an invitation to design the railings for the Peace Bridges in Hiroshima in 1951. Later he went on to collaborate with Kenzo Tange, the architect who left a huge impression on the skylines of Japanese cities in the 1960s and 70s. 'I do not hide' Like other planned Japanese gardens, Moerenuma Park changes with the seasons. In winter it's buried under deep Hokkaido snow, where skiers hurtle down 62-meter-tall Mount Moere or ski cross-country throughout the grounds. Cherry trees blossom in spring and in summer the whitewashed concrete ""music shell"" provide a stage for concerts and organized events. Another example of Noguchi's emphasis on fusing the natural world with the manufactured lies inside the pyramid with a summertime cooling system that uses snow stored underground during the winter months. On his respect for nature and his own modern ethos Noguchi said: ""The art of stone in a Japanese garden is that of placement. Its ideal does not deviate from that of nature ... But I am also a sculptor of the West. I place my mark and do not hide."" Despite his work appearing in 17 cities across the United States and around the world, Dixon believes Noguchi is appreciated more in Japan than in the United States, citing hundreds of thousands of visitors to an exhibition of his work just 10 years ago in Yokohama. ""I think in Japan he's seen much more as a hero,"" she says.

"Aaron Swartz, an Internet savant who at a young age shaped the online era by co-developing RSS and Reddit and later became a digital activist, has committed suicide. Swartz's body was found Friday evening in Brooklyn, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman with the New York medical examiner's office. The 26-year-old had hanged himself in his apartment. His family and partner said they were ""in shock, and have not yet come to terms with his passing."" ""Aaron's insatiable curiosity, creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable -- these gifts made the world, and our lives, far brighter,"" they said in a statement. ""We're grateful for our time with him, to those who loved him and stood with him, and to all of those who continue his work for a better world."" A prodigy, Swartz was behind some of the Internet's defining moments, soaring to heights that many developers only dream of. At the same time, he was plagued by legal problems arising from his aggressive activism, and he was also known to suffer depression, a personal matter that he publicly revealed on his blog. Technology activist Cory Doctorow met Swartz when he was 14 or 15, Doctorow said on his blog. ""In so many ways, he was an adult, even then, with a kind of intense, fast intellect that really made me feel like he was part and parcel of the Internet society,"" Doctorow wrote. ""But Aaron was also a person who'd had problems with depression for many years,"" Doctorow blogged. He added that ""whatever problems Aaron was facing, killing himself didn't solve them. Whatever problems Aaron was facing, they will go unsolved forever."" At age 14, Swartz co-wrote the RSS specification. He was later admitted to Stanford University, but dropped out after a year because, as he wrote in a blog post, ""I didn't find it a very intellectual atmosphere, since most of the other kids seemed profoundly unconcerned with their studies."" What he did next was help develop Reddit, the social news website that was eventually bought by heavyweight publisher Conde Nast in 2006. Swartz then engaged in Internet digital activism, co-founding Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against Internet censorship. But he pushed the legal limits, allegedly putting him on the wrong side of the law. In 2011, he was arrested in Boston for alleged computer fraud and illegally obtaining documents from protected computers. He was later indicted in an incident in which he allegedly stole millions of online documents from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He pleaded not guilty in September, according to MIT's ""The Tech"" newspaper. Two years earlier, the FBI investigated him after he released millions of U.S. federal court documents online. The alleged hacking was significant because the documents came from the government-run Public Access to Court Electronic Records, or PACER, which typically charges a fee, which was 8 cents a page in 2009. No charges were filed in that case, but on October 5, 2009, he posted online his FBI file that he apparently requested from the agency. He redacted the FBI agents' names and his personal information, he said. In that file, the FBI said more than 18 million pages with a value of about $1.5 million were downloaded from PACER in September 2008 to Swartz's home in Highland Park, Illinois. ""As I hoped, it's truly delightful,"" he wrote of his FBI file. Swartz's family and partner recalled his ""commitment to social justice,"" and called his death ""the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach."" They criticized U.S. prosecutors for seeking ""an exceptionally harsh array of charges (for) an alleged crime that had no victims,"" and MIT because it did not ""stand up for Aaron."" ""Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death,"" they said. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment on Swartz's case, citing respect for the family. His funeral will be held Tuesday at a synagogue in Highland Park. Swartz, who completed a fellowship at Harvard's Ethics Center Lab on Institutional Corruption, frequently blogged about his life, success and personal struggles. In some instances, he wrote about death. ""There is a moment, immediately before life becomes no longer worth living, when the world appears to slow down and all its myriad details suddenly become brightly, achingly apparent,"" he wrote in a 2007 post titled ""A Moment Before Dying."" On November 27, 2007, he blogged about ""depressed mood."" ""Surely there have been times when you've been sad. Perhaps a loved one has abandoned you or a plan has gone horribly awry. Your face falls. Perhaps you cry. You feel worthless. You wonder whether it's worth going on,"" he wrote. ""Everything you think about seems bleak — the things you've done, the things you hope to do, the people around you. You want to lie in bed and keep the lights off. Depressed mood is like that, only it doesn't come for any reason and it doesn't go for any either. ""At best, you tell yourself that your thinking is irrational, that it is simply a mood disorder, that you should get on with your life. But sometimes that is worse. You feel as if streaks of pain are running through your head, you thrash your body, you search for some escape but find none. And this is one of the more moderate forms,"" he wrote.

"Plans to adopt Chinese civic education into the Hong Kong public school curriculum have sparked protests among residents, who claim it amounts to ""brainwashing"" impressionable young minds with pro-mainland propaganda. More than 90,000 people took to the streets on Sunday against introducing a ""Moral and National Education"" subject, according to protest organizers, while police estimated the turnout at 32,000. While the actual content of the curriculum has yet to be determined, guidelines in a booklet distributed by the government's National Education Services Centre to schools have inflamed the controversy. The booklet, entitled ""The China Model,"" includes provocative statements, including that China's ruling party is ""progressive, selfless and united."" It also criticized multi-party systems as bringing disaster to countries such as the United States. The booklet also makes no mention of major events that many view as integral to China's history, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Many teachers, parents, and students have interpreted the booklet as a basis for the national education curriculum, which will be introduced in primary schools in September and in secondary schools the following school year. ""We don't want the next generation of Hong Kong people to be brainwashed,"" said Joshua Wong, 15, the convener of Scholarism, a group of secondary students that helped organize Sunday's protest along with the National Education Parents Concern Group and the Professional Teachers' Union. ""It's impossible to be brainwashed,"" said Wong Chi Man, who directs the National Education Services Centre. ""Hong Kong people still have access to a lot of information.  All education is, to some extent, designed to brainwash. I think the word 'brainwash' is too negative. It evokes something out of 'Clockwork Orange.'"" ""Hong Kong's future and China's future are inseparable,"" he added. ""We will never be independent so we should learn to think the same way as China. Teachers should lead our children to think about Hong Kong's future."" Wong went on to explain that there will be some flexibility as to how national education will be implemented.  For example, schools can choose to have specific lessons in the classroom or incorporate ""national education"" as a broader theme. ""It's important to point out the government's approach actually allows for a lot of autonomy on the part of the schools to teach the curriculum,"" said Peter Cheung, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Politics and Public Administration.  ""So it's up to the schools to teach what they want to teach with reference to these very general guidelines."" ""Some of the critics want specific topics to be discussed, but the government approach doesn't preclude specific topics to be discussed at all,"" Cheung said. ""I don't think the government is really going to supervise the specific teaching of this subject,"" he added, predicting, ""There will be a pluralistic way of teaching the same subject."" The controversy followed major protests in the last two months that underscored tensions over the influence of the Chinese central government in Hong Kong's affairs and freedoms. The annual vigil held on June 4 to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre drew a record turnout of 180,000, according to organizers. Police reported the figure was closer to 85,000.  By even the most conservative estimates, there were 15,000 more attendees than last year. On the July 1 annual protest marking Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty, 400,000 people took to the streets to oppose Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who was recently appointed by an electoral college of 1,200 influential figures in Hong Kong with Beijing's approval.  Public anger was also inflamed by the suspicious death of Tiananmen dissident Li Wangyang . It was the largest turnout since the estimated 500,000 protesters who marked the same date in 2003. Police put the figure at a much lower 63,000 people. ""The demonstrations and the concerns about the national education reflect the continuing anxiety of the Hong Kong people toward the mainland's politics and growing influence on Hong Kong affairs,"" said Professor Cheung. The uproar over the national education subject is reflective of anxieties being aggravated by the new government under Leung, which he said ""lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many people."" ""C.Y.

Cheung said that the introduction of a national education subject should come as no surprise, as the government has publicized its plans for many years. The Education Bureau launched a four-month public consultation in May 2011, and government plans to develop a moral and national education subject were included in former Chief Executive Donald Tsang's 2010-11 annual policy address in October 2010. ""It's not a secret -- it begs the questions why some of the protesters and organizers haven't paid attention before,"" said Cheung. Activists have been campaigning on the issue for the past year, and Sunday's protest was a culmination of frustrations over government inaction, said Wong from Scholarism. He said the student group has recruited more than 5,000 volunteers and will continue to press the government to scrap the national education subject. If the government does not take action by September 3, Wong said students would boycott classes and teachers would boycott the subject in their classrooms.","Introduction of Chinese civic education into Hong Kong public school curriculum sparked protests .

"Washington (CNN)For the head of the FBI's counterterrorist division, Michael Steinbach, the unknown worries him the most. Steinbach is leading the daunting effort to stay on top of the evolving threat landscape, which includes targeting and recruiting teenage Americans. In an exclusive interview with CNN inside the agency's Strategic Information and Operations Center, he acknowledged it's extremely difficult to track every American who might travel abroad to join terrorist groups like the Islamic State. ""I'm worried about individuals that we don't know about that have training,"" Steinbach said. ""We know what we know. But there is a number that's greater than that that we don't know."" Steinbach says U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies don't track individuals leaving the United States to vacation in Europe. ""Once you get to Europe, you can easily get down to Turkey and into Syria"" Steinbach says. There's growing concern about homegrown violent extremism in the aftermath of last month's terror attacks in Paris. Those strikes underscored the threat posed to the West by small groups of terrorists with western passports who are influenced by the rhetoric espoused by ISIS. Steinbach is concerned that type of attack could happen on U.S. soil. ISIS images appear to show Jordanian pilot burned alive . When asked if there are ISIS cells in the U.S., Steinbach said ""there are individuals that have been in communication with groups like ISIL who have a desire to conduct an attack"" and those people are living in the U.S. right now, but he says the term ""sleeper cells"" is too simplistic, because the threat is much more complicated and diffuse. In the U.S., the FBI has seen children as young as 15 recruited by ISIS and Steinbach said he ""can't speak with 100% certainty that individuals of that age group have not gotten over there successfully."" In some cases, Steinbach said parents even encourage their children to be involved with terror groups. ""There are individuals out there who are inspired by the message of terrorist groups and they encourage family members, including their children, to follow that path,"" he said, adding in those cases, the FBI holds the parents responsible. Opinion: Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? Steinbach said the FBI is working around the clock to combat the recruitment of Americans but U.S. law enforcement can't do the job alone. It's up to families to speak up as well, he said. ""In the majority of cases, we know that someone recognizes that change in behavior, that radicalization,"" he said. ""That family member or friend chooses not to intervene. And by not getting involved, the story ends in a very familiar fashion, and that's death."" He also said ISIS is aggressively pursuing women on social media. ""The recruitment of women by ISIS is much more than we've ever seen by a terrorist organization,"" he said. ""We have seen everything from a female fighter -- dedicated groups of women fighters -- and those who have come over to support foreign fighters by marrying them."" Colorado teen gets 4 years for wanting to join ISIS . He emphasizes ISIS is pushing out a false narrative of what it's like in Syria in order to lure them. Monitoring social media poses its own challenges, he said. The sheer volume of posts calls for strong analytical skills to weed through the data, which he said is a ""full time job and a challenge."" ""We've seen lots of places, online media, forums, social media, where there have been calls to conducting lone wolf attacks in your home country through a variety of means, not necessarily a sophisticated technique, but use what you have, use the tools you have and conduct an attack,"" Steinbach said. ""They are using it successfully, I might add, to spot, assess, identify, target folks outside of war zones,"" he elaborated. And, of course, the FBI must also strike a delicate balance of respecting privacy concerns of Americans while trying to protect them. ""We don't have a desire or a right to step on somebody's freedom of expression. They have a right to express their opinion,"" Steinbach says. ""But when that opinion turns into violent rhetoric and then into action, that's something different."" Obama: ISIS only 'interested in death and destruction' Still, the recent arrest of an Ohio man, Christopher Lee Cornell, has drawn criticism that the government is making terrorists out of people. He raised red flags by posting messages supportive of violent jihad on social media and was eventually arrested for plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol. But there were doubts about how seriously Cornell sought to act on his threats. To his critics, Steinbach says, ""I need folks to understand that whether you're talking about a foreign terrorist organization directing individuals or just inspiring individuals...we identify individuals with the intent. We don't manufacture that intent. We don't put that intent into their mind."" But do they have the capability and manpower to combat so many individuals with the intent of attacking Americans? ""I don't know if enough manpower is the right word,"" he said. ""Look, there are lots of threats out there, criminal threats, counter-intelligence-based threats, cyber threats and terrorism threats. And we have to identify those highest priority threats and focus the resources. There is a finite number of resources and we have to focus those resources on those threats.""

"President Barack Obama called for a ""sustained conversation"" surrounding the relationship between police and the communities they serve after a series of meetings with Cabinet members, law enforcement officials, young activists and others on Monday. The meetings follow a week of sometimes violent protests that swept the nation following the decision by a grand jury last Monday not to indict a white police officer in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri. Later on Monday, Attorney General Eric Holder, speaking in Atlanta, said the federal investigation of the incident is ongoing. ""The Justice Department's investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown, as well as our investigation into allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department, remain ongoing and active,"" he said. ""They have been rigorous and independent from the very beginning."" Members of the Congressional Black Caucus also spoke out on Ferguson and broader racial tensions in the United States. ""The Ferguson grand jury's decision not to indict former officer Darren Wilson was yet another slap in our face. It was a painful reminder that just like with Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice and so many others that law enforcement officers killed - black and brown men and boys - without repercussions,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, the House floor. ""The fact that our country - the greatest country in the world - remains mired in race relations issues in the year 2014 is an embarrassment,"" she said. ""If we are to learn anything from the tragic death of Michael Brown, we must first acknowledge that we have a race issue that we are not addressing."" The incident, and subsequent months of unrest in Ferguson, set off a national debate over the tactics and tools used by law enforcement to keep the peace, which critics said were at times too aggressive. According to the White House press pool report, Obama told a crowd of about 50 activists, law enforcement and elected officials that the problem is ""solvable,"" but that there needs to be an ongoing discussion of the issues uncovered by Ferguson. ""[This is] not a problem simply of Ferguson, this is a problem that is national. It is a solvable problem, but it is one that unfortunately spikes but fades into background,"" he said. ""What we need is a sustained conversation...to move forward in a constructive fashion."" Obama held his first meeting with members of his Cabinet -- Holder, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson attended, as well as deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work and Michael Botticelli, the acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Policy. They discussed a review Obama ordered in August of federal funding and programs that provide equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies, according to the White House. A White House official confirms a presidential trip to Ferguson was indeed under consideration last week after Obama was asked by CNN about the possibility of such a visit just as the unrest was flaring up again in the Missouri city. But because the issues that arose in Ferguson are more widespread than one incident in one community, the official said, White House advisers decided on what is described as a more comprehensive approach of convening a large group of stakeholders from cities around the country to tackle the issue in a more thorough manner. A trip to Ferguson has not been ruled out in the future.  But it appears for now, the White House is opting for the route they are taking this week.â€‹ . During his remarks Monday afternoon, Obama admitted that past task forces have fallen short, but said that ""this time will be different because the president of the United States is deeply vested in making it different."" RELATED: Obama preparing executive order on police militarization . Following his Cabinet meeting, Obama hosted a group of young civil rights leaders â€” including representatives from the Ohio Students Association and the Howard University Student Association â€” in the Oval Office to discuss, per the White House, ""the broader challenges we still face as a nation, including the mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color."" And he then sat down with elected officials, law enforcement officials and community, civil rights and faith leaders from around the nation to discuss ways to ""build trust"" between communities and law enforcement. That meeting included the mayors of Boston, Mass., Milwaukee, Wisc., New York, N.Y., Gary, Ind. and Philadelphia, Pa, as well as representatives from a number of police organizations and both the Baltimore and Philadelphia police departments. The Rev. Al Sharpton was in attendance as well, along with representatives from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Council of La Raza, the American Civil Liberties Union and others. Sharpton called it an ""historic evening,"" and said he came away with the sense that the president and the administration are putting their weight behind their groups' recommendations. He did caution, however, that this meeting cannot be ""an isolated incident"" and needs to be followed by action. National Urban League President Marc Morial said the meeting was unlike any other he's participated in and featured ""candid, open, productive, substantive conversation."" He called today's actions from the president ""meaningful."" Holder is also set to address the events in Ferguson during a Monday night forum at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Ga., a church where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Civic leaders, students, community leaders and others have been invited to the forum, and Holder plans to give remarks afterward. The day's events come as protests continue into their second week. On Monday, protesters snarled traffic throughout Washington, D.C. by blocking main roadways across the city, according to the D.C. Police Department.","President Barack Obama met with members of his Cabinet and civil rights leaders Monday .

"On Sunday morning Sept. 15, 1963, a dynamite bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four black children, and injuring many others.  The names of the dead girls were Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Denise McNair. That afternoon a phone rang at the house of Gene Patterson, the editor of the Atlanta Constitution.  Patterson was mowing the lawn, his nine-year-old daughter Mary nearby. The call from the office carried the horrible news from Birmingham. Patterson, without changing his clothes, drove to town and with tears in his eyes banged out a column so powerful that Walter Cronkite would ask him to read it for the CBS Evening News. It began: . A Negro mother wept in the street Sunday morning in front of a Baptist Church in Birmingham.  In her hand she held a shoe, one shoe, from the foot of her dead child.  We hold that shoe with her. Every one of us in the white South holds that small shoe in his hand. It is too late to blame the sick criminals who handled the dynamite.  The FBI and the police can deal with that kind.  The charge against them is simple.  They killed four children. Only we can trace the truth, Southerner -- you and I.  We broke those children's bodies. T.S. Eliot once wrote that it is the job of the poet to find the sacred object that correlates to the emotion he wants to express.  For Patterson, the object was that one small shoe: . We hold that shoe in our hand, Southerner.  Let us see it straight, and look at the blood on it. Let us compare it with the unworthy speeches of Southern public men who have traduced the Negro; match it with the spectacle of shrilling children whose parents and teachers turned them free to spit epithets at small huddles of Negro school children for a week before this Sunday in Birmingham; hold up the shoe and look beyond it to the state house in Montgomery where the official attitudes of Alabama have been spoken in heat and anger. Patterson's mentor Ralph McGill once criticized his own early editorials on issues of racial justice as ""pale tea,"" and Patterson accepted the judgment for himself.  Every day from 1960 to 1968, he wrote a signed editorial column in the paper, many of them devoted to issues of segregation and racial equality. As the years went by, his voice grew stronger. In those more than 3,000 columns Patterson urged Southerners to do the right thing, to embrace Christian charity and common decency, to follow the law, promising that if they changed, ""the sky would not fall."" ""I see what you're doing,"" one reader accused. ""You're trying to make us think we're better than we are."" On many days, Patterson's column expressed sympathy for the plight of the white Southerner and confidence that the South could change on its own, without the heavy hand of the federal government. But not on September 15, 1963. In a column that runs 553 words, Patterson uses the words 'we,' 'us,' and 'our,' more than twenty times: . Let us not lay the blame on some brutal fool who didn't know any better. We know better. We created the day. We bear the judgment.  May God have mercy on the poor South that has so been led.  May what has happened hasten the day when the good South, which does live and has great being, will rise to this challenge of racial understanding and common humanity, and in the full power of its unasserted courage, assert itself. The Sunday school play at Birmingham is ended.  With a weeping Negro mother, we stand in the bitter smoke and hold a shoe.  If our South is ever to be what we wish it to be, we will plant a flower of nobler resolve for the South now upon these four small graves that we dug. It is almost unimaginable today that a columnist would be asked to read his work on the evening network news, but that's what happened to Patterson when CBS and Cronkite called. (Recordings of that show have not survived.)  The broadcast carried the message of that one small shoe around the nation.  Patterson received more than 2,000 letters in response. Patterson would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize in 1967 for his editorial columns on racial justice.  He briefly served as managing editor of the Washington Post, taught at Duke University, and became editor of the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) and chairman of the Poynter Institute, the school for journalism and democracy where I have worked since 1979. Patterson hired me to teach writing there and became my friend and mentor until his death earlier this year at the age of 89.  The library at Poynter is named after him.  His photo hangs there, not far from a calligraphed rendition of his famous editorial. It is part of an artistic work by the late African American artist John Scott called ""I Remember Birmingham,"" comprising four glass cubes, each one representing one of the dead girls.  Words etched on the glass are intended to be ""heard"" as the lost voices of the victims.  The translucent cubes remind us of the stained-glass shattered in the bombings. (Three former members of the Ku Klux Klan were eventually convicted of murder for the bombings; one survives, in prison.) This may be the 50th anniversary of their deaths, but I think of those four girls every day of my working life. Patterson never took credit for his progressive views on race.  He knew what he was doing was dangerous.  A ball peen hammer in a desk drawer not far from his typewriter was there for any Klansman who might wander in.  ""I never had to use it,"" he told me, ""but I pulled out the drawer a couple of times.""  He repeated again and again that the heroes of that era were black civil rights workers who put their lives on the line every day to dismantle America's version of apartheid, men and women such as Rep. John Lewis. I met Lewis at a tribute for Patterson held in 2002 at Gene's old newspaper in Atlanta.  Patterson, who had been a tank commander in Patton's army, was an emotional man who could almost never bring himself to read his old work aloud, so I read ""A Flower for the Graves"" to a group of assembled admirers. ""I remember reading it back then,"" Rep. Lewis told me. ""I had tears in my eyes."" In 2003 Patterson did a radio interview with WUNC in North Carolina.  Host Frank Stasio asked Gene to read the column on the air, and he did so reluctantly, but only a couple of passages, his voice rising like a preacher when he came to the phrase ""one shoe."" ""God, Gene, you still sound angry,"" said Stacio. Patterson responded, his voice catching, ""About that -- yeah.""","Sept. 15 is the 50th anniversary of the Birmingham bombing that killed four children .

"(CNN)Fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has left two Israeli soldiers and a Spanish peacekeeper dead, officials said Wednesday. Separately, in Gaza, the United Nations said it was ""outraged"" when Palestinian protesters climbed the perimeter of a U.N. compound and damaged it. U.N. officials took Hamas to task for not preventing the incident. Hezbollah fired five anti-tank missiles at Israeli military vehicles in the disputed Shebaa Farms area, killing an officer and a soldier, the Israel Defense Forces said. Sgt. Dor Chaim Nini was 20; Capt. Yochai Kalangel was 25, the IDF said. The attack took place near Shebaa Farms, also known as Har Dov, a disputed strip of land between Lebanon and Syria adjoining the Golan Heights, under Israeli control. Seven Israeli soldiers were injured, two of them moderately, the IDF said. Hezbollah, which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime supports, claimed responsibility for the attack. The Spanish service member, Cpl. Francisco Javier Soria Toledo, was serving with UNIFIL, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. He was killed ""during the incidents that happened between Hezbollah and the Israeli military,"" the Spanish government said. Spanish President Mariano Rajoy Brey expressed his condolences on Twitter. It was unknown whether the peacekeeper, 36, was killed by Israeli or Hezbollah fire. The IDF told CNN it is investigating . UNIFIL said its personnel ""observed six rockets launched toward Israel"" on Wednesday morning, and that the IDF ""returned artillery fire in the same general area."" ""During the course of the developments, a UNIFIL peacekeeper deployed at a U.N. position near Ghajar sustained serious injuries that resulted in his death. The precise cause of death is as yet undetermined and remains the subject of investigation,"" UNIFIL said in a statement. ""UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Major-General Luciano Portolano was in immediate contact with the parties to help control the situation and prevent further escalation. In the meantime, at around 1:30 p.m., five rockets were fired from the general area of Kafer Shouba toward Israel. The IDF fired artillery rounds towards the source of fire. ""UNIFIL has been informed by the IDF that they incurred casualties as a result of fire from the Lebanese side."" An Israeli military position on Mount Hermon also came under mortar fire Wednesday, the IDF said. Israel planned to evacuate civilians Wednesday from the town, which includes a popular ski resort. A day earlier, a rocket attack struck the Golan Heights, and Israel responded with artillery fire. Overnight, the military launched airstrikes against Syrian targets in response to Hezbollah rocket fire from Syrian bases, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN. ""We did this to send a message to the Syrian regime that we view it responsible for what occurs on its territory and that there is a price to pay for allowing Hezbollah to use your positions,"" Lerner said. ""If the Syrians think they are going to open up a new front on the Golan after 40 years, we are not willing to accept that."" The Golan Heights were part of Syria until the Six Day War in 1967. The area has since been under Israeli control. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Wednesday that his country is prepared to respond to attacks in the region. At a ceremony in the southern Israel city of Sderot, Netanyahu said, ""At this moment, the IDF is responding to events in the north. To everyone who is trying to challenge us at the northern border, I recommend that they look (at) what happened not far away from the city of Sderot, in Gaza: Hamas took its hardest hit since its formation. And the IDF is prepared to act strongly on all fronts."" Netanyahu convened a security meeting and vowed, ""Those who are responsible for this attack will pay the price."" He linked the violence to Iran, which supports Hezbollah and the Syrian regime. ""Iran has been attempting for some time, through Hezbollah, to create an additional terror front against us from the Golan Heights.  We are working aggressively and responsibly against this attempt,"" he said. ""The Lebanese government and the Assad regime are both responsible for the implications of the attacks that are originating from their territory against Israel. "" Netanyahu's office brought up Iran's nuclear activities. ""We must not provide terrorism with a nuclear umbrella. We must not let the most dangerous regime in the world have the most dangerous weapon in the world,"" the office said. Iran insists it seeks only peaceful nuclear energy. U.N. peacekeepers pulled out of the Golan Heights in September after Islamic militants took some peacekeepers hostage and Syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing between Israel and Syria in the Syrian town of Quneitra. There has been intermittent weapons fire from Syria into the Golan Heights -- both targeted and errant, the Israeli military contends -- as the Syrian civil war has raged. More than a week ago, Iranian semiofficial media reported that an Israeli airstrike killed six Hezbollah members and a senior Iranian commander around Quneitra. The Israeli military refused to comment about the January 18 strike. Hamas said Wednesday it ""reaffirms Hezbollah's right to respond to the Israeli aggression, especially following the attack in Quneitra."" Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks. It is blamed for a 1983 bombing that killed 241 U.S. service personnel at a Marine compound in Beirut, Lebanon, the deadliest attack against U.S. Marines since the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. Hamas, meanwhile, came under criticism Wednesday from the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Robert Serry, who said he was ""outraged by the assault"" on a U.N. compound in Gaza. ""During a pre-announced demonstration, of which Hamas was well aware, a number of protesters climbed the perimeter wall and entered the compound causing damage to United Nations premises and property,"" he said. ""Due to precautionary measures taken, United Nations personnel working in the compound were fortunately unharmed."" Hamas controls Gaza. ""Pending a full transfer of security responsibilities to the legitimate Palestinian Authority, we continue to hold Hamas fully responsible for the security and safety of all United Nations personnel and operations in Gaza,"" Serry said. ""As this serious incident took place in the context of increasing incitement against the United Nations in Gaza, the Special Coordinator is conducting an urgent review of operations in Gaza,"" his statement added. CNN's Elise Labott and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Two Israeli soldiers killed, seven wounded in Hezbollah missile attack .

"Burrowing by hand and machines, Chinese soldiers and emergency crews toiled on steep, frigid slopes looking for the few missing after a devastating landslide killed dozens of villagers. By early Saturday, word came that the tragedy had struck the mountain community in Gaopo. The landslide killed 46 people in the southwest China village, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. A powerful avalanche of mud and dirt had taken away 10% of village. Twenty-seven adults, and 19 children. Video from state-run CCTV showed what was once Gaopo, the small community in China's Yunnan Province. Some houses were crushed; others had ceased to exist entirely, except for stray bricks that made their way downhill. Earlier, rescuers drenched in mud swarmed the scene, digging fervently with shovels, looking for signs of life. Instead, they found shredded clothes, wallets and other evidence of those killed in the disaster. ""We pulled out several people, one of whom was breathing weakly,"" said Li Yongju, 50, a resident  of the neighboring community of Zengjiazhai. ""But after a while, he died."" Zhou Benju was born in the landslide hit area, then married a man from Zengjiazhai and moved there. A loud noise woke her, and later she learned the toll the event had taken on her family. ""In this disaster, ... my grandma, brother, uncle and my aunt's family members died,"" Zhou said, according to Xinhua. The landslide struck  Friday morning, triggered by rain and snow that had saturated the largely rocky area for 10 days,  Li Lianju, deputy director of the Yunnan Land and Resources Department, told state media. The Zhaojiagou area of Gaopo village had not experienced landslides before, according to Li. But Friday morning, 46 people in the community of 468 people were buried, according to the local civil affairs bureau. Two others suffered nonlife-threatening injuries, Xinhua reported. The disaster prompted a massive search and rescue effort that included more than 20 excavators and front-end loaders. And there were more than 1,000 soldiers, police, firefighters and mine rescuers participating in the effort, local officials said.","A landslide hits Friday morning in southwest China .

"A Michigan man accused of gunning down an unarmed young woman on his front porch in November was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder, manslaughter and possessing a firearm while committing a felony. Theodore Wafer, 55, faces a possible life prison term when sentenced on August 21. The jury deliberated for a little less than nine hours. Wafer said he feared for his life when loud banging startled him awake in the early morning hours of November 2, 2013. He opened his front door and fired a fatal shotgun blast into the face of Renisha McBride, 19, who prosecutors say was seeking help after a car accident. On Thursday, a judge ordered Wafer remanded to jail though the defense asked for house arrest. After the verdict, McBride's parents issued a statement thanking jurors. They said they were not surprised by the verdict. ""She was a regular teenager,"" said her mother, Monica McBride. ""She was well raised and brought up with a loving family, and her life mattered. And we showed that."" Wafer took the stand Monday to describe feeling the floor vibrate under his feet from the violent pounding on his front and kitchen doors. He said he couldn't find his cell phone to call 911, but retrieved his Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun from a closet and opened the front door at a quiet moment. ""I was not going to cower. I didn't want to be a victim in my own house,"" he said. ""I drew first, that's how I see it."" McBride had a blood-alcohol level more than two times the legal limit at the time of her death and had smoked marijuana earlier in the evening, according to testimony. Witnesses said she crashed her vehicle into a parked car in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, just before 1 a.m. and wandered off disoriented and bloodied. Some three hours later, she lay dead on Wafer's porch. The incident sparked protest and was likened by some to the shooting of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin in 2012. McBride, 5-feet-4-inches tall, was African-American. Wafer, who is white and stands at over 6 feet, was criminally charged more than two weeks after the incident. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said then that race was not a factor in her office's decision-making on the case. In her closing argument earlier this week, defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter was the first to bring the issue of race before the jury. ""It is not a race issue. And I'm going to say that word, because nobody has mentioned it. It isn't. Ted didn't know who this was,"" she said. ""This man is the furthest thing from a racist,"" said Carpenter. While Wafer said at trial that he acted in self-defense when he shot McBride, he also said the shooting was accidental. Jurors saw a videotaped police interview with Wafer done only hours after the incident, where he told investigators he had forgotten the Mossberg 12-gauge was even loaded and meant only to scare off would-be intruders. Facing off with prosecutor Athina Siringas during a two-hour cross examination, Wafer said he must have disengaged the safety inadvertently and that his finger hit the trigger as a ""total reflex reaction"" when a figure suddenly appeared from the side as he stood in the doorway. ""You either shot on purpose because you were in fear, or the gun went off accidentally. Which one is it?"" asked Siringas. ""I shot in fear,"" Wafer replied. ""So that means you shot on purpose?"" ""Yes."" Siringas' co-counsel, Patrick Muscat, suggested in his closing argument that Wafer invented the self-defense scenario to hedge his bets, because he'd realized an accidental killing could still get him convicted of murder in the second degree. A claim of self defense allows jurors to find a defendant not guilty if they find he acted in the ""honest and reasonable"" belief he was in danger of being killed or seriously injured, according to Michigan law. After the incident, Wafer told police he was angry and ""full of piss and vinegar"" when he opened the door that night, Muscat told the jury. Man who shot unarmed Michigan teen takes the stand .

"(CNN) -- Authorities are investigating what happened to a North Carolina teenager whose body was found along a flight path in Massachusetts with ""trauma that was consistent with a fall from a significant height,"" a Massachusetts district attorney said. ""It appears, more likely than not, that (Delvonte) Tisdale was able to breach airport security and hide in the wheel well of a commercial jetliner without being detected by airport security personnel,"" William R. Keating, district attorney for Norfolk County, Massachusetts, told reporters Friday. The mystery started November 15, when 16-year-old Delvonte was last seen by a sibling at their home in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to Keating. Later that day, his family discovered Delvonte wasn't home and reported him missing. ""About 7 p.m., a Boeing 737-400 aircraft was boarded and took off from North Carolina's Charlotte Douglas International Airport, en route to Boston's Logan Airport,"" Keating told reporters. ""At approximately 9:30 p.m. that same evening, a group of area college students came upon a severely injured body"" in the town of Milton, Keating said. ""This was directly below a flight path."" The body was later determined to be Delvonte's. The autopsy on Delvonte's body ""did not reveal any knife or gun wounds, but did show trauma that was consistent with a fall from a significant height,"" Keating said. He said a toxicology test turned out negative. Investigators examined two planes that had originated in Charlotte and followed a similar flight path, Keating said. They found ""what appeared to be physical evidence of someone having been in a left wheel well of one of the planes was located and documented -- including hand prints visible in greasy areas and scuff marks in the area that would accommodate a person."" On Friday, Milton police and other authorities conducted a search of the wooded area along the flight path, Keating said. ""They recovered two dark Nike Air Force sneakers with white stripes, consistent with those that the Tisdale family describe as belonging to Delvonte,"" Keating said. During the investigation, Keating said, one local resident described hearing a loud, crashing noise shortly before 9 p.m. the night Delvonte's body was found. State police have ruled out motor vehicle homicide as a possible cause for Delvonte's injuries. ""The theory that the death may have involved a fall from a passing airplane -- as has happened in other parts of the country and other parts of the world -- began to be explored,"" Keating said. Fingerprints lifted from Delvonte's body were run through a national database, but no matches were found. ""But investigators released a handwritten note found in the pocket of the jeans he was wearing, and a member of the family recognized the name and made contact with Milton police,"" Keating said. Last week, Massachusetts state and local police traveled to North Carolina to take samples of grease used in maintaining aircraft to see if the grease found on Delvonte's pants could be matched to that grease, Keating said. Forensics tests are still pending.","NEW: DA: The teen apparently breached airport security and hid in a plane's wheel well .

"(CNN)Thailand's military-appointed National Legislative Assembly (NLA) has voted 190-18 in favor of impeaching former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra for her role in a controversial rice subsidy program that cost the country billions. Though the vote was largely symbolic, as she had already lost her post, it also carries a five-year ban from politics. The news came hours after the attorney General's office announced that Yingluck, who was removed from office in May last year days before the military swept to power in a coup, will face criminal charges over the affair. If found guilty, she could face up to 10 years in prison. The rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop. But critics said it wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it couldn't sell without losing money. She was eventually put under investigation by Thailand's National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC). In an address to the NLA Thursday, Yingluck denied any wrongdoing and questioned whether the impeachment vote was valid. ""The NACC's legitimacy in sending the impeachment case for the NLA's consideration is questionable since the Constitution of 2007 has been revoked ... with the coup d'etat on May 22, 2014,"" she said. ""I am no longer prime minister since the constitutional court has already removed me, thus there is essentially no 'position' to impeach me from. ""The legal grounds claimed by the NACC were also invalid, as the target of impeaching me is to ban me from holding any political positions for five years, which is a clear violation of my fundamental rights and liberties."" But the Bangkok Post reported Friday that many NLA members were unconvinced and found she was unable to clear up the accusations against her. They also backed the NACC evidence against her. In a statement translated into English by her office, Yingluck said she would ""continue to fight to prove my innocence to the very end, no matter what the outcome will be."" She said the rice subsidy scheme was ""beneficial for the farmers and the country"" and that claims it lost money were wrong and motivated by political bias against her. ""I am not sad because I am the victim of this entire ordeal, but I am sad for the rice farmers and all of the disadvantaged Thai citizens whose lives will return to the vicious cycle of being poor, debt ridden, and being taken advantage of, and most important of all, being denied of their basic democratic rights under the rule of law,"" she said. Two weeks before the military coup last May, a Thai court ordered Yingluck's removal, finding her guilty of violating the country's constitution in her reassignment of a senior security official in 2011. That official was replaced by the then-national police chief, whose role in turn was given to Priewpan Damapong. Damapong is the brother of the ex-wife of Thaksin Shinawatra, Yingluck's brother, who was overthrown as Prime Minister in a military coup in 2006. Thaksin is living in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction.","Yingluck Shinawatra says she will ""fight to prove my innocence to the very end""

"(CNN)The $4 trillion budget President Barack Obama sent Congress on Monday is his blueprint for reviving ""middle class opportunity."" Liberals are thrilled by the redistributive thrust of the president's budget -- it would hit affluent Americans with a battery of new tax hikes, totaling $2 trillion over the next decade, and use the proceeds to finance substantial tax cuts for low and middle income families. However, this has, of course, scandalized tax-averse congressional Republicans, who echo House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan in denouncing the Obama budget as an exercise in ""envy economics."" Given the partisan stalemate in Washington, many pundits therefore view the White House budget as a purely political statement intended to frame the 2016 presidential debate. Next, the GOP Congress will produce a conservative alternative, and each side will spend the next two years accusing the other of waging class warfare. Except that the federal government actually does need a budget, especially one that reinforces the economy's gathering momentum. The one thing both parties seem to agree on is that reversing middle class stagnation is the nation's top priority. What America needs more than anything else is a long stretch of robust economic growth, something we have not seen since the 1990s, when both the growth and unemployment rates averaged about 4 percent a year. It's true that stronger growth alone ultimately may not suffice to restore mass upward mobility. In the absence of real wealth creation, however, a politics of redistribution can only sustain a fleeting illusion of shared prosperity. Although it doesn't go far enough in this direction, the Obama budget does contain some important growth-enhancing features. For example, it proposes to spend $478 billion to repair and modernize America's aging roads, airports and other infrastructure over the next six years. This initiative would be funded by a one-time, 14% tax on offshore profits, which the White House considers more likely to attract GOP support than raising the gas tax. The Obama budget also calls for a 6% increase in federal R&D funding, especially for biomedical research. Public investment that replenishes America's depleted stock of physical and knowledge capital is crucial to putting the U.S. economy back on a high-growth path. In addition, the president wants funding for seven more manufacturing institutes that enlist companies, governments and universities to put America in the vanguard of advanced manufacturing, including 3-D printing. There's also more money for career training and on-the-job apprenticeships, as well as an intriguing Upward Mobility Project aimed at spurring enterprise in impoverished communities. Also good for the economy is Obama's call to ease the sequester's suffocating grip on discretionary spending. His budget would raise next year's spending cap by $74 billion, to be divided equally between defense and domestic spending. This would reduce the fiscal drag produced by deep cutbacks in current spending -- an untimely dose of austerity that the Congressional Budget Office says shaved more than a point off the economy's growth rate. It would also pit penny pinching Republicans against U.S. military leaders and GOP hawks, led by Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, who warns that the caps are weakening the nation's defense. The controversial centerpiece of the president's budget is a grab bag of big tax changes that take from the rich to give to, well, everyone else. These include a minimum tax on millionaires; a higher capital gains tax (including on inherited wealth); and limits on the value of itemized deductions claimed by the wealthy. There's also a new tax on the nation's 100 largest banks. Surging revenues would pay for an array of costly tax breaks for families with modest incomes, including a tax credit for second earners, an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without children and a tripling of the child tax credit. But while there's no doubt the overall effect would be to make federal taxes more progressive, it would also make the code even more insanely complicated. Unfortunately, Obama's budget stops short of a comprehensive tax reform that would close loopholes for both individuals and corporations and use the added revenues to reduce rates for all taxpayers. Most economists believe that junking, or at least limiting, a host of special preferences and tax breaks would reduce economic distortions, promote more efficient use of capital, and generally make federal taxes fairer and simpler. Nonetheless, the president's proposals for reforming business taxes could be more appealing to Republicans. The budget proposes to cut the top corporate rate from 35% to 28%, which would help U.S. businesses compete globally. President Obama also calls for a new 19% minimum tax on global profits, which would reduce the risk that U.S. companies would have to pay tax twice on those profits. Finally, the Obama budget does disappointingly little to reorient U.S. fiscal policy around investment and growth. As Gene Steuerle, a veteran fiscal analyst writes in his invaluable book, ""Dead Men Ruling,"" decisions made by dead or retired politicians have radically constrained contemporary lawmakers' freedom of action. For most of U.S. history, politicians could spend or cut taxes confident in the knowledge that economic growth would make budget deficits temporary and create fiscal space for new initiatives. But now, says Steuerle, the cost of maintaining the government's cumulative commitments exceeds expected revenues. Congress, in short, is wearing fiscal handcuffs. Lawmakers can't launch fresh initiatives to tackle contemporary problems without either piling on new debt or reneging on old commitments (to spend more, or tax less). What's more, as the nation ages, more of our resources are channeled into automatic, formula-driven spending on current consumption -- mainly through Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- leaving fewer dollars to invest in children and families or future economic growth. No one expects President Obama to solve this problem unilaterally, especially with a Republican Party so addled by anti-government populism that it can't distinguish between consumption spending and genuine economic and social investment. But neither can America afford a federal budget so paralyzed by old promises and interest group gridlock that it is essentially a blueprint for national decline. That's why progressives need a strategy for reclaiming their fiscal freedom -- and the ability to invest in America's future.","President Obama this week announced new budget proposal .

"MAVEN has arrived in Mars's orbit after traveling 442 million miles in the course of 10 months to get there. It won't land on the red planet but instead study Mars' atmosphere from above to answer questions about its climate change, NASA says. NASA's MAVEN craft will live up to its formal name -- the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution craft -- by helping scientists figure out how ancient Mars changed so dramatically into the planet we know today. It is the first mission devoted to studying the upper Martian atmosphere as a key to understanding the history of Mars' climate, water and habitability. Mars rover reaches key destination; 'new science ahead!' ""The evidence shows that the Mars atmosphere today is a cold, dry environment, one where liquid water really can't exist in a stable state,"" said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator, during a mission preview briefing last week at NASA headquarters in Washington.  ""But it also tells us when we look at older surfaces, that the ancient surfaces had liquid water flowing over it."" So where did the planet's water and carbon dioxide go? Jakosky said MAVEN will help unravel that mystery by using its scientific instruments to measure the composition and escape of gases in the Martian atmosphere. MAVEN is to study the top of the atmosphere to determine the extent to which losing gas to space might have been the driving mechanism behind climate change, Jakosky said. MAVEN has company out near Mars, man-made and otherwise. India's first mission to the Red Planet, the Mars Orbiter Mission, is set to arrive a few days after MAVEN does. The director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, Jim Green, says the United States and India are  interested in cooperating as their crafts gather data about the planet. There's a visitor of the cosmic kind, too. Comet Sliding Spring, which was discovered last year, will be closest to Mars about four weeks after MAVEN arrives. The comet is going to miss Mars by about 81,000 miles, said Jakosky. ""I'm told that the odds of having an approach that close to Mars are about one-in-a-million years,"" he said, adding that dust from the comet carries only a ""relatively minimal"" risk to the spacecraft. MAVEN will take advantage of the rare flyby by observing the comet itself, as well as its effect on the Martian atmosphere.

"Three suspects were charged Tuesday for their alleged roles in a vicious mob beating of a Detroit tree trimmer after a car accident last week. Bruce Edward Wimbush Jr., 17, Wonzey Saffold, 30, and James Deontae Davis, 24, are three of the dozen or so people who attacked Steven Utash after he inadvertently struck a 10-year-old boy who had stepped into a road, Detroit Police Sgt. Michael Woody said. Utash, a 54-year-old grandfather, immediately stopped his vehicle to help the boy and was allegedly ""severely beaten"" with ""fists and feet,"" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a news release. He's been in a medically induced coma since. Detroit Police Chief James Craig wouldn't go so far as to the attack a ""hate crime,"" but, he said, ""the issue of race is being looked at"" as a possible motive. He gave credit to a woman who stepped in as Utash was being attacked, CNN affiliate WDIV reported. ""Just her presence, offering aid to this gentleman, may have saved his life,"" Craig said. That woman, Deborah Hughes, met Utash's son to talk about what happened. ""I went to your dad and he was unconscious. He wasn't doing anything,"" she said, WDIV reported. ""I go over there and I say, 'Don't nobody else hit him. Don't put your hands on him. Leave him alone!' And everybody backed up and let me go to work on your dad,"" said Hughes, a retired nurse. She told WDIV that Utash gained consciousness at one point and asked, ""Is the boy dead?"" His son, Joe Utash, thanked Hughes for everything she did. ""I know that you saved him and that means so much to us,"" he said, WDIV reported. The prosecutor's office said the boy who was struck by Utash's truck was taken to a local hospital and treated for a leg injury. Woody said that he was unsure of the extent of the boy's injuries but that he is at home recovering from the accident. All three have been charged as adults with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm.  A fourth suspect, a 16-year-old boy, was also arrested, but prosecutors are still deciding if he will be charged as an adult. None of the charged suspects are believed to be related or linked to the boy or his family, said Jennifer Moreno, a police public information officer. She says the beating was ""a spontaneous response."" But some are asking whether the beating last Wednesday reflects a state of racial tension in the Motor City: Utash is white. The child he hit with his truck is African-American, as are all of this alleged assailants, Moreno said. Local defense attorney Cliff Woodards II says the lack of outrage in the African-American community reveals hypocrisy among its leaders. ""Imagine, though, if this happened to a black tree trimmer who was passing through Roseville?"" wrote Woodards, who is African-American, in a Facebook post he titled ""Shame On Us."" Roseville is the suburb Utash hails from. ""Al Sharpton would have been on a plane before the man got out of surgery. Local community leaders and pastors would have taken to the airwaves and the pulpits in search of justice for this fallen hero."" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and City Council President Brenda Jones issued a statement Friday in response to outrage over the incident, asking for calm and patience from all Detroiters, but made no mention of race. ""This senseless vigilante style attack is not the essence of who we are as Detroiters and will not be tolerated,"" the statement said. Utash's daughter, Felicia Utash, told CNN affiliate WXYZ that she doesn't want to believe the assault on her father was a hate crime, but she is pleased that suspects have been apprehended. She, along with her brother and sister, have set up a GoFundMe.com page for their father, who they say does not have health insurance. Donations have exceeded $135,000 in four days. Police are still searching for the remaining suspects. ""By no means are we through with this investigation,"" Woody said.","Detroit police chief credits woman for stepping in, possibly saving driver's life .

"(CNN)Eleven people died Monday after a Greek air force F-16 jet crashed at a base in Los Llanos in southeastern Spain, authorities said. Nine were French military personnel, and two were Greek pilots, a senior Spanish defense official told CNN. The jet crashed on takeoff, hitting other planes on the ground during a NATO training exercise, said the source, who by custom was not named. Twenty people were injured, according to a statement from the Spanish Defense Ministry. All those hurt are either French or Italian. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the crash. ""This is a tragedy which affects the whole NATO family. I express my heartfelt condolences to the loved ones and the nations of those who lost their lives, and I wish a speedy recovery to the injured,"" he said in a statement. ""The plane was taking part in an exercise in the framework of NATO's Tactical Leadership Programme, which aims to improve multinational cooperation in air operations,"" Stoltenberg said. The NATO flight training course at the Spanish base has 750 participants, including pilots, ground crews and other support, from nine countries: the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Denmark and Greece, the Spanish air force reported on its website last week. It was expected to be a four-week program, from January 19 to February 13, with training to prepare pilots for tactical missions, including nighttime missions, the site said.","11 people died and 20 others were injured, according to the Spanish Defense Ministry .

"It's the gravest diplomatic crisis the Gulf Cooperation Council has ever faced -- but as leaders from the six-member Arab alliance prepare to meet in Jeddah, are things about to get even worse? The root of the current problem? Qatar simply will not do as it's told by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who have spent months trying to force the energy-rich nation to fundamentally alter its foreign policy. Bahrain, the UAE and the Saudis withdrew their ambassadors from Qatar in March, and have kept up the pressure ever since. Of course, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar are nothing new. Qatar has striven since the late 1980s to escape the Saudi political orbit by vigorously pursuing its own independent foreign policy -- regardless of the displeasure it caused in Riyadh. The Saudis, for their part, have never liked this rejection of its leadership from an uppity small country like Qatar that it sees as barely more than an appendage of its own state. But for all the pressure Saudi Arabia exerted on Qatar -- including withdrawing its ambassador from Doha from 2002-2008 -- it could not put the Qatari genie back in the bottle. A modus vivendi was reached in 2008, but the current crisis seems to mark another attempt to put Qatar in its place. Among a variety of modern-day issues, the central concern animating this round of difficulties is Qatar's support for various groups associated with the Muslim Brotherhood -- the long-suppressed pan-regional Islamist movement that swept to power in the Egyptian elections of 2012 before being deposed by the military a year later. The Saudis are deeply troubled by the practical and rhetorical threats the group poses in the region. And although a Brotherhood-inspired revolution seems deeply unlikely in the UAE, this is what its authorities fear and the reason they have sentenced to jail dozens of people in the last 18 months. In March 2014 both states banned the group and labelled it a terrorist organization. Qatar has made some concessions. In mid-August, reports emerged that Qatar has considered ending the naturalization of nationals from other GCC countries -- Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait -- in answer to their criticism of the practice. And it beggars belief to think that Qatar has not made other concessions in private, given the seriousness of the break in regional relations between the countries. Yet still Saudi Arabia and the UAE continue to try to force Qatar to accept and conform to their particular world-view. Up to this point, this current disagreement has had a negligible impact on the GCC -- and the fact that the Council cannot provide a united front on the Gaza or ISIS crises is nothing new for the argumentative and perennially-divided group. Demoting Qatar somehow from the GCC, one of the potential punishments for the recalcitrant state, would merely codify the ineffectiveness of the GCC, not create it. Furthermore, punishing Doha would adversely affect on-going efforts to promote ""jointness"" among the GCC militaries in areas like ballistic missile defence. And if Qataris were to need new visas to enter other GCC countries, this would foster a logistical nightmare and increase the already bitter intra-GCC tensions felt by people. If things got worse at the GCC, Qatar would double-down on its relations with the likes of Turkey, Iran, and the remaining Muslim Brotherhood affiliates in the region, and it would reinforce its relations to its closest international allies: the US, the UK, France, Japan, and South Korea. So what could the Saudis do to try to bring Doha into line? Any closure of the Qatari-Saudi border would be deeply harmful for Qatar given the importance of the route for trade. Around 80% of dairy imports, 30% of stone and cement imports, and 92% of aluminium imports come across the land border, according to the Ministry of Development Planning & Statistics in Qatar. If the Qatari Government were to react to this (even though they have taken the moral high ground by doing nothing so far), they could curtail its gas supply to the UAE (and Oman), which is crucial given the surging demand for natural gas in the Emirates. While closing the border would generally be seen as an overreaction by Saudi Arabia, so too was removing its ambassador from Qatar, not to mention its rejection of the U.N. Security Council seat it won in October 2013 after years of lobbying and training for the role. Some kind of escalation looks likely, barring a last minute reprieve. Saudi Arabia and the UAE appear to want a public sign of contrition from Qatar -- something that the new Emir of Qatar cannot give. Not only can the Emir not overturn decades of Qatari policy that has sporadically supported groups like the Brotherhood, but barely a year into his leadership, he cannot capitulate to such naked regional pressure. Vociferous and patriotic public pressure in Qatar alone precludes that. And as the on-going Iranian-American nuclear talks have lowered tensions in the region, so too have the talks diminished the only real factor -- the threat of a nuclear Iran -- forcing any kind of cohesion from the GCC. The GCC does face a serious political crisis, but though this may concern the countries involved, the tiff will likely pass mostly unnoticed by the rest of the region -- and the oil, the gas, the investment, the imports, and the money going to a wide variety of groups around the Middle East will continue to flow from all states.","The leaders from the six-member Arab alliance prepare to meet in Jeddah .

"The outlook for dozens of short-finned pilot whales stranded in shallow water off Florida's Everglades National Park ""does not look good,"" wildlife officials said Wednesday. ""We want to set the expectations low"" that the 41 remaining stranded whales can be saved, said Blair Mase, a marine mammal scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The assessment came as the number of dead whales climbed to 10, including four euthanized by wildlife officials after being found in ""poor condition,"" Mase said. Wildlife officials are unsure how long the pod of whales has been stranded. Fishermen spotted the whales, several of which had beached themselves, on Tuesday night in a remote area accessible only by boat off the west coast of the Everglades, park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. An attempt earlier in the day to herd the whales out of the park's remote Highland Beach failed. Rescuers have been using five boats to create a blockade of sorts between the whales and the beach as part of the effort to keep them from beaching and simultaneously encouraging them to make their way back to the Gulf of Mexico, Friar said. Wildlife officials believe that it took the pilot whales several days to travel the 20 miles from the deep waters where they typically make their home to the shallow beach area where they were found. That area is blanketed with sandbars and sand flats. ""It's a very difficult situation"" given the remote location and the terrain, Mase said. Although there is a slight possibility the whales could swim out during high tide, Mase said, ""I wouldn't set out hope for that."" ""Even in high tide, you're going to have a series of sandbars and sand flats,"" she said. Necropsies were being performed to try to determine why the pod carried out a mass stranding. ""At this point in time, we don't know why this particular group is stranding,"" Mase said. In all, 25 people were involved in rescue efforts, including officials from NOAA, the Marine Mammal Conservatory and the Marine Animal Rescue Society, Mase said. Mass strandings by pilot whales are not altogether uncommon in Florida. In 2012, nearly two dozen pilot whales stranded and beached themselves. In 2011, 23 pilot whales stranded and beached themselves. Such strandings are common and occur in a variety of locations, said Phillip Clapham, director of the whale research program at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle. It's difficult to explain why any particular mass stranding occurs, but they tend to occur in areas where previous strandings have occurred, during low tide -- particularly those around the new and full moons, in areas dotted with sand bars and during storms. The animals' cohesion can doom an entire group. ""These are very, very social animals,"" Clapham said. ""They remain together as family units. If the lead animal gets in trouble, probably everyone else is going to follow them and be in trouble."" Would-be rescuers have their hands full, he said, noting that the animals can weigh a ton apiece. ""It's a largely, but not entirely, hopeless undertaking,"" he said. Clapham noted that on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, where such strandings are routine events, rescuers have used cranes and a flatbed truck. But heavy equipment is not readily available in the remote area off the Everglades where the most recent stranding occurred. No good estimates exist for how many pilot whales exist, but they are not endangered, he said. ""These events, while they're tragic, don't have any implications for the survival of the species.""

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot, who authorities say has confessed to the murder of a Peruvian woman, faces criminal charges in Alabama because he tried to extort $250,000 from Natalee Holloway's mother, according to an Interpol document. U.S. authorities last week announced an arrest warrant for van der Sloot on charges of extortion and wire fraud, but they did not name the victim. In an Interpol document obtained by CNN Wednesday, American authorities ask Peruvian police to arrest van der Sloot and begin a process of extradition to the United States. The document states that Peruvian authorities can hold him if he is facing charges there. According to the document, around March 29, van der Sloot contacted a representative of Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. The Dutch citizen, who was twice arrested in connection with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway but released for lack of evidence, said he would reveal the location of the body and the circumstances surrounding her death for $25,000 in cash. He asked for $250,000 in total, the document states. Van der Sloot and Beth Holloway's representative met in Aruba, where a payment of $10,000 was made to him, followed by a transfer of $15,000 to a personal bank account in the Netherlands, the document states. In exchange, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where supposedly Holloway's remains were, according to the document.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Gunshots inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by Chris Brown wounded three people early Sunday, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was among the wounded, a sheriff's deputy confirmed. All three victims, two men and a woman, are expected to recover from their gunshot wounds, Deputy Jeff Gordon told CNN. The shooting happened inside the 1 Oak club on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood at 1:30 a.m., Gordon said. Brown posted a tweet after the incident: ""It's disappointing that we as a society can't have fun or enjoy ourselves without any altercations sometimes. Miss me with the bulls**t!!!"" Brown, who is still on probation for beating singer and then-girlfriend Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammys, was hosting the party as a celebration of the MTV Video Music Awards, which will be held in Los Angeles on Sunday. A grainy cell phone video posted on Instagram shows Brown standing on the back of a couch and yelling in the aftermath of the shooting. Brown's bodyguard can be seen trying to get him down. The singer has colored his hair blond and is wearing a white shirt and jeans in the video. Sheriff's investigators are handling the shooting investigation, and no arrests have been made, Gordon said. One person inside the club tweeted, ""So 1oak just got shut up. Everyone ducked and ran. Walked out of the club with 20 cops pointing rifles at us. Chris Brown was pissed."" Knight, 49, rose to fame and fortune after founding Death Row Records in 1991 and signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car which which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. This was not Knight's first time being shot at a pre-VMA party. He was shot in his leg at a party hosted by rapper Kanye West at a Miami hotel on the eve of the 2005 VMA show.

"In November of last year, 19-year-old Aqsa Mahmood gave her father, Muzaffar, a long hug goodbye. He remembers, he says, because she looked especially beautiful. He remarked upon it to his wife, saying there was something different about his daughter. The night before, she had asked her sisters to sleep together in one big bed. Aqsa gave a lingering farewell to her bedridden grandmother, and that's when Khalida, her mother, knew something was wrong. Standing in her daughter's empty bedroom, Khalida told CNN, ""There was something about the way she said 'Khuda Hafiz' (God's Blessings) while taking leave that day, which made us all wonder. My husband even asked if everything was OK, and I said she is fine."" Four days later, Aqsa called her parents back in Scotland, just as she was crossing into Syria from its border with Turkey. Her parents were left heartbroken and confused. Her father says when he spoke to her about coming home, she said that she would see her family on Judgment Day and would like to be a martyr. She has been prolific on social media, advocating ISIS and Islamic caliphate beliefs, and calling for attacks to be carried out in Western countries. She posts photos of AK-47s and exults in ISIS executions. Her recent posting online has called to follow the example set by ""brothers from Woolwich, Texas, and Boston."" Family lawyer Aamer Anwar talked about the family's heartbreak. ""There was nothing they (Aqsa's parents) could have done different. She was a bedroom radical. And if this could happen to Aqsa, who had all the life chances, the best education that money can buy, a family that was moderate, liberal ... if it could happen to her, somebody who was so intelligent, then it could happen to any family,"" Anwar said. Aqsa is said to be influenced by watching sermons online and coming in contact with people through social media that helped her make the trek from Glasgow to Syria. Living the dream in Scotland . The Mahmood family was, in many ways, living the dream of many immigrants. Muzaffar moved to Glasgow from Pakistan in the 1970s. He was the first Pakistani cricket player for Scotland. He and Khalida bought a home in an affluent neighborhood and had four children. They went to the prestigious private school Craigholme down the road. ""She was the best daughter you could have. We just don't know what happened to her. She loved school. She was very friendly. I have never shouted at her all my life, all my life,"" Muzaffar laments. Her parents insist there were no signs that the Glasgow teenager harbored any extremist beliefs. She listened to Coldplay and read ""Harry Potter"" books. On her desk, colorful loom bands and bracelets hung from a goosenecked lamp, a dog-eared copy of ""The Hunger Games"" nearby. But when the civil war in Syria flared, Aqsa grew increasingly concerned about the violence. She grew more religious, praying and reading the Quran. And when she went to her university, she gave up her music and childhood fiction. But her parents did not suspect anything extreme. ""She didn't go out much. Just with her sisters, she would go out to watch movies and go out eating. We all went together,"" Muzaffar says. Her family was stunned when they learned she was headed for the rebel-held territory of Aleppo in northern Syria. Khalida says her daughter was afraid of the dark and didn't even know what bus to take downtown, much less how to cross the border into Syria. 'I don't know when she became this brave' ""She didn't like shouting. I don't know when she became this brave. She was scared to talk, scared to fly, and this is a very big step -- her flying to Syria. I can't believe this,"" Khalida tearfully says, explaining the shock the family feels about her daughter's decision. ""I know she is my daughter, but I feel that she is my friend. But she made one mistake, but otherwise, she is really a very good girl. Sometimes I am angry."" Her family describes her as a loving daughter who brought her mother tea in bed, helped massage her mum's tired feet and often assisted her handicapped grandmother. Her mother says Aqsa never complained despite being asked to help with housework. Soon after her arrival in Syria, Aqsa told her family that she would marry. Her father said she sent a message saying: ""That's the process here. They don't let a girl stay alone. Now we have to find a mahram (male guardian). We have to get married here. Don't worry. I'll be OK. My heart is good."" But her parents, still worried, attempted to dissuade her. ""We used to tell her ... this is not Islam, some of these groups are not Islam. They are doing wrong things which we don't approve of. Obviously, no Muslim approves this."" ISIS vs. mainstream Muslims: The media battle . Despite Aqsa's active role on social media, her father says he reads little of what she writes online because it hurts him. ""We don't know what happened and how she changed so quickly. God knows why she is doing this."" In one of the exchanges Muzaffar had with his daughter, she told him that she is praying every day to become ""shahid,"" or a martyr. Praying for the return of their daughter . The family hopes and prays that Aqsa will come home. One of her sisters has been suffering from depression since Aqsa left. Her mother says that Aqsa is leading a very hard life, often sleeps on the floor in the cold and has suffered from pneumonia. Her mother says that in her random chats online, she asks Aqsa to be safe and often reminds her to eat. ""As a mother, I want my daughter safe."" In a special message to Aqsa through CNN, her parents made a personal appeal to their daughter. ""We just want her back. We miss her too much. We love her. We just want to see her back and want to hug her. She was such a good daughter,"" her father said. Looking directly into the camera, Khalida said, ""Aqsa, my dear daughter, please come back. At this moment, I am missing you a lot. Your sisters and brother miss you a lot. My dear daughter, in the name of Allah, please come back. I miss you a lot. I love you. I love you, my dear daughter. Please come back."" Both parents are quick to denounce ISIS, which also calls itself the ""Islamic State,"" and the atrocities that are being carried out in the name of religion. ''We are against all this ISIS carrying on. This is no Islam. Islam is peace. Any killing we are against, whoever it is. That's what we have been taught by our prophet -- peace be upon him,"" Muzaffar says. Anwar, the lawyer, says Aqsa is not directly responsible for committing any crimes and is safe to return home. The Mahmood family says they are speaking out in the hope that their other children and the community don't face any backlash, and they publicly condemn their eldest daughter's callous decision. Both parents are worried that time is running out for Aqsa to safely return home. But they say they are still holding hope that one day, she will come back.

"A Florida judge Friday sentenced Michael Dunn to life in prison without parole for the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. The sentence, imposed nearly two years after Dunn shot and killed Davis during an argument over loud music, also carries an additional 90 years for three convictions of attempted murder and firing a weapon into a vehicle. ""This case demonstrates that our justice system does work,"" Duval County Judge Russell Healey said moments before sentencing Dunn. Dunn, 47, who is white, was convicted of first-degree murder this month for shooting into an SUV full of African-American teenagers at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station after an argument over loud music from the teens' vehicle. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in the racially-charged case, which drew comparisons to the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. Zimmerman, who maintained that he acted in self-defense, was acquitted last year by a Florida jury. Dunn claimed he acted in self-defense because he believed Davis was reaching for a gun. No weapon was found. ""Mr. Dunn, your life is effectively over,"" Healey said. ""What is sad... is that this case exemplifies that our society seems to have lost its way."" Dunn, wearing an orange jumpsuit, showed no emotion. Healey said Florida's controversial ""stand your ground"" law was widely misunderstood. ""We should remember there is nothing wrong with retreating and deescalating the situation,"" the judge said. Outside court, Davis' father, Ron Davis, said the judge sent a strong message. ""We may have in this state 'stand your ground' laws but that doesn't allow you as a citizen, when you have a chance to diffuse a situation, for you to be so aggressive,"" he told CNN by phone on Friday. ""It's basically saying to people, stop with the shoot first."" In a brief statement before sentencing, Dunn for the first time apologized to Davis' family. ""I want the Davis family to know I truly regret what happened,"" he said. ""I'm sorry for their loss. If I could roll back time and do things differently, I would."" He feared for his life, he said. ""I did what I thought I had to do,"" Dunn said. ""Still, I am mortified I took a life, whether it was justified or not."" Davis' parents, Davis and Lucia McBath, made emotional statements at the hearing, which was attended by some of the jurors who convicted Dunn. Juror: 'Race was never a factor' In tears, McBath remembered her son. She said she forgave Dunn. ""I miss his big, wide, toothy smile,"" she said. ""For me, there will be no college graduation. There will be no daughter-in-law. For me, there will be no future generation."" She added, ""I too must be willing to forgive. And so I choose to forgive you Mr. Dunn for taking my son's life. I pray that God has mercy on your soul."" Davis said he life was changed forever. ""My life as I had known it was shattered on November 23, 2012,"" he told the court. ""I now call it Black Friday for a completely different reason. After the longest hour of my life, the hospital confirmed that Jordan Russell Davis was deceased in the emergency room. ... The old Ron Davis died that night with Jordan."" Davis called Dunn's apology ""paper thin."" ""You can tell the defense attorney wrote that for him,"" he told CNN. ""It was not heartfelt. There wasn't a tear in his eyes, no tremble in his voice. He had no remorse whatsoever."" Unlike McBath, Davis hasn't forgiven his son's killer. ""For me to forgive you, you have to have remorse,"" he said. ""I leave it to God to forgive him. I pray that God does forgive him."" Juror: 'I believed he was guilty' Dunn's family did not address the court. Dunn has said he shot at the vehicle because he thought Davis had a weapon and feared for his life, but the prosecution said Dunn was the aggressor and pointed out that he kept firing even after the teens fled. Three of the 10 shots that Dunn fired struck Davis, one of them cutting through his liver, a lung and his aorta. Investigators say Davis never had a weapon, nor was one found in the teens' SUV or in the area. A jury found Dunn guilty of four charges in February, commanding at least 60 years in prison, but the jury was hung on the murder charge related to Davis' November 2012 death. Dunn was convicted in February on one count of shooting into a vehicle and three counts of attempted second-degree murder -- one each for Davis' friends, Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes and Tevin Thompson, who were in the Dodge Durango with Davis. After shooting Davis, prosecutors said, Dunn did not call police. He returned to his hotel, ordered pizza, walked his dog and went to sleep.","Michael Dunn is sentenced to life in prison without parole .

"Lawyers for Texas Governor Rick Perry filed a motion Monday to toss out last month's grand jury indictment against the potential 2016 presidential contender, arguing that the indictment violated the state's basic separation of powers. They also contended the indictment painted a false picture of the governor as an absolute monarch with personal control of the state's public coffers. ""Continued prosecution of Governor Perry on the current indictment is unprecedented, insupportable and simply impermissible,"" Perry's lawyers wrote in a 43-page motion filed in Travis County District Court. ""This attempt to criminalize the political process should not be tolerated by this Court or any Texas court. Otherwise, overzealous prosecutors will be given free reign to use the grand jury process to chill political decisions by Texas' Governors."" Rick Perry takes back tweet . Perry's legal team warned that the ""Texas Constitution does not authorize any such action and the instant indictment is in direct conflict with the Governor's constitutional duties. The Court should dismiss both counts of the indictment and bar the prosecution."" In August, a Travis County grand jury indicted Perry on two felony counts stemming from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis Country District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, unless she stepped down. The case centers on Perry's June 2013 veto of the $7.5 million budget for the unit run by Lehmberg, after she refused his demand to resign following her drunken driving arrest and conviction. Up close with Rick Perry's Hail Mary . Perry faces accusations of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity in connection with the threat and veto. Some Democrats have argued, among other things, that Perry vetoed funding for Lehmberg's unit because it was investigating state-funded grants to cancer research projects that benefited allies of Perry and Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, this year's GOP gubernatorial nominee. 4 reasons why Rick Perry's exercise of power got him in trouble . In their motion, Perry's lawyers ridiculed the notion that vetoing spending -- an action preventing the release of tax dollars -- could somehow constitute a form of personal corruption on the part of the governor. ""A Texas Governor is not Augustus traveling his realm with a portable mint and an imperial treasure in tow; he no more has custody or possession of the State's general revenue funds than does any Texan,"" they wrote. ""No governor can say of his or her state what the Sun King said of France: 'L'Ã©tat, c'est moi.'"" (Translation: ""I am the state."") Perry: 'I don't really understand the details' of indictment charges . Perry has assembled a team of legal powerhouses to defend him against the indictment. Houston attorney Tony Buzbee, GOP attorney Bobby Burchfield, criminal lawyer David Botsford, former Romney presidential campaign legal counsel Ben Ginsberg and Gore campaign veteran Mark Fabiani are among those currently working for the Texas governor. Numerous political analysts have speculated that the indictment could actually work to Perry's political advantage by portraying the conservative politician as a victim of overly aggressive prosecutors working out of Austin -- a Democratic stronghold in the largely Republican state.","Texas Gov.

"A successful mission by India's Mars orbiter would make the country the first Asian nation to reach the Red Planet -- and provide a symbolic coup as neighboring China steps up its ambitions in space. Tuesday's launch was successful, but the plan to send the Mangalyaan, or ""Mars craft,"" on a 680 million-kilometer journey into Mars' orbit has given further credence to claims of an intensifying -- although officially unacknowledged -- space race developing in Asia, with potentially dangerous ramifications. ""I believe India's leadership sees China's recent accomplishments in space science as a threat to its status in Asia, and feels the need to respond,"" says Dr James Clay Moltz, professor at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, who sees increasing competition for space-related power and prestige in Asia that echoes the Cold War space race of the mid-20th century. While Koppillil Radhakrishnan, the head of India's Space Research Organization, has stressed his country is not engaged in competition with any other nation, the mission -- to put a probe into an elliptical orbit around the red planet, mapping its surface and studying the atmosphere -- has been freighted with patriotic significance since its inception. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced the 4.5 billion rupee (US$74 million) mission on India's Independence Day last year, just months after a failed joint mission to Mars by Russia and China -- India's great regional rival for superpower status and the most rapidly accelerating space power. To date, only the U.S., Europe and the Soviets have successfully sent spacecraft to Mars -- Japan's 1998 Nozomi orbiter was also unsuccessful. But not everyone will be cheering from the sidelines. Economist Dr Jean Dreze of the Delhi School of Economics questions the wisdom of investing resources in a flag-waving trip to Mars when the country faces such pressing development needs at home. ""Much as I admire India's Mars mission as a scientific achievement, I am unable to understand the urgency of getting there,"" he told CNN. ""The country would be better served if the same resources, talent and zeal were focused on public health or solar energy. This is a prime case of trying to climb the ladder from the top."" INTERACTIVE: Human exploration of the Red Planet -- from Viking to MAVEN . Even a former head of ISRO, Dr. G Madhavan Nair, has criticized the project as a waste of resources, saying the proposal was half-baked, too expensive and poorly conceived. He told CNN's sister network CNN-IBN that while he was in favor of exploring Mars, ""my contention is that it has to be done properly with complete set of instruments and with proper orbit."" The elliptical orbit, which he said would bring the craft within 360km of Mars at its closest point and 80,000km at its furthest, was ""the wrong kind of orbit to enable any clear observation of a planet."" ""It is not value for money, that's what I feel,"" he told CNN-IBN. ""With regard to priorities, we know there is severe shortage of communication transponders in the country. We need to prioritize that."" So why is India aiming for Mars? For much of its 50-year history, India's space program has prioritized developing technological capacity to help its population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. Just last month, points out Dr Krishan Lal, Fellow at the Indian National Science Academy, India's satellite network -- one of the largest communications systems in the world -- successfully gave advance warning of a cyclone heading for the eastern seaboard, allowing for the evacuation of about 900,000 people. But since 2008, when India sent an unmanned probe to the Moon, the focus has shifted away from a utilitarian focus towards exploration. Radhakrishnan, ISRO chairman, told CNN the mission had several aims, including monitoring the planet for traces of life that may have existed on Mars, but predominantly to demonstrate the technological capability for interplanetary travel. ""First and foremost, what we are trying to do is reach there,"" he said. Lal said the mission was ""primarily about technology proving,"" and was also a matter of significant national prestige. ""It can't be said that it is a scientific issue,"" he said. Indeed, any scientific gains from the mission were unlikely to prove ""earth-shattering,"" said Professor Russell Boyce of the Australian Academy of Science, chairman of the National Committee for Space and Radio Science. ""It would be a modest scientific gain that's attempted in the first instance, to demonstrate the capability."" Rather, the mission was driven mainly by the desire ""to demonstrate they can"" -- a projection of India's technological expertise intended to boost its international prestige and credentials as a leading world power. ""It is a way of showing that you should be taken seriously: 'We are growing in status as a major spacefaring nation, which tends to go alongside growing in status as a great nation.'"" READ MORE: India strives to join elite Mars explorer club . And India is particularly motivated to do so at present, argues Moltz, due to regional rival China's rapid ascent as a space power. Since China launched its first manned spacecraft into orbit a decade ago, he believes, Asia has become the epicenter of a new space race, with China, Japan, and then India leading the way, and smaller powers such as South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan beginning to follow suit with ambitions of their own. This increasing competitiveness, Moltz argues, is fueling regional tensions, and carries with it the risk for potential confrontations and a deepening militarization of space, unless it is accompanied by greater cooperation. Conceived in the current regional environment, he said, India's Mars mission was ""clearly linked to politics and prestige as much as science."" In terms of national security, he said, ""India faces a serious challenge from China's rising space capabilities."" ""It cannot compete with China's vast resources head to head, as it would likely lose any space 'arms race' with Beijing,"" he said, adding that meant India would have to be ""creative in crafting its response to Chinese developments"" including potentially forming alliances with other spacefaring powers. READ MORE: China sets course for lunar landing this year . But other observers differ in their assessments. Boyce said that while there had been a rapid acceleration of space activities in the region, ""I'd hesitate to call it a space race."" Rather than being fueled by competition, he said, the heightened activity was largely due to an increasing appreciation of the importance to states of space assets and satellite technology. They provided vital functions in areas such as communications, or remote sensing for climate change monitoring, disaster management or resources prospecting. ""There's a growing realization if you're engaged in space, if you have access to space assets and space-based information, then you stand to gain economically, and in terms of prestige as a nation,"" he said. The extent to which countries were motivated by pragmatic interest or prestige varied from nation to nation. ""For a country like Australia, the space aspirations are extremely pragmatically driven. On the other hand, a country like Malaysia is intent on putting astronauts in space -- that's very prestige-oriented."" Lal also disputed that a space race was occurring, saying his country acknowledged its limitations in being able to compete with superior space powers and was content to play to its technological strengths, including through comparatively low-cost missions like Mangalyaan. ""A space race? This is not the right way to look at it. If you look at the technological base of Japan, we are not comparable. In many ways, China has done better than India, we have no issues with that,"" he said. ""We are trying to collaborate, in my opinion.""","India's focus on Mars is a product of an increasing Asian space race, says an expert .

"Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a bill Wednesday that would have allowed businesses that asserted their religious beliefs the right to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. The controversial measure faced a surge of opposition in recent days from large corporations and athletic organizations, including Delta Air Lines, the Super Bowl host committee and Major League Baseball. Fiercely divided supporters and opponents of the bill ramped up pressure on Brewer after the state's Republican-led Legislature approved it last week. On Wednesday, the governor said she made the decision she knew was right for Arizona. ""I call them as I see them, despite the cheers or the boos from the crowd,"" Brewer said, criticizing what she described as a ""broadly worded"" bill that ""could result in unintended and negative consequences."" Brewer said she'd weighed the arguments on both sides before vetoing the measure, which is known as SB 1062. Read Gov. Brewer's full statement . ""To the supporters of the legislation, I want you to know that I understand that long-held norms about marriage and family are being challenged as never before. Our society is undergoing many dramatic changes,"" she said. ""However, I sincerely believe that Senate Bill 1062 has the potential to create more problems than it purports to solve. It could divide Arizona in ways we cannot even imagine and no one would ever want. ""Religious liberty is a core American and Arizona value. So is non-discrimination."" Her announcement spurred cheering and hugs by protesters of the bill outside the state Capitol in Phoenix. Banners urging Brewer to veto the bill were quickly swapped for signs praising her decision. ""Thank you Governor Brewer,"" they said. ""Arizona is open for business to everyone!"" Supporters, critics react to veto . Brewer's veto drew swift praise from gay rights advocates. ""Discrimination has no place in Arizona, or anywhere else,"" said Alessandra Soler, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona. ""We're grateful that the governor has stopped this disgraceful law from taking effect, and that Arizona will remain open for business to everyone."" Doug Napier, an attorney representing the Alliance Defending Freedom, which helped craft the bill, criticized the governor's decision. ""Freedom loses when fear overwhelms facts and a good bill is vetoed,"" he said in a statement. ""Today's veto enables the foes of faith to more easily suppress the freedom of the people of Arizona."" Cathi Herrod, president of the Center for Arizona Policy, accused opponents of the measure of distorting facts. ""The religious beliefs of all Arizonans must be respected and this bill did nothing more than affirm that,"" said Herrod, whose conservative organization lent a hand in creating the bill. ""It is truly a disappointing day in our state and nation when lies and personal attacks can overshadow the truth."" Rep. Demion Clinco, the only openly gay member of Arizona's House of Representatives, said he hoped the governor's decision would start a new chapter after what he called a setback for the state's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. ""In her vetoing the bill, I really feel like there's a possible hope for reconciliation within our state, and we can move forward,"" he told CNN's AC360. Bill sparked heated debate . Read Brewer's letter to the Arizona Senate on the veto . Brewer returned home on Tuesday from a weekend in Washington with her state roiling over a values clash between arch conservatives and gay rights advocates. The state battle has national implications, as the issues it deals with play out in different ways in courts, state legislatures and on Main Street across the country. The Arizona measure was particularly pointed and had vocal supporters behind it. They contended it was their legal right to oppose what they see as a gay-rights agenda nationally, and argued the bill allowed for religious freedom. Opinion: Why I put this sign in my pizzeria window . Opponents said the measure encouraged discrimination against gays and lesbians. In addition to gay rights organizations, many businesses sharply criticized the measure, saying it would be bad for Arizona's economy and could lead to discrimination lawsuits, boycotts and other disruptions. Religious liberty movement will continue . Economic concerns . Large businesses including Apple, American Airlines, AT&T and Intel voiced opposition to the measure, and the Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee expressed concerns. The bill also drew fire from some Republican lawmakers with generally social conservative beliefs. Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake publicly urged Brewer to veto the measure, citing worries about the economic impact on the state's businesses. McCain praised Brewer's decision. ""I hope that we can now move on from this controversy and assure the American people that everyone is welcome to live, work and enjoy our beautiful state of Arizona,"" he said in a written statement. Former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney recently tweeted that a veto of the bill was the right course. Romney weighs in, Obama silent on Arizona SB 1062 . Vocal supporters, opponents . Supporters of the bill were just as vocal. They say federal courts have increasingly pushed a pro-gay rights agenda. Freedom or oppression? That's the question for Arizona's SB 1062 . Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said on his show that Brewer was ""being bullied by the homosexual lobby in Arizona and elsewhere."" Supporters said they saw, in the opposition, a double standard in how the rights of gays and lesbians are supported versus those who have conservative religious views. ""I think what we need to do is respect both sides. We need to respect both opinions,"" Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann said Wednesday.

"More than a decade after concluding a fuel tank explosion destroyed TWA Flight 800, senior U.S. accident investigators stood their ground on Tuesday against skeptics claiming new evidence suggests missile fire downed the jumbo jet. ""I'm totally convinced there was no bomb or missile,"" National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jim Wildey told reporters at a briefing outside Washington. Skeptics, including a former NTSB investigator, last month petitioned the agency to re-open its investigation and will release a documentary on the crash this month. Conspiracy theories, outrage swirl around TWA 800 plane . They said evidence suggests one or more missiles destroyed the Paris-bound Boeing 747 over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from New York on July 17, 1996, killing all 230 on board. The safety board has responded cautiously, saying it is having investigators who were not part of the original investigation review the petition. And it is seeking comment from Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other parties to the original probe. But at the same time, the board allowed the original TWA 800 investigators to brief the media on the four-year investigation. Under orders to address only matters in the original investigation, the investigators nonetheless emphasized topics that have come under question by the critics. They held up two sheet metal plates showing examples of bomb and high-velocity missile damage, and then took reporters to view TWA 800's reconstructed fuselage. They said they found no pitting of the type alleged by those challenging the findings. ""You don't see fragmented seat parts,"" said investigator Robert Swaim. Nor is there evidence of pitting, cratering or ""gas jetting"" -- tell-tale marks left by high explosives -- he said. Plane reconstructed . Investigators said they were unable to find any evidence on radar of a missile intercepting the plane. And they discounted the significance of traces of explosives found on more than 100 airplane parts pulled from the ocean. The NTSB said tests showed that explosive residue washes off after only two days in the ocean, leading them to conclude the residue likely was the result of contamination from the military and law enforcement boats that recovered wreckage. The NTSB allowed two TWA 800 family members to attend the briefing, and the family members reiterated their support for the board's findings. Matt Ziemkiewicz, whose sister Jill, a 23-year-old flight attendant, was killed in the explosion, said the briefing ""solidified"" his belief that the original investigation was ""complete, accurate and thorough."" Jim Hurd, whose son Jamie, 29, died on the flight, also endorsed the NTSB finding. ""At first I was of course skeptical as everybody else. You know, you just didn't know what happened. As things unfolded, it seemed to make a lot of sense, what happened to the plane,"" he said. ""It's really cut and dry, at this point, as far as I'm concerned."" Ziemkiewicz and Hurd said the new attention to the crash is opening old wounds. ""It's really a shame in my book,"" Hurd said. ""There are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb and I respect their thoughts and however they want to view it. It's just the way you take the information and how you process it and who you believe. And I believe the NTSB has done a job and I don't believe they've covered up anything and I don't believe the FBI did either."" The NTSB did not allow their critics into the media briefing. They talked to reporters in a parking lot outside. Opinion: Flight 800 conspiracy? Where's the proof? 'A matter of conscience' Hank Hughes, a former NTSB investigator who now doubts the board's conclusion, said he is motivated only by a desire to uncover the truth. Hughes said following the accident, he spent two days with Hurd. ""That's the last guy in the world I'd want to hurt,"" he said. ""There's no profit motive. It's a matter of conscience and integrity as far as we're concerned. Two hundred and thirty people were killed and that's a tragedy that can't be ignored,"" Hughes said. Hughes is featured in the documentary, called ""TWA Flight 800,"" co-produced by longtime skeptic Tom Stalcup. The NTSB investigators on Tuesday repeated a scenario the safety board endorsed in 2000. The series of events leading to TWA 800's disastrous final flight began when it was delayed at New York's John F. Kennedy airport. While the plane was sitting at the gate, the crew engaged the plane's air conditioner to keep passengers cool. The air conditioning units, low in the plane's fuselage, heated the large, nearly empty fuel tank above it, creating a volatile fuel/air mixture. Ten minutes after take-off, when the plane was at 13,700 feet and climbing, an electrical short that likely occurred in a wire bundle pushed a high-voltage current into the fuel tank, igniting it, and destroying the plane. Divers found three overlapping fields of debris at the bottom of the ocean. The first included the pieces of the fuel tank and the cabin above it. A second field contained the nose and cockpit. The final and largest debris field contained the rest of the plane. Investigators said they worked hard to determine if a bomb or missile was involved, especially in light of the event's timing two days before the Summer Olympics and 10 days before the Olympic bombing in Atlanta. ""That really intensified the investigation,"" said investigator Joseph Kolly. A cockpit voice recorder analysis showed a sound spectrum consistent with a low-explosive fuel tank explosion, not a high-explosive missile. Eventually, investigators ruled out a missile or bomb, as well as lightning, meteor, electro-magnetic pulse, and other possible causes, Kolly said. Kolly acknowledged some friction between the NTSB and the FBI during the investigation, but said ""it didn't ultimately harm the investigation."" Kolly said the petition has not prompted him to rethink the board's 2000 findings. Since the petition was filed, Kolly said, he has re-read this report ""a couple more times and it's pretty thorough.""

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Less than one month after a Buenos Aires court derailed the marriage of Alex Freyre and Jose Maria di Bello, the couple wed Monday at the southern tip of Argentina, making it the first same-sex marriage in Latin America. ""As a couple, we dreamed of marrying for a long time,"" Freyre told the state-run Telam news agency. Their marriage was hailed as a victory by gay rights groups in Argentina, though it was unknown whether the legality of their marriage would face any challenges. After a legal battle earlier this year, a court in the capital, Buenos Aires, ruled that a ban on same-sex marriage was illegal and ordered the proper authorities to grant the couple a marriage license if they applied for one. On the eve of their December 1 wedding, however, another court filed an injunction, putting the brakes on the nuptials. In Argentina, the issue of same-sex marriage is decided on the local and state level. So Freyre and di Bello went to the southernmost state of Tierra del Fuego, where a pro-gay marriage governor welcomed the event, Telam reported. Although the federal government could not directly intervene, Argentina's National Institute Against Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) helped find a friendly jurisdiction where the couple could have their wedding, the institute's president, Claudio Morgado, told Telam. Morgado was even a witness at the ceremony. ""This is the purpose of INADI, to safeguard the rights of citizens who do not fully enjoy these rights,"" Morgado said, according to the state-run news agency. The original ruling against a ban on gay marriage was made on November 10 by Buenos Aires trial-level judge Gabriela Seijas. Her decision applied only to Buenos Aires. ""The law should treat each person with equal respect in relation to each person's singularities without the need to understand or regulate them,"" Seijas said in her ruling. Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri said after the ruling that his government would not appeal the decision, but a second trial judge filed an injunction until the issue could be considered further. Countries in Latin America, a region strongly identified with the Catholic Church, have recently given more attention to gay rights. Earlier this month, Mexico City's legislative assembly passed a bill legalizing gay marriage there. In September, Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex adoption. Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador are also addressing the issue of same-sex civil unions.","Alex Freyre and Jose Maria di Bello marry at the southern tip of Argentina .

"(CNN)(CNN) -- At least seven people died Tuesday when a packed Metro North commuter train plowed into a Jeep Cherokee on the tracks north of New York City. A dozen more were injured, a rail official said. Six of the people killed in the fiery crash were train passengers, and the seventh fatality was the female driver of the Jeep, the official said. The collision happened about 7 p.m. when the gates at the two-track Commerce Street crossing near Valhalla came down on top of a Jeep Cherokee stopped on the tracks. The driver got out to look at the rear of the vehicle, drove forward and was struck, a Metro Transit Authority official said. She was outside the vehicle when the train struck, the official said. The 5:44 p.m. northbound train from Grand Central Terminal shoved the SUV about 10 car lengths. The third rail pushed up from the track and rammed through the entire first car of the train. ""Everything is melted inside,"" said Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino. Photos of the scene and areal video from CNN affiliate WCBS showed flames and smoke pouring out windows of the commuter train. The commuter train was full when the accident happened. ""There were about 650 (people) total on the ride home,"" said  Astorino said. A passenger, Justin Kaback, told CNN that people on his car didn't panic and exited in an orderly manner. Getting out of the car was difficult because it was so high and snow was on the ground, he said. MTA said the riders evacuated themselves. About 400 commuters were taken to a rock-climbing gym for shelter, the train company official said.  Buses were en route there to get to them to Pleasantville. Twelve people were taken to Westchester Medical Center. Their condition was not immediately known. The National Transportation Safety Board tweeted that the agency was sending a ""go team"" to investigate the crash.","A Jeep Cherokee got stuck on the tracks .

"(CNN)CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson just returned from the border town of Jizan, Saudi Arabia, where troops are searching for terrorists among the flood of smugglers and illegal workers trying to sneak into the country from Yemen. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Saudi officials are concerned the recent takeover of the capitol by Houthi rebels will give the terrorist group a greater foothold. Saudi dilemma: How to spot potential terrorist amid tide of human misery . Robertson discussed the situation and his experiences covering global conflicts during his 25-year career in a wide-ranging ""ask me anything"" chat on Reddit. Here are the highlights from the hourlong conversation. Some of the posts have been edited for grammar and clarity. Q: ""I hope you don't mind answering a really basic question. What exactly is the situation today and can you explain it with a bit of historical context for naive readers like me? Thanks!"" asked milkmilk_lemonade. Robertson: ""Historically, decades back, the border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen was very open -- little more than a line on the map.  If you go back before that, there was not even a line on the map. More recently, about 6 years ago, Houthi tribesmen crossed in Saudi took control of a village. There was a three-week battle with helicopter gunships before Saudis got it back. As Yemen has become more unstable, its economy has gotten worse. Clearly, Saudi Arabia is the richer country with more oil, so the border is division between the haves and the have-nots on Yemen side.  So many come to Saudi Arabia for work, even an 11-year-old boy I met who earns $100 a month working on a till at a small supermarket. It's the only way for some Yemenis to make money, so they cross over for stays that last weeks or months.  The huge numbers crossing make it hard to control and know who is who --terrorist or poor guy."" Q: ""Is there anything from the border you want to share, that wasn't included in the story? Can you talk about the process and problems of trying to gain permission for it?"" asked sirpoopsal0t. Robertson: ""There were so many more people than we could get in our TV reporting. I wrote a story for CNN Digital after I did the TV piece to cram in more details, but I was shocked. I didn't quite know what to expect that day, but it was way more people and drugs than I'd realized. We try to get everything in our reports, but we saw group after group being caught, particularly at dusk."" Q: ""How was my country's border patrol/army? Were they as you expected? Worse maybe?"" asked sai911. Robertson: ""They were professionals. I was struck by the quality of the officers and the access we were given. I was only there for a day, but they have a huge job on their hands."" Q: ""What have you found to be the biggest three obstacles in locating terrorists?"" asked DebraLynnO. Robertson: ""They can usually be found through intermediaries, but sometimes it's more dangerous than others."" Q: ""Hi Nic. It takes [nerve] to do what you're doing! Why are you doing it? What made it happen?"" Robertson: ""It's important that the world hears what's happening in its darkest corners. It's important for the people in those dark places to know that people care, that they are people too and that their lives count."" Q: ""When traveling in dangerous countries does the fear ever leave? Do you get an opportunity to meet people and enjoy their way of life?"" Robertson: ""Yes, on the good days we do get time to meet folks. At the end of the day on the border we had half an hour to spare and the border guards took us to the beach and gave us dinner -- fish, lamb,.. salads, humus, bread -- right there on a rug at the beach. We got to relax a little before we ran off to catch the plane. Sometimes after an interview, we can chill out a little with folks in their homes. Those can be interesting conversations. ""We always have mind to dangers of any location."" Q: ""You always hear about post-traumatic stress disorder with soldiers. Do you find yourself experiencing it given your work?"" asked allianceofmagicians. Robertson: ""Sure, PTSD does hit journalists too. Soldiers tend to face the exposure to those kind of traumatic events for much longer and often more intensely than we do. We have access to help here at CNN and I've talked to our expert over the years. ""I've never felt that I've suffered from PTSD, but I'd say I do get awfully sad sometimes after a bad story -- tears, etc. -- but it passes. I have a great home life, I love to run and cycle. That kind of stuff gets you out of yourself, but I'd say my exposure to trauma has not been that excessive."" Q: ""CNN keeps reminding us at home that they aren't going to show any of the photos of the captured Jordanian pilot. During and after the Charlie Hebdo massacre they kept letting us how they weren't going to show any of the offending cartoons. With all you've seen what are your thoughts on news organizations making those kinds of decisions?"" asked Mutt1223. Robertson: ""In this day and age all these things can be found online someplace. At least that's my experience. I have seen the video of the pilot, and I feel horrible. ""The Pope posed an interesting question about what sort of people do we want to be. The power is in our hands. Do we want to inflame or do we seek a more just, equitable world where we respect and tolerate each other.

"Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday.  She was 96. Fontaine died ""very peacefully"" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said.  She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher.  She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film ""No More Ladies.""  She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, ""No Bed of Roses,"" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942.  Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's ""Suspicion,""  beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for ""Hold Back the Dawn."" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for ""To Each His Own.""  De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. ""I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,"" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said. Did you meet Fontaine or were you a fan? Share your memories . Fontaine, at 23, was the youngest best actress Oscar winner at the time she was given the award for ""Suspicion.""  Her Oscar represents the only one ever won by a Hitchcock film. Her first Oscar nomination came in 1941 for her role in Hitchcock's ""Rebecca.""  A third nomination followed in 1943 for ""The Constant Nymph."" Fontaine married four times: to Brian Aherne in 1939, William Dozier in 1946, Collier Young in 1952 and  Alfred Wright, Jr. in 1964.  While three of the marriages lasted less than five years, the marriage to Young lasted nine years.  She had a daughter with Dozier and adopted a girl while married to Young. Fontaine acted on the Broadway stage in ""Tea and Sympathy"" in 1954. She won a Daytime Emmy nomination for outstanding guest appearance in the television soap opera ""Ryan's Hope"" in 1980.

"(CNN)The world's most populous country also has the largest -- and fastest growing -- online population. China has now surpassed 649 million users, outnumbering the entire U.S. population two to one, according to official figures released Tuesday. The China Internet Network Information Center's (CNNIC) 35th ""China Internet Development Statistics Report,"" documents online usage in the country for 2014, and identified the staggering number of connected Chinese citizens. The growth of mobile internet is largely credited for the increase, with 80% of users -- 557 million -- using smartphones and tablets to connect. However, the rate of growth is slowing somewhat, the report said, with 31 million new users added in 2014 compared to 54 million in 2013. The rate of growth in mobile users was significantly higher than the overall increase, with 57 million new mobile users logging on last year. Despite the huge number and rapid growth of connectivity, the overall population size means that still a majority (52.1%) of Chinese have no access to the internet. Rural users are heavily outnumbered by their urban counterparts. After China, the U.S. has the second largest number of Internet users, with 280 million, followed by India (243 million) and Japan (109 million), according to data compiled by the World Bank and United Nations amongst others. Those who are connected largely have a different user experience from internet users in the West, with sites like Twitter, Facebook and Google blocked or severely restricted. Thousands of terms deemed sensitive by the government -- such as ""end one-party dictatorship"" -- are also banned. And China's ""Great Firewall"" is getting harder to break through. Prior to the latest crackdown, many Chinese internet users employed VPNs -- virtual private networks -- to get around the draconian censorship laws. But now these VPNs are also being shut down. Without unfettered access, however, some are concerned that China is strangling its nascent ""knowledge economy."" While the huge number of connected users -- particularly those on smart devices -- is a boon to companies like Apple, which credits a large part of its phenomenal quarterly earnings to its huge Chinese fanbase, there is a cost. Strict, new Chinese government rules will subject foreign companies to tailor their products for use within China. By insisting that overseas companies give up source code and back-end data on their China-bound products, could are put at a huge competitive disadvantage.

"(CNN)""Lolita's story reminded me of my own,"" says African-American actress and singer Robbyne Kaamil. ""My own relatives, my family ancestors, were captured and forced into slavery."" Captured in waters off Washington State in 1970, Lolita is an orca -- a killer whale. Kaamil, who perceives clear parallels between Lolita's life of captivity-for-profit and the human slave trade, was inspired to record ""Let The Girl Go: Free Lolita,"" a bold music video about Lolita, and a courageous interview on the parallels of captivity between human slaves and performing orcas. Lolita is still living in Florida at the Miami Seaquarium. She's been the focus of a concerted campaign to win her release. In January, Kaamil participated in a march in Miami that drew an impressive crowd estimated by the Miami Herald to be around 1,000 people. Can a killer whale be a slave? Literally? ""It's important to understand how horrendous it is to steal a baby orca from her family, force her to perform, and hold her in the equivalent of a bath tank until she dies. It's a crime,"" Kaamil said. Lolita has spent 44 years in a teacup. She is 20 feet long, living in a tank reportedly to be about 20 feet deep, 35 feet wide and 80 feet long. Free-living orcas usually travel 25 to 75 miles per day. Compared to say, 40 miles, 80 feet is about 1/2600th the size of an orca's normal daily life. Like a second lump of sugar, a whale named Hugo who had been captured from the same free-living whale community two years earlier, shared Lolita's teacup for 10 years. Hugo died in 1980 after repeatedly ramming his head into the wall of the pool. Did he commit suicide? Free-living orcas never do anything self-destructive. They have never even been seen fighting. Consider Lolita's isolation. At age 4, she was taken from her mother. Free-living orcas live their entire lives traveling with their mothers, siblings and children. Unlike any other known creature, unlike elephants and humans, orcas like Lolita never leave their birth family. Free-living orcas frequently live into their 50s or beyond (they can live up to a century). They often cooperate and help one another, and may perform midwife duties. Forty-year veteran orca expert Ken Balcomb has told me that tooth marks on a recent healthy newborn suggest that another whale, likely its grandmother, assisted her daughter during a difficult birth by pulling the infant from her body. Thousands of miles away, Lolita's family has been without her. During these decades, the family desperately needed her. ""The captures of young whales in the 1960s and '70s really caused a long-term problem,"" Balcomb told me. The so-called ""resident"" orca families travel the U.S. West Coast off Washington, Oregon and California hunting fish. Before the captures they totaled about 120 whales. The captures took them down to about 70. They managed to rebuild to 99 whales by the 1990s. But when the whales removed as babies would have been the next maturing generation, rebuilding hit a wall: too few females. Forty years later, the population—around 80 whales—is losing one or two members a year. The whole U.S. resident population now has just two-dozen females of reproductive age. In some families, the only females are past reproductive age. Those families are doomed. Lolita, who has never given birth, is now menopausal, her gifts to the future forever withheld by her denatured existence. By continuing to lure paying customers, Lolita continues to make money for her owners. Palace Entertainment, owner of the Miami Seaquarium, claims Lolita can no longer survive in the wild. But that's not the proposal. The proposal is to move her into a vastly larger open-water net-pen in her home waters of Washington State. There, she can be in vocal contact with her family. Depending on how that goes and whether after all this time there remains recognition, the possibility of full return to her family could be considered. Lolita's fish-hunting skills are by now somewhere between rusty and nonexistent, but free-living orcas routinely share food. Bottom line: What's proposed for her is better than the situation she is in. Even death might seem preferable—as Lolita's companion Hugo seemed to think. ""Most of us have a clear understanding about the cruelty of slavery. It is imperative to recognize the inhumanity of forcing any living being into captivity."" Kaamil said.","Carl Safina: Lolita, a captured killer whale, is living in Florida at the Miami Seaquarium in a confined space .

"(CNN)For President Barack Obama and the Republicans in Congress, distance does not make the heart grow fonder. With the president escaping to Asia for a critical foreign trip after last week's bruising losses for his party, White House officials are signaling Obama will take a hard-nosed approach with Congress when he returns to Washington. Obama is ""nearing a final decision"" on issuing an executive order bringing reforms to U.S. immigration policy, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at a briefing in Naypyitaw, Myanmar. Earnest reiterated the President's goal to act on the issue by the end of the year. Immigration reform advocates working with the administration on the expected executive action anticipate Obama will expand his policy of deferred deportation for undocumented children to their families, a move that may provide enforcement relief to as many as five million people. The expected incoming Senate majority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has described such a move as a ""poison pill"" that would damage relations with the new Republican Congress coming into power in January. Aides to the President brush off those GOP warnings, noting threats from Republican leaders to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Obama has vowed he will never sign that repeal legislation into law. ""Repealing Obamacare is also a poison pill,"" White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said. Obama seeks new Syria strategy review . Earnest cited the President's new climate change deal with China as another area where Obama can pursue his own agenda without Congress. Asked whether the administration believes the United States can meet the agreement's carbon emission requirements without congressional involvement, Earnest said simply, ""we do."" Administration officials believe the United States is well on its way to holding up its end of the climate deal, citing Obama's executive decisions to raise fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks as well as new rules that set tougher emission requirements for power plants. In his own response to the climate agreement, McConnell questioned whether China would be as ambitious. ""I read the agreement - requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states around the country,"" the Kentucky Republican said. Will Congress kill an Iran nuclear deal? China would have to make ""significant"" changes in meeting its energy needs in order to comply with the deal, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said. On another top priority for Republicans, passage of legislation to accelerate completion of the contested Keystone oil pipeline, Earnest suggested the President is warming up his veto pen. Earnest declined to definitively say Obama would veto such legislation. But he quickly added the President has taken a ""dim view"" of similar bills in the past. Top White House officials insist the President remains interested in working with Republicans on a range of common interests, from tax reform to infrastructure spending. Obama is visiting Myanmar for the second time in two years to attend the ASEAN economic summit while checking in on democratic reform efforts in the nation also known as Burma. Top Congressional Republicans slam U.S.-China climate deal . Making the transformation from a closed-off military state to a parliamentary democracy, Myanmar happens to be a beneficiary of bipartisan cooperation on Capitol Hill. McConnell, who was originally a sponsor of sanctions on Myanmar's military leadership, was praised by Rhodes in Naypyitaw for his role in winding down those economic penalties.

Greste said at a press conference that he'll work to free them. ""I will do all we can to talk to the right people to facilitate their release,"" Greste said, declining to go into detail. Greste thanked the people who worked for his release -- his family, leaders of the Australian and Latvian governments, people who took part in demonstrations and journalists. He was surprised at the number of people involved. ""What we've seen out of this is a sense of purpose and a sense of unity that has blown me away,"" he said.

"Toronto (CNN)Describing Canada's terrorism activity as ""diverse and constantly evolving,"" the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Tuesday charged three Ottawa men with terrorism-related offenses. Awso Peshdary, 25; John Maguire, 24; and Khadar Khalib, 23, were charged with conspiracy to facilitate a terrorist act, knowingly participating in the activities of a terror group and counseling a person to knowingly participate in a terrorist activity. Maguire and Khalib are believed to be fighting with ISIS in Syria or Iraq and were charged in absentia.  Peshdary was arrested in Ottawa on Tuesday without incident. Maguire has been a menacing presence on social media, seen in videos threatening Canada and its allies and boasting of ISIS strength. Posts on social media in recent weeks have claimed that Maguire died while fighting with ISIS, but Canadian authorities say they have no proof that Maguire on whether he's dead or alive. ""Through collaborative efforts with our partners, we were able to disrupt an organized network associated with (ISIS). This network was involved in recruiting individuals for terrorism purposes and in sending them into Syria and Iraq for the benefit of this terrorist group,"" said James Malizia, an assistant RCMP commissioner, in a statement. The arrests Tuesday were part of yet another extensive national security criminal investigation, this one named ""Project Servant."" It involved the RCMP as well as local and provincial police. Including those charged Tuesday, Canadian police have now charged six Ottawa men in recent weeks with terrorism related offenses. They say all knew each other and were communicating through social media. It is unclear whether they were part of one cell or operating more loosely. ""These charges along with other terrorism-related arrests within the past few weeks underscore the reality that there are individuals in Canada who become radicalized to violence and who are willing to act upon it,""  said Malizia during a news conference in Ottawa.","Three Ottawa men have been charged with terrorism-related offenses .

"(CNN)Florida's Three Sisters Springs got a little crowded this week when more than 300 manatees swam quickly into the springs, prompting park officials to close the springs to human swimmers and kayakers. Up to 600 manatees winter in Florida Kings Bay and Crystal River from November to March, but the population drops to 30 manatees the rest of the year. The warm waters of Three Sisters Springs, part of Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, allow manatees to live safely during the winter months, when the open waters can get dangerously cold for the gentle mammals. About 80 miles north of Tampa, it's also a popular place for visitors to see and swim with the manatees. Three Sisters Springs is the only ""confined-water body in the United States"" open for the public to see wintering manatees, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages Three Sisters Springs for the city of Crystal River and the state. Though the springs closed Monday and reopened Tuesday, the refuge's policy is to close them again as needed. Noting increasing manatee harassment at the springs since 1979, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been considering a policy to restrict access to the manatees during the winter months. ""Swimming with manatees is a tremendous experience, and I know that when done properly, everybody benefits,"" said Andrew Gude, who manages Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, as well as Lower Suwannee, Cedar Keys and Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuges, in a December statement. ""It is the experience of a lifetime."" This isn't the first time animals simply living their lives have crowded out their human visitors. Harbor seals take over Children's Pool beach in the San Diego suburb of La Jolla for five months each year during pupping season. After years of visitors bothering the seals at the small beach in the tony neighborhood, the beach has been closed to humans from December 15 to May 15 under a San Diego City Council plan approved in 2014 by the California Coastal Commission. No matter what modest restrictions were put in place in the past, visitors would still bother the birthing seals, officials said, leading to the possibility that scared mother seals might abandon their pups. ""Every time we've tried to help both the people and the seals, it hasn't worked out,"" Coastal Commissioner Dayna Bochco told the Los Angeles Times. ""If more people would act reasonably, we wouldn't be here today."" Though swimmers and snorkelers protested the move, many day trippers have preferred to admire the animals from afar. The seals' tendency to defecate where they live can make the waters unsanitary for human swimming.","Over 300 manatees swam into Three Sisters Springs .

"Washington (CNN)Triumphant Republicans return to Washington Wednesday to prepare for a new era of GOP dominance on both sides of the Capitol. But first, they have to get through a short, final Senate session under Democratic control. The post-election lame duck session should be fast-paced as lawmakers work to clear leftover business, including a must pass bill to fund the government, and other bills to arm Syrian rebels and extend expiring tax breaks.  Republican leaders are anxious to start the new Congress in January with a clean slate when they could control as many as 54 seats. Senators who were defeated in the last election must return to the Capitol to vote on these items.  But newly-elected senators, excited after their victories, can't vote until they are sworn-in in January. The incoming freshmen will be here for three days of intensive orientation. Unlike past orientations, when senators were given heavy binders and detailed briefings about foreign policy, national security, and other current topics, this week's sessions will deal more with the practical matters of operating a Senate office, including hiring, disbursement, and ethics rules. They will be conducted by individual senators who will share their experiences. There will be a special dinner honoring the new members and their spouses Wednesday night in the Capitol. The incoming members will also be assigned temporary office space for use until they move into their permanent digs sometime next year. Like an overcrowded elementary school, those offices will be housed in trailers sandwiched into the courtyard of the Russell Senate office building. While the lame duck agenda is packed, one controversial item the Senate may not deal with until next year is approving Loretta Lynch to be the new Attorney General. Democrats signaled Tuesday they are unlikely to try to confirm her even though if they moved now, they could approve her with just Democratic votes. Democrats say Lynch, who has been confirmed twice by the Senate, is highly qualified and will be approved regardless of who controls the chamber. ""There may be some who feel they have to vote no simply because it's a nominee by President Obama,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said in an MSNBC interview Tuesday.  ""But the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats will vote for her.  She's superbly qualified."" However, most Republicans don't want to rush the process, preferring to explore more carefully Lynch's background and views on immigration and other hot-button subjects. ""Ms. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate.  And her nomination should be considered in the new Congress through regular order,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell warned over the weekend. Tensions between the parties are already high after a bruising two-year session that was marked by gridlock and partisanship. Senators are now bracing for President Barack Obama to announce controversial executive orders to change immigration laws, which could be released during the lame duck. Lawmakers and aides are guessing the President will wait until after December 11, which is when Congress needs to clear that critical funding bill to keep government operating. Republicans are vehemently opposed to Obama revising immigration laws on his own and have warned that doing so could make it difficult to get anything of consequence done during the lame duck. ""What the President does over the next two months is really going to set the tone for the next two years in Washington,"" Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the GOP leadership, said on Fox News Sunday.  ""So, I think it would be like the President pulling the pin out of the hand grenade and throwing (it) in as we're actually trying to work together.  I'm hoping that cooler heads at the White House prevail."" Other items Senate Democratic leaders hope to bring to the floor include a package that would extend some personal and business tax breaks set to run out at the end of the year along with the annual Department of Defense bill that will likely include extending approval Congress already gave for training and equipping Syrian rebels. They will also vote on billions in new funding for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, billions more for the military operations against ISIS, and possibly an NSA reform bill written by the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which would rein in the government's ability to make bulk collections of phone and Internet data. However, Republicans are doubtful this bill will be debated now. Senate Democratic leaders are considering a vote on the Keystone pipeline during the lame duck, according to a source familiar with the issue. A decision hasn't been finalized but such a move could boost Louisiana Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in her run off race. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, meanwhile, also has a long list presidential nominations he wants to clear. The Senate could start debate on authorization of military force to give formal approval for U.S. military action in Syria and Iraq.  However, aides in both parties said that vote on any new authorization will likely be put off until the new Congress. The U.S./Iranian nuclear talks could also take center stage during the lame duck, as those negotiations hit a critical deadline Nov. 24. There is bipartisan support in the Senate for new sanctions against Iran if those talks fail. New and returning senators will gather privately Thursday morning in the Capitol to elect new leadership for their respective caucuses.  There are no major changes expected in the leadership ranks, with Sen. Mitch McConnell set to become majority leader and Reid set to become minority leader. Will Congress kill an Iran nuclear deal?","Congress returns to Washington Wednesday .

"Atlanta (CNN)The breakup of a gun smuggling ring allegedly involving a current and former Delta Air Lines employee has exposed what a New York prosecutor described as an ""egregious breach of security"" at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said Tuesday that the investigation was ""deeply troubling"" -- not only for the havoc the gun running unleashed on the streets but because of the vulnerability to acts of terrorism on air travel that it revealed. ""If they can put guns on the plane this time,"" he told reporters, ""they could have easily put a bomb on one of those planes."" Two men worked together to smuggle guns and ammunition on at least 20 flights from Atlanta to New York from May to December, officials said. ""We have an egregious breach of security"" at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport because airport employees ""are not required to go through screening,"" said Thompson. In total, 153 guns were recovered as part of a complex investigation that Thompson outlined by using charts and surveillance video during a press conference in New York. Eugene Harvey, who worked for Delta at the Atlanta airport, was arrested at his home in Atlanta on Monday, authorities said. According to Harvey's arrest warrant affidavit, here's how the operation worked: . -- Harvey used his security clearance to help provide guns to a passenger named Mark Quentin Henry after Henry cleared security. -- Henry, the former employee, allegedly brought the firearms in his carry-on luggage on at least five flights from Atlanta to New York between May 1 and December 10. -- During that time frame, Henry supplied 129 handguns and two assault rifles to co-conspirators in New York, the affidavit states. -- One of those co-conspirators ended up selling the firearms to an undercover New York police officer. ""Gun violence is tearing our country apart,"" Thompson said. ""In Brooklyn, far too many people have been victims of gun violence."" Reese McCranie, spokesperson for the Atlanta airport, said officials have cooperated with the FBI, the Transportation Security Administration and other agencies and was reviewing its security. ""As part of the TSA- and airport-approved multi-layered security plan, all employees must pass extensive criminal history record checks, security threat assessments, and security training prior to being approved for access to secured areas,"" he said in a statement. ""Additionally, employees are subjected to continuous vetting and random inspections."" In a statement, the TSA said it took ""the potential for insider threats at airports very seriously."" ""TSA administers security threat assessments and airport criminal checks for all airline employees prior to receiving credentials and access privileges,"" the statement said. ""This is a recurring vetting process that involves random checks. TSA continues to closely partner with law enforcement on this investigation and, where possible, will use the findings from the investigation to improve current processes."" Thompson praised Delta for being cooperative from start to finish of the undercover probe. Henry was arrested in New York on December 10 after landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport with 18 handguns in his bag  -- seven of which were loaded, the affidavit says. ""The problem at this airport in Atlanta is that the employees don't have to go through screening,"" Thompson said. ""Henry knew that. Henry would give Harvey the guns outside the airport. Harvey would go through. All he had to to was badge himself in ... and he's in the terminal with the guns."" Henry told investigators that he had flown from Atlanta to New York with the 18 firearms and associated ammunition in his carry-on bag, FBI task force agent George Taylor wrote in the affidavit. TSA seizes record number of firearms . So how could a man get more than a dozen guns on a flight in his carry-on backpack? ""Had the eighteen firearms been inside the Oakley bag when Henry passed through TSA screening, the firearms would have been discovered,"" Taylor wrote. ""Accordingly, I reasonably believe the eighteen firearms bypassed security."" The 'backdoor method' Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst, said the suspects apparently ""took advantage of known loopholes"" in airport security. Baggage handlers and other airport employees don't have to go through a concourse screening as passengers do, creating a ""backdoor method"" for airport employees to smuggle materials, she said. ""That's literally been a loophole since 2002,"" when the TSA was established, she said. ""There was a big issue on cost."" When she was inspector general of the Transportation Department for six years ending in 1996, Schiavo raised the ""same kind of warning"" about the screening of airport employees. ""This is an important wake-up call. I just hope Washington and the airports heed it,"" she said. Schiavo said that ""it will take a lot of expense and manpower to close that loophole."" At the news conference, Thompson held one of the weapons allegedly smuggled by Henry -- an AK-47. ""This gun can shoot through a car door,"" he said. ""It can shoot through an apartment door. It can shoot through a bullet-proof vest. In November, Mr. Henry brought this gun on a Delta commercial airliner to New York."" Transfer in men's restroom? On the morning of December 10, the affidavit says, baggage handler Harvey used his security clearance to enter Delta's employee parking lot and then the secure area of the airport. ""Employees entering this area are not subjected to screening by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), neither at the time of entry into the employee parking lot, nor upon entry to the internal secure/restricted area at Hartsfield-Jackson,"" the affidavit states. Surveillance video showed that on the same morning, the passenger Henry cleared security with a black Oakley backpack. He then went to sit down at the airport's Concourse B. According to Taylor, that's when Henry started texting Harvey. Moments later, Harvey entered a men's restroom in Concourse B. And Henry followed. After one minute, the affidavit says, Henry walked out of the restroom with the backpack. Gun packed in PlayStation 2 gets passenger arrested . The criminal complaint also says on several occasions this year, Harvey used his security clearance to enter the secure Delta employee parking lot -- even though he was supposed to be off or on sick leave. And on each of those dates, Henry boarded a flight from Atlanta to New York. Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant told CNN the airline is cooperating with authorities. ""We take seriously any activity that fails to uphold our strict commitment to the safety and security of our customers and employees,"" he said. Thompson said Henry allegedly boarded 20 flights with guns between May and December.

"The 80-year-old North Korean war vet says he's been holding onto a bullet he didn't get to fire when his country declared a truce with its neighbor 60 years ago. Now -- if North Korean state media is to be believed --  the man is itching to do so. ""I am still keeping a bullet that I failed to fire at a trench in the 1950s because the U.S. imperialists and their stooges signed an armistice agreement,"" the man is quoted as saying in Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party. ""Send me to the trench. Give me a rifle. I want to rain bullets on the enemy to my heart's content."" Like him, the newspaper said, North Koreans across the country are begging to join the army after the United Nations slapped the country with new sanctions. It's the latest hyperbole coming out of the repressed country after the North reneged Monday on a 60-year-old armistice that had maintained an uneasy peace with South Korea since the Korean War in the 1950s. ""All people who can take rifle are petitioning to be allowed to join or rejoin the People's Army in all provinces and towns,"" the newspaper said. For its part, South Korea said it's keeping a close watch and making sure its combined forces with the United States are prepared for moves by the North. ""There are possibilities that these activities could lead to provocations,"" defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-suk said. If they do, he added, ""We will respond in a more resolute and destructively manner."" The ever-ratcheting war of words between the two sides reached new heights after Pyongyang scrapped the agreement and then followed it up by ignoring Seoul's calls to a military hotline the two sides set up in 2004 to ease tensions. Opinion: Will China finally 'bite' North Korea? 'An act of war' North Korea said its decision was a direct response to the U.N. Security Council, which passed tougher sanctions against the country after it carried out a nuclear test last month. The sanctions, North Korea's ruling Workers' Party said, are ""a declaration of war and an act of war."" The United States followed the U.N.'s sanctions with its own Monday after North Korea scrapped the armistice agreement. The new U.S. sanctions target North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank for its role in supporting the country's weapons of mass destruction program, the Treasury Department said Monday. The sanctions effectively cut the North's primary foreign exchange bank off from the U.S. financial system. Rodman: 'I'm going on vacation with Kim in August' 'Break the waists of ... enemies' Pyongyang is also furious at joint military drills taking place between the South and the United States. The annual training exercises are scheduled to last two months. Leader Kim Jong Un lambasted the drills, taking place near the Korean peninsula. ""As the saying goes ... a guy who is fond of playing with fire is bound to perish in flames"" Kim told soldiers, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""All the enemies quite often playing with fire in the sensitive hotspot should be thrown into a cauldron once I issue an order."" ""Once an order is issued,"" Kim told the troops, ""you should break the waists of the crazy enemies, totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war is like."" In Washington, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Pyongyang's ""bellicose rhetoric"" has raised concerns -- but won't help the North's situation. ""The DPRK will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in northeast Asia,"" he said.

"(CNN)One of the most common misconceptions about cancer is that it is one disease. Most people think of cancer as something that will automatically kill you if left alone, but there are so many variations of the disease that this is actually not a given. Every ""cancer"" is different. Some aggressive cancers grow rapidly and can be quite serious, but some grow slowly or not at all and may be completely safe to live with. As physicians, we need to help change the way the medical community and general public think about cancer. And World Cancer Day, being marked Wednesday, is as good a day as any to start. To begin with, we need to be more precise. Science has taught us quite a bit about the disease in the last few decades, so a one-size-fits-all definition is no longer the right fit because there isn't just one type of cancer -- there are many. It's like allergies; we can easily understand that there is more than just one type of allergy. Allergies vary hugely in type and severity, and not everyone will lead to anaphylactic shock or a fatality. Some allergies cause no more than itchy eyes or a runny nose. The same principle is true of cancer. And because the term cancer is surrounded by connotations of panic and death, in the case of extremely low-risk lesions, we should reclassify them accordingly. The reality is that many of the low-risk lesions we call breast cancer would never come to our attention and never harm us if left alone. After more than a decade of screening and finding 50,000 to 60,000 women a year with pre-cancerous or low-risk lesions in the breast (which are frequently treated aggressively as if they are cancer), you would expect that the incidence of invasive cancers would drop. But in fact, the frequency of invasive cancer occurrence hasn't gone down. This highlights the need to know more about how specific cancers develop and progress so we can distinguish between them and label them properly. Proper labeling would provide us with a more precise method for evaluating individual lesions and allow us to offer our patients the least invasive and most effective treatment options. In 2009, Dr. Ian Thompson and I were collaborating on an article for the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA. We were comparing screening approaches between breast and prostate cancers, and we really got to thinking about the need to reframe our approach to screening and rename these slow-growing tumors. When JAMA told us: ""OK, come up with a name -- you have 24 hours,"" our solution was the term IDLE, which actually sounds like what it is intended to convey. The IDLE condition is an Indolent Lesion of Epithelial origin. (Epithelial is the type of cell that lines all the ducts in the body and is the cell of origin of many solid tumor types.) We intend the term to be used when a lesion does not pose an urgent threat, where observation over time is an acceptable alternative to an invasive procedure, and may in fact be the best course of action. We wanted a meaningful term that communicated a slow tempo and a lack of threat instead of some empty acronym or complicated jargon. IDLE does that. It's a common word that gives people a sense of comfort with the idea of watching and then only intervening if there is a change. If a lesion doesn't grow, it can be left alone. There is plenty of time to get more information. If it does grow, it can be treated at that time, without risking the patient's health. This is the direction that breast care is heading. Over the last couple of years, the concept has been the subject of many articles such as a Wall Street Journal piece by health writer Melinda Beck. Moreover, the National Cancer Institute recently put out a request calling for proposals to identify and define the IDLE condition and study its underlying biology as well as how to treat it differently. It is an exciting time for cancer research, with the possibility of dramatically improving the way we provide breast care specifically and treat cancer generally. A 51-year-old patient of mine recently had a lesion detected on a mammogram, which then resulted in a biopsy. Hearing the word cancer right off the bat put her in an immediate state of panic. Her diagnosis was ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, which was low grade and low risk. DCIS is not cancer, and would only cause harm if it progresses, yet because the word ""carcinoma"" is used in the label, it often creates panic. To sit across from my patient and see her in a state of complete misery and anxiety once again brought into focus so clearly why it is important to be able to distinguish the variation in this disease. Why should she have to suffer the emotional trauma of thinking she has a fatal disease if that is most likely not the case? Why should she be subjected to invasive procedures unnecessarily? It is heartbreaking to see a woman -- and I have seen it many times -- go through this turmoil when the ability to ease her worries, without compromising her health, could be in our grasp. It is time to redefine the word cancer. The old label is imprecise and engenders needless fear. It can prompt unnecessary treatment, surgery and hospitalization, not to mention the extreme emotional and physical stress that all too often accompanies a breast cancer diagnosis. Medical science has given us marvelous tools for understanding and treating breast cancer, something that can, of course, absolutely be a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. But not all cancers pose the same threat. We need to apply today's advanced understanding of the biology of cancer to our medical practice in ways that benefit our patients and reflect the more precise knowledge we have at our disposal. This is the true essence of personalized or precision medicine. Participating in clinical trials or registries that allow clinicians to adopt less aggressive approaches to in situ or specific types of invasive cancers is one of the best ways to accomplish this. Clinical trials or registries allow women to participate today in what the standard of care will be tomorrow; they make it possible for us to test and document what we learn so that knowledge can inform the future -- and help us differentiate IDLE threats.","Wednesday marks World Cancer Day .

"(CNN) -- Burning the Quran would be an ""outrageous and grave gesture,"" the Vatican said Wednesday, joining a chorus of voices pleading with a small Florida church not to burn Islam's holy book on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Vatican body responsible for dialogue with other religions expressed ""great concern"" about the plan by Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said it would be a ""disrespectful, disgraceful act."" She was speaking Tuesday night at a State Department dinner in honor of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Her statement came a day after the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David Petraeus, warned that the plan ""could cause significant problems"" for American troops overseas. But despite the growing pressure, the pastor of the Florida church, Terry Jones, said Wednesday that ""as of this time we have no intention of canceling."" Jones all week has rebuffed pleas to call off the event, saying radical Islamists are the target of his message. ""The general needs to point his finger to radical Islam and tell them to shut up, tell them to stop, tell them that we will not bow our knees to them,"" Jones said on CNN's ""AC360."" ""We are burning the book,"" Jones said. ""We are not killing someone. We are not murdering people."" Jones announced Wednesday that the church's website provider has ""canceled"" Dove World Outreach Center's accounts, though its website, and another URL for a book written by Jones titled ""Islam is of the Devil,"" were still accessible Wednesday evening. ""We feel that it's definitely an indirect attack on our freedom of speech,"" Jones said, adding that the provider, Rackspace, is ""trying to shut us down."" But he said, ""This is not going to affect the event going forward."" A spokesman for the provider, Rackspace, said the company decided to cancel the center's sites after investigating a complaint and reviewing both sites. The center ""violated the hate-speech provision of our acceptable-use policy,"" said Rackspace spokesman Dan Goodgame. ""This is not a constitutional issue. This is a contract issue,"" said Goodgame, adding that his company had given the center until midnight to find another host and move its content. Goodgame said Rackspace has about 100,000 customers and he did not know how long it had hosted those two specific sites. On Tuesday, Jones said his flock was taking Petraeus' warning seriously but had not decided to cancel the event. Jones told CNN that while his congregation still plans to burn Qurans to protest the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the church is ""weighing"" its intentions. ""We have firmly made up our mind, but at the same time, we are definitely praying about it,"" Jones said on CNN's ""American Morning."" As reaction to the planned event grew Wednesday, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin took to social media outlets, using Twitter to call on Jones to ""please stand down."" On Facebook, Palin wrote that Jones' planned Quran burning ""will feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean-spirited religious intolerance. Don't feed that fire."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is one of the few public officials who defended Jones' right to go ahead, even as he condemned the idea as ""distasteful. ""I don't think he would like if somebody burned a book that in his religion he thinks is holy. ... But the First Amendment protects everybody, and you can't say that we are going to apply the First Amendment to only those cases where we are in agreement,"" Bloomberg said, citing the section of the Constitution that promises freedom of speech. ""If you want to be able to say what you want to say when the time comes that you want to say it, you have to defend others no matter how much you disagree with them,"" Bloomberg said. The planned action has drawn sharp criticism from Muslims around the world and from U.S. officials. The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan condemned it as ""disrespectful, intolerant and divisive,"" in a statement on Wednesday. ""We are deeply concerned about all deliberate attempts to offend members of any religious or ethnic group,"" said Stephen Engelken, the second-ranking diplomat at the embassy. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Tuesday issued a statement saying the U.S. government ""in no way condones such acts of disrespect against the religion of Islam, and is deeply concerned about deliberate attempts to offend members of religious or ethnic groups."" It emphasized that it strongly condemned ""the offensive messages, which are contrary to U.S. government policy and deeply offensive to Muslims especially during the month of Ramadan."" ""Americans from all religious and ethnic backgrounds reject the offensive initiative by this small group in Florida. A great number of American voices are protesting the hurtful statements made by this organization,"" the Afghanistan embassy said. The U.S. ambassador to Iraq, James Jeffrey, issued a joint statement with Lloyd Austin, the commanding general of U.S. forces in Iraq, to condemn the act. ""As this holy month of Ramadan comes to a close and Iraqis prepare to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, we join with the citizens of Iraq and of every nation to repudiate religious intolerance and to respect and defend the diversity of faiths of our fellow man,"" they wrote. With about 120,000 U.S. and NATO-led troops still battling al Qaeda and its allies in the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban movement, Petraeus warned that burning Qurans ""is precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses and could cause significant problems -- not just here, but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the Islamic community."" Lebanese President Michel Suleiman denounced the Quran burning as ""contrary to the teachings of tolerant divine religions and totally incompatible with the logic of dialogue among civilizations, religions and cultures."" Suleiman noted that a United Nations conference on religious tolerance two years ago called on people ""to renounce hatred and intolerance and terrorism,"" and ""to reflect on the Christian teachings and concepts of humanity that emphasizes the love and respect for the other."" Thousands of Indonesians gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Sunday to protest the planned Quran burning. ""The burning is not only an insult to the holy Quran, but an insult to Islam and Muslims around the world,"" said Muhammad Ismail, a spokesman for the hard-line Indonesian Muslim group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population. Jones said his congregation is aware that the action is offensive. ""We realize that this action would indeed offend people, offend the Muslims. I am offended when they burn the flag. I am offended when they burn the Bible. But we feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended."" Jones said Muslims are welcomed in the United States, if they observe the Constitution and don't try to impose Sharia, or Muslim law. The message, he said, is directed toward the ""radical element of Islam."" ""Our message is very clear,"" he said. ""It is not to the moderate Muslim. Our message is not a message of hate. Our message is a message of warning to the radical element of Islam, and I think what we see right now around the globe provides exactly what we're talking about,"" he said. The center says it was founded in 1986 as a ""total concept church for the rich, the poor, the young and the old."" Its purpose is to ""stand up for righteousness and for the truth of the Bible."" It stresses that ""Christians must return to the truth and stop hiding.""","Pastor: ""We have no intention of canceling""

"(CNN)Native Americans often speak of straddling two worlds: the America where pop culture and political gridlock dominate headlines, and a world where the culture of their ancestors lives on through ritual celebrations, language and artisan traditions. It's a tough balance to strike, especially as Native youth leave tribal lands in search of education and career opportunities. Across the nation, members of the nearly 600 federally recognized tribes are working to keep their traditions alive to pass on to the next generation and to show mainstream America that Native culture is a living, breathing entity. Some faces of these efforts are captured in ""Red Road,"" an ongoing photo series by Italian photographer Carlotta Cardana and writer Danielle SeeWalker, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The name ""Red Road"" comes from the Lakota concept of ""the good path"" that should be followed in life, the project's website says: ""The people we've met and photographed all follow this 'Red Road' in some way, rising above to be role models to their people and their way of life."" ""Red Road"" consists of portraits taken in a setting of the subject's choosing and a short biography, showing how each person bridges the gap between modern America and Indian Country. One photo shows 33-year-old Tanksi Morning Star Clairmont, who grew up off the reservation in Denver. She was usually the only Native American in school growing up. She began to embrace her Native identity in high school by performing cultural dances for her classmates. She also learned the Lakota language and rituals from her grandmother and mother, and she continues to share them with her community in Denver, where she works for the American Indian College Fund. Her portrait shows her dressed in hand-beaded regalia in the colors and patterns of the Lakota and Dakota tribes, standing near a river in a park close to her home in Denver. ""I'm proud that we, as Native Americans, can maintain our traditional lifestyle whether we live in the city or on the reservation and that we can be educated and be professionals, too,"" Clairmont said in ""Red Road."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Another photo shows Danielle Finn, a member of the Hunkpapa Lakota tribe, sitting on a pink bedspread in a bedroom of her family's home. If not for her traditional green dress and accessories made by her and mother, the portrait could be mistaken for an image from a decor catalog. A law student in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Finn also represented the Hunkpapa Lakota tribe at the 2014 Miss Indian World pageant. She also visits reservations on behalf of the Center for Native American Youth's ""Champion for Change"" program, discussing topics such as teen pregnancy, alcohol abuse and the importance of Native culture. ""Running in pageants is a way to show you are a leader, be an inspiration to other young Native girls and teach others about your tribe,"" she said. Cardana and SeeWalker met in 1998 while in high school. SeeWalker had just moved to Nebraska from her tribal land in North Dakota, and Cardana was an exchange student. They bonded as the new kids in town over a love for thrift clothes and blue hair, and they became lifelong friends. They decided to pursue a project together in 2013 after Cardana visited SeeWalker and her family on the Standing Rock reservation. The goal was to capture stories that portrayed Native Americans in a positive light to counteract the negative headlines coming out of Indian Country related to substance abuse and poverty. ""We envision this project as a celebration of Native American culture rather than portraying all the misery,"" Cardana said. ""There's a richness of cultural differences among the tribes. We tend to generalize and think of them as just a few tribes, but there's so much more."" Carlotta Cardana is an Italian portrait and documentary photographer based in London.

"A New Mexico man is suing police for allegedly ""subjecting him to multiple digital penetrations and three enemas,"" among other ""shockingly invasive medical procedures"" -- all on an invalid warrant, all without finding any drugs -- his lawyers claim. The lawsuit states that David Eckert, 54, spent more than 12 hours in custody last January at a police station and local hospital after being pulled over for a traffic violation. Yet he was never charged, nor did authorities find illicit substances on him. ""Defendants acted completely outside the bounds of human decency by orchestrating wholly superfluous physical body cavity searches performed by an unethical medical professional,"" states the lawsuit, which was filed earlier this year but has garnered more public attention in recent days. Police in Deming, New Mexico, did not return multiple messages left by CNN on Wednesday seeking their side of the story. The city attorney's office also did not offer an immediate comment after being contacted Wednesday. According to a police affidavit accompanying the lawsuit, a detective asked a different officer to pull over Eckert's 1998 brown Dodge pickup truck for not properly stopping at a stop sign. After Eckert was pulled over, a Deming police officer said that he saw Eckert ""was avoiding eye contact with me,"" his ""left hand began to shake,"" and he stood ""erect (with) his legs together,"" the affidavit stated. Eckert was told he could go home after a third officer issued him a traffic citation. But before he did, Eckert voluntarily consented to a search of him and his vehicle, the affidavit states. A K-9 dog subsequently hit on a spot in the Dodge's driver's seat, though no drugs were found. ""Hildalgo County K-9 officer did inform me that he had dealt with Mr. Eckert on a previous case and stated that Mr. Eckert was known to insert drugs into his anal cavity and had been caught in Hidalgo County with drugs in his anal cavity,"" the affidavit said. While CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, a search of Eckert's criminal history found he's been arrested several times on drug possession charges, though many of those charges were dismissed. Outrage over highway body cavity search . Eckert was then put in ""investigative detention"" and transported around 2 p.m. to the Deming Police Department. Sometime after that, a judge signed off a search warrant ""to include but not limited to his anal cavity."" The next stop was Gila Regional Medical Center, where the lawsuit states ""no drugs were found"" in ""an x-ray and two digital searches of his rectum by two different doctors."" One doctor at this time found nothing unusual in his stool. Three enemas were conducted on Eckert after 10:20 p.m. A chest X-ray followed, succeeded by a colonoscopy around 1:25 a.m. After all this, ""no drugs were found in or on Plaintiff's person,"" according to the lawsuit. Because he ""merely looked nervous during a traffic stop,"" the lawsuit claims that authorities ended up violating Eckert's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures on a number of grounds. One was that ""the language in the warrant was overly broad and, therefore, invalid,"" said the plaintiff, asserting that the chest X-ray and colonoscopy, for instance, weren't related or confined to the ""anal cavity."" Moreover, many of the tests took place outside the 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. timeframe for which any such search warrant (unless otherwise authorized) is legally valid under New Mexico law, according to the lawsuit. ""While the war on drugs has resulted in aggressive government tactics,"" the suit added, ""the Supreme Court has never authorized the seizing of an alleged drug user for forced medical procedures to purge their bodies of drugs.""

"(CNN)Rhinos are coming back to Uganda. The animals, indigenous to the country, were completely wiped out by 1982. Now, thanks to the combined effort of several private and public bodies, they are making a comeback. About 110 miles (177 kilometers) north of the capital Kampala lies the privately own, non-profit Zhiwa Rhino Sanctuary, 7,000 hectares of suitable savannah and native woodlands. Six southern white rhinos were introduced here in 2005. Now there are fifteen. These rhinos are heavily protected. A 2 meter electric fence surrounds the whole 70 square kilometer sanctuary, and the animals themselves are kept under armed guard at all times. A team of about 70 park rangers and guards tracks the herd's movements and follows them around, even at night. To avoid scaring the rhinos or interfering with their lives, the guards use bird-like noises to communicate. Also, keeping quiet is essential to avoid giving away the animals' location. They are entitled to shoot if they encounter armed poachers. So far, none have entered the sanctuary. The original group was composed of four animals from Kenya, bought from the Solio Ranch in the Rift Valley Province, and two from the United States, donated by Walt Disney's Animal Kingdom in Orlando. The first birth was in 2009: the mother was from the U.S. and the father from Kenya, so the calf was called Obama. But the six were evenly split between females and males, which caused a bit of a problem. A group needs more females to allow for a dominant male: the gender balance causes too much fighting. Before they can be reintroduced into the wild, the program needs to reach a minimum of twenty animals, with ideally a five-to-one ratio between cows and bulls. The surrounding land has been ravaged by poachers in the past decades, but it wasn't just the animals suffering. Plants have also been collected to the point of extinction. Locals have used medicinal plants as remedies for various ailments for centuries, but now people are collecting them for commercial gain. And unlike rhino horns, which are used in alternative medicine without any scientific backing whatsoever, some of these plants have been shown to be effective in lab tests, for example in increasing sperm count in mice. Add to that the illegal cutting for firewood, and vegetation is disappearing at an alarming pace, hurting both the land and the local populations who depend on it. It won't be easy to reverse the damage, but identifying the problem is a good way to start. Fixing it will require patience and a coordinated effort. Just like with rhinos, which are coming back to Uganda one calf at a time.","A wildlife sanctuary is bringing rhinos back to Uganda .

"It has three times the horsepower of the average car. It's notoriously difficult to handle, even for professional drivers. And now, it's known as the car actor Paul Walker was riding in when he died. Both Walker and his driving team partner, who was behind the wheel, died after the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT they were in slammed into a pole and burst into flames. Los Angeles County authorities say speed was a factor in the crash and are investigating how fast the exotic car was going. So why is the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT so different from other street cars? Here are five reasons: . 1) It flies on the road . The sports car has a top speed of 208 mph, a very high-revving V10 engine and more than 600 horsepower, said Eddie Alterman, editor-in-chief of Car and Driver magazine. Police rule out 2nd vehicle in Walker crash . ""This was not a car for novices,"" Alterman said. ""Actually, the Carrera GT program began as a racing program."" Todd Trimble, an exotic car mechanic in Las Vegas, said the Carrera GT is a ""very hard car to drive."" ""It's (a) pure racer's car. You really need to know what you're doing when you drive them. And a lot of people are learning the hard way."" 5 things to know about Roger Rodas, who died with Paul Walker . 2) It's incredibly expensive . Brand new, the car costs $450,000. An oil change alone costs $900, Trimble said. 3) The engine is in the middle . Having the engine in the middle of the car means it's more agile and turns more quickly than a car with the engine in the front or in the rear. The Carrera GT is able to change direction ""very quickly, very much like a race car,"" Alterman said. ""It was beyond a super car. It is what we call a hyper car."" 4) It has no stability control . The Carrera GT is also unusual because it has no electronic stability control. That means it's unforgiving with mistakes. ""Stability control is really good at correcting slides, keeping the car from getting out of shape,"" race car driver Randy Pobst said. Pobst coached the actors in the second ""Fast & Furious"" movie -- including Paul Walker. ""Paul was by far the best driver -- a natural car guy,"" he said. Alterman said learning to drive a car like a Carrera GT can be extremely tricky. ""Every car is sort of different. And this one, especially since it had such a hair-trigger throttle, because it changed directions so quickly, there is a lot to learn."" 5) There are only 1,300 of them . Porsche made only about 1,300 Carreras GTs -- and they're disappearing fast. ""They're getting rarer and rarer,"" Trimble said. ""Most of the time, when they do get wrecked, there's not much left of them."" Walker and other stars who died during production .","The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT goes up to 208 mph and has more than 600 horsepower .

"(CNN)The barbaric, elaborately stage-managed video that showed Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh being burned alive was a calculated move by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to weaken the resolve of Jordan and other Sunni Arab powers that have joined the U.S.-led coalition against the terror group. But the early signs indicate the video, which may have been shot a month ago, has had the opposite result, creating a significant backlash from Sunnis in the region. Spreading terror has worked before for ISIS, allowing it to punch above its weight. In the weeks before launching an assault on Mosul, Iraq, in June, the group released a series of gory videos showing the militants brutalizing and killing Iraqi soldiers they had captured. It put the scare in the Iraqi army. When ISIS fighters attacked Mosul, Iraqi soldiers turned and fled despite greatly outnumbering the attackers. Al-Baghdadi was no doubt hoping to pull off the same trick this time. The release of the video to coincide with Jordanian King Abdullah II's visit to the United States may have been deliberate -- the optics of the Jordanian King in Washington served ISIS' narrative of the kingdom being a vassal of the ""Crusaders."" But ISIS appears to have badly miscalculated. Al-Kasasbeh was from a prominent Sunni tribal family in Jordan, and his killing has sparked outrage. And if support in Jordan for King Abdullah's involvement in the anti-ISIS coalition was lukewarm before, it is now red-hot. There has also been outrage across the Sunni Arab world, with the head of Egypt's Al-Azhar University, Sunni Islam's most prestigious center of learning, reportedly calling for ISIS fighters to be crucified. Indeed, while the video has electrified ISIS' most hard-line supporters around the world, and will likely help persuade foreign fighters to join it rather than al Qaeda, it is also likely to shrink its potential pool of recruits. The reality is that burning to death a fellow Muslim is so at odds with mainstream Islamic teaching that even some ISIS sympathizers may have second thoughts. It's a point underscored in November when Sulaimaan Samuel, a mentor in a UK Home Office scheme to prevent radicalization, said ISIS' beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning was putting off young British Muslims from joining the group. In the long run, ISIS' brutality is not a winning strategy, as al Qaeda has recognized. Exactly a year before the release of the video of the Jordanian pilot being burned alive, al Qaeda's general command severed ties to ISIS for its excess brutality and killing of Muslims. In the coming weeks, Jordan is likely to step up its air campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. But its greatest contribution to the anti-ISIS coalition will likely be its significant intelligence gathering capabilities in those two countries, which we can expect to be expanded. Jordan intelligence played a key role in gathering intelligence that led to the U.S. airstrike that killed Jordanian ISIS founder Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq in June 2006. Of course, such expanded action carries the risk that ISIS and its supporters will retaliate with attacks in Jordan. The pre-dawn executions of Sajida al-Rishawi, an ISIS female icon who was part of a team that killed almost 60 in hotels in Amman in 2005, and Ziad Karbouli, an al-Zarqawi aide captured in 2006, has deeply angered the group. Plus, Jordan already had a significant home-grown radicalization problem -- as many as 2,000 Jordanians are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight, many with ISIS. Meanwhile, several Jordanian fighters appeared in an ISIS video released last year calling for King Abdullah to be slaughtered. In addition, last summer saw significant pro-ISIS demonstrations in Zarqa (al-Zarqawi's birthplace near Amman) and Ma'an (a southern desert tribal town) by extremists excited by ISIS' declaration of an Islamic caliphate. Altogether, there are an estimated 9,000 pro-jihadi extremists in the kingdom, according to The Associated Press, and analysts fear that number is growing due to high unemployment and other socioeconomic problems that are creating a fertile atmosphere for recruitment. Another worry is the presence of extremists among the 620,000 Syrian refugees who have fled to Jordan. All that said, the picture in Jordan is not all gloomy -- its overwhelmingly Sunni population at least has meant there is relatively little sectarian tension. And the brutal burning to death of one of their own has also mobilized Jordan's conservative tribes against ISIS. But in taking the fight to ISIS and its supporters inside and outside the kingdom, one thing is clear -- King Abdullah will need every ally he can get.","Paul Cruickshank: Video of Jordanian pilot being burned alive a calculated move .

"Cory Booker raised an eye-popping $4.6 million over the past three months for his bid in the New Jersey special election for the U.S. Senate. The Newark mayor's cash haul that was announced Thursday is the latest example of the skyrocketing costs of winning election or re-election to Congress. Last year, winning Senate candidates spent an average of $10.3 million, according to the latest edition of Vital Statistics on Congress, which was released this week. That's a 62% increase, adjusted for inflation, since 1986. The report indicates that it took, on average, $1.6 million to win a House seat in 2012, a 344% increase since 1986. That increase is dwarfed by spending of outside independent groups, especially following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010. That ruling removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections. Senate insiders look outside as they run for re-election . Outside groups spent $457 million on Senate and House races in 2012, according to the report, compared to $9 million in 1986. In 1978, such groups spent only $303,000 to influence Senate and House elections. ""The most striking to me is the explosion in outside spending,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute, which contributed to the report. ""The numbers for (political action committees) become a surrogate for the huge amounts outside what candidates and parties spend themselves. So for House Republicans, the nightmare is the Club for Growth (an independent fiscal conservative group) spending big money to challenge incumbents like Mike Simpson from the right, meaning the party is pulled even further to the right,"" Ornstein said. ""And for all incumbents, the fear of an alien predator individual or group parachuting in behind the lines in the final two weeks of the campaign with a multimillion dollar ad blitz means they spend even more precious hours doing call time to raise money,"" he added. But the report, which uses Federal Election Commission data compiled by the non-partisan Campaign Finance Institute, indicated that incumbents in both the House and Senate, not surprisingly, tended to outspend their challengers. But the fund-raising disparity was far more pronounced in House races. On average, House incumbents outspent their rivals $1.7 million to $587,000, a ratio of almost a 3-1. Incumbent senators spent on average $10.7 million compared to $7.2 million for challengers. Challengers narrowed the spending gap with incumbents in competitive House races but not by much. Incumbents who were re-elected with less than 60% of the vote raised on average $2.3 million in the 2012 cycle, slightly more than double the $929,000 spent on average by their challengers. Incumbents re-elected in competitive Senate races still outspent their rivals but by a much narrower gap of $12.8 million to $10.1 million. The report also shows that outspending opponents did not necessarily guarantee victory. House incumbents who lost their re-election bids in 2012 on average spent more than their challengers -- $3.1 million to $2.5 million.","Spending on winning Senate races has increased 62% in 2012 dollars since 1986 .

"A young Sri Lankan woman has been beheaded with a sword in a small, dusty town in Saudi Arabia, thousands of miles from the lush jungles and idyllic beaches of the country where she grew up. Rizana Nafeek arrived in Saudi Arabia in 2005 and spent her first few weeks in Saudi Arabia working as a housemaid to earn money to support her relatives back home who had been displaced by the massive tsunami in the Indian Ocean the year before. She then spent the next seven years in Saudi jails as she was accused, charged, convicted and sentenced to death in the killing of her employers' 4-month-old son. Authorities executed her Wednesday in Dawadmi, about 200 kilometers west of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. CNN iReport: Share your views . The family said she had strangled the boy, Kayed bin Nayef bin Jazyan al-Otaibi, after being asked to bottle-feed him. Nafeek said the infant accidentally choked on milk. She found herself plunged into the unfamiliar, unfriendly and -- according to many human rights advocates -- unfair Saudi legal system. Read more: Sri Lanka appeals to Saudi king to spare maid's life . In cases where the death penalty is possible, ""defendants are rarely allowed formal representation by a lawyer and in many cases are kept in the dark about the progress of legal proceedings against them,"" Amnesty International says. Nonetheless, human rights groups and the Sri Lankan government lobbied Saudi authorities to release her, or at the very least show some leniency in her complicated case. Read more: Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery' They argued that the courts had failed to take into account Nafeek's birth certificate, which showed she was only 17 at the time of the baby's death in 2005, making her too young to receive the death penalty under international law. The passport she used to enter the country, which said she was 23 at the time, was inaccurate and had been falsified, they said. Additionally, she had not had access to lawyers during her pre-trial interrogation during which she said she was assaulted and forced to sign a confession under duress, rights groups pointed out. Right up until the end, they pointed out that the dead boy's family could still grant Nafeek a pardon or request blood money as compensation. Read more: Saudi support for Syrian rebels shaped by tribal, religious ties . But those arguments and others, as well as numerous visits by Sri Lankan ministers and members of Nafeek's family, failed to sway Saudi authorities. The interior ministry statement announcing the execution began with a verse from the Quran, according to SPA, the official Saudi News agency: ""O ye who believe! the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder."" The death penalty for Nafeek had been approved by the Supreme Court, the agency reported, and a ""high order was issued"" to carry out the sentence. The Sri Lankan government and human rights groups have sharply criticized Saudi Arabian authorities for the beheading of Nafeek. Opinion: Why global labor reforms are vital to protect vulnerable workers . It shows ""once more how woefully out of step they are with their international obligations regarding the use of the death penalty,"" said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program. President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka, who had made personal appeals for clemency in Nafeek's case, said he and his government deplored the decision to go ahead with the execution. Lawmakers in the Sri Lankan parliament observed a minute of silence Wednesday to mourn her death. But her case appears to be far from a one-off occurrence. Many of the people executed in Saudi Arabia in recent years have been foreign citizens, according to Amnesty International, most of them ""migrant workers from poor and developing countries."" In 2012, Amnesty said it had recorded at least 79 executions in the country, 27 of them of foreigners. Saudi Arabia also has a history of carrying out the death penalty on people convicted of committing crimes when they were children, according to Human Rights Watch. ""Rizana was just a child herself at the time of the baby's death, and she had no lawyer to defend her and no competent interpreter to translate her account,"" said  Nisha Varia, senior women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.

As a lawmaker with the ruling United Russia party, he ensured the legislation was first passed in his home city of St. Petersburg before it was adopted across the country. In the past, he has called lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people ""sick"" and ""crazy."" Spotting him on their flight, the two lesbian activists kissed, took a selfie and uploaded it to Instagram. Ksenia Infinity, one of the women in the photo, posted on her Vkontakte page (Russia's version of Facebook) that ""as fate would have it, he was sitting in the row behind us."" She went on to say, ""Milonov didn't say anything. We did a photoshoot with him in the background. When he noticed what we were doing he hid behind his tablet computer. We are very happy. He probably isn't. But who cares!"" Ksenia told CNN that she was ""delighted by the positive global reaction"" to the photo after it went viral on Twitter and was ""liked"" by more than 1,000 people on Instagram. Milonov lashed out at the photographer, saying ""I am tolerant towards all sexual minorities."" He went on to say: ""This shows that these people are not of a normal sexual orientation, but that their sexual deviance shows in all aspects of their lives. I didn't understand what they are doing but they have a nice sense of humor. I also have a good sense of humor. I will perhaps continue this joke by closing their gay club in St. Petersburg, or ban them from having meetings in public places, that's also a funny step."" Milonov is currently working on legislation that would ban marriages in Russia between transgender couples. It comes after two people were able to get married in wedding dresses in St. Petersburg last year because one of them, according to passport information, is a man. At the time, Milonov told CNN that he was working to get the marriage annulled and that the people who allowed it to take place were ""psychologically sick."" He suggested that Irina Shumilova and Alyona Fursova should be committed to a ""mental asylum"" and that gay people who want to get married ""should go to the United States.""","Russian politician behind anti-gay propaganda law pictured in photograph of two women kissing .

"(CNN)Jeb Bush will make his first scheduled appearance this year to the critically important state of Iowa next month for the Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines on March 7. Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, confirmed Wednesday that Bush will attend the event in the Hawkeye State, which holds the first nominating contests in presidential election years. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and real estate titan Donald Trump are also confirmed for the event. Other invited speakers include a range of potential Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Bush's scheduled speaking slot was first reported by the Des Moines Register. The former Florida governor makes his first major public address Wednesday since announcing in December he was actively exploring a presidential bid, though he hasn't officially announced a campaign. He's set to pitch a message at the Detroit Economic Club that he's a ""reform conservative"" and will offer an optimistic view for how to help the middle class. Bush skipped the most recent cattle call in Iowa last month, when close to 10 potential GOP presidential candidates addressed an assembly of core caucus goers in Des Moines. RELATED: Jeb's invisible man strategy . His absence seemed to be welcomed by many activists at the event. He was a frequent punching bag for some of the speakers — Donald Trump said to big applause: ""The last thing we need is another Bush"" — and the former governor's push for Common Core education standards was an even bigger target that day. New Hampshire State Rep. Bill O'Brien blasted the idea of ""nominating a liberal supporter of Common Core because he has a familiar name."" A recent Iowa poll also showed troubling signs for Bush. He garnered 8% support among likely Republican caucus goers, falling behind Scott Walker at 15%, Rand Paul at 14%, Mike Huckabee at 10% and Ben Carson at 9%. The Hawkeye State is already seeing a range of potential candidates making stops in the state. Sen. Rand Paul will be there on Friday and Saturday for an ""Audit the Fed"" rally and to attend an Iowa State University basketball game. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie speaks at a Dallas County GOP event in Iowa on Monday. CNN's Jeremy Diamond and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Former Florida Gov.

"(CNN)I have never bothered Harper Lee, although I have had endless chances. Many times, I've looked across the broom sage behind my parents' Alabama home toward the town where she lives, and I have wondered: What is she up to? Why has one of America's most cherished authors fallen so silent for so long? So the latest news landed like a thunderclap in my Twitter feed: She has a new book. Readers have waited for those words almost my entire life. Lee's first novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" came out in 1960 as the nation was rising into the Civil Rights era. Her story of a young girl named Scout, her wise father, Atticus, and the racially charged events in fictitious Maycomb, Alabama, resonated widely. A hit movie followed, and over the decades, 30 million copies of the book sold worldwide. The new book will continue the story of Scout ""some 20 years later"" according to a release from the HarperCollins. Oddly, this sequel was written before ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" A quote from Lee on the publisher's website says, ""In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called 'Go Set a Watchman.' It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman, and I thought it a pretty decent effort. ""My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel from the point of view of the young Scout. I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told."" The manuscript for ""Go Set a Watchman,"" she says, was unexpectedly rediscovered and ""after much thought and hesitation, I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years."" She is not alone in her amazement. Shortly after ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" rose to fame, the author took flight from the public eye. Why? No one really knew. Some speculated that bad feelings had boiled up over rumors that her longtime friend, Truman Capote, had played a strong role in crafting the story. Others wondered whether fame was just too much to bear. But everyone waited for her next novel. And waited. And waited. And when it did not come after years, then decades, most assumed it never would. Then they assumed worse. When I graduated from high school in 1978, I lived in that house with my parents not far from Lee's home in Monroeville, Alabama. I could have hopped into my Chevy Biscayne, driven an hour and knocked on her door. But like a great many other Americans, I had no idea she was alive. My mother didn't either, although she is almost the same age as Lee, and her own childhood down a red dirt road could have been a missing chapter in the famous novel. My mother even recalls her older brother, James, telling her back when Lee's story was published that ""a woman from Monroeville wrote a book,"" as if he were mentioning a school classmate. Lee, who is now 88, has often been described as reclusive. That is not the right word. She has emerged now and then to accept awards. For many years, she shuttled between a home in New York City and Monroeville, keeping an active and lively circle of family and friends. She just didn't speak to the press. She didn't ""do"" public appearances much. And, by all accounts, she did not want to talk about her famous book. She essentially told all who asked that the work spoke for itself. What's more, her circle helped guard her privacy. Charles Shields wrote a compelling, unauthorized biography called ""Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee,"" and he noted the many ways in which people close to her tried to shoo him off the subject. Nonetheless, I thought repeatedly over the years that I should try to score the impossible interview. A close friend had a connection to the arts community in Monroeville; maybe he could open a line of communication. Perhaps a series of nice letters would do the trick. Or maybe I should just wander up as Harper Lee tended her flowers, and say ""Hi, my family's home is over near Dozier. I went to school at Opp. Can we share a glass of iced tea?"" I never did. I knew she wanted to be left alone, and the Southern manners with which I'd been raised -- the same she grew up with -- kept me away. And unless she suddenly announces a return to public life with this new novel, out of respect I will continue to keep my distance. And I suspect I will read this new novel at arm's length, too. Not merely because my own vision has faded a bit through all the waiting, but also because she has surely grown larger in my imagination than any human can actually be. Her talent has been magnified in the public eye by years of unbroken focus on a single, spectacular piece of writing. Follow-ups to greatness so rarely work out as we hope. So, like Boo Radley, I am eager to peek into Scout's world again, but I will do so from behind a half-pulled curtain, timidly, for fear of what I might see -- and for fear of scaring the mockingbird off once more.","CNN's Tom Foreman grew up not so terribly far from Harper Lee in Alabama .
Like many others, he spent most of his life hoping and waiting for another novel from the publicity-shy author ."
"(CNN)We're days past that little football game Sunday in Arizona, and it keeps trending like crazy on Facebook, which makes sense. Even if you don't know a kicking tee from the 50-yard line, you know Super Bowl XLIX was the site of the worst coaching decision in the history of professional sports, one that kept the Seattle Seahawks from consecutive NFL titles. There is more. As of Wednesday afternoon, both the New England Patriots and the Seahawks were generating nearly 1,000 tweets per hour, and remember: This is happening in the Twitter world, where stuff that occurred five minutes ago already is ancient news. Then there was Patriots coach Bill Belichick taking time away Wednesday from his team's victory parade in Boston to give his thoughts on the subject. Why not? The rest of the universe is doing the same. The agony of defeat always trumps the thrill of victory when it comes to tugging at the soul. The Patriots didn't win Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. The Seahawks lost. For verification, there are a bunch of hash tags to prove it. During a 24-hour-period through Tuesday evening, there were 400 tweets per hour about the Patriots capturing a fourth Lombardi Trophy. They did so with their familiar tandem of Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, the designated All-American boy with the supermodel wife. Yeah, well, during that same time frame, there were 2,800 tweets per hour about the Seahawks. It's just more interesting to contemplate how the Seahawks blew a Super Bowl victory in the final seconds despite sitting inches away from a game-winning touchdown. They got that close to scoring after a catch that would make The Flying Wallendas envious. Moments later, Seattle's offensive brain trust of head coach Pete Carroll and coordinator Darrell Bevell did their own high-wire act without a net. They decided to throw the ball into the end zone instead of giving it to explosive running back Marshawn Lynch, who basically was low risk. The ball was intercepted, and early during the afterward, I began thinking: ""I haven't seen this much grief up close and personal after a brutal loss in 23 years."" Back then, when tweets were only done by birds, the Atlanta Braves shocked the Pittsburgh Pirates with a rally out of nowhere in the bottom of the ninth inning to snatch the 1992 National League pennant. Sid Bream forgot he was the slowest man in baseball to score the game-winning run from second base at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium after he slid underneath a throw by Gold Glove left fielder Barry Bonds. The Pirates clubhouse was a morgue. Hours later, when I finished writing for the night, I peeked inside the place for a final time. It was empty -- except for Pirates center fielder Andy Van Slyke sitting motionless on a stool in the middle of the room, staring a hole into the floor. There also was 1981, when I stood among those rubbing their eyes in Dayton, Ohio, as tiny St. Joseph used the last seconds to shove No.1-ranked DePaul out of the first round of the NCAAA basketball tournament.  With tears flowing across his big face, DePaul star player Mark Aguirre ran out of the arena into the snowy afternoon. He walked all the way back to the team hotel, and I followed him for part of his journey. When I returned, DePaul coach Ray Meyer, who was nearly 70, eased outside of his locker room, sighing heavily before reporters and looking ready to collapse any moment. The Seahawks locker room was a little of those Pirates, a little of those DePaul Blue Demons and a lot of something else: Pure anger. I was among the few reporters in the Seahawks locker room from the time it opened until we were asked to leave about an hour later. In between, I saw Seahawks players ignore protocol in these situations. Instead of saying the Earth is flat and their offensive brain trust knew what it was doing near the end, they ripped that nonrunning play like the rest of us. On one side of the Seahawks locker room, there was wide receiver Doug Baldwin blasting at will (""All of us are surprised""), and on the other side, there was somebody else, and then somebody else. ""I don't understand how you don't give (the ball) to the best back in the league, on not even the one-yard line,"" said linebacker Bruce Irvin, with the body language of a guy trying to recover from the flu after getting smacked by a semi. Across the way, as teammates grumbled in and out of the shower, defensive backs Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas were more depressed than Irvin, especially Thomas. They sat frozen in their seats for the longest time, resembling this generation's Van Slyke in my world. It could be worse. It's not as if they are this century's Bill Buckner and Everson Walls. To hear Buckner tell it, it took him nearly two decades to forgive Red Sox fans for cursing his name through the years after his gaffe during the 1986 World Series. Walls was a star defensive back in 1981 for the Dallas Cowboys. Even so, he still is tormented by The Catch, which was Joe Montana throwing that miracle pass over his head to Dwight Clark to push the San Francisco 49ers into the Super Bowl. At one point, quarterback Russell Wilson, who threw the interception, dropped by to console Sherman and Thomas. Then came Carroll with a few words, but nothing helped. Sherman and Thomas just sat there, thinking, hurting, wondering when this nightmare would end. Apparently not as long as it keeps trending. Which looks like forever.","Days after the Super Bowl, the chatter about the losing play goes on.

"(CNN)Former cycling champ Lance Armstrong struck two parked vehicles as he drove home from a night of partying but wasn't charged until his longtime girlfriend said she wasn't behind the wheel, according to police in Aspen, Colorado. Armstrong, 43, was cited for two misdemeanors: Duty to report accidents and exceeding the safe speed for conditions, police said. Police served a summons on Armstrong through his lawyer so Armstrong was not questioned by police or quoted in the police report. The same charges had been filed against his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, 33, but were dropped after she admitted lying, the police report said. No other charges were filed. When asked if Armstrong persuaded her to take the blame, Hansen said, according to the police report: ""No, that was a joint decision and um, you know we've had our family name smeared over every paper in the world in the last couple of years and ... I thought, 'Gosh, Anna Hansen hit some cars, it's not going to show up in the papers, but Lance Armstrong hit some cars, it's going to be a national story.' "" The arrest is another embarrassing incident for Armstrong, who fell from grace after being one of the world's most revered and inspirational athletes. Armstrong recovered from a near-fatal bout of testicular cancer and went on to win seven Tour de Frances, raising millions for cancer research and making millions for himself. But rumors he used performance-enhancing drugs dogged him for years. In 2012, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency filed a report alleging Armstrong was at the center of a doping program during his heyday in cycling -- something Armstrong had always denied. After he stopped contesting the doping allegations, Armstrong was stripped of his Tour de France titles and Olympic cycling medal. He went on Oprah Winfrey's television network and admitted he doped and had lied about it. He was sued and lost endorsements. Hansen told police she drove an SUV home from an art museum party the night of December 28 because ""Lance had a little bit to drink,"" the report said. She said she lost control on a snowy street, hit two parked vehicles, parked around the corner and provided contact information to the people renting the vehicles, the report said. She told them she and Armstrong would pay for the damage and drove home, the report said. Police talked to her the next day and got her side of the story. The officer was suspicious of Hansen's story and talked to a car valet at the museum, who said Armstrong drove away that night, the report said. On December 31, Hansen talked to police again, this time with her lawyer, and changed her story to say Armstrong was the driver. When the officer asked if Armstrong was intoxicated, as she earlier indicated, Hansen said, according to the report: ""He was not intoxicated, and that was um, you know, I'm sorry I lied to you that morning but I was trying to make it sound like, well, I was driving because that was just, I don't know, I'm not in the habit of lying in general and especially not to police officers so, I don't know, I was just trying to make something up at that time."" She said Armstrong is ""prepared to admit driving the car and accept responsibility for the crash,"" the report said. Armstrong is scheduled to appear in Pitkin County Court on March 17.","Aspen, Colorado, police cite former cycling champ Lance Armstrong with two traffic offenses .

"Two people have been killed and 45 others were wounded when clashes broke out during anti-government protests in Thailand's capital, an official said. Pornthep Saeheng, from the city's Erawan emergency center, gave CNN the updated toll -- which was double the number reported on Saturday, when the violence occurred. At least one of those killed was a university student who was shot inside Ramkhmhaeng University, according to a spokesman for the center. The incident occurred on the same day that 2,000 members of the armed forces were called in to protect government buildings after demonstrators stormed a number of them, according to Lt. Gen. Paradon Pattanathabut. Saturday's violence came after weeks of heightened tensions. On Friday, hundreds of protesters stormed army headquarters in Bangkok to demand help overthrowing the government led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Yingluck's critics accuse her of being the puppet of her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecommunications tycoon and former premier who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Yingluck denied that charge in an interview with CNN's Anna Coren on Friday. Yingluck survived a no-confidence vote in parliament Thursday. ""The government is ready to open a space for dialogue,"" the embattled prime minister said in a brief televised statement after the vote. She added that officials were willing to ""listen to all voices of people, including those who are still occupying the governmental offices."" But a spokesman for Yingluck's Pheu Thai Party said she would not resign or dissolve the parliament. ""She will stay in power,"" Prompong Nopparit said. Thaksin was a polarizing figure who was removed from power by the military in 2006, while he was in New York. Except for a brief return in 2008, he has lived in exile since. Thai courts have convicted him of corruption and sentenced him in absentia to two years in prison. Courts have also frozen billions of dollars of his assets, but he is believed to still have a great deal of money held elsewhere. On Monday, protesters in Bangkok stormed the finance ministry building and converted it into a command center. The protests started as a response to a government-backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to Thaksin Shinawatra and opened the door for his return to Thailand. The Thai senate rejected the bill on November 11, but opposition demonstrators have called since then for Yingluck's government to be replaced. At various points during the past few days, demonstrators have surrounded the foreign ministry, the agriculture ministry and the interior ministry. Yingluck had said authorities will ""absolutely not use violence"" to disperse the demonstrators. But the situation is delicate after Thai police issued an arrest warrant against protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. On Thursday, protesters pulled down electricity wires to the National Police Headquarters. The protests evoke the 2010 clashes in Bangkok between security forces and Thaksin supporters who demanded his return. Some 90 people, many of them civilians, were killed.","The death toll is double what was reported the day earlier .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)Shelling in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday killed four people, as fighting damaged a hospital and schools, local officials said. The deaths occurred at a hospital in Kirov district in Donetsk, the city council there said. The shelling damaged area schools, including a kindergarten. Kirov district was left without power. Wednesday's deaths are the result of a worsening conflict between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Civilians increasingly are falling victim, with at least 224 killed and more than 540 injured in the final three weeks of January, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said Tuesday. As the situation deteriorates, the United States is considering sending lethal aid to help the Ukrainian government fend off attacks from pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This assistance would come in the form of so-called defensive lethal aid, which could include antitank, antiaircraft and counter-artillery systems.","Four deaths at a hospital in Kirov district in Donetsk, city officials say .

"(CNN)I am American. Italian-American. Or maybe I'm American-Italian or an American of Italian descent. Nah, I'm Italian-American. It's how I was raised to think of myself, even though I was born in the most American of cities, Canton, Ohio. In 1920, a group of men meeting in downtown Canton founded the National Football League. What's more American than that? In that same year, the number of Italian immigrants living in Northeast Ohio exploded. Some 60,000 Italians called this most American of states home, including my Grandma and Grandpa Costello. And the Recchios on my mother's side. I am Italian as far back as the ""proverbial they"" can trace. And I was raised to be proud of it. I grew up dancing the tarantella and doing the hustle, fearing the malocchio and the monster under my bed, playing the morra and diving for baseballs, and arguing for no good reason at all. As Grandma Costello always told us, ""Never forget where you came from."" She insisted on that, even though only two of her nine children and dozens of grandchildren were born in Italy. Didn't matter. That's how she felt, and that's how we felt. But not everyone agrees. Ever since Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal proclaimed he's not a ""hyphenated American,"" as in ""Indian-American,"" the debate over ""who is us"" has grown more heated. Like many immigrants today, my grandparents came to America not because they fell in love with American culture, but because they were desperate to escape poverty. My Grandpa, Vincenzo Costello, fought for the United States in World War I so he could become an American citizen. Keep in mind that in the early 1900s, Italians were not the beloved paesanos they are today. They were ridiculed for their dark skin, for practicing Catholicism, and don't even get me started on the Mafia thing. Even Joe DiMaggio could not escape ridicule. A 1939 Life magazine article described the Yankee great's heritage like this, ""Instead of olive oil or smelly bear grease, he keeps his hair slick with water. He never reeks of garlic. ..."" In spite of that, Grandpa Costello grew to love America. My grandmother did, too, but she also desperately missed ""the Old Country."" She used to tell my Aunt Nancy that she couldn't bear to visit Italy because she would want to stay there. That didn't make her un-American. She loved her Italian heritage, but she also loved America. So we embraced the rich culture of there and here and developed a strong sense of identity that so many in this country yearn to hold on to. ""I grew up telling people I was American,"" Chun Yee Yip O'Neill, a native New Yorker who works for the city's Museum of Chinese in America, told me. She added, ""But, people were not satisfied with that answer. So, when I went to college, I said, wait a minute, they don't see me as American, so I'll call myself Chinese-American."" The current exhibition at the museum explores Chinese-American identity. O'Neill agreed to talk to me about her personal beliefs. She told me, ""I feel very strongly about keeping customs. Leaving a legacy. Especially since I became a mother. My husband is British, we grapple with identity all the time. Is our daughter a global citizen? Where does she fit in?"" The new ABC sitcom, ""Fresh Off the Boat,"" premiering Wednesday night, will explore similar identity issues. Like the comedy, ""Black-ish,"" and the coming PBS documentary, ""The Italian Americans,"" it will delve into how much cultural diversity should matter when it comes to being American. In ""Fresh Off the Boat,"" the story centers around a Taiwanese Chinese immigrant family who moves from Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown to mostly white Orlando, Florida. It's based on Chef Eddie Huang's 2013 memoir of the same name. The 11-year-old star of ""Fresh Off the Boat,"" Hudson Yang, told me his character, Eddie, wants to ""prove he can be part of the group, that he's the same as anybody else,"" despite the fact his parents are Asian. In real life, Yang said, he thinks ""being Asian is cool,"" but added, ""I don't really care if I was any other race. It wouldn't matter to me."" It's a sentiment that makes me both happy and a little sad. Eric Liu, who wrote ""A Chinaman's Chance,"" a book about his own cultural identity, would most likely agree. ""This idea that we're a melting pot, to me it's the wrong metaphor,"" Liu told me. ""We're not just thrown into this pot and cooked together and we all come out together the same beige-brown-blob. That's not what happens. What happens is that all of these influences get thrown together, woven together, and hybrids get made. Little hybrids of Italian and Jewish and Chinese and African-American identities and styles ... get meshed together. And we're hardly conscious of it because we're in it. It's like water to fish."" Like water to fish. I would guess my youngest cousins will have no idea what Liu means. But, I do. And I'm glad.","Carol Costello: I am proud to be Italian-American .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Hanna moved through the Bahamas on Thursday and headed toward the Carolina coast with 65 mph winds, the National Hurricane Center said. Forecasters predicted a slight strengthening of the storm, warning there was a possibility it may be a Category 1 hurricane when it hits the U.S. mainland. Water fills the streets of Gonaives, Haiti, on Wednesday after heavy rains from Tropical Storm Hanna. Hanna may make landfall near the North Carolina-South Carolina state line late Friday night or early Saturday morning, the hurricane center said. Both states, as well as Georgia, have activated their emergency centers ahead of the storm, and North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley declared a state of emergency. ""It now appears Hanna will be a Category 1 hurricane when it hits the North Carolina coast early Saturday morning,"" Easley said in a news release. ""Since the exact path is uncertain, everyone who lives in the coastal counties needs to be ready."" South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford urged the voluntary evacuation of two northeast counties, Horry and Georgetown, as the storm approached. ""The suggestion is for people to look at this storm and make their own decisions,"" he said. ""Every one of us needs to continue to watch out in the Atlantic because this could be a dress rehearsal for a thing called Ike,"" he said, referring to Hurricane Ike, a Category 4 storm spinning in the central Atlantic, hundreds of miles from the U.S. coastline. ""Time will tell,"" Sanford said. Hanna was about 540 miles south of Wilmington, North Carolina, at 11 p.m. ET Thursday, according to the hurricane center. A hurricane watch was in effect from north of Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to Currituck Beach Light, including Pamlico Sound.  See Hanna's projected path » . The hurricane center's advisory said wind and rain from Hanna would reach the U.S. coast well before the center of the storm and that dangerous riptides were expected to increase along the coast.  Watch what Hanna, Ike and Josephine are doing » . Hanna caused massive flooding in Haiti when it pummeled the Caribbean nation earlier this week, killing 137 people, a government official said Thursday. Rescue workers are trying to get aid to affected victims of the storm, said Abel Nazaire, the assistant coordinator of Risk and Disaster Management. Another 79 people were killed in Haiti by Hurricane Gustav last week, said Louis Pinchinat, deputy director of Haiti's Civil Protection Directorate. On Wednesday, Haitian President Rene Preval appealed for international help in the wake of ""catastrophic"" flooding, Nazaire said. As Hanna approached the East Coast, Charleston, South Carolina, prepared for the worst. Workers started boarding up buildings Wednesday, and firefighters filled sandbags and distributed them to residents and business owners. Backup generators were being gassed up and positioned at key locations around the city. ""We will continue until we know we're totally out of the woods,"" Charleston spokeswoman Barbara Vaughn said. Cathy Haynes, Charleston County's director of emergency operations, said county schools will be closed Friday. ""We'd also like to encourage residents that either live in low-lying areas or mobile homes, or if they just feel vulnerable to the situation at hand, to maybe move to safer locations,"" she said. Jennifer Moses, a resident of Charleston's Daniel Island, said she was ready for whatever came. ""I filled up the gas can, I have water, I have peanut butter, and I took the rocking chairs off the front porch,"" she said. Charleston sits on a peninsula between two rivers and is extremely prone to flooding. Recent downpours from the remnants of Tropical Storm Fay left a foot and a half of water on some streets. But the city hasn't had a mandatory evacuation since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Traffic then was so congested that it took up to 19 hours to drive inland to Columbia, usually a two-hour trip. At Parris Island, South Carolina, hundreds of Marines graduated Thursday morning from basic training -- a day earlier than planned because the base didn't want Hanna to cause problems for families coming to the celebration, Master Sgt. Mark Oliva said. However, Oliva said the base's emergency center was standing down, as the storm's track seemed to put Parris Island out of harm's way. Meanwhile, Hurricane Ike, still hundreds of miles from the islands of the Caribbean, was a powerful Category 4 hurricane on Thursday.  Its winds had dropped slightly, to 135 mph, but the center said Ike was still ""extremely dangerous.""  iReport.com: Bracing for Hanna and Ike .

"(CNN) -- Syrian soldiers working to retake a rebellious northern town killed, wounded and arrested members of ""armed terrorist groups"" operating in the region, state media reported Saturday. This development unfolded as Syrian troops on Friday afternoon came to the entrances of the city, Jisr Al-Shugur, in an operation ""to restore security and tranquility to the area which was being terrorized by armed terrorist groups,"" the Syrian Arab News Agency reported. This military offensive took place amid anti-government protests raging across Syria for nearly three months, outpourings that have led to violent security crackdowns on demonstrators. Syria's Bashar al-Assad regime has consistently blamed what it calls armed gangs for the bloodshed over the last three months. But activists and protesters say security forces have caused the violence. The Syrian government announced it would punish Jisr Al-Shugur after it accused ""armed groups"" of killing at least 120 security forces there several days ago. Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey disputed that claim, saying some of the soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves. The military advance spread panic throughout the civilian population, and residents said they had evacuated women and children from Jisr Al-Shugur in recent days. More than 3,800 Syrians have fled to Turkey, the Anatolia news agency reported. In the nearby town of Maaret al-Nouman on Friday, Syrian security forces and helicopters advancing toward Jisr Al-Shugur sprayed automatic weapons fire into a crowd of thousands of protesters demonstrating after Friday prayers. As the army reached Jisr Al-Shugur, it ""arrested a large number of the armed terrorist group members and killed and wounded a number of them, despite the fact that these groups resorted to setting up traps using dynamites stolen from Wadi Abyad dam area,"" SANA reported, citing Syrian TV. The military confiscated machine guns, explosive devices, detonators and Turkish SIM cards from those arrested, state TV reported on Saturday. ""Cameramen and reporters"" were ambushed at the entrance of Jisr Al-Shugur ""after they came under heavy fire by the terrorist armed gangs."" It said the journalists were doing well and there were no casualties. ""The army managed to foil the armed groups' attempts to besiege the grain silos in the area. The group had threatened to burn crops and any vehicle that attempts to transport groups to the silos,"" SANA reported. Protests spread across Syria on Friday and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 25 people were killed in various locations, including 11 in Maaret al-Nouman. Amnesty International said it believes that more than 1,100 people have been killed in the three-lcrackdown, including 82 children. Every Friday for weeks, anti-government marches have been organized after Muslim prayers.

"(CNN)Sen. Rand Paul may be blaming the ""liberal media"" for the recent controversy over his comments about vaccinations, but the right-leaning editorial board of the Wall Street Journal published a blistering opinion piece published in Wednesday's edition on the Kentucky Republican's skepticism. ""He will have to avoid these libertarian dormitory passions if he wants to be a credible candidate,"" the editorial says, adding that government requirements for vaccinating school children is ""a legitimate use of state 'police powers' under the Constitution."" Paul, who's moving toward a presidential bid, caused a stir when he said Monday that he's ""heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.""

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, also a potential presidential contender, kicked things off when he told reporters Monday that ""parents need to have some measure of choice"" in determining whether to vaccinate their children, though he personally endorsed the idea. Paul said he's also in favor of getting vaccinated, but his comments -- especially as a physician -- lent credibility to conspiracy theories that vaccinations can do severe damage. ""Mr. Paul is an ophthalmologist, so he should know he was broadcasting misinformation,"" the Wall Street Journal editorial states. His office did not return a request for comment about the editorial. RELATED: O'Reilly slams Rand Paul for 'naive' foreign policy, measles . The piece acknowledges that in rare cases vaccines can lead to ""deafness, seizures, comas or brain damage,"" but the Centers for Disease Control says those results are ""so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine."" The Wall Street Journal also notes that President Obama and Hillary Clinton also expressed skepticism over the safety of vaccines back in 2008. Both, however, offered support for vaccines this past week. ""Let's chalk up the weird science of Messrs. Paul and Christie to a lack of information, and we're happy to send them 13 years of vaccine editorials if they want to study up,"" the editorial later says.  The not-so-great measles vaccine debate of 2015 is one of those events that makes us wonder if there is such a thing as human progress."" On Tuesday Paul tried to clarify his comments, saying he wasn't arguing causation but saying vaccinations and mental disorders ""were temporally related"" ""I support vaccines, I receive them myself and I had all of my children vaccinated,"" he added in a statement. ""In fact today, I received the booster shot for the vaccines I got when I went to Guatemala last year.""","The Wall Street Journal likens Rand Paul's thoughts on vaccinations to ""libertarian dormitory passions""

"Ladies: I know you've heard the news that some doctors think you should just say no to your annual pelvic exam. ""Doctors are examining your genitals for no reason"" and ""Skip the stirrups"" were just a few of the headlines that followed last week's report from the American College of Physicians. But before you hop out of those stirrups, listen to what happened to this woman. She went in for her yearly checkup, and the gynecologist did a regular pelvic exam -- one hand in her vagina, one hand on top of her belly -- and it was unusually painful. The doctor felt some inflammation and sent the patient for an ultrasound. More testing found pre-cancerous polyps in her colon, which she promptly had removed. The patient was in her late 40s and wouldn't have started regular colonoscopies until she was 50, so her pelvic exam caught the pre-cancerous condition early. ""I feel like my astute gynecologist saved my life,"" the patient told me. And this patient knows a few things about medicine: she's Dr. Julie Gerberding, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So if pelvic exams can find bad things, why did the American College of Physicians recommend doctors skip them? This group of internal medicine doctors -- they're not gynecologists -- said that while there may be some success stories, those are merely anecdotes. The group said there are no actual studies showing pelvic exams help women, and it believes the exams could actually hurt them. As someone with a master's degree in public health, this made sense to me. But since my own annual exam is coming up, I decided to take a closer look. My conclusion: the American College of Physicians has made some judgments based on some very thin research. So I am going to continue getting my exams. Here's why: . During a pelvic exam the doctor inserts a speculum to open the vagina and look inside for things that shouldn't be there, such as growths on the cervix. If you're due for a Pap smear, the doctor will do one at this point in the exam. Since the doctor can't see the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries, he or she then removes the speculum and inserts two gloved fingers into the vagina and places the other hand on the lower abdomen to feel for abnormalities, such as inflammation, tumors or cysts. Doctors have been doing this exam on women with no gynecological symptoms for as long as anyone can remember. There are plenty of studies showing the Pap smear saves lives, but does a visual and manual inspection do any good? The American College of Physicians looked and didn't find a single study that assessed whether routine pelvic exams save lives or make women healthier. ""I don't want to do an exam that doesn't have any documented benefit,"" said Dr. Hanna Bloomfield, who, with funding from the Veterans Health Administration, reviewed the medical literature for the American College of Physicians. I get it, but just because no one's ever sat down and studied these exams doesn't mean they're useless -- it just means no one's studied them. So I called up a handful of gynecologists to ask if they'd ever made any great saves like Gerberding's gynecologist. While the catches might not be as dramatic, they've all caught bad stuff women wouldn't have known about otherwise: warts on a woman's cervix; HPV lesions that could have spread to a sexual partner; benign ovarian cysts that weren't painful but could twist and rupture; and, on occasion, they found ovarian cancer. That left me thinking I do want this exam, unless it causes me too much harm. The American College of Physicians says ""physical harms may include urinary tract infections."" Yikes, I don't want a urinary tract infection. But what's the evidence that this actually happens? Strangely, the organization's guidelines didn't give any, so I called Dr. Amir Qaseem, the lead author. He told me he got his information from the evidence report written by Bloomfield, but when I looked at that report, there was nothing. So I gave Bloomfield a call. ""The data about urinary tract infections is bad data, so I didn't include it in the final version of my report,"" she said. ""I don't know why they put that in the guidelines."" The past president of the American College of Physicians, Dr. Molly Cooke, says, both as a doctor and a patient, urinary tract infection doesn't  ""figure into my benefit/harms calculus."" Okay, I thought to myself: If the former president of the American College of Physicians isn't worried, I won't be either. So what should I worry about? Unnecessary surgery, according to the college. Sometimes your doctor will do a pelvic exam and see or feel something that they think is worrisome but is actually a big nothing, and you have surgery you didn't need. That sounds legitimate. But again, where's the evidence? The American College of Physicians cites one study. That study, done in Greece, looked at 174 healthy women whose doctors found something worrisome on their pelvic exams. These women had more testing, and doctors decided to do laparoscopic surgery on 31 of them. Ovarian cancer was found in two of these women, so the American College of Physicians concluded that the other 29 had ""unnecessary"" surgery. There are two problems with this conclusion. One, while these women didn't have ovarian cancer, during the surgery doctors did find other things, such as benign ovarian cysts, that were removed. Maybe this was unnecessary. Or maybe it helped. Bloomfield, the associate chief of staff for research at the Veterans Administration Healthcare System in Minneapolis, agreed that some of these surgeries she deemed ""unnecessary"" might actually have been helpful. It's impossible to know because the Greek paper contains very few details. The second problem with labeling these surgeries ""unnecessary"" is that the Greek women got their care from 1991 to 1993. Doctors are now much more adept at weeding out people who don't need surgery because of better imaging technology. 5 questions to ask before surgery . ""To extrapolate anything from a study done in Greece in 1992 to the U.S. in 2014 is unconscionable,"" says Dr. Barbara Levy, vice president of health policy at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The professional organization is not going to change its recommendations in light of this report, saying they believe pelvic exams can still be valuable. So we have different doctors with different opinions. You and I get to be empowered patients and decide who we agree with. For me, I don't want to miss something that could be serious. I'll take the small chance that an exam will lead me to an unnecessary surgery because before I would have that surgery I would ask good questions and get a second or third opinion if necessary to make sure I really needed it. So ladies: if you choose to have a routine pelvic exam, do it with your vagina and your eyes wide open. Know that science isn't perfect. But also know that you, and not a group of doctors looking at that imperfect science, will make that decision.","The American College of Physicians recommend against pelvic exams .

"(CNN)Lessons from the zoo: Here are four surprising animal facts only zookeepers know. From Dr. Seuss to Dr. Dolittle, pop culture has made life with wild animals look like a blast. But for those who work there, a day at the zoo is no picnic. In the forthcoming episode of ""Inside Man,"" CNN host Morgan Spurlock becomes the latest human to weave his way within the fur and feathers, trying his hand as a zookeeper. For those looking to follow in Spurlock's dung-encrusted footsteps, here are a few lessons best learned ahead of time: . 1. If a gorilla is pursing his (or her) lips, it's best to direct thine eyes in another direction . As Spurlock learned in his visit to the Detroit Zoo -- a facility that's been home to animals for nearly a century -- gorillas interpret direct eye contact as a threat. ""So usually you look chest high on them, or directly past them,"" one experienced zookeeper told Spurlock.  Otherwise, you may find yourself staring at what she said is known as ""threat face."" ""They stand very rigid and very tall and then purse their lips, and really very tight."" When giving up anywhere between 200 and 300 pounds, ""threat face"" doesn't exactly put a smile on an amateur zookeeper's own kisser. 2. If you're working with penguins, bring your own eggs . In captivity, penguins aren't permitted to nest atop their own eggs, for fear they'll break. Instead, when breeding season concludes, the zoos pull the real eggs and transport them to their own incubation room and nursery.  Fake eggs are put in their place, leaving the penguins to wonder why nothing has hatched. ""They'll kind of hang out for a couple more days and then they are often completely forgotten,"" a penguin handler said. The zoo's argument is that separating the chicks from the mother penguin serves to further grow the population. But Spurlock was uneasy about the arrangement: . ""I found it a little bit concerning that the penguins were being raised in incubators away from their parents, only to live lives entirely in captivity."" 3. If you have a thing for elephants, it might be best to seek the experience elsewhere . Zoos aren't a great place to house elephants, largely because of, well, their largeness.  Elephants are meant to be moving, roaming, eating, exploring. Kept in captivity, the mammoth mammal will develop a variety of health concerns, many having to do with the feet and toes. It's a lesson learned by the staff in Detroit, resulting in what was likely quite a road trip. ""They would have to be cooped up inside for months at a time and we just felt that that's wrong.  We knew they were suffering,"" explained Ron Kagan. ""After a lot of, you know, heartache we finally said what's best for them is to do this, and ultimately were successful and sent them to a fabulous sanctuary in California."" After traveling from the Motor City to the Sunshine State, the elephants picked up an additional 2,000 acres through which to meander. ""Here there are no cages and no visitors ... just a lot of space to roam free,"" explained Spurlock.  ""While 'Winky' unfortunately passed away a few years ago, 'Wanda' seems to be enjoying her life away from the crowds."" 4. When it comes to food, Mother (Nature) knows best . In the Detroit Zoo, veterinarians have noticed an increase in heart disease, a condition that likely stems from a combination of factors, including diet.  While zookeepers try to replicate the gorillas' natural fare, they can only come so close. ""Well, although we're feeding them vegetables like they would get in the wild, it's not the same plants that they would be getting in the wild,"" said Ann Duncan, chief veterinarian at the Detroit Zoo.  ""You've seen they get a lot of leaves, but I don't think they're getting romaine in their wild habitats."" The altered food source, plus confinement and genetics, has yielded ailments not found in freer versions of the species. It's an equation that left Spurlock wondering about the existence of zoos. ""It's pretty disappointing to hear that they are suffering from heart disease, an illness they likely wouldn't have in the wild,"" he said.  ""It really makes me question why we would want to keep breeding more animals in captivity who may suffer the same fate.""","From Dr. Seuss to Dr. Dolittle, life with wild animals may look like fun, but working at a zoo is no picnic .

"(CNN) -- A representative for Natalee Holloway's mother who paid $25,000 for information on the whereabouts of her remains last month was an undercover FBI agent, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. However, the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham, Alabama, said Wednesday that the FBI did not supply the money. ""Some news accounts have suggested that the FBI provided $25,000 in funds that were transmitted to van der Sloot. This is incorrect. The funds involved were private funds,"" the FBI and U.S. attorney's office said in a statement. An Interpol document says van der Sloot faces criminal charges in Alabama because he allegedly tried to extort money from Holloway's mother. U.S. authorities filed extortion and wire fraud charges against van der Sloot this week. The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham arranged for a meeting where van der Sloot was paid $10,000 in cash and another $15,000 in a wire transfer for information van der Sloot allegedly promised would lead to Holloway's body in Aruba, a source familiar with the case said. The meeting took place in May, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham. Interpol documents show that the $15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the Netherlands. The information van der Sloot provided to the FBI was not true, according to the documents. It's unclear if that money funded van der Sloot's trip to Colombia and into Peru, where authorities said he confessed this week to killing 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez. Members of Flores' family told CNN they knew days ago that the FBI had paid van der Sloot. ""We really don't have anything to say about it or what could have happened if we knew this information,"" said brother Enrique Flores, speaking by phone from Peru. ""It won't make any change today. Her mom is praying every day. We are not having contact with a lot of people. We want to be left alone."" Although the investigation involving alleged extortion had been in motion for several weeks at the time of Flores' death, ""it was not sufficiently developed to bring charges prior to the time van der Sloot left Aruba,"" the FBI statement said. ""This is not due to any fault on the part of the FBI or the U.S. attorney's office, where agents and prosecutors were working as hard as possible to bring the case to fruition when they learned of the murder. A case based on events outside of the United States is a complex matter, and work was proceeding with all deliberate speed to prepare the evidence, the charges and the necessary procedures to obtain custody of van der Sloot,"" the statement said. Van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen, was twice arrested in connection with the 2005 disappearance of Holloway but was released for lack of evidence. This week Alabama authorities filed extortion and wire fraud charges against van der Sloot. On or about March 29, van der Sloot contacted a representative of Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway, say Intepol documents. That came as a shock to Natalee Holloway's father Dave Holloway. CNN spoke with his attorney Vinda de Sousa in Aruba Wednesday. ""He didn't know about it ... and he just didn't have very much to say about it because he was not involved,"" the attorney said. In exchange for payment, van der Sloot showed a person -- described in Interpol documents as Beth Holloway's representative -- a house in Aruba where supposedly Holloway's remains were located. When records showed that the house wasn't even built at the time of her disappearance, van der Sloot admitted he lied, Interpol said. Aruban authorities were involved in the FBI's undercover investigation, Aruban government spokesman Taco Stein said. ""We did some technical work"" and ""worked together,"" Stein said. CNN's Terry Frieden, Kim Segal and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","FBI: Money came from a private source, not the FBI .

"(CNN)On the whole, Denmark is pretty deserving of its reputation as a neat, orderly place. So it's a surprise to discover a sand dune the size of a small desert roaming around the countryside unchecked, destroying farmhouses, churches, roads and anything else that gets in its way. While Legoland's miniaturized landmarks may be more famous, Northern Jutland's claim to be home to ""Denmark's equivalent of the Sahara"" doesn't look quite as ridiculous as that sounds when you're actually standing amid the windswept white sands of Rabjerg Mile. Certainly a budget Nordic remake of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" wouldn't be out of the question. Covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers and containing 3.5 million cubic meters of sand, Rabjerg Mile is the largest migratory dune in northern Europe. In fact, the dune played a starring role in the desert epic of its day. In 1915, Danish filmmakers erected a sphinx and a pyramid as the backdrop for ""The Secret of the Sphinx,"" one of the more ambitious productions of the Scandinavian country's so-called ""golden age"" of silent cinema. Endless horizon . At the time it was the largest and most expensive film set ever built. Sepia-toned photos of actors in flowing robes suggest a reasonable approximation of the wonders of ancient Egypt was achieved. These days, it's the undisturbed natural beauty of the dune and the thriving ecosystem of the wetlands left in its wake that are the star attractions for visitors that come to hike its slopes each year. ""Listen to the quietness,"" says Villy Hansen, our group's guide for the day and a dune ranger for 15 years. ""It's very special. There are not many places where you can hear nothing. And look at the endless horizon."" Only the croaking of a few frisky natterjack toads disturbs the peace as we sit atop the highest point, 40 meters above solid ground, enjoying a view that stretches from the waters of the Skagerrak, a straight off Denmark's western coast, to the Kattegat Channel leading to the Baltic in the east. Understanding how so much sand ended up in one place requires a Dummies' Guide to millions of years of geological history, which Hansen illustrates by scratching out lines and arrows with a stick and shaping ridges with his hands. ""This sand was cliffs and mountains in the period when the tectonic plates were taking land from each other,"" he explains. More sand was added to the mix during the ice ages, as the landscape was crushed and re-sculpted by glaciers. Rabjerg Mile's documented history begins in the 1700s. Abandoned villages . By then Denmark had been plagued for centuries by sand drifts that destroyed farmlands, buried buildings and forced villages to be abandoned. ""It is to be feared that the whole of North Jutland will be covered with sand and virtually laid waste,"" a city official in Aalborg wrote in 1726. In the 19th century, the government finally took steps to tame the dunes, planting millions of trees and shrubs to check their movement. But Rabjerg Mile was left to roam as an active reminder of how the landscape had been. Since then it has continued to move northeastward at an average rate of about 15 meters a year, covering nearly five kilometers since measurements of its movement began. Hansen says the dune appears to be turning left and speeding up because of variations in wind direction he believes are a consequence of climate change. ""We don't get so much wind from the west anymore. It had been moving from Skagerrak to Kattegat but now it looks like it will go back to Skagerrak. ""Maybe it will change for three years or a hundred years, who knows? Nothing is certain nowadays."" Giant sand castle . More worrying for Hansen is the threat posed by rising sea levels to an area that is effectively a giant sand castle. ""If the sea rises one meter then I won't be living here anymore,"" says Hansen. ""You could go out toward Norway where the sea is 800 meters deep, take all the sand that has built up here over 9,000 years and count to three and there would be nothing left. ""The land here is dynamic, being built up and torn down, and this place is a monument to all of that."" A few kilometers south stands another monument to the natural forces at work on this coastline. When the lighthouse at Rubjerg Knude was built at the end of the 19th century, it stood amid green fields on cliffs 60 meters high and set back 200 meters from the sea. Now, only the tower is visible, the two-story building beneath it swallowed up by sand and the steep drop to the beach just a few footsteps away. The lighthouse was switched off in 1968 and converted into a museum. That had to be abandoned in 2002, by which time staff were serving ice cream to visitors out of a first floor window. ""Every time I come up here it is different. It is a fascinating landscape,"" says local guide Jakob Nielsen, pointing at the streaks of sand and clay in the cliff face. Most of the erosion is caused by winter storms, which wash away the clay and loosen the sand, uncovering an archaeological cross-section of human history. Destructive force . ""You see the dark layers? Those were Viking fields. And those layers higher up were wheat fields 500 years ago,"" says local artist John Kristensen, who has been painting Rubjerg Knude lighthouse every year for almost 40 years. ""If we go down to the beach it's possible we'll find something from the Stone Age."" When Kristensen began painting he had no idea he was charting the lighthouse's demise. When he realized it, he set about trying to buy back his earliest paintings to complete the series, though so far without success. ""The lighthouse is a reference point, but the most fascinating things are the landscape and the light. They are constantly changing,"" he says. Kristensen may not have to drag his easel to the top of the dunes many times more. The lighthouse is expected to crash into the sea by 2020 if the cliff continues to retreat at its current rate, though bad weather over the next few winters could accelerate its demise. ""Maybe it will be a reef down there,"" he says, pointing a paintbrush toward the beach below. ""Perhaps I'll sit on it and try fishing instead.""

Yamauchi took over the company from his ailing grandfather as a university student in 1949 and ran it until 2002 -- a remarkable span of 53 years. He guided Nintendo from its pre-electronic days as a maker of children's games through its emergence as the creator of hugely popular video-gaming platforms such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Game Boy, hit games such as ""Donkey Kong,"" and iconic characters such as Mario, the mustachioed Italian plumber. Nintendo confirmed the news Thursday in an e-mailed statement to media outlets. The company said Yamauchi died of pneumonia at a hospital in central Japan. ""The entire Nintendo group will carry on the spirit of Mr. Yamauchi by honoring, in our approach to entertainment, the sense of value he has taught us -- that there is merit in doing what is different -- and at the same time, by changing Nintendo in accordance with changing times,"" said current Nintendo President Satoru Iwata in a statement sent to CNN.

"(CNN)French authorities say a woman in the latest video released by French-speaking ISIS fighters may be Hayat Boumeddiene, who is believed to have knowledge about the deadly January 9 attack on a Paris kosher grocery, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The video, titled ""Blow Up France 2,"" was released Tuesday and shows an ISIS fighter praising previous attackers in France and calling for new attacks. The video shows a woman standing next to the speaker, wearing camouflage clothing and holding a weapon. ""French authorities are investigating the possibility this woman could be Hayat Boumeddiene,"" the source said. Her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, killed four hostages January 9 at a kosher grocery in Paris, authorities said. He was killed by police in a rescue and the remaining hostages fled to safety. Authorities are searching for Boumeddiene, who is believed to be in Syria. She and Coulibaly were married in a religious ceremony, but the marriage was not officially recognized under French law. The grocery store attack followed the January 8 attack by Islamic gunmen on Charlie Hebdo, a satire magazine. The next day, a French police officer was killed. Seventeen people were killed over those three days. The latest ISIS video calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France.

The next stage of Dubai's development will see it host the World Expo in 2020, an event that has added a further dose of fuel to the booming construction sector that has made these changes possible. Residential and commercial property prices are on the rise as a result -- but so are fears of a property collapse like that of 2009 which resulted in Dubai being bailed out by neighboring Abu Dhabi. Global real estate firm Knight Frank calculates that property prices rose by 27.7% between March 2013 and March 2014, although the speed of this surge slowed in the first quarter of this year. A new bubble? According to Masood Ahmed, Middle East and Central Asia director of the IMF, the specter of instability is one that must be monitored closely. ""You do see in an increase in property prices, real estate prices in Dubai and these are things to watch out for,"" Ahmed said. ""Overall inflation rates in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) ... remain quite manageable, these are the areas you quite rightly pointed out are where you need to keep a vigilant eye."" But alongside these words of caution comes optimism as well. The IMF predicts approximately 5.5% growth for Dubai between 2014 and 2019. This figure that is expected to rise to 8% in 2020, the year of the Dubai Expo. Still, the authorities have moved to cool the property market, perhaps aware of the dangers of speculators looking to make a quick buck and driving up prices in the process. ""The Dubai government raised the transfer tax from 2% to 4% (making) property transactions more expensive and less attractive to flippers,"" said Alan Roberston, regional CEO of real estate and financial services firm JLL. On top of this ""the UAE bank introduced new loan to value proportions on mortgage lending and some of the developers have been introducing their own regulations,"" Robertson added. Playground of the rich . But with no corporate tax and stable governance in the Emirate, the well-to-do property investors keep on coming. Dubai is a growing travel hub between east and west while luxury property like the Palm Islands and year round warm weather ensures it retains a big appeal to the global elite. Estate agent Patrick Crowe is responsible for some of Dubai's most exclusive properties through his company Luxahabit and believes that high-net-worth clients are undeterred by the rising prices. ""For a lot of our clients the driver seems to be lifestyle."" Crowe said. ""Some of our clients are Russian guys ... they like seafront properties so the Palm treats them well. Our GCC clients they like penthouses, Dubai marina downtown that kind of area. ""The Indian (and) Pakistani clients we have they like a bit more privacy so they tend to go for the Emirate Hills properties."" The other Dubai . For those with less cash to splash purchasing sales have slowed, however. Rents have surged on average by 20% year on year, according to commercial property consultants CBRE Research. ""The issue for Dubai is affordability,"" said Nick Maclean of CBRE Middle East. ""The cost of living is going up not just housing prices. (Neighborhoods like) Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah have been beneficiaries of people moving away to seek better value accommodation so Dubai has to be very careful that the affordability gap as we are calling it doesn't get out of control."" Dubai, the remarkable city that rose from the desert sands, is known for its ""build it and they will come"" philosophy. It will hope, however, that it won't have to add to the postscript of this charmingly optimistic phrase ""but only if you can afford it.""","Dubai has grown at a rapid pace in recent years as has its property market .

"As many as 200 girls were abducted from their boarding school in northeastern Nigeria by heavily armed Boko Haram Islamists who arrived in trucks, vans and buses, officials and witnesses said. The group has recently stepped up attacks in the region, and its leader released a video last month threatening to kidnap girls from schools. Dozens of gunmen stormed the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, about 130 km (81 miles) west of Maiduguri, on Monday night as the students slept in their dormitories, officials said. They engaged the soldiers guarding the school in a lengthy gun battle and then herded the girls onto vehicles. ""Many girls were abducted by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the school in a convoy of vehicles,"" said Emmanuel Sam, an education official in Chibok. Sam could not say exactly how many girls were kidnapped, but one student who managed to get away said at least 200 students were taken. ""The Boko Haram attackers came to town around 9 p.m. and made straight for the school where they had a gun battle with soldiers stationed at the school and killed two soldiers,"" said Chibok resident Maina Babagana. The gunmen then burned homes and businesses in the town in Borno state as they fled with the girls, witnesses said. A military spokesman in the region declined to comment on the abduction, saying the Nigerian Defence Ministry would issue statement later. A student who was among about a dozen girls who managed to escape from their abductors recounted her ordeal. ""They forced us into trucks, buses and vans, some of which were carrying food stuffs and petrol. They left with us in a convoy into the bush,"" said the student, who declined to be named for security reasons. ""A group of motorcyclists flanked the convoy to ensure none of us escaped."" At one point, one of the trucks broke down and the girls on that vehicle were transferred to another one, the student said. The broken down truck was set on fire, she added. When another vehicle broke down and the men tried to fix it, ""some of us jumped out of the vehicles and ran into the bush. We later found our way back to Chibok,"" she said. Boko Haram, which translates as ""western education is sin,"" is known to have carried out deadly attacks on other schools in the northeast. In a clip released by the group March 23, leader Abubakar Shekau threatened to launch raids and abduct girls from schools. In early March, Borno state government closed all of its 85 secondary schools and sent more than 120,000 students home following increasing Boko Haram attacks on schools.","The girls were sleeping in their dormitories when Boko Haram attacked .

"Forensic tests have found the blood of Michael Brown on the gun, uniform and police cruiser belonging to Officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot the unarmed teen two months ago in Ferguson, Missouri, The New York Times reported. The revelation, provided by unnamed government officials familiar with a federal civil rights investigation, marked the first public account of Wilson's testimony to investigators. That it could potentially serve as exculpatory evidence -- or at the very least, used by Wilson's supporters to back the officer's account of what transpired on Canfield Drive on August 9 -- immediately drew suspicion and anger from leading activists who portended an ominous reaction from Brown supporters. ""This is clearly constructed and contrived to justify the killing of Mike Brown,"" Ferguson resident Pam Peters told CNN affiliate KTVI. Angela Whitman, a Ferguson resident who was among activists meeting with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder there in August, found the newspaper account of Wilson's testimony ""so hard to believe."" She said the report addressed only the initial encounter and not the subsequent fatal shooting, when some witnesses said Brown was surrendering with his hands up. But police said Wilson shot Brown after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun. Whitman speculated that the account was leaked to the newspaper because a St. Louis County grand jury investigating the teen's killing is now leaning toward not indicting the officer. ""If [Michael Brown] struggled with this officer, this still does not justify why this child is not alive,"" Whitman said. ""If this young man did this, and struggled, that means he got free. And then witnesses said he turned around with his hands up. This kid should still be alive. ""There was speculation probably about a week ago, that Wilson will not be indicted, and that he is going to get off. People are more angry now. There's more anger now than when the incident happened,"" Whitman continued. Whitman worried whether the revelation would provoke another round of racially charged protests akin to the violent demonstrations immediately after Brown's August 9 death in the St. Louis suburb. Wilson is white; Brown was black. ""This is not a black and white thing, this is about what's right and wrong. St. Louis is in trouble, because if this is what Darren Wilson said, and they believe him, St. Louis is going to burn,"" Whitman said. ""I'm so frustrated with this. It's all for political gain. It's become no longer about Mike Brown,"" Whitman added. The officer's account . Wilson, 28, a resident of the St. Louis area, has stayed out of the spotlight since the incident, and until now, few details have emerged publicly about his side of the story. Wilson told investigators he was trying to leave his car when Brown shoved him back in, the Times reported Friday night. Once in, Brown pinned him in his car and tried to get his gun, which made him fear for his safety, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed government officials familiar with the federal civil rights case. The officer told authorities that Brown hit him and scratched him repeatedly,  leaving bruises on his face and neck, according to The Times. Analyst: ""Helpful testimony"" for officer . CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said the new account appears to be ""strong evidence"" favoring the officer, but ""the real focus on the case will shift to what happened outside of the car when Michael Brown ran away, according to many witnesses,"" Callan said. ""I think the focus will shift on the officer,"" Callan said. ""He is not out of the woods yet, even though this is helpful testimony for him. ""The officer will claim here that because Michael Brown tried to kill him with his gun ... he was a danger to the public and to the officer in general,"" Callan said. ""However, if, as some witnesses have said, Michael Brown turned with his hands up in a surrender gesture, well, then he's no longer a threat to anybody and he cannot be shot. ""The officer may be saying, well, that is not what's happening. He was running towards me and trying to tackle me and he constitutes a continuing threat to my safety. So it will depend on what the grand jury believes which is the accurate version,"" Callan said. Gun fired twice in car . FBI forensic tests showed the gun was fired twice in the car, with one bullet hitting Brown's arm while the second one missed, the newspaper said. In addition to Wilson's uniform and gun, forensic tests found the teen's blood on the interior door panel of his car, The Times said. His account did not include an explanation on why he shot at Brown even after they got out of the car, according to The Times. A preliminary autopsy showed the teen was shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Separate federal and local investigations are still ongoing, but the government officials said the evidence so far does not indicate that the officer violated any civil rights, The Times reported. CNN cannot confirm the details of The Times' report. A grand jury is considering whether Wilson should be tried on other charges. What happened in the car mostly a mystery . Most of the accounts of Brown's shooting have focused on what happened outside the car -- on the street -- with conflicting narratives between both sides. Dorian Johnson, 22, who was walking with Brown on the street when the shooting occurred, told CNN that the officer pulled up and told them to get on the sidewalk. They told him they were almost home, and would be off the street shortly. The officer drove forward, but stopped and backed up, almost hitting the pair, Johnson said. ""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer,"" he said. Witnesses' version a stark contrast . Still in his car, the officer grabbed Brown by his neck, but he tried to pull away as the officer pulled him toward him, Johnson said. The officer drew his weapon and fired, hitting Brown, Johnson said. A bloodied Brown took off running, but the officer followed him and fired, according to Johnson. Brown turned around with his hands up and told the officer he was unarmed, but the officer fired and the teen hit the ground, Johnson said. Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, has said she saw Wilson and Brown ""tussling through the window"" of the police cruiser.

"(CNN)Ivory Coast are one step away from ending 23 years of painful African Cup of Nations memories after sweeping aside Democratic Republic of Congo in the semifinals. The Elephants have twice lost the final on penalties, in 2006 and 2012, but could be on course for its first title since 1992 after a 3-1 success in Bata, Equatorial Guinea. Goals from two of its star players -- Yaya Toure and Gervinho -- were added to by Wilfried Kanon to seal a place in Sunday's showpiece. It signaled the end of DR Congo's fairytale run after it scored four goals in the final half an hour to defeat neighbors Congo in their last eight clash. Toure de Force . After a modest opening it was Ivory Coast talisman Yaya Toure who made the first decisive impact on the game, as he so often does for his club -- English Premier League champions Manchester City. The 31-year-old pounced on a loose ball after a run from teammate Wilfried Bony -- signed by City in January -- to lash a fierce shot into the roof of the net. It was his 19th goal for Ivory Coast and must surely rank of one of his finest. But having got themselves in front, Ivory Coast switched off moments later to allow DR Congo back into the match. A looping cross from the right was handled by Eric Bailly, allowing Dieumerci Mbokani to register his third goal of the tournament from the penalty spot. The striker, who plays for Dynamo Kyiv in Ukraine, should have put his side ahead 10 minutes later but failed to make proper contact with a cross that fell to him at the back post. It was to prove a costly miss. Ivory Coast immediately gained the upper hand and Gervinho saw his header diverted onto the crossbar by a brilliant Gabriel Zakuani clearance. But the AS Roma midfielder wasn't to be denied for long as an error in midfield saw Bony play him into the area, Gervinho slotting neatly into the far corner of the net. DR Congo came out revitalized after the break and Yannick Bolasie, who plys his trade with Crystal Palace in England's top flight, forced a fine save from Sylvain Gbohouo after a mazy run. But it proved to be only a brief flurry as Ivory Coast reasserted its control on the match. Gervinho and Toure both went close before defender Wilfried Kanon scored the vital third, knocking home from close range after Serge Aurier's header had been saved by goalkeeper Robert Kidiaba. Kidiaba made another save from Gervinho as Congo's desperate attempts to get back into the game left counter attacking gaps for Ivory Coast. Its players spilled onto the field to celebrate at the end of the match and they can now look forward to a clash in the final with either Ghana or tournament hosts Equatorial Guinea, who play Thursday.","Ivory Coast cruises into the African Cup of Nations final after victory over DR Congo .

"(CNN) -- When Vanessa Hudgens' naked photos hit the Internet, the ""High School Musical"" star quickly apologized. But sending nude or seminude pictures, a phenomenon known as sexting, is a fast-growing trend among teens. Phillip Alpert is a registered sex offender as a result of sending a nude photograph of his 16-year-old girlfriend. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, a private nonprofit group whose mission is to protect children, and CosmoGirl.com, surveyed nearly 1,300 teens about sex and technology. The result: 1 in 5 teens say they've sexted even though the majority know it could be a crime. Phillip Alpert found out the hard way. He had just turned 18 when he sent a naked photo of his 16-year-old girlfriend, a photo she had taken and sent him, to dozens of her friends and family after an argument. The high school sweethearts had been dating for almost 2½ years. ""It was a stupid thing I did because I was upset and tired and it was the middle of the night and I was an immature kid,"" says Alpert. Orlando, Florida, police didn't see it that way. Alpert was arrested and charged with sending child pornography, a felony to which he pleaded no contest but was later convicted. He was sentenced to five years probation and required by Florida law to register as a sex offender. ""You will find me on the registered sex offender list next to people who have raped children, molested kids, things like that, because I sent child pornography,"" says Alpert in disbelief, explaining, ""You think child pornography, you think 6-year-old, 3-year-old little kids who can't think for themselves, who are taken advantage of. That really wasn't the case."" Alpert's attorney Larry Walters agrees and he's fighting to get Alpert removed from Florida's sex offender registry. The law lags behind the technology, he says. ""Sexting is treated as child pornography in almost every state and it catches teens completely offguard because this is a fairly natural and normal thing for them to do. It is surprising to us as parents, but for teens it's part of their culture."" In many states, like Florida, if a person is convicted of a crime against children, it automatically triggers registration to the sex offender registry. Thirty-eight states include juvenile sex offenders in their sex offender registries. Alaska, Florida and Maine will register juveniles only if they are tried as adults. Indiana registers juveniles age 14 and older. South Dakota registers juveniles age 15 and older. Most states allow public access to sex offender registries via the Internet and anyone with a computer can locate registered sex offenders in their neighborhoods.  Watch a report on the 'sexting' trend and how police are now getting involved » . A number of states have elected not to provide Internet access to registries; Florida is not one of them. There is no hiding for Alpert, whose neighbors, he says, all know. ""I am a sex offender. If you type my name into the search engine online, you will find me."" As sexting incidents pop up around the country, prosecutors are trying to come to terms with how these cases should be handled. George Skumanick Jr., a district attorney from Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, took a novel approach when 20 students from Tunkhannock High School were caught allegedly sexting.   He gave them a choice: probation and re-education classes or be charged with sexual abuse of a minor. ""An adult would go to prison for this,"" says Skumanick, adding, ""If you take the photo, you've committed a crime. If you send the photo, you've committed a different crime, but essentially the same crime."" Critics, however, say child pornography laws on the possession or dissemination of graphic images were never meant to apply to teen sexting and that these teenagers usually have no criminal intent when they send pictures to each other. amFIX: Should teens be prosecuted for ""sexting""? Fifteen-year-old Marissa Miller of northeastern Pennsylvania was 12 when she and a friend snapped themselves wearing training bras. ""I wasn't trying to be sexual,"" she says, ""I was having fun with my friends at a sleepover, taking pictures, dancing to music."" The picture recently surfaced on a student's cell phone and Marissa's mom, MaryJo Miller, was contacted by Skumanick. ""He told me that he had a full nude photo of my daughter,"" says MaryJo Miller, who calls the picture innocent. Rather than force her daughter to take the classes, which would have required she write a report explaining why what she did was wrong, Miller and two other families ­-- with the help of the ACLU -- are suing the district attorney to stop him from filing charges. ""We believe she was the victim and that she did nothing wrong,"" says  Miller. ""How can I ask her to compromise her values and write this essay, when she didn't do anything?"" Although the district attorney maintains the program is voluntary, the letter he sent to parents notes, ""Charges will be filed against those who do not participate."" Seventeen of the 20 students caught in the sexting incidents have completed the 14 hours of classes. Skumanick won't comment on the Miller case, but says, ""You can't call committing a crime fun or a prank. If you do that, you can rob a bank because you think it's fun."" In the majority of sexting cases, it's usually girls sending pictures to boys, who then send them to their friends. Though teens may think it's funny and a way to flirt or even seek revenge after a breakup, there can be dangerous consequences. Last year, Jessica Logan, a Cincinnati, Ohio, teen, hanged herself after her nude photo, meant for her boyfriend, was sent to teenagers at several high schools. For months after, her father says, she was the subject of ridicule and taunts. ""Everyone knew about that photo,"" Bert Logan says. ""She could not live it down."" On July 3, his wife found her. ""She had been getting dressed to go out. The curling iron was still warm. It was so unexpected,"" Logan says. ""I heard my wife scream, I ran up to Jessie's room, but it was too late."" No charges had been filed against Jessica's 19-year-old boyfriend, who disseminated the photo, nor had the school taken any action, Logan says. He says he and his wife want to warn parents and students of the dangers of sexting. The Logans are fighting to raise awareness nationally and to advocate for laws that address sexting and cyber-bullying. As for Alpert, life is not easy as a registered sex offender, a label he will carry until the age of 43. He's been kicked out of college, he cannot travel out of the county without making prior arrangements with his probation officer, he has lost many friends and is having trouble finding a job because of his status as a convicted felon. He says he feels terrible about sending the photo of his ex-girlfriend, especially since they were once so close. At the same time, Alpert says, ""I'm being punished for the rest of my life for something that took two minutes or less to do."" Says attorney Walters, ""Some judges have the good sense and reasonableness to treat this as a social problem and others are more zealous in their efforts to put everybody away and I think it's time as a society that we step back a little bit and avoid this temptation to lock up our children.""","Phillip Alpert, now a registered sex offender, sent pictures of his 16-year-old girlfriend .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Boko Haram insurgents killed scores of people Wednesday on the Nigerian-Cameroonian border, slitting throats and shooting victims, residents said. The attackers moved door-to-door slaughtering people in the predawn raid on the town of Fotokol, according to witnesses, and opened fire on at least three mosques, including the central mosque, as worshipers said their morning prayers. They burned the central mosque after killing worshipers, including the imam. The gunmen also moved along the streets shooting people heading to the mosque, residents said. Several homes and vehicles were set ablaze in the attack, which started around 5:30 a.m. Troops engaged the militants in a gun battle that lasted until 9 a.m. before the gunmen retreated. A Chadian fighter jet pursued the fleeing attackers into the bush and dropped bombs on them, residents said. Troop reinforcements arrived in the town and moved into the bush in search of gunmen who survived the aerial bombing. The gunmen are believe to be Boko Haram fighters who were pushed out of Gamboru-Ngala, Nigeria, in a ground offensive by Chadian and Cameroonian troops, along with fighters from other Boko Haram camps in northeast Nigeria. The Nigerian-based radical Islamist group has been staging cross-border raids on Cameroon, including an attack on the villages of Mabass and Makxy on January 18 in which they kidnapped 80 people. Chad's parliament had voted, only two days before the kidnappings, to send troops to Cameroon and Nigeria to join in the fight against Boko Haram.","Attackers go door-to-door in predawn slaughter, say residents of Fotokol .

"(CNN)Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, stars of the hotly anticipated ""50 Shades of Grey"" movie, opened up to Glamour magazine about everything from what drew them to their characters to sculpting their bodies for nude scenes to visiting a sex dungeon in preparation for the film. Johnson, the daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, plays Anastasia Steele, a naive young woman who finds herself ensnared in the dark sexual world of Christian Grey, a successful businessman with a penchant for bondage and domination. The film is based on the book trilogy by E.L. James that took the publishing world by storm. Fans of the book are eager for the Valentine's weekend release. The story is not without its detractors, some of whom have criticized the relationship between Christian and Anastasia as abusive and not true to the BSDM community. Why I don't want my daughters to see 'Fifty Shades' Johnson addressed the criticism, calling Anastasia a positive example of a woman exploring her sexuality. Still, Dornan told Glamour he felt protective of Johnson, who was placed in vulnerable situations during filming. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson also explained why Johnson is perfect for the role. ""50 Shades of Grey"" will be released on February 13. The March issue of Glamour hits newsstands February 10 and is available online now. Glamour.com: Best Trends to Try in 2015 . Excerpts from the interview are below: . On chasing the hottest roles in Hollywood ... DAKOTA JOHNSON: I had read the books and was drawn to the character of Ana because she's private, loving, honest -- and because she and Christian are both incredibly intelligent, confident, and can spar with each other on every level. I auditioned for two months. I met with Sam a bunch of times. So when I found out I had the part, I think I started crying. I was relieved the not-knowing was over. Click here to view a ""50 Shades"" slideshow on Glamour.com . SAM TAYLOR-JOHNSON: Dakota was everything that I wanted in Anastasia. She has a strong sense of who she is, but at the same time there's a sweetness about her. It was tough to find Christian because, on the page, he's perfect. In real life there aren't so many people that tick all those boxes: to be able to be charismatic and charming, successful, wealthy, and devastatingly handsome. JAMIE DORNAN: At first, I didn't audition. I made a tape in London with a casting director. I didn't hear anything until they cast Charlie (Hunnam). I thought it was kind of funny to say that I'd auditioned to play Christian and failed miserably. Then whatever happened with (Hunnam) happened, and the doors opened again. Click here to watch a behind-the-scenes video interview of Johnson and Dornan on Glamour.com . On becoming Anastasia and Christian ... JAMIE: I had to do a lot of work to get in shape because Christian's someone who's very anal about that. But it wasn't six hours a day. You don't want to turn to your heavily pregnant wife and say, ""I'm going to the gym for six hours. Text me if you go into labor."" DAKOTA: Jamie and I actually shared a trainer. It was important to me that Ana's body look like that of an active college student. And I was going be naked, so I wanted to look good. I did a lot of working out and had more waxing than any woman should have! Glamour.com: 27 Cringeworthy Fashion DON'Ts . JAMIE: In that six weeks before filming, my daughter was born. It was just an insane time. For research, one rainy Tuesday evening, I kissed the wife and baby good night and went to watch a dominant-submissive session in a dungeon. The dominant was our sort of adviser on the job. He'd be on hand anytime there was a scene in the Red Room (Christian's playroom for bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism), to say, ""You're doing that wrong."" So I watched him do his thing. ... It was quite jovial, a very different approach to how I saw Christian being in the Red Room. I think Christian takes it a bit more seriously. DAKOTA: I didn't go to the sex dungeon. I wanted to keep myself distanced from it at first because I wanted Ana's reaction to certain things to be completely honest and real, like new. But I did do a lot of reading about the culture of BDSM. It's about the ebb and flow of control between two people. To me, there's something really honest in wanting to completely give up control for just a second. Glamour.com: Carrie Underwood's Workout Moves for Miniskirt-Ready Legs . On entering the Red Room ... DAKOTA: The scenes in that room were definitely the most vulnerable scenes in the movie. But it was a very closed set -- my mom told me that it's my right to ask for that during intimate scenes, so it seemed like (Jamie and Sam and I) were in this little world together. JAMIE: Some of the Red Room stuff was uncomfortable. There were times when Dakota was not wearing much, and I had to do stuff to her that I'd never choose to do to a woman. Glamour.com: 46 Brand-New Wedding Dresses That Will Make Your Heart Sing . DAKOTA: It's stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene. But then they call cut, and you're still tied to the bed, naked. Jamie would be the first one to throw a blanket over me. JAMIE: I felt very protective and aware that it probably wasn't easy for her to be put in those situations, and exposed. And Sam, as a director, has an amazing quality of making everyone feel very relaxed. SAM: We left anything that was emotionally difficult or of a sexual nature until the last few weeks of filming.

You can't put up sandbags, get rations in. I just live my life. I've had the same friends since I was a small boy. None of them do what I do or, frankly, give a sh*t about what I do. We just love each other. The one thing I take comfort in is that none of that is going anywhere, no matter what the perception of me is or what happens in my career. DAKOTA: I'm proud of (the movie). I completely disagree with people who think Ana's weak. I think she's actually stronger than he is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that. My mom came up for a day [during filming]. She's proud of me. But I don't want my family to see [the movie], because it's inappropriate. Or my brothers' friends, who I grew up with. I think they'd be like, Blegh (mimics vomiting). Also there's part of me that's like, I don't want anyone to see this movie. Just kidding. On their turn-ons ... JAMIE: I've got a thing for great hands.

I grew up in Colorado, and there are manly men there, so manliness is attractive to me. I think it's unsexy when a man chews with his mouth open or when a man is rude or wears fedoras. I hate fedoras. Oh God, I can find more things I hate about men than I like. I think it's just a phase!

"(CNN)An ISIS video showing the horrific killing of a Jordanian air force pilot has stoked anger in the Arab kingdom and left analysts wondering what impact it will have on the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militant group. Jordan already carried out one act of retaliation, executing two terrorist prisoners with ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. One of them was Sajida al-Rishawi, the would-be suicide bomber whose release ISIS had demanded. Protesters gathered in the streets of the Jordanian capital, Amman, and in the home town of the pilot, Moath al-Kasasbeh. But what will ISIS and Jordan do next? ""I think there's likely to be a backlash, particularly in Jordan,"" said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst. ""I think it's sort of going to rally support for King Abdullah and his participation in the anti-ISIS coalition."" But it's unclear whether ISIS leaders are bothered by the condemnation and outrage. ""ISIS doesn't really care very much about the reactions it gets from Arab or foreign governments,"" said Rami Khouri, a Middle East analyst based in Beirut. ""They're on a mission to carry out their barbaric deed."" Anger against ISIS was in evidence among protesters in Jordan. One demonstrator held a poster that read: ""They burned our hearts, so let's burn their dens, and their prisoners in our prisons."" Some experts expressed puzzlement at ISIS' decision to kill the pilot without getting anything in return. ""This pilot was a real bargaining chip,"" said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a U.S. Air Force veteran intelligence officer. ""The Jordanians were willing to do things to get him back. He comes from a very established family, one that supports the Jordanian monarchy. I'm not sure they realized exactly who they had."" Adding to the intrigue, Jordanian authorities said they believed the pilot had been killed as early as January 3, before ISIS made any demands for the release of al-Rishawi by Jordan. If that's the case, the recent ISIS threats against the life of al-Kasasbeh appear to aimed at publicity rather than serious negotiations. ISIS is known to still be holding at least two Western hostages: John Cantlie, a British journalist who has appeared in a number of ISIS-produced videos, and an American woman who is a 26-year-old aid worker. Analysts said they thought it was unlikely that Jordan's hanging of the two jihadist prisoners Wednesday would affect ISIS' next moves. ""I don't see that the execution of these two individuals is really going to change their calculus much,"" said Francona. ""They're going to do whatever they want to do."" ""I don't think they had much invested in either the woman or the man who were just hanged,"" he said. ""They were nice bargaining chips that they could try and do something with."" The video of the killing of the Jordanian pilot, showing a new level of brutality even by ISIS' grim standards, raises the question of whom they are trying to reach. ""There are some people out there attracted to these horrific videos,"" said CNN political commentator Peter Beinart. ""But a much, much larger group of people in the Muslim and Arab world are absolutely repulsed."" Maajid Nawaz, a former extremist, said he believes that ISIS isn't trying to reach the majority but is going after existing terrorists as it competes with al Qaeda for foreign recruits. ""This is a race to the bottom when it comes to the gruesome depictions that they're showing,"" said Nawaz, the author of ""Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism."" Juan Zarate, a former U.S. deputy national security adviser, said he thinks that with the pilot video, ISIS is trying to send a message to the Arab members of the coalition against it. ""They're going to be treated brutally, and in fact, maybe perhaps more brutally than other members of the coalition,"" he told CNN. At the end of the video, ISIS shows names and addresses of people whom it claims are Jordanian pilots. A reward is offered, and a voice says they are ""wanted dead."" The timing of ISIS' recent string of videos -- showing the deaths of two Japanese hostages and now al-Kasasbeh -- may also be significant, according to Sajjan Gohel of the Asia Pacific Foundation. He suggested it could be an effort to distract attention from the militant group's ""humiliating defeat"" by the Kurds in the Syrian city of Kobani. The news of the killing of the pilot sparked protests in the streets of Amman, the capital, and in the pilot's hometown. The focus of the people's ire was ISIS. Analysts said they expected most of the population to stand behind the government. ""The Jordanian people, I think, very clearly will unite behind the government,"" said Khouri, a senior fellow at the American University of Beirut. ""The trick is for the government to figure out what is the most appropriate response now."" The government's early retaliation was to carry out the hangings of the two jihadist prisoners. But the pilot's father suggested that was far from enough. ""Those criminals cannot be compared to Moath,"" al-Kasasbeh's father, Safi, said Wednesday. ""Moath's blood is much more valued than these two prisoners."" He called on the Jordanian government to execute all prisoners with links to ISIS. ""Annihilate this organization,"" he said. A Jordanian government spokesman on Tuesday promised an ""earthshaking retaliation"" for the killing of the pilot. But it still remains very unclear what form that might take. Some military experts speculated that Jordan could launch independent airstrikes against ISIS or move artillery and other weapons to the border near ISIS-controlled territory. But other analysts said they thought that unilateral action was unlikely. ""They know that it would be foolhardy to launch an attack without being part of the coalition."" Francona said. He said he expected more commitment to the coalition from Jordan, including perhaps greater access to its airbases and an increased number of Jordanian sorties. ""When Jordan commits, Jordan can be a real force. But Jordan can't do this alone,"" he said. CNN military analyst Mark Hertling said he expected Jordan to increase intelligence sharing with the coalition and possibly put some additional defenses along the borders with Syria and Iraq. ""This is a calm, measured leader who wants to do things the right way,"" he said of King Abdullah. A key question is how the Jordanian population's views on the U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS will develop over time. For the time being, the anger and desire for revenge appear to be directed against ISIS. But before the pilot's killing was announced, some Jordanians had been questioning the government's decision to take part in the anti-ISIS coalition. ""We're going to have to see what happens after this period of mourning and anger is over,"" said CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Amman. ""What sort of calls are we going to be hearing from the Jordanian street?"" The issue is complex in a country like Jordan, according to Khouri. ""You get situations where many Muslims -- they don't support ISIS -- but they don't like foreign armies coming to attack Arab Sunni Muslims,"" he told CNN. ""No doubt that the majority, especially in Jordan, are afraid of ISIS and want to fight it and want to defeat it,"" Khouri said. ""But there are tensions because many, many people instinctively in the Arab world are hesitant to join an American-led military assault against Arab parties."" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","""I think there's likely to be a backlash"" against ISIS, analyst says .

"Atlanta (CNN)As Bobbi Kristina Brown remains hospitalized, her father's attorney said ""we are currently investigating the events that led to (her) hospitalization."" Attorney Christopher Brown also said Tuesday that the 21-year-old daughter of singers Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown ""is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,"" contrary to some reports. Bobbi Kristina Brown was found facedown in a bathtub over the weekend. Her family has been tight-lipped about her condition, but her R&B singer father issued a statement through his lawyer Tuesday night. ""We continue to request privacy in this matter. Please allow for our family to deal with this matter and give Bobbi Kristina the love and support she needs at this time,"" Bobby Brown said in the statement. After she was discovered unresponsive in her home in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell, Brown was rushed to a hospital, where doctors placed her in a medically induced coma. As of late Monday, she remained on a ventilator in the intensive care unit, a source close to the family said. On Tuesday, she was moved to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, sources close to the family said. The status of her brain function won't be known until sedatives are reduced, the source told CNN. ""Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family. As her father already stated, we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time,"" the Houston family said, thanking her supporters. The source close to the family told CNN that Brown's eyes opened and closed a few times Monday, but that doctors told family members not to read too much into that movement. Doctors were trying to reduce the sedatives to check Brown's brain function but decided to keep her in the coma for now, the source said. The source added that Brown had seizures Monday. It was not immediately clear what medical significance these reported events have in Brown's case. Bobbi Kristina, in her own words . She ""was not breathing"" when Nick Gordon and a friend, who's been identified as Maxwell Lomas, found her Saturday morning inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb. They called 911 and performed CPR until emergency crews arrived and took over, police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said. The spokeswoman said when Brown was found, she was ""unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat."" In scanner traffic, emergency services could be heard describing an ""ECHO-level response"" -- urgent and life-threatening -- with ""possible cardiac arrest."" ""Twenty-one-year-old female in the bathtub, facedown. PD's (police department's) en route."" On Monday, a source close to the family told CNN that Brown was in ""really bad shape."" Everyone is ""hoping for the best, preparing for the worst"" and ""praying for a miracle,"" the source said. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. The incident report referenced a drowning. Police had been to Brown's residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there on January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland said. Almost three years ago, Whitney Houston was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel near Los Angeles, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. A coroner ruled her February 11, 2012, death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown is her only child. ""She encourages me and inspires me,"" Houston once said of her daughter. ""When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'OK. I can do this. I can do this.' "" Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Mother and daughter performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang ""My Love Is Your Love"" in Central Park on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Given the pair's close relationship, it's no surprise that Houston's death was a major blow. Days after her mother's body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was ""overwhelmed,"" family friend Kim Burrell said. ""She loves hard,"" Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. ""She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it."" After Houston's death, Bobbi Kristina talked of pursuing a career in acting and music, just like her mother. In 2012, she reportedly lobbied for a role in a planned biopic of her mother's life. Lifetime's ""Whitney,"" which was directed by actress Angela Bassett, debuted in January 2015, but the Houston family was not involved. Brown did make her acting debut in 2012 on Tyler Perry's show ""For Better or Worse."" Her performance in the small role won praise from Perry. ""She did a fantastic job,"" he said at the time. ""And that kid has such a future. She's such an actor. "" Even before her mother's death, videos of Brown singing surfaced on YouTube and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to Houston's. Concerns that she may have substance abuse issues, as her mother did, intensified in July 2014 after a picture was posted on her Instagram account showing a young woman who looked like Brown appearing to be smoking from a bong. The image had previously made the media rounds two years prior. The caption read: ""This picture may be inappropriate but I want to make a connection with you all. Don't worry this picture isn't recent just hear me out. Do you know what I feel? I feel strange I can't feel any pain anymore. I don't take any drugs as of recently. Things just happened. But then there is some situation that force me to do things and the impact I'll feel pain. I did and I do. I was hurt."" Brown later denied that she posted the photo and tweeted that it was done by someone attempting to tarnish her image. Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime's brief reality show ""The Houstons: On Our Own,"" which followed her life after Houston's death. One of the show's story lines revolved around Brown's relationship with Nick Gordon, who had lived with Houston and her daughter since he was 12 years old. Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon, and in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings along with the words, #HappilyMarried• SO#Inlove."" However, Bobby Brown attorney Christopher Brown said Bobbi Kristina was never married to Gordon. ""(Houston) made me promise several times to look after Krissy ... and, Mom, I will never, ever, ever break that promise,"" Gordon told the entertainment show ""Extra"" afterward, saying Houston ""just treated me like she gave birth to me."" It was unclear whether Gordon and Lomas came into the home Saturday morning to find Brown in the bathtub or if they had been in another part of the house overnight, said Holland, the police spokeswoman. The whereabouts of another man who was in the house when Brown was found, Maxwell Lomas, are also unclear. But in response to several media outlets reporting Lomas' lengthy rap sheet, attorney Philip Holloway issued a statement Tuesday saying his client is a cooperative witness and Lomas' most recent arrest in January has nothing to do with Brown's hospitalization. Holloway also told CNN Wednesday that his client was the one who actually found Brown and called 911.  Holloway's comments came after he met with Roswell police for two hours; his client was not at the meeting, he said. On January 15, Lomas was booked on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of alprazolam (aka Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug) and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of or the attempt to commit a felony, according to Fulton County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan. CNN has also learned from Fulton and Dawson county authorities that Lomas was arrested at least three times in 2011 and 2012 and charged with a host of crimes, including battery and alcohol, weapons, drug and probation violations. Holloway did not mention the previous arrests in his statement. ""Mr. Lomas' widely reported recent arrest is completely unrelated to the incidents that occurred at Ms. Brown's residence and there is absolutely no relationship between the events. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges,"" it said. ""Mr. Lomas has not been accused of anything in connection with Bobbi Kristina Brown's injuries."" Police obtained a search warrant to look through Brown's house, but that's standard procedure, Holland said. Concern for Brown came from many in the entertainment world. Music director Michael Bearden sent along ""healing energy to the daughter of a late great friend."" Songwriter Diane Warren tweeted, ""I hope Bobbi Kristina gets the help she needs."" ""Poor thing,"" Warren wrote. ""Almost 3 yrs to the day her mom passed and the same thing almost happened to her."" CNN's Carolyn Sung, Lisa Respers France, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Sunny Hostin, Nischelle Turner and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Bobby Brown's lawyer says he's investigating ""events that led to the hospitalization""

"(CNN) -- Oh Bob Dylan, how can the life of such a man be in the palm of some advertiser's hand? Be sure to sing that first line to the tune of Dylan's classic song ""Hurricane"" and you'll get why it fits. The musical icon stirred a bit of a ruckus on social media Sunday night after he appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Chrysler while another, for Chobani yogurt, featured his music. The term of choice: ""sellout."" ""I'm sorry. Young Bob Dylan would vomit in the mouth of old Bob Dylan for making car commercials, especially jingoistic ones,"" said one Twitter user. The Chrysler ad included Dylan asking, ""Is there anything more American than America?"" Another tweeted ""That Bob Dylan, Chrysler commercial was disappointing and sad on so many levels. Proof that there are very few not willing to sell out."" Could this be the same artist once known -- to his regret -- as ""the voice of a generation""? Oh the times, they are a-changing. However, it's not the first time Dylan has linked up with an advertiser. Bleacher Report: Bob Dylan's Chrysler Super Bowl ad highlights night of memorable commercials . In 2003 he made an appearance in a Victoria's Secret ad which used his song ""Love Sick."" According to Rolling Stone, Dylan previously licensed his track ""Motherless Children"" to be used in a Jeep ad. That brand is also owned by Chrysler. There was also the 2009 Pepsi commercial which aired during the Super Bowl which mashed up Dylan's image and music with Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas. Brian Steinberg of Variety points out that instead of ""selling out"" Dylan may be merely doing what some of his contemporaries have done in trying to remain relevant in today's music industry. ""Put bluntly, with radio formats so narrow and music videos so out of vogue, musicians often have a tough time getting their work heard,"" Steinberg writes. ""For Dylan, an artist whose time in the spotlight was most intense in the 1960s, the feat is more difficult, even if he does continue to release albums that gain plaudits and critical acclaim.""","Bob Dylan narrated and appeared in a Chrysler ad during the Super Bowl .

"(CNN)A Lowndes County, Georgia, grand jury has indicted a man on a felony charge of making a false statement to investigators in connection with the 2013 death of Kendrick Johnson. According to incident reports released to CNN after an Open Records Act request, Dalton Ray Chauncey told neighbors he'd overheard two students at Lowndes High School in Valdosta discussing their involvement in the 17-year-old's death. Chauncey was arrested August 6. His mother, Michelle Chauncey, told CNN that her son is bipolar and is being used by the sheriff's office as a ""fall guy."" ""They have literally slandered my child, and I don't appreciate that,"" his mother said in an August phone interview. Dalton Ray Chauncey, 20, was indicted Friday. Johnson's body was found inside a rolled gym mat at Lowndes High School in January 2013. Sheriff's investigators determined there was no evidence of foul play and closed the case in May 2013. However, Johnson's parents believe their son was beaten to death. They hired an independent pathologist, who found ""unexplained apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the teen's neck and concluded the death was a homicide. Chauncey told investigators two boys at the school wanted to rough Kendrick up, but they took it too far. According to the arrest report, Chauncey gave deputies only the first names of those two boys. Investigators interviewed one student with a name matching Chauncey's claim. That student denied having the conversation. Investigators say they were unable to locate any student with the second name Chauncey gave them. Lowndes County investigators questioned Chauncey about inconsistencies in his statement July 23, according to investigative records. According to the reports, ""Chauncey admitted he had fabricated the story while at the home of friends in order to boast."" The students he claimed had admitted involvement in Johnson's death ""do not exist,"" the report said. Chauncey's mother said in August her son's story is true, but he told investigators he'd made up the story, hoping they'd end the questioning. She told a detective twice that her son had mental issues, she said, adding that she felt her son should not have been interviewed alone. ""He's bipolar. His comprehension level is not like ours,"" Michelle Chauncey said. ""He's a good-hearted boy. He just gets screwed over a lot."" According to an incident report, sheriff's investigators asked Dalton Ray Chauncey to take a polygraph test July 29. He declined and told a detective ""it was all over because he made it all up and it was a lie,"" according to the report. A warrant was issued for Chauncey's arrest July 30. He was taken into custody the following week and released a day later on $2,500 bond. In a written statement, an attorney for the sheriff's office wrote in August that CNN had been provided pertinent records in Chauncey's case and it would not be appropriate to comment further. U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia Michael Moore launched a federal investigation into Johnson's death in October 2013. Last month, an attorney for Johnson's parents filed a wide-ranging, $100 million lawsuit that claims several former classmates beat their son to death. The suit names 37 people, mostly members of local law enforcement, plus the city of Valdosta as defendants.","Grand jury indicts man who police say lied to Kendrick Johnson investigators .

"(CNN)Dramatic dashboard video shows the moment an out-of-control plane clips an aerial highway before crashing into a river in Taiwan. Thirteen people are confirmed dead and dozens remain missing after the TransAsia Airways ATR-72, carrying 58 people, veered out of control en route from Taipei to Kinmen, off the coast of the Chinese province of Xiamen. Rescuers were working Wednesday to pull survivors from the submerged wreck of the twin engine turboprop aircraft. Of the 58 people on board, 13 were confirmed dead, 28 injured and the remainder remain missing. The astonishing dashcam video showed the moment the plane hurtled out of control above the city's Nanhu Bridge before crashing into the Keelung River, just after 11 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET). Taiwan's official news agency CNA reported that the pilot appeared to try to control the plane as it descended, but the aircraft's wing grazed the overpass, clipping a passing taxi. The two people in the taxi were injured but in a stable condition after being taken to hospital, CNA said. Video from the scene showed rescuers in lifeboats trying to pull survivors from the water and the wreckage. Some passengers appeared to be wearing lifejackets as they waited their turn to board  rescue boats. The military said it had 165 personnel and numerous vehicles nearby to assist rescue efforts if required. Hours after the crash, TransAsia Airways CEO Chen Xinde extended a ""deep apology to the victims and our crew."" He said 31 of the passengers aboard the flight were Chinese tourists, including three children. Twenty-two were from Taiwan, including one child. The airline had sent the passenger manifest to authorities, and families were confirming the identities of the deceased, he said. Airline staff have been dispatched to hospitals to provide assistance to families and the injured, as well as the taxi driver and passenger who were also receiving treatment. Some were also going to Xiamen to assist two Chinese travel agencies, Chen said. The 31 Chinese tourists were traveling in two tour groups: the Xiamen Airlines International Travel Service Co. and the Xiamen Tourism Group International Travel Service Co. Chou Jih-shine, the vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation -- a quasi-governmental agency which covers cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations -- said that the agency had informed its Beijing counterpart. Chou added that the agency had sent personnel to the crash site. Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said the plane was less than a year old and had last completed a safety check on January 26. The agency did not offer any information on what may have caused the crash. Last year, an older TransAsia ATR 72, which was attempting to land in the Taiwanese Penghu Islands crashed, resulting in 49 deaths.","Plane carrying 58 people hits bridge, crashes into river .

"A joint military task force in Nigeria arrested 158 suspected members of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, security sources told CNN Tuesday, three days after a spate of bombings and shootings left more than 200 people dead in Nigeria's second-largest city. Some suspects resisted arrest and exchanged gunfire with the task force in the city of Kano, said security sources who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. No casualties have been reported so far, they said. The arrests come as community leaders said the number of dead from the Kano bombing and gun attacks has risen to at least 211. Community leaders have been keeping their own count of the number of dead from Friday's attacks, they told CNN Tuesday, including victims who never made it to hospitals. They declined to be quoted by name for security reasons. Government officials declined to confirm the number of victims. They previously put the death toll at 157. Police in Kano announced Tuesday that they had seized 10 cars laden with explosives and about 300 improvised explosive devices hidden in soft drink cans and bottles at a number of locations in the city. The state police commissioner, Ibrahim Idris, said a mass search turned up the explosives after police found undetonated devices at a police barracks in Kano. President Goodluck Jonathan toured the city Sunday after the attacks there left the police headquarters and other government buildings in charred ruins Friday night. ""The message I had for the people of Kano is the same message I have for all Nigerians: A terrorist attack on one person is an attack on all of us,"" Jonathan said in a post on his official Facebook page after the visit. Boko Haram -- whose name means ""western education is sacrilege"" -- claimed responsibility for the blast in a phone call to the Daily Trust, according to journalists at the newspaper. The group has been blamed for months of widespread bloodshed, with churches and police stations among the targets. The United States Tuesday strongly condemned the ""terrorist attacks"" carried out in Kano on Friday and in the neighboring state of Bauchi on Sunday, State Department representative Victoria Nuland said. ""This is a time for all Nigerians to stand united against the enemies of civility and peace,"" she said in a written statement. ""Nigeria's ethnic and religious diversity is a source of strength for the country and those who seek to undermine that strength with divisive tactics cannot succeed,"" she insisted. The bombings hit eight government sites Friday. Shell-shocked residents wandered the streets, looking for loved ones. Others hid behind barricaded doors, too scared to leave for fear of more attacks. ""That's the scary part, not knowing,"" said Faruk Mohammed, 27, who lives near one of the bombed police stations. ""We don't know what's going to happen next. No one thought this would ever happen here. There's a general sense of despair."" The attacks paired bomb blasts with shootings at various sites including police stations, the passport office, state security headquarters and the immigration office. During the attack, assailants entered a police station, freed detainees and bombed it, authorities said. They later canvassed the area in a car led by motorcycles, spraying targets with gunfire. ""I counted at least 25 explosions,"" Mohammed said. ""... Then it went deathly quiet. Kano is a bustling city. ... I've lived here for years and it has never been quiet, even at night. But after the bombings stopped, the only noise you could hear were dogs barking."" On Sunday, two churches and a security checkpoint were attacked in Bauchi state, the state police commissioner said in a written release. At least 11 people, including police and army personnel, were killed in the checkpoint attack, the commissioner said. There were no casualties reported from the church attacks. Police said they suspect Boko Haram was involved in the checkpoint attack. In December, Jonathan declared a state of emergency in four northern states after a series of Christmas Day attacks on churches blamed on Boko Haram. The man suspected of orchestrating those attacks was briefly captured before escaping police custody while being transferred to another prison. Depending on the faction, Boko Haram's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law to the total destruction of the government. Its grievances remain local, but it has attacked international institutions --- such as the United Nations -- on Nigerian soil. An August 26 attack -- during which a Boko Haram suicide bomber drove a Jeep laden with explosives into the U.N. headquarters in Abuja -- was one of the deadliest in the world body's history. Twenty-four people were killed, including 12 U.N. staff members. The group was formed in 2002 by Islamic preacher Mohammad Yusuf as an outgrowth of ethnic tensions in the country in the 1990s. Nigeria's population is split between mostly Muslims living in the north and predominantly Christians in the south. Yusuf advocated the institution of Sharia law throughout the northern states and opposed democracy. The group operated openly out of northeastern Nigeria and staged small-scale attacks against government targets. In 2009, Nigerian police forces moved to crack down on Boko Haram. Harsh police tactics led to an armed uprising and the arrest of Yusuf, who later died in police custody. The death spurred the group to begin its attacks on police stations. Ensuing clashes between group members and the police killed hundreds. The following year, Boko Haram re-emerged as a more radicalized, insurgent-style group, staging assassinations and attacks against not only government targets, but also churches and even a beer garden. ""We're dealing with a movement of inchoate rage,"" said John Campbell, a U.S. ambassador to Nigeria who left his post in 2007. ""It's highly decentralized, but what it has in common is a strongly Islamic character, and hatred for the secular, political economy of Nigeria, particularly the federal and state governments,"" he said.","""This is a time for all Nigerians to stand united,"" the U.S. State Department says .

"Doctors make mistakes. They may be mistakes of technique, judgment, ignorance or even, sometimes, recklessness. Regardless of the cause, each time a mistake happens, a patient may suffer. We fail to uphold our profession's basic oath: ""First, do no harm."" According to a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine, as many as 98,000 Americans were dying every year because of medical mistakes. Today, exact figures are hard to come by because states don't abide by the same reporting guidelines, and few cases gain as much attention as that of Rory Staunton, the 12-year-old boy who died of septic shock this spring after being sent home from a New York hospital. But a reasonable estimate is that medical mistakes now kill around 200,000 Americans every year. That would make them one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Why have these mistakes been so hard to prevent? Here's one theory. It is a given that American doctors perform a staggering number of tests and procedures, far more than in other industrialized nations, and far more than we used to. Since 1996, the percentage of doctor visits leading to at least five drugs' being prescribed has nearly tripled, and the number of MRI scans quadrupled. Certainly many procedures, tests and prescriptions are based on legitimate need. But many are not. In a recent anonymous survey, orthopedic surgeons said 24% of the tests they ordered were medically unnecessary. This kind of treatment is a form of defensive medicine, meant less to protect the patient than to protect the doctor or hospital against potential lawsuits. Herein lies a stunning irony. Defensive medicine is rooted in the goal of avoiding mistakes. But each additional procedure or test, no matter how cautiously performed, injects a fresh possibility of error. CT and MRI scans can lead to false positives and unnecessary operations, which carry the risk of complications like infections and bleeding. The more medications patients are prescribed, the more likely they are to accidentally overdose or suffer an allergic reaction. Even routine operations like gallbladder removals require anesthesia, which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. So what do we do to be safer? Many smart people have tackled this question. Peter Pronovost at Johns Hopkins developed a checklist shown to bring hospital-acquired infections down to close to zero. There are rules against disturbing nurses while they dispense medications and software that warns doctors when patients' prescriptions will interact badly. There are policies designed to empower nurses to confront doctors if they see something wrong, even if a senior doctor is at fault. Interview with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his novel . What may be even more important is remembering the limits of our power. More — more procedures, more testing, more treatment — is not always better. In 1979, Stephen Bergman, under the pen name Dr. Samuel Shem, published rules for hospitals in his caustically humorous novel, ""The House of God."" Rule No. 13 reads: ""The delivery of medical care is to do as much nothing as possible."" First, do no harm. One place where I have seen these issues addressed is in Morbidity and Mortality, or M and M — a weekly gathering of doctors, off limits to the public, which serves in most hospitals as a forum for the discussion of mistakes, complications, deaths and unusual cases. It is a sort of quality-assurance conference where doctors hold one another accountable and learn from one another's mistakes. They are some of the most candid and indelible meetings I have ever attended. I will never forget when one of our most talented surgeons operated on the wrong side of someone's brain. The patient was bleeding internally; everyone was rushing, and someone had hung up the CT scans backward. Thankfully, the patient survived. The distraught doctor spent hours throwing up after the operation. After he told the story in our M and M meeting, the hospital implemented a ""time out"" protocol in the operating room for everyone to stop and agree on what operation would be performed, on what side of the body and whether the correct patient was indeed lying on the operating table, to make sure that kind of mistake would never happen again. At my first M and M as a medical student, I heard the story of a patient who had received antibiotics for an upper respiratory tract infection. Two weeks later she developed joint pain and blisters on her chest and arms, a condition known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which can be caused by an allergic reaction to antibiotics. She ended up with sepsis, a body wide infection, and spent two weeks in intensive care. She, too, survived, but most stunning was the doctor's admission that her original ailment had been a mild viral illness — she hadn't even needed the antibiotics that led to such a terrible reaction. Years later, that case still makes me think harder about every test I order and every medication I prescribe. Hospitals are supposed to take care of the sickest members of our society and uphold the highest standards of patient care. But hospitals are also charged with teaching doctors, and every doctor has a first mistake. The only thing we can do is learn each time one happens, and reduce future errors in the process. Having a consistent gathering to talk about the mistakes goes a long way toward that goal, and just about any institution, public or private, could benefit from a tradition like M and M. It is not enough to stop the practice of defensive medicine, but when doctors are asked by their colleagues to justify the tests they ordered and the procedures they performed, perhaps they will be reminded that more is not always better. 10 shocking medical mistakes .","Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Why is it so hard to prevent medical mistakes that kill thousands?

"(CNN)#BlackLivesMatter has been a hashtag, a mantra, a movement and now it's a college course. This spring, Dartmouth College will offer a new class, ""10 Weeks, 10 Professors: #BlackLivesMatter,"" which will examine race, violence and inequality through current events and throughout history. The 2014 deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York during confrontations with police sparked conversations on social media and protests around the world, including Dartmouth's Hanover, New Hampshire, campus. ""Even though we might be sort of cloistered away in the ivory tower or something, we felt very much moved by, incited by, inspired by a lot of the activists' work following the failure to indict Darren Wilson after the events in Ferguson,"" said Aimee Bahng, an assistant professor of English at Dartmouth. ""We wanted to not leave this behind after winter break."" Then, around Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Missouri Rev. Starsky Wilson, co-chairman of the Ferguson Commission, spoke with Dartmouth faculty about ""teaching Ferguson."" By the end of Wilson's two-hour workshop, faculty members were already brainstorming how to integrate the events and the response into coursework and campus life. The result was a teaching collective that draws faculty from geography, history, English, math and other areas, and the idea for an interdisciplinary course crafted and taught by all of them. The course is also expected to draw outside speakers and to explore ways to engage the community beyond parading professors in front of lecture halls. ""There is a special energy around this,"" said Abigail Neely, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth. ""It's designed to transgress the boundaries between disciplines in an effort to do some really deep, sustained critical thinking about some of the most important issues in the country and world at this moment."" The course came together quickly with support from college leaders and Dartmouth's African and African-American Studies Program, Neely and Bahng said. Enrollment opens on Friday, but faculty members are still finalizing the syllabus and deciding how many students will be admitted. An early lesson is expected to focus on St. Louis and its racial history. Another will consider poetry, prose, music and religious sermons. Still others will look at how events in Ferguson were documented through different media and how black activism has evolved, ""from hip-hop to hashtags."" As word spread about the course, there's been an outpouring of support on campus, Bahng and Neely said. Far more than 10 faculty have signed on -- as of Wednesday, 21 are ""thinking together, teaching together, working together"" -- and students have approached to ask whether they can sit in on the course, even if they aren't enrolled. In planning the course, ""we've already begun the work as a teaching collective,"" Neely said. ""I'm so excited to see what happens when the students join.""","Dartmouth will offer a course inspired by the #BlackLivesMatter movement this spring .

"(CNN)Less than a month after French President François Hollande mused that sanctions on Russia should be lifted (apparently reflecting the prevailing sentiment in much of the European Union), Russia has launched a new offensive through its proxies in Ukraine. Facing a full-blown crisis, with the Russian economy estimated to be contracting by at least 5% this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be unconcerned about further economic pressure and diplomatic isolation. Is he irrational? As the only one making important decisions in Russia today, does Putin not care about the sanctions? He is not and he does. His is a multiphased, well-calibrated endgame to destabilize Ukraine and to weaken the sanctions at the same time. The first thing for the West to understand is that, in the short run, no amount of sanctions will force Russia to leave Ukraine -- not until the Kremlin achieves victory, which Putin appears to have defined as Ukraine's almost unconditional capitulation. Until then, any ""peace initiatives"" and ""accords"" signed by Russia are not worth the paper they are written on. Having raised the propaganda pitch to a ""motherland-in-danger"" level unheard of since World War II, Putin has been telling Russians that the war in Ukraine is about ""defending our independence and our right to exist,"" and that the Ukrainians are nothing more than the first line of NATO's attack. The popular mobilization to protect the motherland from the alleged ""NATO aggression"" has become the key to Putin's popularity and, by extension, to the regime's legitimacy. Climbing down from such rhetorical heights without a clear victory in sight, especially during an economic crisis, could be very dangerous politically. What sort of victory could Putin be envisioning? First, humiliated and bled dry on the battlefield, Ukraine would be forced to agree to a ""federated"" structure and recognize the ""autonomy"" of its southeast region that would make it a de facto Russian protectorate inside Ukraine. The ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk would have their own political, legal and security systems and their ""defense forces"" would not be disarmed. Nor would Russian ""volunteers"" be repatriated. Completely controlled by Moscow, the republics' authorities would be in charge of all elections within their territories. A permanent bloc of seats in the Ukrainian parliament would be set aside for them, giving them (that is, Russia) de facto veto power over Ukraine's key political, security and foreign policy choices. Finally, there would be no restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over the Russo-Ukrainian border and no end to the flow of Russian military and civilian supplies into Ukraine. With these arrangements in place, the Kremlin would be able to re-ignite the conflict instantaneously whenever it did not like what Kiev is doing or, more importantly, whenever Russia's domestic political situation called for another round of propaganda-induced patriotic hysteria and anti-West paranoia. With such a victory, Putin would get very close to achieving his goal since the Ukrainian revolution 11 months ago: punish, humiliate, dismember, destabilize and, ultimately, destroy a Europe-bound Ukraine. Ukraine's de facto surrender would also put pressure on the West to weaken and ultimately lift the sanctions. How could the United States and the European Union continue to punish Russia when the government in Kiev had agreed to such a ""peace""? Given Putin's determination and the resources he has put behind it, his endgame will have a high probability of success, but it is not preordained. The only way to thwart Putin's ambitions is through Russian domestic politics. A strong resistance by Kiev would force Putin to intensify and widen the scope of the campaign. This would require an increase of regular Russian troops in Ukraine (estimated last year by NATO at 1,000 and by the Ukrainians last month at 9,000) to at least 15,000 to 20,000. Russian casualties are likely to rise proportionately to the number of troops, reminding the families of Russian soldiers of the bloody 1979-'89 Soviet war in Afghanistan, which greatly contributed to the unraveling of the Soviet regime's legitimacy. Putin will be reluctant to choose this option, and the extreme political sensitivity of the issue explains the secrecy about Russian casualties and the creation earlier this year of a Russian ""foreign legion"" to minimize the losses of regular Russian troops. But in the short run, Russia's defeat on the battlefield is anyhow unlikely because of the continuing disarray in the Ukrainian defense establishment. This stems largely from the Soviet or Russian-trained top brass, which is not especially anxious to fight their comrades, as well as from the lack of manpower, poor training and the absence of modern defense weapons, especially anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. So what can the West do? For the moment, keeping up sanctions is critical. While they are far from the most damaging of the Kremlin's economic maladies, they raise the stakes for Moscow at a time of deepening economic crisis and rapidly shrinking budgets. By preventing Russian companies from borrowing or selling debt in the West, they force Putin to choose between bailing out, for example, the oil giant Rosneft or the huge VTB Bank, or keeping hospitals open even in Moscow, which is relatively well-off compared to the rest of the country; between paying the kontraktniki ""volunteer"" soldiers who fight in Ukraine and raising the pensions of tens of millions retirees and the salaries of doctors and teachers to keep up with inflation. Far from being the product of a delusion of grandeur, Putin's endgame is based on hard military and geopolitical realities. If Kiev, Brussels and Washington are serious about resisting it, they ought to be as realistic, as determined and as creative.","Tensions have flared again in eastern Ukraine .

"(CNN)It's an almost too-perfect metaphor.  This week brought news that a Republican member of Congress has decked out his office in the style of the mansion in ""Downton Abbey,"" the BBC series that Americans -- struggling against income inequality of historic proportions -- somehow can't get enough of. Maybe it's because we can relate. The United States is fast becoming a real-life example -- or worse -- of the upstairs/downstairs inequality portrayed in the show. And it's Republican policies that got us there and are making it worse. On Monday, Ben Terris, a reporter from The Washington Post, toured the Downton-inspired office of U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock, R-Illinois. Terris described the outer office: ""Bright red walls. A gold-colored wall sconce with black candles. A Federal-style bull's-eye mirror with an eagle perched on top."" ""It's actually based off of the red room in 'Downton Abbey' "" a woman at the front desk told him. An interior designer from a company called (no joke) Euro Trash showed the reporter Schock's private office. It's another red room, ""[t]his one with a drippy crystal chandelier, a table propped up by two eagles, a bust of Abraham Lincoln and massive arrangements of pheasant feathers,"" he wrote. Schock's decorator said the choice to imitate Downton Abbey's ostentatious halls was made because the congressman is ""fresh-minded and forward-thinking.""  Um, sure, for the 1870s maybe -- when the inequitable accumulations of the robber barons and the subsequent Great Depression were but a twinkle in our forward-thinking eyes. Now under some scrutiny for accepting the free services of the Euro Trash decorator (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate), Schock insists he's never even seen ""Downton Abbey.""  But he's sure lived it -- if not in his brand spanking new aristocratic office than as a resident of the Republican Party. Here's ""Schock-er"": Income inequality in the United States right now is worse than in post-Edwardian England, the era depicted in ""Downton Abbey."" The richest Americans today take home a higher share of our nation's income than the aristocratic lords and ladies of 1920s England. What's more, low-wage employees -- such as fast food restaurant workers and Walmart cashiers -- take home a smaller share of our nation's income than the butlers and cooks did back then. That unequal reality is even more gaudy than Aaron Schock's office. And it is without question the direct result of Republican policies. Tax cuts for the wealthy and the deregulation of business have ensured that the share of wealth enjoyed by big business and the top 1% has continued to climb, even in the recession. In fact, the top 1% suffered only one-third of the income loss during the recession but have basically reaped all the gains of the recovery.  Meanwhile, despite overall economic growth and the growth of worker productivity, most Americans have seen their wages stagnate or even decline. The working poor in America today may have wireless telephones, automobiles and indoor privies, but they still very much live in basement of the U.S. economy. When the Republican Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas cut taxes with a severity and speed never before attempted by any other state, he was actively cheered on by conservatives. His stated goal was to get the tax rate down to zero. The result?  The economy in Kansas plummeted. Job growth has failed to keep pace with the national level.  Giant revenue gaps led to drastic cuts in public services such as schools.  Credit rating agencies even cut the state's previously stellar bond rating.  And 100 Republican leaders in Kansas endorsed a Democratic candidate to replace Brownback as governor because, they said, Brownback's tax and budget cuts had so severely hurt the state's working class and middle class families. Narrowly re-elected, Brownback announced recently that he will now raise taxes in Kansas to fix the state economy. As if the failure of GOP anti-tax, anti-government economics hadn't already been proved by the record wealth and corporate profits at the top juxtaposed against record numbers of poor people and low-wage workers relying on food stamps, Kansas should be seen as the final nail in the coffin. Wealth from the top does not ""trickle down"" to the bottom to lessen inequality.  It never has. It's time for Republicans to do more than talk. It's time they admit that their precious economic theories are actually the poison sickening our economy. Republicans in Congress might have a mini-PR scandal on their hands with the revelations about Schock's office.  But it's the massive moral crisis that should be weighing on their shoulders, hearts and minds. Republicans need a new, populist economic theory that helps the majority of Americans and not just the elite 1%.  But to get there, they'll need a fundamental shift of perspective and priorities to say the least. Maybe start with redecorating.","Sally Kohn: GOP Rep. Aaron Schock had his office decorated like ""Downton Abbey""
She says it's the perfect metaphor for GOP policies that have brought U.S. inequality historically worse than in the ""Abbey"" era ."
"For the first time in well over a decade -- and months since a federal judge overturned her murder conviction -- Debra Milke is free. A short time after the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office indicated she would be leaving, video showed someone who appeared to be Milke being driven away Friday from the Lower Buckeye Jail in Phoenix. Sheriff's office spokesman Brandon Jones subsequently confirmed that Milke had been released. Even though she's no longer behind bars -- leaving the jail without addressing reporters  -- Milke's legal ordeal may not be over. Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne said in March that his office would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court the judge's decision to toss her conviction and the death sentence that went with it. Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' Chief Judge Alex Kozinski ruled this spring that Milke did not receive a fair trial. Milke still faces charges and was released on bond pending the possibility of a retrial. Arizona woman's murder conviction, death sentence overturned . Milke's legal team will at some point address the media about their client's release, though it's not known when, said one of the lawyers, Lori Voepel. Horne's office referred requests for comment to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office, which is now handling the matter. The prosecutor's office is not discussing the case, its spokesman Jerry Cobb said Friday. A jury convicted Milke of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on October 12, 1990, less than a year after her 4-year-old son was found dead. She was sentenced to death a few months later. A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. That was the plan, she said, when the boy got into the car with Milke's roommate, James Styers. Styers picked up a friend, ""but instead of heading to the mall, the two men drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine, where Styers shot Christopher three times in the head,"" according to Kozinski's summary of the case. Styers was convicted of first-degree murder in the boy's killing and sentenced to death. During her trial, ""no ... witnesses or direct evidence (linked) Milke to the crime"" other than Phoenix police Detective Armando Saldate Jr., according to Kozinski. The detective questioned Milke -- an interrogation that wasn't recorded or seen by anyone else -- and later said she had confessed to her role in the murder conspiracy, saying it was a ""bad judgment call."" But Milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had admitted to any role in a murder plot. ""The judge and jury believed Saldate,"" Kozinski wrote in his March ruling overturning Milke's murder conviction. ""But they didn't know about Saldate's long history of lying under oath and other misconduct."" The judge explained that he had made his decision because prosecutors did not disclose the ""history of misconduct"" of its key witness. The defense and the jury did not know that previous judges had tossed out four confessions or indictments because Saldate had lied under oath, among other issues. Horne, the Arizona attorney general, has argued Milke should remain on death row, given his understanding of what happened. ""After dressing him up and telling him he was going to the mall to see Santa Claus, Milke was convicted of sending her young son off to be shot, execution style, in a desert wash,"" he said.","Debra Milke is driven away from the Phoenix jail where she was being held .

"(CNN)Walk through the streets of Kobani, and the devastation wrought by fighting ISIS is immeasurable. Entire buildings reduced to heap of  rubble. A hospital virtually obliterated. Shoes and clothes strewn throughout the debris, their owners nowhere to be found. After four months of intense fighting, Kurdish Peshmerga forces have liberated the Syrian city from the grip of ISIS. Their prize: utter devastation. Kobani has been a coveted prize for ISIS, which has been on a murderous campaign to establish an Islamic state across parts of Syria and Iraq. The city sits on the border with Turkey and would have given ISIS a complete swath of land between its self-declared capital in Raqqa, Syria, and Turkey. And while there are many ISIS battlefields in both Syria and Iraq, Kobani is within sight from the Turkish border -- which means Western media and the world could see the magnitude of the fighting. Peshmerga forces wrestling for control of Kobani have received a boost from hundreds of U.S. and coalition airstrikes against ISIS. The strikes have hit terrorist targets, as well as buildings and houses. But after months of fighting ISIS, the Kobani area is now almost unrecognizable. ""They were advancing with heavy weapons, tanks, artillery, mortars, heavy weapons. They attacked us,"" said Bozane Shere, who is from  a village just south of Kobani. ""They attacked us. Then we took our cars and ran away."" Now, the city is no better than the village he left, he said. Many civilians fled Kobani for refugee camps in less volatile areas when the fighting first started, but others could not flee -- or were forced by circumstance to return. ""My daughter recently died. We brought the (body) here,"" one woman said. ""We said, we will not bury her in Turkey; we will bury her in Kobani, our own mud is much sweeter than other's homeland."" While there is barely anything left in Kobani, it's still home to people like Shere. ""I said I will not leave my city. I will stay here, and told my sons go wherever you want to go,"" he said. ""But for me, I will stay here, and I will die on the Syrian land.""

"Boko Haram is an Islamist militant group waging a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, particularly in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. The group's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of Sharia law -- which is derived from the Koran as the ""world of God"" -- across the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, to the total destruction of the Nigerian state and its government. The Nigerian government is struggling to control the bloodshed between the mainly Muslim north and Christian south that has claimed more than 3,000 lives since Boko Haram came to prominence in 2009, according to Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have also accused Nigeria's military of committing atrocities against civilians. After raising concerns with Nigeria's foreign minister last May, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said: ""The government has acknowledged that there have been some problems ... they're working to try to control it."" Days after a deadly attack on a college in northeastern Nigeria, which the military suspects may have been committed by Boko Haram, we look back at the past year of attacks blamed on -- or claimed by -- the group. February 26, 2014: At least 29 students die in an attack on a federal college in Buni Yadi, near the the capital of Yobe state, Nigeria's military says. Authorities suspect Boko Haram carried out the assault in which several buildings were also torched. February 15, 2014: Dozens of residents in northeastern Nigeria are killed in two separate attacks launched by Boko Haram, according to officials and residents. They say scores of militants dressed in military uniforms storm the Christian farming village of Izghe, in Borno state, and open sporadic fire on residents, killing at least 106 people in an attack specifically targeting male residents. In the second attack, suspected Boko Haram gunmen open fire on Doron Baga, a fishing village along Lake Chad. ""They opened fire from all directions, forcing residents to jump into the lake in a bid to escape, and many drowned while others were gunned down,"" a survivor says. February 11, 2014: Suspected Boko Haram militants torch houses in the village of Konduga, killing at least 23 people, according to the governor of Borno state. January 26, 2014: Militants open fire on a village market and burn homes in the village of Kawuri, killing at least 45 people, Borno state police commissioner Lawan Tanko says. Tanko says the suspected Boko Haram members were on all-terrain vehicles and shot at people while traders were closing shop for the day. December 2, 2013: Hundreds of Boko Haram militants attack an Air Force base and a military checkpoint in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri, according to government officials.

July 6, 2013: Gunmen storm a school in Yobe state, killing 20 students and a teacher, state media reports. June 2013: An attack on another Yobe school takes the lives of seven students and two teachers, state news reports. Boko Haram claims responsibility, according to local media. May 7, 2013: Two soldiers are killed in Bama, Borno state, during coordinated attacks on multiple targets. Nigeria's military says more than 100 Boko Haram militants armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft weapons mounted on vehicles carried out the attack. President Goodluck Jonathan  says dozens of people were killed and police say at least 13 suspected militants were among the dead.

After Eckert was pulled over, a Deming police officer said that he saw Eckert ""was avoiding eye contact with me,"" his ""left hand began to shake,"" and he stood ""erect (with) his legs together,"" the affidavit stated. Eckert was told he could go home after a third officer issued him a traffic citation. But before he did, Eckert voluntarily consented to a search of him and his vehicle, according to the affidavit. A K-9 dog subsequently hit on a spot in the Dodge's driver's seat, though no drugs were found.

Sometime after that, a judge signed a search warrant ""to include but not limited to his anal cavity."" His next stop was Gila Regional Medical Center, where the lawsuit states ""no drugs were found"" in ""an X-ray and two digital searches of his rectum by two different doctors."" One doctor at this time found nothing unusual in his stool. Three enemas were conducted on Eckert after 10:20 p.m. A chest X-ray followed, succeeded by a colonoscopy around 1:25 a.m. Again, in all these tests, authorities found ""no drugs"" on Eckert, according to his lawsuit. ""(Authorities) acted completely outside the bounds of human decency by orchestrating wholly superfluous physical body cavity searches performed by an unethical medical professional,"" the plaintiff asserted. Because Eckert ""merely looked nervous during a traffic stop,"" the lawsuit claims that authorities ended up violating his constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures on a number of grounds. One was that ""the language in the warrant was overly broad and, therefore, invalid,"" said the plaintiff, asserting that the chest X-ray and colonoscopy, for instance, weren't related or confined to the ""anal cavity."" Moreover, many of the tests took place outside the 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. timeframe for which any such search warrant (unless otherwise authorized) is legally valid under New Mexico law, according to the lawsuit. Eckert agreed to the $1.6 million settlement on December 20, according to his attorney, but it became public only in recent days. The New Mexico man said, in his latest statement, that he wants to maintain his privacy and -- to whatever extent he can -- not have his ""face ... be linked with jokes related to anal probing."" At the same time, Eckert said that he was heartened by those who relayed their sympathy and their own horror stories involving police on online articles about his lawsuit. ""I felt very helpless and alone that night,"" he wrote. ""The comments I have read on news stories from people have made me feel much better and not so alone.""","David Eckert sued, saying police subjected him to ""digital penetrations,"" enemas .
These actions and a colonoscopy occurred over 12 hours in early 2013 in New Mexico .
Authorities never found drugs; his lawsuit says the warrant used for search was invalid .
Eckert says the settlement gives him ""some justice"" and ""shows they were wrong"""
"Turkish authorities reopened Gezi Park in Istanbul on Monday for the first time since a crackdown on protesters last month and soon closed it again, pushing demonstrators to the streets. Riot police armed with tear gas and water cannon maneuvered through the city on Monday to disperse crowds of 30 or more people in side streets. The demonstrators moved through the city, chanting ""Everywhere is Taksim, everywhere is resistance"" as they were dispersed, then regrouped. In typical riot control protocol, police used water cannon and tear gas on Monday to clear out Taksim Square, the flashpoint of anti-government demonstrations that started in late May. Taksim Solidarity, the umbrella platform of activists and civil society groups, said in a media statement that roughly 80 people had been detained on Monday and that 32 of them are members of the group. Many of the detained were taken into custody after the park was opened to the public. After a news conference called by Taksim Solidarity, the officers chased members of the media and the group with nightsticks indoors. ""We were headed to Gezi Park,"" Sami Yilmazturk said during the news conference. ""As we were walking through Taksim Square, our friends were detained."" Istanbul's governor warned protestors before Gezi Park was reopened that the park would be opened to the public but that demonstrations there would not be tolerated. ""This is not an area for forums, for slogans, for occupation. This is not a place for marching, it is a place to take a rest, it is a place to meet and to have conversations,"" said Huseyin Avni Mutlu. ""Actions that go outside of this, that turn into demonstrations or marches, will not be permitted."" Some demonstrators shouted the ""everywhere"" slogan during the opening ceremony. Leaders of the protest movement called participants to gather in Gezi Park. Anti-government protests erupted when bulldozers began removing some trees in Gezi Park. Conservationists held sit-ins, which were broken up by riot police with tear gas and water cannons. Tens of thousands of people poured into Gezi Park and Taksim Square in Istanbul's main commercial district in response to the police action and the planned development project. Similar protests around Turkey soon turned into anti-government demonstrations. The 6th Administrative Court in Istanbul overruled parts of the Taksim development project last week, including plans to rebuild old barracks in Gezi Park that would have been used for a shopping arcade.","Istanbul's Gezi Park reopened for the first time since last month and soon closed gain .

"(CNN) -- Brazil is waiting to welcome the world for the biggest football tournament on the planet -- but has it taken its eye off the greatest show on earth -- the Olympics? The South American nation was shamed Tuesday after International Olympic Vice President John Coates claimed Rio de Janeiro's preparations for the 2016 Games was the ""worst"" he had ever witnessed. Coates, who has been involved in the Olympics for nearly 40 years, has made six trips to Rio as part of the commission involved in ensuring the Brazilian city is ready to host the Games. And while the World Cup, which starts on June 12 may take priority, Brazil's ability to juggle two huge events has been called into question. ""It's the worst that I've experienced,"" he said in a statement ahead of a press conference in Sydney, Australia, where he was being asked about preparations for 2016. ""We have become very concerned. They are not ready in many, many ways. ""We have to make it happen and that is the IOC approach. You can't walk away from this."" Coates revealed Tuesday that the IOC has taken ""unprecedented"" action by placing experts in the local organizing committee to ensure the Games go ahead. But in a statement issued Tuesday, the Rio organizing committee insisted the city will host an ""excellent Games that will be delivered absolutely within the agreed timelines and budget."" The committee also cited the recent announcement of the budget for both infrastructure and legacy projects, as well as the tender process for Olympic Park venues, as signs of progress. The statement added: ""The time has now passed when general discussions about the progress of preparations contribute to the journey towards the Games. ""The work being undertaken in partnership with the three levels of government -- federal, state and city -- is delivering progress. ""The support of the International Olympic Committee is also crucial. We have a historic mission: to organize the first Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil and in South America. We are going to achieve this."" Ongoing concerns have prompted the IOC to agree to increase the frequency of visits -- led by Olympic Games executive director Gilbert Felli -- and establish dedicated task forces. Rio organizers announced earlier this month that Brazil will spend 24.1 billion reais ($10.8 billion) on infrastructure projects to ensure the Games are delivered on time. City mayor Eduardo Paes also stated that he was looking forward to Felli's visit saying that there was ""no reason for concern"" and that the ""Olympic Park has nothing delayed."" But Coates says the delays in construction and the lack of information available means the current state in Rio is worse than that seen in Athens in 2004. ""The IOC has adopted a more hands-on role,"" said Coates. ""It is unprecedented for the IOC but there is no Plan B. We are going to Rio."" But in a statement sent to CNN late Tuesday, the IOC appeared to play down Coates' comments. ""Working together with our partners in Rio we have put in place a number of measures to support the Games,"" said the statement. ""Mr Felli has received a very positive response on the ground in the past few days, and a number of recent developments show that things are moving in the right direction. ""Now is a time to look forward to work together and to deliver great Games for Rio, Brazil and for the world, and not to engage in discussion of the past. ""We continue to believe that Rio is capable of providing outstanding Games."" Brazilian army occupies Rio shantytown ahead of World Cup . The lead up to the Athens Games 10 years ago was marred by construction delays and service delivery, but the venues and infrastructure were delivered on time. Like Athens, Rio is experiencing similar problems. The Games, which are being held in South America for the first time in its history, have been beset by delays, soaring costs and bad communication. Coates has also voiced concerns that the IOC was unable to get the reassurances needed from the local organizing committee. ""No-one is able to give answers at the moment,"" he said. ""Can they use the car parks in the village for recovery centers? What will be the time to take from this venue to this venue? ""All of those things, they're being fobbed off."" Coates also claimed that only two people were working in Rio's test event department with tournaments scheduled to start this year.

"Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN she has been treated differently as a woman in the clubby upper chamber — echoing the general sentiments of her colleague Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who wrote about sexism in the Senate in a recent book. During a wide-ranging interview on the Colorado campaign trail—where she was stumping for endangered incumbent Sen. Mark Udall—CNN asked Warren whether she had experienced any different treatment as a woman. ""Yes,"" she said. Would she elaborate?  ""Nope."" But was it surprising? ""Not really, I wish it were,"" she told CNN. ""But it's hard to change these big, male dominated institutions. What I am very happy about is that there are now enough women in the United States Senate to bring change to that place and I think that's just powerfully important.""  There are now 20 women in the senate. Opinion: This is Elizabeth Warren's moment . Warren added: ""You know, others have said it before me. If you don't have a seat at the table, you're probably on the menu."" Warren's comments did make one clear case: women will be treated as equals when there continue to be more women in the Senate. Warren didn't want to talk specifics, or how the different treatment manifested itself. ""I've said all I am going to say,"" ending that part of the conversation. In the book, Gillibrand recounted specific details of unnamed male senators remarking about her appearance—even squeezing her waist. The rest of the interview was about Warren's role as one of the Democratic Party's most sought after surrogates this election year.  Our story, airing today on the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, looks at Warren as the unusal Washington phenom—a combination of loyal Democratic soldier and outside agitator, a party star who is willing to take on her own party—including the president. And will she take on Hillary Clinton? Watch the full piece.","Elizabeth Warren said she's been treated differently as a woman in the Senate .

"(CNN)I happen to agree with Renee Zellweger that all the chatter about her face is ""silly."" But I, and many other women I talked with via email Wednesday, would add some other choice words to the mix to describe the non-stop attention about her appearance following her first red carpet event in years: nasty, cruel, hurtful, invasive and sexist. Why do we, the public, feel so free to pick apart the appearance of a woman who is aging in the public eye? What does this say about us and how we treat and value women? It's a ""double bind,"" said Lyz Lenz, a writer and blogger, and mother of two small children in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We tell women ""to look youthful and perfect, but when they do what it takes to reach that standard, we shun them and mock them,"" said Lenz. Beth Engelman, mom of a 9-year-old son in Chicago, agreed that we put aging women in a no-win situation. ""As they age, they either look old (which is never pleasant to hear) or they look scary (because they've had so much plastic surgery) and everyone feels entitled to weigh in,"" said Engelman, co-founder of Mommy on a Shoestring. Many of those slamming Zellwegger's appearance were women, which to some women is more upsetting than any of the criticisms coming from men. ""I find that women are the worst,"" said Rhonda Woods, a mom of three in New Milford, Connecticut, and a real estate executive. ""People should be 'judged' on their skills, abilities, character and intellect, and by judged, I mean assessed as a person that you would want to spend time with."" There is no question that those in the public spotlight are held to a higher standard but not really for any logical reason, said Woods. ""They are human and are allowed to do whatever they would like to do to their body that makes them feel good,"" she said. If Renee Zellweger is ""comfortable"" with how she looks, ""what right does anyone have to criticize her?"" Annette Lanteri, an attorney and mom of two in Bayport, New York, agreed. ""It is her life, her choice, her body and poo poo on the people that say mean and hurtful things. They need to get a life of their own,"" she said. Sadly, the furor over Zellweger, much of it online, is another example of a culture that seems so comfortable tearing people down. It was just Monday when Monica Lewinsky received rave reviews after a speech at Forbes' 30 Under 30 Summit where she dedicated herself to help end the ""shame game"" online that caused her so much pain 16 years ago. Zellweger has said that she looks different because she is ""living a different, happy, more fulfilling life, and I'm thrilled that perhaps it shows."" ""Are we a society of people that are so jealous or maybe even fearful that others are living a fulfilled life ... that we have to spill out cruel words?"" said parenting advocate Sue Scheff. There is a larger concern here, many women said, and that is that we live in a culture that continues to correlate youth with beauty, said Michelle Noehren, founder and manager of Connecticut Working Moms. ""It's easy to judge others for actions we don't fully understand but we do a detriment to all women when we criticize each other, especially when the criticism is related to our bodies and appearance,"" said Noehren, a mom of a 3-year-old in Glastonbury, Connecticut. ""We'd be much better off criticizing a culture that makes women feel badly about themselves if they don't fall into our media's unrealistic and unattainable beauty ideals."" Diane Smith, an Emmy-award winning television journalist, brought up a book she just finished reading, ""The Confidence Code,"" about why women might suffer from a lack of confidence as compared to men. ""It is pretty clear that when women are subjected to this kind of unsolicited commentary, it does nothing to increase confidence or help women understand that their value goes way beyond their looks,"" said Smith, co-author of the recent New York Times bestseller ""Obsessed: America's Food Addiction and My Own."" I've written story after story about how we want to do everything we can to build up confidence in our girls and remove any notion that their worth is connected to their appearance. So, what kind of message does all this talk about Zellweger's face and whether she did or did not use plastic surgery send to our daughters and our sons? ""Our kids need to understand that people, whether they are celebrities or not, have feelings that we need to respect,"" said Scheff, author of ""Wit's End: Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out-of-Control Teen."" But first, their parents need to absorb the lesson. What do you think the public criticism of Renee Zellweger's new look says about us? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Renee Zellweger's appearance at an event led to non-stop talk about her face .

"Dohuk, Iraq (CNN)""Aria"" is only 15, smiling as she greets and welcomes us into her family's tent inside the Khanke refugee camp in northwest Iraq. Her parents sit nearby. Their faces, with their weathered skin and deep lines, speak of a difficult life that has just become much harder. Blankets and mattresses are stacked up on one side, except for a few that we sit on while a small fan gently whirls, creating a slight breeze in the stifling heat. The refugee camp, outside the town of Duhok, was created just last month by the UNHCR for the massive influx of Yazidis fleeing their homes in Sinjar from the ISIS onslaught. I ask Aria if she will tell us her story. She nods and then looks at her elderly parents and asks them to leave the tent. She doesn't want them to hear what she's about to say. Six weeks ago the family piled into their neighbor's car in the early morning hours. They heard ISIS was coming and they were desperately trying to escape from their home in Sinjar. They got on the road, but a convoy of vehicles with black flags flying drove past them. They thought they had got away until minutes later when at least seven ISIS vehicles appeared on the road, surrounding them. ""They forced us out of the car,"" said Aria. ""The girls and women were separated from the men including my 19-year-old brother. But they only took the girls forcing us into a minivan."" Horrific conditions . From Sinjar, Aria, her 14-year-old sister-in-law and a handful of other girls were driven 120 kilometers to the ISIS stronghold of Mosul -- Iraq's second largest city captured by militants back in June. They were taken to a three-story house where they were locked with dozens of other teenage girls who'd been captured. ""In Mosul they tried to make us change our faith and religion,"" she said. ""They said to us, 'Read our Quran.' A couple of the girls said, 'We never went to school - we can't read.' I couldn't understand the Quran."" For more than three weeks, Aria stayed here under horrific conditions. During this time, a sheik came and collected 20 girls including her 14-year-old sister-in-law. ""He forced himself on her. I was so scared. A lot of my friends were raped. It's hard to talk about it."" Sexual abuse is a taboo subject in this culture and to admit being a victim is unheard of. I gently ask Aria if she was also raped. She looks straight ahead, staring at the wall and shakes her head. It's clear the teenager has been visibly traumatized. ""I see their faces all the time,"" Aria said. ""I have nightmares. I can't stop thinking about how they forced themselves onto the girls. I have seen and been through too much."" Shame . Tanya Kareem, UNHCR Duhok director, explains how difficult it is for girls like Aria to talk about what has happened to them. ""Even if these girls and women are released I think it's impossible for them to talk about their painful ordeal. They are traumatized. And they're from a society, a culture that does not accept what this means for the family. It brings so much shame so they just don't talk about it."" Aria and her friend were then taken to Fallujah by two ISIS militants she calls Abu Hassan and Abu Jaffar. ""They were really filthy. They had long beards; they were really tall and big. Even men would be scared of them. They forced us to marry them, threatening to hurt us if we didn't. They gave us a phone to call our families to tell them we'd converted."" Using this phone, they secretly called her friend's uncle who knew people in Fallujah who were prepared to help. When the militants left the house, the girls - dressed in niqabs -- escaped. ""My friend and I thought about killing ourselves. But we decided to ask my friend's uncle for help to escape. He had friends living in Fallujah, but they couldn't come to the house and rescue us, so we broke the door, put on veils, and walked for about an hour and met at a place where my friend's uncle's friends were waiting for us. They took us to a safe house in Fallujah."" But when she was reunited with her family in this refugee camp, she suffered once again. ""I didn't know that my brother had been killed. That made me very sad. I only had one brother. He was only married for six months. I was sad to hear this. They killed him and other men when they took me. They shot him in the head. My mother slept next to my brother's body all night."" Aria doesn't want to stay at the camp. Everyone knows what happened to her and she says they gossip and look at her whenever she goes outside. But her shame is dwarfed by her guilt after learning what happened to the other girls once ISIS discovered they'd fled. ""They raped them because we escaped. That was the punishment. They tightened security so no girls can escape anymore. ""I have to live with that.""","15-year-old Aria's hometown in Iraq was attacked by ISIS .

"In 1925, H. L. Mencken wrote an impassioned plea: ""Prohibition has not only failed in its promises but actually created additional serious and disturbing social problems throughout society.  There is not less drunkenness in the Republic but more. There is not less crime, but more. ... The cost of government is not smaller, but vastly greater. Respect for law has not increased, but diminished."" This week marks the 79th anniversary of the repeal of Prohibition in December 1933, but Mencken's plea could easily apply to today's global policy on drugs. We could learn a thing or two by looking at what Prohibition brought to the United States: an increase in consumption of hard liquor, organized crime taking over legal production and distribution and widespread anger with the federal government. News: Pot smokers enter legal limbo in Washington, Colorado . Here we are, four decades after Richard Nixon declared the war on drugs in 1971 and $1 trillion spent since then. What do we have to show for it? The U.S. has the largest prison population in the world, with about 2.3 million behind bars. More than half a million of those people are incarcerated for a drug law violation. What a waste of young lives. In business, if one of our companies is failing, we take steps to identify and solve the problem. What we don't do is continue failing strategies that cost huge sums of money and exacerbate the problem. Rather than continuing on the disastrous path of the war on drugs, we need to look at what works and what doesn't in terms of real evidence and data. Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana . The facts are overwhelming. If the global drug trade were a country, it would have one of the top 20 economies in the world. In 2005, the United Nations estimated the global illegal drug trade is worth more than $320 billion.   It also estimates there are 230 million illegal drug users in the world, yet 90% of them are not classified as problematic. In the United States, if illegal drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco, they would yield $46.7 billion in tax revenue. A Cato study says legalizing drugs would save the U.S. about $41 billion a year in enforcing the drug laws. Have U.S. drug laws reduced drug use? No. The U.S. is the No. 1 nation in the world in illegal drug use. As with Prohibition, banning alcohol didn't stop people drinking -- it just stopped people obeying the law. News: Marijuana advocates hope to rise from 'prohibition' About 40,000 people were in U.S. jails and prisons for drug crimes in 1980, compared with more than 500,000 today. Excessively long prison sentences and locking up people for small drug offenses contribute greatly to this ballooning of the prison population. It also represents racial discrimination and targeting disguised as drug policy. People of color are no more likely to use or sell illegal drugs than white people -- yet from 1980 to 2007, blacks were arrested for drug law violations at rates 2.8 to 5.5 times higher than white arrest rates. Prohibition failed when the American people spoke up and demanded its repeal. Today, the American people are showing their dissatisfaction with the war on drugs by voting for change, often in the face of federal law. Colorado and Washington recently became the first U.S. states to legalize recreational use of marijuana. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia  allow the medical use of marijuana, and 74% of Americans support alternatives to locking people up for marijuana possession. How would our society, our communities and daily lives improve if we took the money we use running a police and prison state and put it into education and health? Treating drugs as a health issue could save billions, improve public health and help us better control violence and crime in our communities. Hundreds of thousands of people have died from overdoses and drug-related diseases, including HIV and hepatitis C, because they didn't have access to cost-effective, life-saving solutions. A Pew study says it costs the U.S. an average of $30,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate, but the nation spends only an average $11,665 per public school student.  The future of our nations and our children should be our priority. We should be helping people addicted to drugs break their habits rather than putting users in prison. When it comes to drugs, we should focus on the goals we agree on:  protecting our kids, protecting public safety and preventing and treating drug abuse and addiction. To help unlock barriers to drug reform, last June, I joined the Global Commission on Drug Policy, which is bringing global leadership to drug reform to make fact-based research public and draw attention to successful alternative approaches. Opinion: Mr. President, fix our broken drug policy . As part of this work, a new documentary, ""Breaking the Taboo,"" narrated by Oscar award-winning actor Morgan Freeman and produced by my son Sam Branson's indie Sundog Pictures, followed the commission's attempts to break the political taboo over the war on drugs. The film exposes the biggest failure of global policy in the past 40 years and features revealing contributions from global leaders, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. It is time we broke the taboo and opened up the debate about the war on drugs. We need alternatives that focus on education, health, taxation and regulation. If you ignore a serious problem, refuse to debate it and hope it will go away all by itself, you are very naive. The war on drugs has failed. It's time to confront the issue head on.

"Amal Alamuddin may have just accomplished what many believed was the impossible: snagging Hollywood's most notable bachelor. The Lebanese-born British beauty is reportedly engaged to George Clooney, who many thought could never be tied down. Not a lot is known about Alamuddin, who is said to have started dating the actor in October. But here is what we do know: . 1. She's a well-respected attorney. Alamuddin's profile on the site The Legal 500 says she ""specialises in international law, human rights, criminal law and extradition."" Some of her clients have included the Royal Court of Bahrain and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. ""She is also part of the legal team representing the government of Cambodia in a case involving a territorial dispute with Thailand at the International Court of Justice in The Hague,"" the site says. ""She has previously worked as a legal adviser to judges at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and as senior legal adviser to the prosecutor of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon."" 2. Clooney isn't the only one who finds her attractive. She was named one of the 21 hottest female barristers in London on the blog ""Your Barrister Boyfriend."" ""These are three short words that come to mind when thinking about this dazzling beauty,"" the blog states about her. ""Amal Alamuddin may make some feel inadequate because she has achieved the seemingly unattainable ideal of contemporary femininity: She is both breathtakingly beautiful and formidably successful."" 3. She's a world traveler. In addition to being fluent in both Arabic and French, Alamuddin has traveled widely. Her time in the United States included graduating from the New York University School of Law, and among her trips is a safari to Tanzania she reportedly took with Clooney in March. 4. She's discreet. Alamuddin, 36, hasn't been speaking out about her relationship with the 52-year-old star. People magazine reported on the engagement based on information from ""a source with knowledge of the situation"" and reports that the attorney was spotted with a sparkler on her left ring finger. ""George and Amal are trying to keep things very low-key, but they also aren't really trying to hide this, it doesn't seem,"" the source said. ""I think it's like they want the people they love to know that this is real, that they plan on being together forever."" 5. Alamuddin must be special. There's no debating this one if she actually gets the actor to the altar. Clooney, who was married from 1989 until 1993 to ""No Strings Attached"" actress Talia Balsam, has long been outspoken about the fact that he has had no desire to wed again. In a recent Esquire interview, Clooney said, ""I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever,"" about becoming a husband and father.  He has proved that by dating his fair share of women over the years but not settling down. 6. Her co-workers are happy for her. Alamuddin may not be talking, but her law firm has spilled the beans. The Doughty Street law firm is clearly excited about the news and released a statement that began, ""The barristers and staff of Doughty Street Chambers offer their best wishes and congratulations to Ms Amal Alamuddin, a member of Chambers, and Mr George Clooney on their engagement to be married."" Clooney rep has declined to confirm reports of an engagement, telling CNN, ""I do not comment on his personal life.""","Amal Alamuddin has reportedly snagged George Clooney .

"Mitt Romney may say he's not planning to make a third run for the White House, but according to a new CNN/ORC International poll, Republican voters aren't ready to give up on the idea just yet. While there is no clear frontrunner for the Republican ticket in 2016, most likely GOP voters say they would choose the former Massachusetts governor for the nomination, among 16 potential contenders.

"(CNN) -- Washington -- one of the world's most secure cities -- is reacting cautiously following the attacks at Canada's Parliament Hill. One soldier who was shot at Canada's National War memorial, located across from the Parliament building, has died. The gunman was shot and killed on the scene inside Parliament Hill's Center Block. President Barack Obama spoke to Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper on the phone Tuesday afternoon. ""The President offered any assistance Canada needed in responding to these attacks. Prime Minister Harper thanked the President and the two leaders discussed the assault and agreed to continue coordination between our governments moving forward,"" the White House said in a statement. Later this afternoon, the president told pool reporters that it is still unknown whether a ""broader network or plan"" was behind the shooting. He added that these attacks serve as a reminder to ""remain vigilant"" when dealing with unnecessary violence or terrorists. ""It's very important, I think, for us to recognize that when it comes to dealing with terrorist activity, Canada and the United States has to be entirely in sync. We have in the past and I am confident we will continue to do so in the future,"" the president said. Secretary of State John Kerry was also briefed on the shootings, Mary Harf, the State Department's spokeswoman confirmed. At the U.S. Capitol, which was the site of a deadly shooting in 1998, police are ""monitoring and tracking"" developments in Canada. But as of now, they haven't modified their regular ""post 9-11 heightened state of alertness,"" according to U.S. Capitol Police spokeswoman Kim Schneider. PHOTOS: Gunshots at Canada's Parliament . Congress is on recess until next month's elections, though the Capitol remains busy with tourists, staff and other workers. Across the Potomac River, security near Arlington Cemetery has increased, specifically at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa, located near the Ottawa River next to Parliament Hill, is on lockdown, according to a message posted on Twitter. A spokesman at the Canadian embassy in Washington told CNN that they have locked the front door to non-embassy staff as a ""precautionary measure."" In New York City, the NYPD added extra security to the Canadian consulate as a precaution. NORAD, meanwhile, is increasing its alert posture and the number of planes ready to respond to a problem, according to CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr. NORAD, which provides air defense over North America, is in continuous contact with Canadian law enforcement, CNN is told. ""We have taken appropriate measure to ensure that NORAD is postured to respond quickly if the ongoing situation in Ottawa should include any effect on aviation,"" NORAD spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said. Washington was already reviewing its approach to security before the shooting in Ottawa. A man shocked the nation last month by allegedly jumping the fence outside the White House and making his way into the building before finally being stopped by security. Around the same time, reports emerged that a man with a gun rode the same elevator as Obama during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Those incidents prompted the resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson. In an interview with Roll Call published Wednesday morning before the Ottawa shootings, Terrance W. Gainer, the former Senate sergeant at arms, said the U.S. Capitol complex is too open. ""The only people that have left their campus open is the Capitol,"" Gainer said. ""Now, I get people wanting to be open, but people have to somehow understand there are constant threats and if the only way to mitigate the threat is have an officer chase after the bad guy â€” you're going to end up having problems."" The Twitter account for the National Security Council also tweeted updates including that the president had spoken with Harper and condemned the attacks. CNN's Barbara Starr, Jim Acosta, Kevin Liptak, Ted Barrett, Pam Brown, and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","One confirmed gunman has been shot and killed after they fired shots in Canada's Parliament building and surrounding areas .

"Republicans released a new battery of campaign ads that play on fears of ISIS and terrorism, and the Republican charged with helping elect new GOP congressmen said national security was ""popping"" as a key issue heading into November. ""We're seeing a big uptick on national security issues,"" U.S. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon, told reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor on Friday. He cited a CNN poll showing that 57% of Americans didn't approve of President Obama's handling of terrorism. Walden said it was too early to tell if the issue had overtaken the economy as the chief concern of voters, but on Friday, the National Republican Congressional Committee rolled out paid television ads in four competitive districts that accused Democrats of cutting funds to fight al Qaeda. One of the new spots said that a Democratic candidate supported suspected terrorists keeping their U.S. passports. Three of the ads featured images of groups of men carrying weapons with ominous music and a narrator warning that positions supported by Democratic candidates made them ""dangerous."" A spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said the GOP was ""resorting to Karl Rove's scare tactics."" ""It's a shame that at a time when our nation is facing real threats abroad and economic challenges at home, the NRCC would stoop to these lows just to try to win seats,"" Josh Scherwin told CNN in a written statement. Walden railed on the President's leadership on the international stage and asked, ""Can you show me a foreign policy success?"" But the issue is somewhat complicated for the party, and it's unclear how a continued -- and likely expanded -- U.S. military operation in the Mideast will affect voters' opinions in the final days of the fall campaign, when voters tend to pay closer attention. More House Republicans than Democrats backed the President's request for authority to arm and train Syrian rebel groups to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Walden said he supported assisting groups in the region, but like other Republicans, he said the administration didn't have a clear strategy for fighting ISIS. He said the issue will play out ""district by district"" across the country. The NRCC chairman repeated that he believes his party can win 245 Republican seats in the House, which would mean a net gain of a dozen seats in November. ""I'd rather be us than them,"" Walden said, referring to Democrats, and he downplayed the financial advantage that the DCCC has had over his committee consistently over the election cycle.","National security issues are becoming a top priority in midterm campaigns .

"The number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in the current outbreak has surpassed 16,000, according to the World Health Organization, with nearly 7,000 deaths from those cases. The United Nations' health agency issued its latest numbers Friday, focusing on how Ebola has affected Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the three countries where the vast majority of cases have occurred. Liberia has been hit hardest, with the WHO reporting 7,244 confirmed and potential cases as well as 4,181 deaths. Both numbers reported Friday are significantly higher than those released earlier in the week. The WHO and other health agencies have long said the scale of the Ebola outbreak is likely significantly worse than even the current high numbers indicate, because many people died before they could be diagnosed and many contracted the disease in remote areas without ready access to health care. The U.N. health agency recently noted that the situation in Liberia has stabilized in the past five weeks, after the rate of new cases declined from mid-September through mid-October. The one country where WHO has reported a significant uptick -- with 385 new confirmed cases during the week of November 23 and 533 in the previous week -- is Sierra Leone. Ebola and similar contagious diseases are not new to Africa, but the latest outbreak has been particularly virulent and deadly.  About 60% of those infected have died from the virus, according to WHO. The rapid infection rate fanned concerns that, due to the relative ease of international travel, Ebola might spread outside the continent. In fact, there have been new cases of Ebola in the United States and Spain, though such incidences remain a tiny fraction of the overall outbreak. The United Nations has urged countries worldwide to pitch in, asking in September for nearly $1 billion to help Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in their efforts to control the deadly disease. While experimental drugs and treatments have been used to treat Ebola, there's no known vaccine that can prevent the disease. Earlier this week, the U.S National Institutes of Health reported on the first human trial on one vaccine that's being fast-tracked by that government agency and British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. Researchers tested the blood of 20 volunteers -- all healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 50 who got the vaccine -- at two weeks and four weeks after they first got their shots to determine if anti-Ebola antibodies had been produced. All developed such antibodies within four weeks of receiving the vaccine, with levels higher in those who were given the higher-dose vaccine. Scientists: 'Positive' results in 1st human trial of experimental Ebola vaccine . Doctor's condition worsens . A number of the cases of Ebola outside of West Africa are of health workers who treated patients. In Italy, one doctor who contracted Ebola while treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone has seen his condition deteriorate, according to the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases. The doctor, whose name has not been revealed, had arrived in Rome from Sierra Leone on Tuesday on a special bio-containment military plane. His condition was initially stable, but has become worse since Friday, the medical institute said, and has been suffering from major gastrointestinal disorders. The Italian doctor was working for the Italian aid organization, Emergency, and had treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. It is not clear how he contracted the virus, the aid organization said.","The World Health Organization reports nearly 7,000 Ebola deaths .

"Heroin and alcohol were blamed for the deaths of two American security officers aboard the infamous cargo ship Maersk Alabama, police in the Seychelles have concluded, citing a toxicology report on Tuesday. Police said toxicologists in Mauritius found alcohol in the blood of Jeffrey Reynolds, 44, and Mark Kennedy, 43, who both suffered respiratory failure and heart attacks. Foul play was ruled out. A police statement on the lab report did not mention whether the two former Navy SEALS tasked with ship security had heroin in their blood. But it did cite heroin consumption as a cause of death, along with alcohol. The drug was found with their bodies on the ship on February 18. The Maersk Alabama gained notoriety when Somali pirates seized it in lawless Indian Ocean waters five years ago. The hijacking ended, when U.S. Navy marksmen shot three pirates dead. The feature film ""Captain Philips,"" starring Tom Hanks was based on its capture. Reynolds and Kennedy died after going on shore leave in Port Victoria, Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean, local police spokesman Jean Toussaint has said. The ship arrived on February 16 with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave two days later. The bodies were found by a colleague who had gone to check in with one of the men in a cabin, Seychelles police said. Neighbors of the men in the United States were surprised to hear about suspicions of drug and alcohol overdose. They described Kennedy and Reynolds as fitness and health oriented. But police in the Seychelles say surveillance camera footage showed the two in a bar until closing  and meeting after with two women, who they described as prostitutes. Police said the women took Kennedy and Reynolds to a place where they could buy heroin. Source: Seychelles video shows 2 Americans on the town before deaths .

"Tom Magliozzi, half of the ""Click and Clack"" team of brothers who hosted NPR's ""Car Talk"" radio show, died Monday. He was 77. NPR reported the death Monday afternoon. The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, the radio network said. In a statement, his brother Ray remembered a jovial partner. ""We can be happy he lived the life he wanted to live; goofing off a lot, talking to you guys every week, and primarily, laughing his ass off,"" he said. For more than 25 years, ""Car Talk"" has been one of NPR's most popular shows, a laid-back free-for-all that's only occasionally about cars. The brothers stopped doing original broadcasts two years ago, but archival material has kept their laughter on the air. A typical show featured Tom Magliozzi and Ray, 12 years his junior, taking questions from listeners about whether it was appropriate to buy a BMW roadster for a teenager, how to get the smell of a dead mouse out of an air-conditioning vent and whether relationships were worth pursuing with a partner who owned an old rattletrap. Tom Magliozzi had an old rattletrap himself, a 1963 Dodge Dart that was a constant source of fun for both brothers. In fact, most things were sources of fun for the brothers, whose uproarious laughter frequently punctuated the show. ""His laugh is the working definition of infectious laughter,"" Doug Berman, the longtime producer of ""Car Talk,"" told NPR. ""Before I ever met him, I heard him, and it wasn't on the air."" Opinion: Who won't miss 'Car Talk' laughter? ""Car Talk"" debuted in 1977 on Boston radio station WBUR. NPR picked it up in 1987. The show was drawing about 4 million listeners at the time the brothers stopped making original broadcasts in 2012. The network said in a statement that it continues to be a top-rated show. The two retired from the show in October of that year. ""We've decided that it's time to stop and smell the cappuccino,"" Ray wrote on the show's website. The two brothers didn't just talk cars. They also owned a Cambridge, Massachusetts (""our fair city,"" as they've long called their home), garage. Behind the laughter and advice were two smart men. Both Tom and Ray graduated from MIT. But after years as an engineer, Tom decided he'd had enough. ""I quit my job,"" he said. ""I became a bum. I spent two years sitting in Harvard Square drinking coffee. I invented the concept of the do-it-yourself auto repair shop, and I met my lovely wife."" The program inspired two TV shows -- one of them, ""The George Wendt Show,"" ran for one season on CBS -- and at least two books. There's also a website, cartalk.com, which features a daily car question and other information about automobiles and the brothers. NPR has been airing archival material since the Magliozzis stopped making original shows two years ago. Berman told NPR that Ray would like the shows to continue as a tribute to his brother.

"The Food and Drug Administration is making another attempt at regulating electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products. On Thursday, the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, water pipe tobacco and hookahs. Currently, only cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco come under the FDA's regulatory authority. When these recommendations are finalized following a 75-day public comment period, the age limit to buy the products is expected to be at least 18, although individual states could choose to set it higher. Health warnings would also be required, and the sale of the products in vending machines would be prohibited. Initially, the only health warning required for e-cigarettes would be about the potential for addiction to nicotine. Manufacturers would be required to register all their products and ingredients with the FDA. They would be able to market new products only after an FDA review, and they would need to provide scientific evidence before making any direct or implied claims of risk reduction associated with their product. Companies would also no longer be allowed to give out free samples. After the public comment period, and once the proposed rules are finalized, manufacturers will have 24 months to submit applications to allow their products to remain on the market or to submit new product applications. E-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor. They are usually battery-operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine. When heated, the liquid in the cartridge turns into a vapor that's inhaled. Most look like cigarettes, cigars or pipes, but some resemble pens or USB memory sticks. Because they have not been fully studied, the FDA says it's unknown what health risks they pose, how much nicotine or other chemicals are actually being inhaled, or whether there is any benefit to using them. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the percentage of high school students who reported ever using an e-cigarette more than doubled in one year, from 4.7% to 10% between 2011 and 2012. As electronic cigarettes have increased in popularity, so have the number of related calls to poison control centers nationwide. According to a recent CDC report, poison control centers logged 215 calls involving e-cigarettes in February alone. Of those calls, 51% involved children. ""It's really the wild, wild West out there,"" said Margaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner. ""Because e-cigarettes are increasingly in the marketplace. They're coming in different sizes, shapes and flavors in terms of the nicotine in them, and there's very worrisome data that show that young people in particular are starting to take up e-cigarettes, especially the flavored ones -- and that might be a gateway to other harmful tobacco products."" Hamburg said officials don't know how many types are on the market, another reason why regulation is critical. ""We're already conducting research and working with partners in the research community to better understand patterns of use of these e-cigarettes and  to learn more about the way in which they work and the delivery of the nicotine through e-cigarettes. But until we can really regulate them, we can't have all the information we need and we can't take all the actions that we might want to, to be able to best address the public health issues associated with them."" Miguel Martin, president of LogicTechnology Development -- considered the second-largest electronic cigarette company in the U.S. -- said he is encouraged by the FDA announcement. ""We look forward to being a part of this process and believe that science-based and responsible regulations are good for both adult consumers and responsible electronic cigarette manufacturers,"" Martin said. Logic opened its doors in 2010. The company has nine products on the market, both disposable and rechargeable, but no flavored nicotine products. Logic implemented rules a year ago similar to the ones the FDA has proposed. ""We support and have already implemented those steps to ensure that adult smokers are the audience and consumer base of our products,"" Martin said. ""We work with the retailers to ensure the product is sold to adult consumers of legal smoking age."" Experts have said that e-cigarettes, if properly regulated, could help reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco-related disease. But a lot of unanswered questions remain, according to Michael Eriksen, dean of the School of Public Health at Georgia State University, one of 14  U.S. institutions conducting FDA-funded research on electronic cigarettes. Nicotine is a drug, and poison experts say the concentrated liquid form used in e-cigarettes is highly toxic, even in small doses. It can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin. ""How concentrated is liquid nicotine? Are there impurities in it? Is it properly handled like a pesticide?"" Eriksen asks. ""Nicotine is a pesticide, fundamentally, and we take so many precautions about pesticides for our lawns and how to wear gloves. But what precautions do consumers take when they put the nicotine vials in? People treat it (liquid nicotine) as sugar when it's a toxin."" Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, believes nicotine is highly addictive whether used in a regular cigarette or an e-cigarette. So how safe are e-cigarettes?  Hamburg said it's buyer beware. ""We think that there's a lot of information that needs to be understood about e-cigarettes and their use.  We're trying to help provide some of that information through research that we're conducting,"" she said. ""But we need the tools that regulation provides to be able to get critical new knowledge about e-cigarettes and to be able to put in place a framework that will protect the American public and potentially e-cigarette users, and really address the issues of what are the health consequences and what are the potential benefits."" Hamburg believes these new rules will change the landscape. If the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she said, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans. But big changes could come slowly. ""It may be years before much regulation is imposed,"" said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. ""The lobbying at FDA and Congress will be intense."" And some believe the FDA has already waited too long. ""It is inexcusable that it has taken the FDA and the Administration so long to act,"" Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement. ""This delay has had serious public health consequences as these unregulated tobacco products have been marketed using tactics and sweet flavors that appeal to kids, and their use has skyrocketed. ""The FDA and the Administration must now move as quickly as possible to finalize this rule.""","E-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor .

"Washington (CNN)Vice President Joe Biden, in a closed-door meeting with black clergy in South Carolina on Tuesday, referred to himself as ""the only white boy on the east side of Wilmington"" as he recalled his days as a Delaware public defender and pressed faith leaders to elect Democrats this year. He offered a candid critique of Republicans, calling the tea party ""crazy,"" according to a detailed readout of Biden's remarks provided to CNN by a person in the room. ""This is not your father's Republican Party,"" he said, according to the source. ""This is a different breed of cat, man. I am not making a moral judgment, but I will tell you that they have no judgment."" Biden was in South Carolina for the day to support local Democrats in competitive races. But South Carolina's role as an early presidential primary state added another layer of political intrigue to his trip, one of several to the state this year. His office declined to comment on his remarks at the private meeting. Biden predicted dire consequences for Democrats if Republicans win full control of Congress in November. ""If they win again, we are going to get no consensus on anything for the next two, four, six years,"" Biden told the gathering of more than 100 ministers.  ""But if we beat some of these folks, it's going to give some spine to the Republicans who know better."" He added, ""If we win, will turn things around. There will begin to be consensus."" Biden delivers 'Elizabeth Warren-type speech' The day's public event was a rally at Allen University, a historically black university in Columbia. Before a crowd of roughly 1,000 people, Biden took sharp aim at Republicans in Congress and in the South Carolina state house, including Gov. Nikki Haley, accusing them of putting ideology over compromise. ""Your governor is denying 200,000 South Carolinians additional Medicaid because she opposes expansion,"" Biden said. But he was more blunt in the gathering with ministers.  He said Americans side with Democrats on issues from minimum wage, ""tax fairness,"" combating climate change and making climate change affordable. Pointing to the enactment of strict voter ID laws in GOP-dominated states, Biden said Republicans have been successful in discouraging Democrats, especially African-Americans, from voting. 'I'm Joe Biden and I don't like Twitter' ""What the other team has done so skillfully over the last 15 years is convince our folks that it's not worth voting,"" he said. ""Rich guys never get fooled that it's not worth voting. They always show up and vote. But they tell our folks it doesn't matter, that government doesn't work anyway."" At one point referring to himself as ""Joe Biden, progressive Democrat,"" Biden pointed to gains in manufacturing jobs under President Barack Obama, but said the middle class still ""has not come back yet."" ""You can see it in the eyes of your parishioners,"" he said. ""It's not just in black America, it's white America as well. People are wondering, when is it going to be OK?"" ""Corporate profits have soared,"" Biden said, criticizing ""these guys running hedge funds in New York."" He noted that the top 1% of earners in the United States make almost a quarter of all the money earned in the country. ""How can that possibly be fair?"" he asked. ""The biggest problem is income inequality,"" he said, echoing populist-themed remarks he made at a South Carolina fundraiser earlier this year. ""Because when income inequality spreads, economies shrink because folks don't have money to spend."" Six times Joe Biden aimed for the truth and caused a headache . Sitting next to South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, Biden talked up his political background and told the assembled audience that he ""got 98% of the African-American vote every time I ran"" in Delaware. Black voters routinely make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina. Biden pointed out that his career began as a young public defender in Delaware, representing low-income clients. That's when he called himself ""the only white boy on the east side of Wilmington."" Later in the day, Biden echoed his remarks at a fundraiser for the South Carolina Democratic Party at the home of Dick Harpootlian, a prominent local attorney and former state party chairman. About 40 people attended, including Elizabeth Colbert-Busch, the sister of comedian Stephen Colbert, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress last year. ""He gave a great speech,"" Harpootlian said. ""He said Republicans are being stymied by the extremists John Boehner that doesn't want to go against. He said that hopefully some moderates can prevail this November."" Harpootlian, who has been publicly critical of Hillary Clinton, said Biden will have a head start in South Carolina if he decides to run for president because of his previous campaigns and his longtime friendship with former Sen. Fritz Hollings. ""If he runs, there is no candidate who will have been to South Carolina as many times as he has,"" Harpootlian said. ""He has a built-in infrastructure.""","Joe Biden met with black clergy in South Carolina on Tuesday .

"""Server Not Found."" Those three ominous words -- especially for an organization in the highly competitive news business  -- were seen on computer screens nationwide as customers tried to access The New York Times website this week. The newspaper's site was crippled for more than 20 hours. A notorious group of hackers called the Syrian Electronic Army claimed responsibility. Beyond the crippling of one high-profile newspaper website, the incident has people asking broader questions about U.S. cybersecurity: How vulnerable are U.S. websites to attack? Who are our potential cyberenemies? Is there more to come? The answers aren't comforting: Computer and homeland security experts now warn of a broader cyberwar if the U.S. launches military strikes on Syria. Frank Cilluffo, director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University, believes the Syrian Electronic Army will likely strike again -- and might have help. ""If they did work with some of their allies -- with Iran, if they were to get some support from China and Russia -- then the game changes quickly,"" Cilluffo said. ""It escalates in terms of capability."" The Syrian Electronic Army might not be the most sophisticated gathering of hackers at the moment, but experts say its shown the ability to wreak plenty of havoc -- primarily with media outlets so far. Such attacks can be costly. In April, the group hacked the Twitter feed operated by the Associated Press and put out a fake message saying ""Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured."" That caused a brief panic, and stock markets plummeted temporarily. Helmi Noman, a researcher at the Munk School of Global Affairs' Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, predicts these hackers will look for more chances to exploit weaknesses in America's cybergrids. ""It's not what they want to do or could do; it's what are the available vulnerabilities out there,"" said Noman. The Syrian Electronic Army has already ably demonstrated those soft spots -- and that's by a possibly ragtag group that's not considered particularly sophisticated in the hacking world. ""The Syrian Electronic Army is a murky, underground group that has made a name for itself by plastering pro-regime propaganda across some of the Internet's most trafficked sites,"" a U.S. official told CNN. ""It's clearly a nuisance, but its tactics aren't all that sophisticated. And while the regime probably welcomes its efforts, Damascus isn't necessarily calling the shots."" ""It appears to be a loose collective of a few individuals,"" said former hacker Marc Maiffret of the group, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Maiffret, who's now chief technology officer for the cybersecurity firm Beyond Trust, also says these hackers might not have been in the game for that long. ""There's been some information put out on the Internet that (some) could be even as young as 19-year-olds."" Whatever the age of its members, the Syrian Electronic Army has recently escalated its method of attacks. Previously, cybersecurity experts say, it would only go after the direct managers of the websites it was hacking, using phishing e-mail to attempt to trick those operators into revealing their login credentials.  But earlier this month, the group targeted a search engine that directs traffic to CNN and The Washington Post. Security for the CNN.com and CNNi.com sites were not compromised. In the case of the Times attack, the Syrian group went after the larger connection chain. It's called the Domain Name System. It connects you, when you type in ""CNN.com"" or any other website, to the specific computer addresses where that content can be found. Experts say the hackers went after the managers of those connections; in this case, a firm that works with a company called Melbourne IT. The hackers tricked employees of that firm into giving up their passwords. Once they did that, many people trying to access The New York Times website were steered instead to servers controlled by the Syrian Electronic Army. That makes more than The New York Times vulnerable. ""You could basically have your computer attacked,"" said Maiffret. ""By hitting this unknown malicious website, if you had out-of-date software or out-of-date anti-virus, your computer could actually be compromised.""","The Syrian Electronic Army crippled The New York Times' website earlier this week .

"Hillary Clinton publicly backed President Barack Obama's authorization of Syrian airstrikes during a panel discussion in New York  Wednesday and attempted to dismiss previous disagreements she had with the Obama administration on Syria. Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state, said the President gave a ""very clear explanation and robust defense of the action he has ordered"" regarding airstrikes against the terrorist group ISIS in Syria and Iraq. ""The situation now is demanding a response and we are seeing a very robust response,"" Clinton said. ""It is something that I think the President is right to bring the world attention to."" The United States and a coalition of member countries conducted their second day of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on Tuesday, targeting terrorist cells and organizations in the region. The Clinton Global Initiative panel on developing children's brains was hosted by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who started the panel with a series of questions for Clinton on Syria. Clinton has not always agreed with Obama on his policies in Syria. As America's top diplomat, Clinton urged the President to arm Syrian rebels and made clear that she disagreed with Obama's decision not to arm them in her much-talked-about memoir. But on Wednesday, Clinton dismissed her previous disagreements in light of the current situation. ""Whatever the debates might have been before, this is a threat to the region and beyond,"" Clinton said.

I was on one side of the debate, others were on other side."" Earlier in the day, Clinton's husband -- former President Bill Clinton -- echoed his wife, telling CNN's Erin Burnett that he supports the airstrikes. ""I personally believe the way they have thought this through and planned it and limited our involvement, avoids ISIS achieving their objective of suckering us into their fight,"" Bill Clinton said.

"(CNN)The second Dallas health care worker who was found to have the Ebola virus should not have boarded a commercial jet Monday, health officials say. Because she had helped care for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, and because another health worker who cared for Duncan had been diagnosed with Ebola, the worker was not allowed to travel on a commercial plane with other people, said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The worker had a temperature of 99.5 Fahrenheit (37.5 Celsius) before she boarded her flight, he added. Health care workers who had been exposed to Duncan were undergoing self-monitoring. They were allowed to travel but not on a commercial plane with other people, Frieden said. Moving forward, the CDC will ensure that no one else in such a situation travels outside of a closed environment, he said. The worker is Amber Vinson, 29, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. She was confirmed to have Ebola overnight. Now, she will be transferred from the Dallas hospital to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which has successfully treated two other patients. It is now treating a third: a male health care worker who was infected in Sierra Leone. Vinson is ""ill but clinically stable,"" Frieden said. The first Dallas health care worker with Ebola, Nina Pham, is in ""improved condition,"" Frieden said. It has not been determined whether she will be transferred to another facility. Both Dallas health workers had ""extensive contact"" with Duncan on October 28-30, when he had ""extensive production of body fluids"" such as vomit and diarrhea, Frieden told reporters in a conference call. CDC wants to interview passengers . The risk of exposure to the passengers who were on the plane with Vinson is low, since she did not yet have symptoms, health officials said Wednesday. The Ebola virus is not contagious before symptoms set in. Still, the CDC wants to interview all 132 passengers who were on the plane with her. ""Because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning, CDC is reaching out to passengers who flew on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth Oct. 13,"" the CDC said in a statement. The flight landed Monday at 8:16 p.m. CT. The woman ""exhibited no symptoms or sign of illness while on Flight 1143, according to the crew,"" Frontier Airlines said in a statement. Earlier, Vinson flew from Dallas-Fort Worth to Cleveland on Frontier Flight 1142 on October 10. The airline said customers who may have traveled on either flight should contact the CDC at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). But the CDC statement, contained in the same news release, said the CDC wanted to speak only with passengers of the October 13 flight. The CDC later confirmed to CNN that it is ""only interested"" in the passengers on Flight 1143. The October 13 flight was cleaned thoroughly after it landed, ""per our normal procedures which is consistent with CDC guidelines,"" the airline said. After the airline was informed of the Ebola patient, the plane was removed from service. In a sign of growing concerns about Ebola, President Obama canceled trips to New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday to convene a meeting at the White House of Cabinet agencies coordinating the government's response to the outbreak. Hospital denies 'institutional problem' Vinson, who lives alone, is in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The news that she contracted Ebola cast further doubt on the hospital's ability to handle the virus and protect employees. It's the same hospital that initially sent Thomas Eric Duncan home, even though he had a fever and had traveled from West Africa. By the time he returned to the hospital, his symptoms had worsened. He died while being treated by medical staff, including the two women who have now contracted the disease. ""I don't think we have a systematic institutional problem,"" Dr. Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, told reporters Wednesday, facing questions about the hospital's actions. Medical staff ""may have done some things differently with the benefit of what we know today,"" he said, adding, ""no one wants to get this right more than our hospital."" People in the health care worker's office building were informed when officials went door to door, and also through early morning reverse 911 calls, officials said. The health care worker had no pets, authorities said. Growing concerns about the spread of Ebola . More than 120 being monitored . Seventy-five health care workers in Dallas are being monitored for any Ebola symptoms, Varga said. Separately, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, who is overseeing the response efforts, said 48 other people in the community still are being monitored after having contact with Duncan, who was Dallas' first Ebola patient. Those 48 are asymptomatic, and Sunday will mark the end of the window in which they could get sick. The second worker reported a fever Tuesday and was immediately isolated, health department spokeswoman Carrie Williams said. The virus is not contagious before there are symptoms. A preliminary Ebola test was done late Tuesday at the state public health laboratory in Austin, and the results came back around midnight. A second test will be conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ""Health officials have interviewed the latest patient to quickly identify any contacts or potential exposures, and those people will be monitored,"" the health department said. The worker's apartment and car will be cleaned Wednesday, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said. Rick Perry heads to Europe despite Ebola situation . Official: Duncan should have been moved . An official close to the situation says that in hindsight, Duncan should have been transferred immediately to either Emory University Hospital in Atlanta or Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Those hospitals are among only four in the country that have biocontainment units and have been preparing for years to treat a highly infectious disease like Ebola. ""If we knew then what we know now about this hospital's ability to safely care for these patients, then we would have transferred him to Emory or Nebraska,"" the official told CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""I think there are hospitals that are more than ready, but I think there are some that are not."" Troubling allegations . Also Tuesday, National Nurses United made troubling allegations about the hospital, claiming ""guidelines were constantly changing"" and ""there were no protocols"" about how to deal with the deadly virus."" ""The protocols that should have been in place in Dallas were not in place, and that those protocols are not in place anywhere in the United States as far as we can tell,"" NNU Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro said. ""We're deeply alarmed."" Nurses were told to wrap their necks with medical tape when equipment left their necks exposed; they felt unsupported and unprepared, and they received no hands-on training, union co-president Deborah Burger said. A Texas Health Presbyterian spokesman did not respond to the specific allegations but said patient and employee safety is the hospital's top priority. Global epidemic . While the Texas hospital deals with its third Ebola patient, the situation in West Africa is getting increasingly dire. A total of 4,493 people are confirmed to have died from Ebola this year, from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. There could be 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea by the end of this year as the outbreak spreads, the WHO warned Tuesday. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","The second Dallas health care worker with Ebola will be moved to Atlanta on Wednesday .

"Eileen Brennan, who earned an Oscar nomination for her hilarious turn as the exasperated drill captain in 1980's ""Private Benjamin,"" has died, CNN has confirmed. She was 80. Brennan died Sunday at her Burbank, California, home after a battle with bladder cancer, her management company said. ""Our family is so grateful for the outpouring of love and respect for Eileen,"" her family said in a statement. ""She was funny and caring and truly one of a kind.  Her strength and love will never be forgotten.  She will be greatly missed by all of us."" Brennan was known for character roles as sassy, brassy women, the kind with a sandpaper surface but a light, pure heart. She played a waitress in ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971), the companion of Paul Newman's conman in ""The Sting"" (1973), a wisecracking maid in ""At Long Last Love"" (1975) and Mrs. Peacock in ""Clue"" (1985). She also did a great deal of television, including a reprise of her ""Private Benjamin"" role in the TV series of the same name. Other TV appearances included guest shots on ""Taxi,"" ""thirtysomething,"" ""ER,"" ""Murder, She Wrote,"" ""Mad About You,"" ""Touched by an Angel"" and six episodes of ""Will & Grace."" The latter earned her an Emmy nomination, one of seven she earned in her career -- including one that resulted in a win, a supporting actress-comedy pick for ""Private Benjamin."" Verla Eileen Regina Brennan was born in Los Angeles in 1932, the daughter of a doctor and a silent-film actress. After several small stage roles, she finally earned notice for her 1959 off-Broadway turn as ""Little Mary Sunshine,"" for which she won an Obie. Five years later, she gained fame for her performance as Irene Molloy, one of the woman who falls victim to Dolly Levi's matchmaking skills, in the 1960s hit musical ""Hello, Dolly!"" In 1982, Brennan was involved in a horrific accident, struck by a car as she exited a restaurant with ""Benjamin"" co-star Goldie Hawn. She suffered broken bones in her face, an eyeball pulled from its socket and two broken legs. Even after recovering physically -- a process that took years -- she suffered from an addiction to painkillers and entered the Betty Ford Clinic in 1984. ""It was my only hope,"" Brennan told People magazine in 1985. ""I had reached the stage where I was taking anything I could get my hands on."" Typical of her upbeat attitude, however, she told the magazine she took pride in her recovery. ""Everyone hits bottom their own way,"" she said. ""Mine came through my accident, which led to my pill addiction, which led to my birth. I say birth rather than rebirth because I feel born new. I re-established a spiritual connection that is lost when you are taking any kind of drug. Strangely enough I wouldn't have missed my accident. It just knocks me out to say that, but I mean it."" Brennan also survived a bout with breast cancer in 1990. Brennan was married to David John Lampson from 1968 to 1974. She is survived by two sons, Patrick Brennan and Sam Lampson.

"A ""massive and unprecedented"" assault against al Qaeda fighters in Yemen appears to be targeting high-level operatives of the terrorist network, U.S. analysts said Monday. It wasn't clear who those targets are, but Yemen's government says it has killed dozens of members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in a joint operation with the United States. The ongoing push included a Sunday night ambush in which Yemeni special forces killed men believed to be top leaders of the group, a high-level Yemeni government official being briefed on the strikes told CNN on Monday. The Yemenis collected the bodies and will perform DNA testing to determine the militants' identities, the official said. In addition, suspected U.S. drone strikes over the weekend pounded a mountain camp where al Qaeda fighters were training for attacks ""against Yemeni and foreign interests,"" Yemen's Supreme Security Committee said. U.S. authorities blame the Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda for a string of plots against Americans, including the failed attempt to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner with a bomb concealed in an operative's underwear in 2009. CNN National Security Analyst Fran Townsend said the intensity of the strikes suggests there's a ""very real"" hope of capturing or killing a top al Qaeda figure. ""The fact that this is an ongoing effort with such massive resources behind it tells you that the target is a very high-value target,"" Townsend said. ""You don't commit the Yemeni army, you don't commit the drones without the target being very real."" By Monday night, at least 65 militants have been killed, some of them from neighboring Saudi Arabia, Yemeni officials said. Another three civilians were killed in a Saturday night drone strike, the high-level Yemeni official said earlier. 'Massive and unprecedented' The official called the raids ""massive and unprecedented."" One of the sites targeted is in the same area where scores of al Qaeda followers had gathered recently to hear from Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the head of the terrorist network's Yemeni branch and the global organization's ""crown prince,"" the official said. In addition to the ""undiebomber"" plot on Christmas Day 2009, U.S. officials have said AQAP was behind a 2010 plan to load bombs onto cargo planes disguised as computer printers, another plot to blow up a jetliner in 2012 and a 2013 scheme to attack oil and gas ports in Yemen. Its chief bomb designer, Ibrahim al-Asiri, is believed to have dispatched his own brother in a 2009 attempt to kill Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism chief. Al-Asiri is one of the main reasons AQAP has become ""a direct threat"" to the United States, Townsend said. Speculation swirled Monday that he was among the targets of the weekend's attacks, but Yemeni officials have so far identified only three men they said were midlevel leaders of the group. Previous U.S. strikes have killed radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and Fahd al Quso, an al Qaeda operative wanted in the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in 2000. The high-level Yemeni government official would not confirm whether drones were used in the weekend attacks, but the United States is the only country known to have conducted drone strikes in Yemen. As a rule, U.S. officials don't comment on those strikes, and Washington had little to say about the operation Monday. ""We support the Yemeni government's efforts to tackle terrorism within their own borders,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. ""And beyond that, for details of these reported incidents, I would refer you to the Yemeni government."" Growing frustration in Yemen . The high-level Yemeni official said it would take time to clarify the details of Sunday's strikes: whether the raids targeted camps, vehicles on the move or both, the full death toll among the militants and whether there were any civilian casualties. But other Yemeni officials, who asked to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak to the media, said there was growing frustration within the government about the lack of clarity and expressed concern that some of the information the military is reporting may be propaganda. ""I'm worried this is an attempt to convince Yemenis that the U.S. and Yemen have turned a corner and are in the process of destroying AQAP,"" one of those other officials said. ""At this hour, the numbers of militants being reported as being killed keeps changing, and we still aren't sure if any civilians have been killed or wounded in these strikes."" He added, ""Yemenis are smart enough to doubt initial reports of this type. If this does turn out to be exaggeration, it will make the people here trust their government even less than they do and fuel growing anger over the drone program."" The United States first used armed drones to pick off an al Qaeda operative in Yemen in 2002. Strikes on suspected al Qaeda figures resumed in 2009, with more than 92 drone attacks since then, as well as a further 15 U.S. strikes using other forms of weaponry such as cruise missiles, according to a count by the New America Foundation, a U.S.-based think tank that tracks the raids. As of Monday, U.S. drone and air strikes have killed an estimated 753 to 965 people in Yemen, of whom the large majority were militants, but at least 81 were civilians, according to the New America Foundation study. Did the United States miss top al Qaeda meeting in Yemen?","At least 65 militants killed since Saturday, Yemeni officials say .

"McDonald's restaurants in many Chinese cities have been eerily quiet this past week. The fast food giant is enormously popular in China where it has 2,000 outlets, each one typically overflowing with hungry crowds. But many McDonald's addicts have been forced to go cold turkey as numerous branches have yanked flagship burgers off the menu amid a tainted meat scandal. The food scare broke when a video surfaced in Chinese media last week, showing appalling practices in a Shanghai food-processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands. Since then, the tainted meat supply has been found to reach across China, all the way to Hong Kong, and even to Japan. How was the scandal uncovered? A reporter from a Shanghai broadcaster secretly filmed inside the food processing plant of Shanghai Husi Food, a subsidiary of U.S.-based food supply giant OSI Group. The footage captured workers handling food with their bare hands. Several scenes showed them picking up meat that had fallen on the floor and returning it directly into the processing machine. One worker, his face concealed behind a surgical mask, turned to the camera and stated, ""foul meat,"" referring to the meat being handled. Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) subsequently investigated the factory and found that expired beef and chicken products were processed and repackaged with new expiration dates. Amongst the tainted products, they were able to trace forged production dates on more than 4,300 cases of smoked beef patties, with more than 3,000 cases already sold. Who was affected? Husi had been supplying chicken and beef products to branches of McDonald's, Papa John's, Burger King, Starbucks, KFC, and Pizza Hut in several cities in China. Since the scandal broke, all the brands have cut ties with Husi's parent company OSI Group, except for McDonald's. The golden arches will continue to work with the food supplier in China, eventually shifting to a Husi food plant in Henan province, which was described as the ""newest state-of-the-art facility"" by OSI CEO Sheldon Lavin. McDonald's has worked with OSI for more than half a century internationally, and for more than 22 years in mainland China, a spokesperson surnamed Xu told CNN. Meanwhile, beef and chicken products at most McDonald's in northern and central China are unavailable. Branches in southern China, which use a different meat supplier, are largely unaffected. Xu also said the products will slowly return to menus after August 3. In Hong Kong, McDonald's previously stated that it does not use products from Husi. It later backtracked the claim after local government issued a ban on the import and sales of Husi products. As a result of the ban, chicken nuggets, chicken filets, as well as several vegetable products and iced lemon tea are now temporarily unavailable at the city's McDonald's branches. Japan's McDonald's have also been affected as 20% of the meat for chicken nuggets there were supplied by Husi. It has since stopped importing chicken from China and introduced a tofu and fish version of the McNugget. The scandal has led to ""negative impact on sales and consumer confidence,"" the company's Japanese unit said in a statement. ""Our sales and profit expectations have been reduced."" Who was held responsible? Although no one has fallen sick as a direct result of the tainted meat supply, Shanghai's FDA has closed the Husi plant at the center of the scandal, and detained five employees for questioning. Meanwhile, Shanghai's top official has pledged to mete out ""severe punishment"" for anyone involved in the incident, China Daily reported. OSI Group is conducting its own internal investigation, promising ""swift and decisive action"" against those responsible. It has also announced a number of organizational changes that it says will better ensure food safety at its China subsidiaries. This includes taking the previously separate and decentralized China operations and shifting them under the global management umbrella. It will also launch an Asia Quality Control Center in Shanghai and a three-year, RMB 10 million ($1.6 million) food safety campaign. Is China doing enough for food safety? Food safety has long been a top concern for China, affecting domestic and foreign companies. In 2008, a major scandal erupted over tainted infant formula that killed several babies and left thousands more ill. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart recalled donkey meat after it was found to be contaminated with fox meat. Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, has just emerged from a food safety scandal that began in late 2012. The latest Husi scandal comes amid a revision of China's food safety laws. Earlier this month, the National People's Congress released a draft version of the law on its website, seeking public opinion. It promised harsher punishment for offenders. ""Over past years, punishment for food safety violators has been increased but it still lags far behind that in developed countries. There should be much higher punishment for offenders,"" an anonymous industry insider told China Daily.","Expired meat was repackaged and sold to fast food chains in China .
McDonald's is the only brand that will continue to work with the meat supplier .

"President Barack Obama responded to outrage by European leaders over revelations of alleged U.S. spying on them by saying Monday that all nations, including those expressing the strongest protests, collect intelligence on each other. The German news magazine Der Spiegel reported Sunday that classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden detailed NSA bugging of European Union offices in Washington and New York, as well as an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels. Mounting anger throughout Europe on Monday included a threat by French President Francois Hollande to halt talks with the United States on trade and other issues unless the bugging stopped. U.S. and EU officials are scheduled to begin talks on a proposed trans-Atlantic free trade agreement next week. The European Commission will sweep its offices for electronic listening devices and other security breaches, a spokeswoman said Monday. Asked at a news conference in Tanzania about the latest leaks involving Snowden, Obama said he needed more information on the specific programs cited in the Der Spiegel report, but made clear such spying was commonplace. ""I guarantee you that in European capitals, there are people who are interested in, if not what I had for breakfast, at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with their leaders,"" Obama said. ""That is how intelligence services operate."" Opinion: U.S. intelligence community is out of control . Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin opened the door on Monday to Snowden possibly staying in Russia. The admitted NSA leaker has been in the international transit lounge of the Moscow airport seeking asylum in Ecuador. Snowden ""must stop his work aimed at harming our American partners"" if he wants to stay in Russia, Putin said. Previously, Putin had said Snowden should depart the airport for his final destination, wherever it might be. Conflicting reports emerged Monday that Snowden was seeking asylum in Russia. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell was unable to provide clarity to reporters. ""We don't have information one way or another"" about an asylum request for Russia, Ventrell said, later adding that Snowden ""appears to still be in Russia and our position is the same that he should be expelled and returned home here to the U.S."" Obama said Monday that Snowden had traveled to Russia without a valid passport or legal papers, and he hoped that Moscow would handle the case as it would any other travel-related matter. The president confirmed that the United States and Russia have had ""high-level"" discussions about Snowden, after an earlier report from Russia that the two nations' top law enforcement officials were working together to resolve the situation. The new bugging controversy follows earlier European discontent over revelations of U.S. surveillance of overseas e-mails related to terrorism, as well as the collection of phone records as a database for  further court-approved investigation. Obama sought to distinguish between what he portrayed as normal intelligence-gathering and the specific anti-terrorism programs disclosed by Snowden's earlier leaks to The Guardian newspaper in London and the Washington Post. In the end, he said, U.S. and European allies ""work so closely together that there is almost no information that is not shared between our various countries."" Hollande, however, said bugging of EU offices went beyond the anti-terrorism programs previously revealed and must stop immediately before negotiations can go forward. ""We know that there are systems which have to control notably for the threat against terrorism, but I do not think that this is in our embassies or in the EU that this risks exist,"" he said. Der Spiegel reported the allegations Sunday, citing information from secret documents obtained by Snowden and ""in part seen"" by the news magazine. In Brussels, Der Spiegel says, the agency targeted the Justus Lipsius Building, which houses the European Council and the EU Council of Ministers, the union's main decision-making and legislative body. And in Washington, the magazine report claims, the NSA installed bugs in the European Union's building and infiltrated its computer network. To Michael Hayden, a former director of the NSA and CIA, the report reflected the reality of international spying. ""Any European who wants to go out and rend their garments with regard to international espionage should look first and find out what their governments are doing,"" he told CBS on Sunday. Obama declined to comment in-depth on the Der Spiegel article, saying his staff needs to analyze the report to figure out which, if any, U.S. surveillance programs it involved. ""When we have an answer we will make sure to provide all the information that our allies want in what exactly the allegations have been,"" he said. Describing himself as ""the end user of this kind of intelligence,"" Obama said he telephones Hollande or German Chancellor Angela Merkel or British Prime Minister David Cameron if he wants to know what they're thinking. ""Ultimately, you know, we work so closely together that there is almost no information that is not shared between our various countries,"" Obama said. 'Unbowed' Snowden seeks new havens . Reactions abroad . The reports elicited particular outrage in Germany, where Der Spiegel reported that NSA spying had targeted telephone and Internet connection data in Germany more than any other European nation. Citing the Snowden documents, the news magazine reported that an average of up to 20 million phone connections and 10 million Internet data connections are surveyed daily. Der Spiegel noted that the intensity of surveillance puts the U.S. ally on par with China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Merkel's spokesman, Steffan Seibert, cautioned Monday against taking the report as fact without further confirmation. ""If it is, though, confirmed that diplomatic representations of the EU and some European countries were spied upon, we have to say clearly: The bugging of friends is unacceptable,"" Seibert said. ""That cannot happen at all. We are no longer in the Cold War."" The German and French foreign ministries planned to meet with the U.S. ambassadors to those countries to talk about the allegations. The Italian Foreign Ministry called the reports ""a very thorny affair,"" while European Parliament President Martin Schulz said Sunday he was ""deeply worried and shocked"" by the claims. ""If the allegations prove to be true, it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on EU-U.S. relations,"" he said. Another report Sunday claimed that surveillance extended beyond European offices. The Guardian newspaper reported that one NSA document leaked by Snowden describes 38 embassies and missions as ""targets"" and details surveillance methods that include planting bugs in communications equipment and collecting transmissions with specialized antennae. Targets included France, Italy, Greece, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, India and Turkey, according to The Guardian. CNN has not independently confirmed the allegations in the reports from Der Spiegel and The Guardian. What the U.S. has to say . The U.S. Director of National Intelligence's office declined to comment Sunday on specific allegations published in Der Spiegel. Obama: Pay no attention to that man we can't capture . ""The United States government will respond appropriately to the European Union through our diplomatic channels, and through the EU/U.S. experts' dialogue on intelligence that the U.S. proposed several weeks ago,"" the DNI office said in a statement. ""We will also discuss these issues bilaterally with EU member states. While we are not going to comment publicly on specific alleged intelligence activities, as a matter of policy, we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations."" Ventrell referred to the DNI statement Monday, repeatedly telling reporters that the United States would deal directly with European allies on the matter instead of making public statements. U.S. asks Ecuador to reject any asylum request from Snowden . Snowden has revealed himself as the source of documents outlining a massive effort by the NSA to track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and Internet traffic of virtually all Americans. Now Snowden faces espionage charges in the United States and was seeking asylum from Ecuador. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador ""to please reject"" the request for asylum, according to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa. Father proposes deal for Snowden's voluntary return . Snowden and his asylum bid . On Saturday night, Correa said the ball was in Russia's court. ""In order to process this request, he needs to be in Ecuadorian territory,"" Correa said in an interview with Ecuador's Oromar TV on Saturday night.

"Paris (CNN)A man arrested after a knife attack on two soldiers on the streets of Nice in southern France was already known to intelligence services as having been radicalized, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Wednesday. The suspect, named by the Nice mayor's office as Moussa Coulibaly, 30, attacked a soldier and a comrade who came to his aid on Tuesday as they patrolled near a Jewish community center. They were slightly injured. Intelligence services had detected the suspect's radicalization in the Yvelines area, west of Paris, Cazeneuve said. They informed the General Directorate of Internal Security, or DGSI. The notification meant that when the suspect got on a plane to Turkey last month, an alert was raised, and Turkish authorities expelled him, Cazeneuve said. The DGSI questioned him but was not at that time able to establish any criminal acts in the works or a legal case against him, the minister said. Days later, while the DGSI was still looking into why he was in Nice, Coulibaly allegedly carried out Tuesday's attack. The authorities are conducting searches and have taken people into custody as they seek to pin down the suspect's profile, Cazeneuve said. According to CNN affiliate BFMTV, Coulibaly was from the Paris area, where he was handed prison time and fines between 2006 and 2009 for offenses, including shoplifting, violence and drug abuse. An official in the Turkish prime ministry told CNN on Tuesday that French intelligence was aware of Coulibaly and had alerted Turkish officials when he flew to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport from Rome on Thursday. He was put on a flight back to Rome that same day, the source said. The suspect shares the same last name as one of the three terrorists behind last month's deadly attacks in and around Paris. Officials cannot confirm he's related to Amedy Coulibaly, the man who killed a police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge, then took hostages in a kosher grocery in the French capital, a standoff that ended with him and four hostages dead. Coulibaly is a common name for families of Malian descent. The soldiers attacked were among the French military forces who have been out on the streets around sensitive sites following last month's terror attacks that included the massacre at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Philippe Pradal, Nice's deputy head of security, told BFMTV that the assailant initially didn't do much harm because the soldier he attacked had on a bulletproof vest. ""After realizing the inefficiency of his stabs ... he tried to hurt him in the face,"" Pradal said. The attacker injured another soldier trying to assist before he was stopped, with help from a passer-by, public transit officers and municipal police. CNN's Sandrine Amiel reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Ariana Williams, Margot Haddad, Alexander Felton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","French interior minister says the suspect was on the radar of intelligence services .

"Concerns about even remote chances of Ebola exposure rippled Friday from a U.S. airline to a cruise ship off Belize, with Frontier contacting hundreds who flew with an infected nurse and Carnival quarantining a health worker only tangentially linked to an Ebola patient's care. The airline's move relates to Amber Vinson, a Dallas nurse who treated an Ebola patient and then was diagnosed with the virus this week after flying round trip between Dallas and Cleveland. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said Thursday she could have had symptoms earlier than believed -- a period possibly covering her two flights on Frontier Airlines. Frontier spokesman Todd Lehmacher said that, by early Friday evening, airline officials had contacted as many as 800 passengers, including those on Vinson's October 10 flight to Cleveland, her October 13 return flight to Dallas and five other trips taken by the latter plane before it was taken out of service. The CDC, even as it said these passengers have an extremely low chance of getting Ebola, is reaching out to those on Vinson's flights. Vinson is one of two nurses at Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital who became ill with Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who was the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States and died October 8. She was hospitalized Tuesday, one day after her return flight from Ohio, where she was visiting family and planning her wedding. Vinson was moved Wednesday  to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. The other nurse, Nina Pham, is being treated at a National Institutes of Health facility in Maryland. Authorities initially said Vinson had a slightly elevated temperature of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 Celsius), which was below the fever threshold for Ebola, but didn't show any Ebola symptoms on her Monday flight. This is significant because a person isn't contagious with Ebola, which spreads through the transmission of bodily fluids, until he or she has symptoms of the disease. Her uncle, Lawrence Vinson, said Thursday night his niece didn't feel sick until the morning after her return to Dallas. And the CDC's Dr. Chris Braden said Friday that Vinson didn't have classic Ebola symptoms like a sore throat, fever or muscle aches on her trip. But Braden said that she may have started feeling off on October 11, and investigators couldn't rule out her illness starting the previous day -- when she flew from Texas to Ohio. ""She rested for a long time on some days; she said she felt funny,"" he said of Vinson's state during her trip. ""Those types of things, but nothing specific."" Ebola in U.S.: Who has it, who doesn't, who might . Belize refuses to let possible Ebola case disembark . The Frontier passengers and crew members aren't the only ones to find themselves thrust into the Ebola story. So, too, are 16 people being monitored in northeast Ohio -- including two employees at a bridal store Vinson visited -- because they were in the vicinity of or had contact with her, health officials there say. There also are 48 people who had contact with Duncan in Texas before he was hospitalized. Their 21-day monitoring period, during which their movement has been restricted, will end Sunday, at the latest. ""Monday afternoon is when we're going to start piecing our lives together,"" Aaron Yah said. Yah said he is the husband of Youngor Jallah, the daughter of Duncan's fiancee. Yah said he hadn't been able to go to work the past three weeks. Then there are the 76 health care workers involved in Duncan's treatment, one of whom is now in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and a diplomatic kerfuffle. That Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital worker did not have direct contact with Duncan, but ""may have had contact with his specimen,"" the U.S. State Department said on Friday. It has been 19 days since that may have happened -- two days shy of the maximum 21-day Ebola incubation period. Carnival CEO Arnold Donald told CNN's Richard Quest the woman is a lab supervisor and ""has no symptoms whatsoever."" Even so, she was isolated on the ship. ""We have a lot of experience in the cruise industry,"" said Donald, citing diseases such as SARS, H1N1 and the flu. ""... The CDC has protocols in place; we're following those protocols."" The vessel is heading back to Galveston, Texas, with the passenger on board. But that's not what the U.S. government wanted. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the plan was for the passenger to get on land in Belize, then be flown back to the United States. The Belize government refused to let the passenger leave the ship, given the potential Ebola exposure, despite a plea from U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to Belize Prime Minister Dean Barrow. ""There's a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of fear about this disease, much of it not rooted in actual facts,"" Harf said, adding that Belize authorities ""could have handled (this situation) differently."" Belize's government responded Friday night, in a statement in which it also announced it is barring travel from Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria, by saying it ""regrets (being) unable to move"" the Dallas hospital worker ""and her traveling companion"" onshore for evacuation from an international airport. ""This decision was made out of preponderance of caution for the welfare of the citizens and residents of Belize,"" said the government, which didn't dispute that the passenger was low risk. Nurse: My neck was exposed . All but a few of the thousands of documented Ebola cases originated in West Africa. Yet it's the two cases that spread here -- Vinson and Pham -- that have caused a fury in Texas, fueling fears and complaints about the procedures meant to keep health care workers safe. One of those affected is Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse Briana Aguirre. She said Thursday that the Dallas hospital didn't give her proper gear while she cared for Pham, even though it was more than a week into the Ebola response there. Aguirre told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the gear she was given -- when she cared for Pham for one day -- included a Tyvex suit, gloves and booties that covered most of her body, but not her neck. ""I just told them, 'Why would an area so close to my mouth and my nose ... be exposed?' "" Aguirre told Cooper. ""And they didn't have an answer."" She said she asked supervisors about new gear and was told it had been ordered. But she said the better equipment should have been procured more quickly, and raised concerns for her colleagues who were more involved in Ebola care. ""I just know that the (two) nurses that have been infected, they were dealing with the same equipment while they were dealing with so much more than I dealt with personally,"" she said. ""They put their lives on the line and without the proper equipment."" She also said that prior to Duncan's arrival in late September, nurses at the hospital had no mandatory Ebola training and only an optional seminar. The hospital has said its professionals wore equipment consistent with CDC guidelines at the time. Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC's director, admitted at a congressional hearing Wednesday that ""some forms of"" health care workers' protective equipment ""did allow exposure of some parts of the skin."" Given such concerns and the fact Pham and Vinson got Ebola at work, the CDC ""very soon"" will put out updated guidelines on putting on and removing protective gowns, masks, gloves and other gear, agency spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said Friday. Kerry: 'We have to do more' in West Africa . There have been eight confirmed cases of Ebola in the United States: Duncan, three missionaries, an NBC News freelance cameraman and a World Health Organization doctor infected in Africa, plus the two Texas nurses. The missionaries have all been released from hospitals, while the others are being cared for at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, Nebraska Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health hospital in suburban Washington. U.S. authorities' response goes well beyond providing medical care. Federal, state and local governments, Customs and Border Protection, various health agencies and even the U.S. military have all played a part in the response so far. Thousands of American troops will help in West Africa, performing duties such as flying in supplies, building field hospitals and helping local authorities with logistics. Several U.S. military officials told CNN on Friday that the Defense Department is considering sending anywhere from a dozen to 100 of its health care professionals to help CDC officials in the region. The Obama administration also will appoint Ron Klain -- former chief of staff to Vice Presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore -- as his ""Ebola czar"" in an effort to help streamline America's response. There's also a press to recruit other countries to devote their own resources and money to help stem the months-long outbreak in West Africa, where all but a few of the roughly 9,200 reported Ebola cases and 4,555 deaths have occurred, according to the World Health Organization. Kerry, the U.S. secretary of state, expressed disappointment Friday in the international response, saying ""we are barely one-third of the way"" to hitting the United Nations' $1 billion fundraising goal for the Ebola fight. ""We have to do more and we have to do it quickly,"" Kerry said. ""... If we don't adequately address this current outbreak now, then Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio that we will end up fighting -- all of us -- for decades.""","Belize: Passenger with Ebola link not let in ""out of preponderance of caution""

"(CNN)I can't believe I'm writing this, but: California, you've got a heck of a lot to learn from Mississippi. Not in terms of per capita income, obesity rates or LGBT rights. It's well-known that Mississippi falls at or near the bottom of 50-state rankings for a range of social and health indicators. But there's at least one stat where the Magnolia State shines: Its vaccination rate. A staggering 99.7% of kindergartners in Mississippi are vaccinated for measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's the highest rate in the nation. In California, the rate is only 92.3%. (Colorado, meanwhile, has the lowest rate, at 81.7%.) Those numbers are significant. Even a very small percentage of unvaccinated kids can contribute to an outbreak, especially if they're concentrated in a single community, as is often the case in high-end, hippy-dippy California. According to the San Jose Mercury News, 87% of kindergartners at the Berkeley Rose School, for example, had exemptions from vaccination. Parents at the school ""seek more alternative health care,"" a spokeswoman told that newspaper. Well, they're choosing an unsafe alternative -- one that puts their kids, and, importantly, all kids in the community, at greater risk. They shouldn't be allowed to do so. Those risks should be abundantly clear given the outbreak of measles that started at Disneyland. From January 1 to January 30, there were 102 cases of measles reported across 14 states. It's time for California's Gov. Jerry Brown to stand up to the so-called anti-vaxxer crowd. He has a moral responsibility to push for vaccine policies that are more like Mississippi's. It's clear, after all, that policies are what make the difference. Parents in California can exempt their children from life-saving vaccines because of philosophical or religious reasons. More-religious Mississippi, meanwhile, offers neither. It's one of only two states -- the other is West Virginia, with a 96.1% measles vaccination rate -- that requires parents to vaccinate their children unless they have a medical reason not to. The result: It's easy for misinformed parents to skip vaccinations in California. In Mississippi, it's hard. I'm not a scientist, but I do trust scientists. And if you listen to them, you know that higher vaccination rates make kids safer. As CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has reported, vaccines do not pose a danger to children. They do not cause autism. Sure, there is always a slight risk of an allergic reaction or other complication. But the risk of serious allergic reaction to the measles vaccine, according to the CDC, is less in 1 in a million. Gupta smartly puts that in context: ""It is worth pointing out that 12 out of 10,000 people who take an aspirin are at risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain. People who regularly take too much acetaminophen (Tylenol) are the largest group of people hospitalized for acute liver failure. And, on average, one person in the United States dies every year from H20 intoxication, or drinking too much water. And yet, no armies have formed against aspirin, Tylenol or water."" All 50 states offer the medical exemption, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That makes sense. Some children, such as those with cancer, cannot be safely vaccinated. But 48 of them offer religious exemptions. And 20 states -- California among them -- grant ""philosophical exemptions for those who object to immunizations because of personal, moral or other beliefs,"" NCSL says. These laws cave to the anti-science, anti-vaccine movement. And they create unnecessary public health risks. In California, it's relatively easy for parents to obtain exemptions based on their personal beliefs. ""Legislators tried in 2012 to make it tougher for parents to bypass vaccines, requiring counseling and signatures from health care professionals to gain an exemption,"" the San Jose Mercury News reports. ""But two loopholes left it easy for parents to opt out: Counseling can be given by naturopaths, who practice alternative medicine and typically oppose vaccination. (And) people who oppose vaccination because of religious beliefs can skip counseling, a policy change that (California) Governor Jerry Brown instituted when he signed the updated law."" In an e-mail, Brown's press secretary, Evan Westrup, told me that ""the Governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit."" He cited data showing the kindergarten immunization rate for measles is up very slightly (from 92.3% to 92.6%) in the wake of the 2012 law. And ""personal belief exemptions"" are down from 3.15% to 2.54%. ""It clearly has had an impact on exemptions in terms of providing parents with more information,"" Westrup said of the 2012 law. It's also clearly not enough. Two lawmakers in California are proposing legislation that would limit parents' ability to claim ""personal belief"" exemptions from shots, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. It's unclear if the bill would eliminate religious exemptions, as well, according to that network. It should. And I hope the bill will be the subject of much debate. For now, however, personal choice and fear are trumping reason in California. ""It's good to explore alternatives rather than go with the panic of everyone around you,"" a California parent told The New York Times. ""Vaccines don't feel right for me and my family."" It doesn't matter what ""feels right."" It matters what's real. Vaccines don't cause autism. They save lives. And allowing parents to act on such misguided ""beliefs"" is negligent. California needs to take a cue from Mississippi and remove its vaccine exemptions.","John Sutter: California should boost its vaccine laws .

"As a plume of black smoke billowed from Asiana Airlines flight 214 after it crash landed at San Francisco International Airport last week, images were being captured -- not just of the plane itself, but of passengers ignoring official safety procedures and collecting their carry-on items before evacuating the aircraft. A photograph that showed several passengers, including a woman walking away from the smoking wreckage with a black suitcase and smaller white bag in her hands, has been widely circulated. The photo and reports of similar behavior have stirred up a stormy debate across China's social media platforms -- Chinese nationals made up approximately half the passengers on the Asiana Airlines flight that originated in Seoul, according to the airline. ""I am so disappointed those passengers think their baggage is more important than other people's lives,"" posted ""MeganZhong,"" on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. ""And they had time to tweet the plane crash (before) helping others that are injured."" ""Foreigners (especially Americans) don't understand that in China, human lives are cheaper than money,"" posted another, called ""Victory of Xiangzi."" ""And this belief is deeply ingrained in the mentality of the Chinese government and its people."" A similar tone and theme was prevalent across Weibo but other netizens defended the passengers. ""Grabbing the bag is an instinct response,"" wrote ""Jiqiongqiong."" ""But as Chinese, we should always keep in mind that human lives weigh more than our belongings."" Did pilot have enough 777 experience? Communication problems? Many commenters chided passengers who did not read the aircraft's safety briefing card or pay attention to verbal safety instructions. Part of the investigation into the incident will look at Asiana crew members' verbal instructions during the emergency, what languages those instructions were in and how passengers responded. There can be no denying such an event can be chaotic and potentially confusing. According to the airline, flight attendants helped passengers get off the plane safely. They opened doors, deployed slides and helped passengers escape, according to JoongAng Daily, a South Korean newspaper. Safety information available online from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) emphatically capitalizes the instruction to ""LEAVE YOUR POSSESSIONS BEHIND"" under its evacuation procedures. Passengers are also instructed to: . -- stay low . -- proceed to the nearest front or rear exit -- count the rows between your seat and the exits . -- follow floor lighting to exit . -- jump feet first onto evacuation slide . -- don't sit down to slide. Place arms across your chest, elbows in, legs and feet together . -- remove high-heeled shoes . -- exit the aircraft and clear the area . -- remain alert for emergency vehicles . -- never return to a burning aircraft . Some passengers have defended their decision to grab personal items before evacuating the burning aircraft, citing passports as a major concern. One of the most high profile passengers to do so was Xu Da, president of product development for Taobao, the largest e-commerce platform in China. ""Regarding some people who criticize me for taking my luggage with me and thus hindering the rescue of other passengers, I have to clarify,"" wrote Xu on Weibo. ""First, my family (three of us) sat in the same row, our bags were in the overhead cabin on top of our seats, we didn't stand in the aisle to take our things. ""Second, our passports, money, etc., were all in (our luggage). I would be difficult if I didn't take it with me. ""Third, everyone was looking forward in the cabin at that time, it wasn't too chaotic. No one was running behind us. My son said to us, 'we could get out' (through the hole in the aircraft, not the evacuation slide). And so we did."" Shock and survival: Plane crash through the eyes of children . But Xu's explanation attracted criticism from some netizens. One, identified as ""Olivia Yi"" posted: ""Are you an idiot? Taking your luggage when you're escaping ... Ignorant and selfish!!! You know your seemingly justifiable action may lead to the death of the others? Please read your safety manual carefully next time! Your possessions may be important to you, but even more so are the lives of others."" Xu's comments notwithstanding, the question remains why so many defied safety protocol -- and, perhaps, common sense -- by carrying their belongings off the plane. Cabin crew well trained . A Chinese netizen named ""Happy Beyond the Cloud,"" who identifies himself as a commercial airline pilot, posted his own summary. ""A crew member from American Airlines complained to me that a lot of Chinese people refuse to put on safety belts, adjust their seats or close the glare shield while the plane is landing, and they put over-weighted bags overhead. ""Some planes have to broadcast in Chinese over and over again that if passengers refuse to cooperate with the crew, they will face a fine as much as $1,500. Don't these passengers know their bad behavior would kill them in emergency landing?"" The rush for belongings, even as potential disaster loomed, may raise questions about the way passengers are briefed for emergency situations. How does an air crash investigation work? The news from San Francisco could have been far worse, and ""what if"" speculation abounds. ""It's a natural reaction in the chaos of a crash, to grab your things and run, I think,"" said Tom Ballantyne, chief correspondent at Orient Aviation magazine. ""But clearly there can be repercussions, from high heels puncturing the slide to bags blocking exits. ""Flight crew are trained to be extremely firm with passengers, ordering them about if necessary. It's unlikely the crew were at fault. To get an operating license aircraft need to show they can be evacuated in 95 seconds. The problem here is with passengers ignoring safety instructions -- if we don't comply, you could have problems."" Interactive: What happened with Asiana Flight 214? The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has yet to comment on or determine the impact passenger behavior had on overall safety and the efficiency of the evacuation effort.

"Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to reveal whether she voted for President Barack Obama, dodging the question for the second time in a week Monday during the only debate of Kentucky's Senate race. Grimes, the Democratic secretary of state who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in one of the nation's marquee races, cited the ""matter of principle"" of privacy at the ballot box, noting that she is the state's chief election officer. ""I'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or (an)other side or members of the media,"" she said during Monday night's debate. The answer echoed one she gave the Louisville Courier-Journal's editorial board last week, which touched off days of criticism -- with NBC ""Meet the Press"" moderator Chuck Todd saying that Grimes ""disqualified herself,"" and McConnell's campaign immediately placing that comment in a new ad. It came after McConnell had already blasted Grimes for trying to hide her political allegiances in a state where Obama is deeply unpopular. ""My opponent has spent spent most of her time trying to deceive everybody about her own views,"" the five-term Republican said. McConnell also criticized Grimes' answer on whether she voted for Obama, saying there is ""no sacred right to not announce how we vote."" He offered that he had ""proudly"" voted for GOP nominees John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, and said he voted for Trey Grayson during Kentucky's 2010 primary against now-Sen. Rand Paul. McConnell also said he doesn't buy Grimes' claim that she is a ""Clinton Democrat."" ""There's not a dime's worth of difference between a Clinton Democrat and an Obama Democrat,"" he said. The debate was the only chance Kentucky voters will have to see the two candidates grapple personally in what's been one of the nation's most expensive races, and one of about a dozen that are key to Republicans' chances of seizing at least six more seats and taking control of the Senate. The free-wheeling, hour-long event was almost entirely negative -- with Grimes calling McConnell ""Senator Gridlock, Senator No-show or Senator Shutdown,"" painting him as an obstructionist and accusing him of doing the bidding of conservative political funding giants Charles and David Koch. She referred to the Koch brothers as McConnell's ""family,"" and later, his ""henchmen."" Much of the debate was focused on coal, with Grimes criticizing the Obama administration's move to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants by 30% over the next 25 years and McConnell going even harder after the Environmental Protection Agency and saying Grimes would be a reliable Obama supporter on issues like energy. ""It's pretty obvious, given where all her support comes from, all the anti-coal activists in the country, that she's going to do their bidding,"" he said. The two also tangled over Grimes' push to increase the minimum wage and equal pay legislation, and Grimes landed a shot against McConnell for putting ""two wars on a nation's credit card."" Grimes benefited late in the debate from a series of questions on Obamacare that demonstrated the difficulties GOP candidates face in states that have already expanded access to coverage under the 2010 health care law. Kentucky's Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, accepted the federal Medicaid expansion and set up a state-run insurance exchange called Kynect. McConnell said he wants to repeal the health care law ""root and branch"" and that hospitals ""are being rim-racked by these Medicare reimbursement reductions."" But he wouldn't address the future of Kynect, saying that ""it's a state decision"" and that ""it's fine to have a website."" Grimes said McConnell is living in a ""fictional fantasyland"" on the issue and that more than 500,000 Kentucky residents now have health insurance because of the law. ""I will not be the senator that rips that insurance from their hands,"" she said. Several times Grimes said McConnell had already had 30 years to carry his policy ideas through. But McConnell shot back that he was the one who negotiated several bipartisan efforts to extend the debt ceiling and stave off government shutdowns with Vice President Joe Biden in recent years. And he argued that a possible future role would position him to advance Kentucky's interests. ""There's a great likelihood,"" McConnell said, ""that I will be the leader of the majority in the Senate next year.""","Kentucky's Democratic Senate candidate won't say if she voted for President Obama .

"(CNN)Moments before testifying at the murder trial of her son's alleged killer Wednesday, Ursula Ward's voice cracked when she was asked by a prosecutor to identify a photo of her son's body. Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh told Ward that it is ""very, very important"" for her to control her emotions on the witness stand once the jury returned to the Massachusetts courtroom. The judge had to rule on what photos could be shown to the victim's mother in the presence of the jury. ""You are not to cry,"" the judge said. ""Yes, your honor,"" Ward replied during her brief appearance as a prosecution witness in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez. Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, a former semipro football player who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Before Ward took the stand, defense lawyer Michael Fee objected to admitting the photo of Lloyd as evidence and showing it to the victim's mother, saying it was ""cruel and unnecessary"" and aimed at eliciting emotion. ""This woman, the mother of Odin Lloyd, has handled herself with plenty of restraint and dignity on the stand,"" prosecutor William McCauley told the judge before the jury returned. Garsh allowed the photo to be shown to Ward but not projected on a monitor for the jury to see. When the jury came back, Ward remained composed as she testified that Lloyd was her oldest child and that he played football and basketball in high school, but didn't go to college because she couldn't afford it. Ward, who had twice walked out of court sobbing when photos of her son were shown, calmly recounted that Lloyd rode his bicycle 20 miles to a landscaping job, that he played semi-pro football for the Boston Bandits and that she last saw him alive on Father's Day 2013. ""I just saw his beautiful pink gums smiling at me across the street,"" she said. Ward then showed no emotion when she identified two photos of her son -- one of Lloyd after his death, another one of him standing in front of a neighbor's home, wearing a cap and carrying a backpack. ""My son,"" Ward said after seeing the first photo. Hernandez looked at the second photo on the court monitor. That photo was shown to the jury. The defense did not cross-examine Ward. On Tuesday, a female juror was dismissed for talking about the case. The juror had said it would be difficult to convict the ex-player without a murder weapon and discussed inadmissible evidence, Garsh noted. The judge dismissed the juror after ordering the public out of court for a hearing that included defense lawyers, prosecutors, witnesses and the juror. The closed-door session was ""no broader than necessary to protect Hernandez's right to a fair trial,"" Garsh said. After the hearing, Garsh also said there was ""credible evidence"" that the dismissed juror had expressed interest in being part of the Hernandez jury and had attended more Patriots games than the juror admitted on a questionnaire. ""The juror's recollection of conversations is not supported by the credible evidence,"" the judge said. The juror's presence on the jury ""posed a substantial risk"" to the fairness of the trial, she said, and the dismissal was necessary in ""the best interest of justice."" Shaneah Jenkins, 23, who was dating Lloyd at the time of his death, Tuesday broke into tears when she recalled a call from a state trooper with word that ""Odin was dead."" Her sister, Shayanna, is Hernandez's fiancee and mother of his child. Shaneah Jenkins testified that she later visited her sister and saw Hernandez, who placed his hand on her shoulder to console her. Hernandez told her ""he's been through this death thing before and it would all get better with time,"" she testified. After Hernandez left the home, Shaneah Jenkins testified, her sister Shayanna kept receiving cell phone calls and text messages. Shaneah Jenkins said her sister seemed ""secretive,"" her responses ""very short."" Shayanna Jenkins would go to the basement to continue the conversations, her sister testified. One time, Shaneah Jenkins told the jury, her sister went down to the basement with what appeared to be a new garbage bag folded in her hand. Shayanna later left the house, returned and asked to borrow her sister's car, Shaneah Jenkins testified. The case has divided the Jenkins sisters, who sit on opposite sides of the courtroom -- Shaneah with Lloyd's mother and Shayanna with Hernandez's family. Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg has told the jury that Hernandez not only orchestrated the killing, but also participated in it and covered it up. Bomberg summed up the prosecution's largely circumstantial case, telling the jury that Hernandez and his associates killed Lloyd and then ""took evidence with them and tried to and, in some cases, were successful in destroying evidence."" The three picked up Lloyd and drove to a secluded area where he was shot six times and killed, Bomberg said. A marijuana blunt found near Lloyd's body had traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, Bomberg said. Hernandez's DNA also was found on a .45-caliber shell casing found in a car he had rented. A footprint at the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found matched sneakers worn by Hernandez, the prosecutor said. The defense said the one-time NFL star worth $40 million was targeted by police and prosecutors in the death of the semipro football player because of celebrity status. Hernandez ""never had a chance"" as authorities zeroed in, Fee told the jury. Garsh said the jury may visit the crime scene on Friday. Two alleged accomplices, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Laura Dolan contributed to this report.","Mother of victim in Aaron Hernandez murder trial identifies photos of son .

"Leaders of the G7 nations on Friday condemned Russian actions in and around Ukraine, promising punishments aimed at sending a message to Moscow. ""We have now agreed that we will move swiftly to impose additional sanctions on Russia,"" the G7 leaders said. ""Given the urgency of securing the opportunity for a successful and peaceful democratic vote next month in Ukraine's presidential elections, we have committed to act urgently to intensify targeted sanctions and measures to increase the costs of Russia's actions."" The statement from the group -- which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States -- came hours after U.S. President Barack Obama threatened Russia on Friday with new sanctions. According to a senior Obama administration official, each G7 country ""will determine which targeted sanctions they will impose"" -- measures that ""will be coordinated and complementary, but not necessarily identical."" The United States could take action as early as Monday, according to the official. This comes as Western nations and Ukraine's government in Kiev express growing concerns about what they see as Russia's role in the Eastern European nation, its military movements outside it and the potential for the situation becoming an even larger conflict that could envelop the region. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Russia of aiming to occupy his country ""militarily and politically,"" claiming that Russia wants to start a third world war. His strong statement came amid a sharp escalation in tensions. Russia's defense chief ordered new military drills Thursday near the border with eastern Ukraine after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants in an operation to clear roadblocks near the city of Slavyansk. Serhiy Pashinskiy, chief of staff to acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov, said Friday  the drills had  entered their ""second stage,"" aimed at encircling Slavyansk and cutting off additional supplies or support. And on Friday afternoon, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said Russian aircraft entered Ukrainian airspace on several occasions over the previous 24 hours. He urged Russia ""to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation."" A U.S. official said they were fighter jets. They were not major incursions, but rather a handful of flights along the border that crossed into Ukrainian airspace, the official said. Yatsenyuk said he had asked Russia to explain the presence of its troops on Ukraine's border within 48 hours -- but 24 hours later, Kiev was still waiting for an official response. At the same time, he said, the world is lined up with Kiev in its efforts to restore stability and preserve ""the system of world security that Russia wants to destroy."" Just as Kiev announced the second phase of its so called ""anti-terrorism operation,"" behind the barricades of the security services building, at the command and control center, the pro-Russian forces expressed confidence they can repel any sort of attack. ""We have 2,000 fighters at the ready and plenty of weapons,"" says Evgeniy Gorbik, a former military man turned spokesman for pro-Russian militants. On Friday, Ukraine's Interior Ministry reported that 13 people on board a bus -- including foreign observers and military officials -- were detained at the entrance to the town of Slavyansk. The ministry said the captors were unknown, but that the detainees were taken to a security office that is under the control of pro-Russian separatists. The detainees are seven European representatives from the Organization for Security and Co-operation, five Ukrainian military representatives and a bus driver, the ministry said. ""We strongly condemn the fact that the members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation mission were taken hostage by pro-Russian separatist forces, this is completely unacceptable,"" Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Lubkivsky told CNN. Negotiations were ongoing to secure their release, the ministry reported. U.S. pressure . Meanwhile, top U.S. officials have vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow, in their view, continues to escalate the situation. The war of words between the United States and Russia is growing increasingly intense. In a phone call Friday, Obama and European leaders agreed that Russia has failed to do its part to de-escalate tensions, the White House said. The Russians have not supported a deal reached last week to decrease tensions, nor have they called on militant groups to put down their weapons, the White House said. To the contrary, Russia has made things worse through its rhetoric and military exercises, it said. At a news conference Friday in South Korea, Obama said there will be targeted sanctions that are ""ready to go."" ""I think it's important for us not to anticipate that the targeted sanctions that we're applying now necessarily solve the problem,"" he said. ""What we've been trying to do is continually raise the costs for Russia of their actions while still leaving the possibility of them moving in a different direction. And we will continue to keep some arrows in our quiver in the event that we see a further deterioration of the situation over the next several days or weeks."" Obama also praised the unity of other countries in condemning Russian ""meddling"" in Ukraine. Moscow argues that the government in Kiev, which took power after ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine in February, is illegitimate. The United States has accused Russia of supporting, arming and coordinating the separatist militants -- an allegation Moscow denies, saying these are simply local ""self-defense"" units. NATO and the United States have also voiced concern over an estimated 40,000 Russian troops massed near the Ukrainian border. Russia in turn accuses the United States of ""running the show"" in Ukraine and says it must do more to hold Kiev to its side of a deal reached in Geneva, Switzerland, saying the interim government must disband right-wing ultranationalist groups. On Friday, the International Criminal Court said chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda had opened a preliminary investigation into alleged crimes committed in Ukraine while Yanukovych was in power. The investigation will look at the period from November 21 to February 22, when street protests against Yanukovych's government took place that resulted in bloody clashes with security forces. Volatile situation . Only a week has passed since foreign ministers for Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union agreed to the Geneva deal aimed at easing the crisis. But that pact, which called for all sides to refrain from violence and for illegal militia groups to disarm and leave occupied buildings, appears to have faltered, if not failed. Pro-Russian militants remain holed up in government buildings in around a dozen cities in eastern Ukraine. Slavyansk has been at the center of much of the tension. Nearby in Kramatorsk, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported gunfire at an airfield that Ukrainian forces retook from separatist protesters this month. But the head of Ukraine's anti-terror operations unit, Vasil Krutow, told CNN that a helicopter at the airfield had exploded after a shot hit its fuel tank. He said the crew's commander was injured as a result. An explosion was also reported overnight at a police checkpoint in the southwestern city of Odessa. Economic impact . Unless and until additional U.S. sanctions are announced, it's hard to judge how much they will hurt Russia. Previous rounds targeted individual lawmakers and businessmen seen as close to Putin as well as a bank, Rossiya, believed to serve the Russian President and senior officials. The European Union has also imposed its own asset freezes and visa bans. Russia increased interest rates for a second month running Friday in an effort to limit the economic damage of rising tensions over Ukraine. The move came hours after ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Russia's credit rating to one notch above junk, citing a flight of capital from the country. The Russian ruble lost more ground Friday, taking its losses against the dollar to 8.4% since the start of the year. ""We do believe that by more economic pressure, we can stop the aggressor,"" said Danylo Lubkivsky, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister. Any further sanctions could hurt the European Union as well as Russia, since the two have deep trade ties and nearly a third of Europe's natural gas comes from Moscow. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev acknowledged this week that the sanctions, coupled with other factors, were affecting the economy.

"There aren't many NFL players who influenced the game like David ""Deacon"" Jones. Jones, 74, who died Monday of natural causes his Southern California home, proved himself many times over as arguably the sport's most fearsome defensive lineman. He invented his own weapon on the field of battle: the head slap. He created his own statistic on the NFL record books: the quarterback sack. ""I developed a term that is used in the game right now called sacking the quarterback,"" Jones is quoted on NFL.com. ""Sacking a quarterback is just like you devastate a city or you cream a multitude of people. I mean it's just like you put all the offensive players in one bag and I just take a baseball bat and beat on the bag."" Clearly, Jones didn't mince words. Advertising execs on Madison Avenue played on Jones' tough-guy persona with a series of memorable TV beer commercials for Miller Lite. Dressed in a black leather jacket, Jones marches into a bar and recites a poem about the virtues of the beer, and then warns, ""and if you don't believe me, I'm gonna break your nose."" The numbers alone tell the tale: The 6-foot-5-inch tall Jones piled up 173 sacks during a 14-year career with the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers and the Redskins. That's second only to Reggie White. ""Deacon Jones was one of the greatest players in NFL history,"" said Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen. ""Off the field, he was a true giant. His passion and spirit will continue to inspire those who knew him."" Sacks weren't even an official NFL statistic until 1982, long after Jones' retirement. Then there was the head slap -- the brain-jarring swipe of a defensive lineman's hand or arm against the helmet of his opponent. ""Jones could split helmets with his head slap, and his outside speed rush was devastating,"" wrote Paul Zimmerman, aka Dr. Z, in Sports Illustrated. ""Plus, Jones was relentless; he never gave up. He collected sacks on his hands and knees."" Jones started his NFL career in 1961 with the Rams and spent 11 seasons there.  Along with fellow icons Rosey Grier, Lamar Lundy and Merlin Olsen, Jones formed one of the best defensive lines of all time: the Fearsome Four. As a Ram, Jones perfected the head slap. Jones once said he wished that, after messing with him, opposing players would wake up ""hopefully on Tuesday."" You could say it was effective. So effective, the NFL banned it. ""His eyes were as red as fire, and after he took his stance, he was pawing his leg in the dirt like a bull,"" remembered Rayfield Wright of his first NFL start. Wright, playing with the Dallas Cowboys, was facing Jones in that 1969 game. ""As an offensive lineman, you're taught only to hear the quarterback's voice. Nothing else,"" Wright said in the Sports Illustrated interview. ""I'm listening in case there's an audible, and in the pause between 'Huts!' I hear a deep, heavy voice say, 'Does yo' mama know you're out here?' It was Deacon Jones."" Rams fans nicknamed him ""Secretary of Defense."" And in 1999, Sports Illustrated named him the ""Defensive End of the Century."" In 1972, he was traded to the Chargers, and he finished his career with the Redskins in 1974. During his entire time with the NFL, Jones missed just six games. In later years, Jones worked as a radio host, served as a spokesman for the blood-pressure drug Atacand and started the Deacon Jones Foundation to mentor inner-city high school students. He also published an autobiography titled -- what else? -- ""Head Slap."" People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .","NFL's Deacon Jones said he invented the ""head slap"" and the term ""sacking the quarterback""

"(CNN)ISIS appears to have gained more ground in Iraq. Islamic State fighters surrounded one of Iraq's largest air bases Tuesday, a police captain in Anbar province and other security sources told CNN. The militants are preparing to launch an attack on Ein Al-Assad military airbase, which is halfway between Hit and Haditha, said Anbar police Capt. Omar Mohamad Hanin. Anbar has been largely overrun by ISIS, which has been waging war for months in order to establish a caliphate -- or a society run by strict Sharia law. It has also taken over large swaths of Syria, near the border with Turkey. Coalition forces have been trying to battle back, but ISIS is getting into position in Iraq with rocket launchers and tanks in villages to the south and east of Ein Al-Assad, Hanin said. President Barack Obama said he is focused on the fighting taking place in Anbar and vowed airstrikes will continue there and elsewhere. ""This is going to be a long-term campaign, there are no quick fixes involved,"" he said Tuesday at Joint Base Andrews, during a  meeting of military leaders from 22 countries who are part of the coalition fighting ISIS. ""We're still in the early stages,"" the President said.  ""As with any military efforts there will be days of progress and there will be periods of setback, but our coalition is united  behind this long-term effort."" Nearly 60 countries are now part of the effort to stop ISIS. Opinion: Why we must talk to bad guys -- even ISIS . Two deadly car bombs exploded in Baghdad on Monday and one on Tuesday. The militants claimed they were behind the blasts. One targeted the police checkpoint in the Shiite neighborhood of Khadimiya. Four people were killed and 12 others were injured when a car bomb being driven by a someone on a suicide mission exploded in an area called al-Utayfia. The target was a security checkpoint at one of the entrances to the predominately Shiite neighborhood, police officials told CNN. ISIS released a statement on its media site claiming that the al-Khadimiya attack killed a member of the Iraqi Parliament,  Ahmad al-Khafaji, who was a member of the Badr Organization, a main Shiite bloc in the government. On the surface, Badgad remained calm Tuesday, despite ISIS advances from the west.  Ali, who sells fish at a market, noted that ISIS has taken control of even more territory since the coalition airstrikes began. Nearby, Walid, who sells fruit and has two sons in the Iraqi army, said the airstrikes are ""like theater."" The Iraqi army's track record in fighting ISIS is not good.  It has lost control of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and is now struggling to keep control over Anbar. Obama on ISIS: Expect 'long-term campaign' ISIS advances in Syria . In Syria, ISIS fighters bombed and blasted their way through the strategic city of Kobani. Columns of smoke rose as the sound of gunfire erupted. Coalition airpower -- aided by Saudi Arabia -- has been focused intensely on Syria. U.S. Central Command said Tuesday that it had bombarded ISIS near Kobani, using bomber and fighter aircraft to fire 21 airstrikes that destroyed two ISIS staging locations, a building, a truck and two vehicles and damaged other ISIS property. Another U.S. strike near the Syrian city of Dayr az Zawr struck a modular oil refinery and initial indications are that this strike was successful. The strikes are meant to prevent the extremist Muslim group from resupplying and massing combat power on the Kurdish-held portions of Kobani, Central Command said in a release. All coalition aircraft used in missions against ISIS departed the space safely, the military said, and analysis of the strikes suggests that they slowed ISIS' advance. But Central Command warned that ""the security situation on the ground there remains fluid"" with ISIS attempting to gain territory and beat back the Kurdish military, which is putting up a fierce fight. Opinion: Why we must talk to the bad guys -- even ISIS . Turkey in or out? The fight for Kobani brings ISIS right to the border with Turkey, but Turkey's contributions to the fight against ISIS remain unclear. After  U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Sunday that Turkey had agreed to allow the United States and its partners to use an air base and territory for training, Turkish officials said Monday that they had not decided whether to allow use of the Incirlik airbase. On Tuesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that Turkey is still committed. ""I mean, Turkey has agreed to host and train and equip people. It certainly has allowed the use of certain facilities, and we don't need to get into the specifics except to say that I don't believe there is any discrepancy with respect to what they will or won't do."" ""Kobani is caught in between the United States and Turkey. It's a pawn right now,"" retired Col. Derek Harvey, the former special adviser to Army Gen. David Petraeus, told CNN's Hala Gorani. Turkey is still focused on removing Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad  and has been fighting it's own battle with Kurdish separatists inside Turkey, Harvey said.   Turkey even launched strikes against Kurdish positions within Turkey in recent days, according to its military. Kobani is an example of the fissures that exist within the coalition about the overall strategic goal, Harvey said. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Hamdi  Alkhshali, Kareem Khadder and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","John Kerry says Turkey is on board with coalition fighting ISIS .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Stalinist North Korea deployed new medium-range ballistic missiles and expanded special forces training during 2008, South Korea's defense ministry reported. North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong-Il . The missiles can travel about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles), possibly putting U.S. military bases in the Pacific Ocean territory of Guam within striking distance, the Ministry of National Defense said in its 2008 Defense White Paper, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Monday. The paper, published after weeks of delay, calls the North's 1.2 million-strong military an ""immediate and grave threat,"" according to Yonhap. The report adds that the North has recently bolstered its naval forces, reinforcing submarines and developing new torpedoes, in addition to increasing its special forces training after reviewing U.S. military tactics in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tension between Pyongyang and Seoul has increased in recent weeks, with North Korea announcing it would scrap peace agreements with the South, warning of a war on the Korean peninsula and threatening to test a missile capable of hitting the western United States. U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2. Pyongyang tested one of the missiles in 2006, but it failed 40 seconds after launch. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers), which if true, could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii. North Korea has been involved in what is known as the six-party talks with the United States, Japan, Russia, South Korea and China, which is an effort to end the nation's nuclear program, which the U.S. says is linked to nuclear weapons. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who returned from Asia on Sunday after her first overseas trip in the post, recently called North Korea's nuclear program ""the most acute challenge to stability in northeast Asia.""","New missiles can travel about 3,000 kilometers .

"Teena Henson's ""journey to life"" began with a newspaper ad. She remembers wishing they had an Anytime Fitness in her hometown of Gilmer, Texas. She specifically wanted to join Anytime Fitness because it is open 24/7 and is made for men and women of all levels of fitness. ""Then there was an ad in the local paper that Anytime Fitness was opening,"" she said. ""It was like, 'Here it is; it's in your hands. Now, what are you going to do with it?' "" Read Teena Henson's story on iReport . Determined to get herself on the right track, Henson signed up at the gym while it was still under construction. It was March 2011; Henson was 5-foot-4 and 332 pounds. She knew that her poor diet and inactivity were not the path to a long, healthy life. She didn't suffer from any serious health problems, but her parents and three brothers were all diabetic so she knew the potential consequences. Henson, 54, is very close with her family. Loved ones, especially her mom, would often approach her with concerns about her health, telling her she should lose weight. ""I think the older I got, the more concerned my mom became because she knew she wouldn't be there to take care of me,"" Henson says. ""She was my No. 1 supporter on my plan to exercise and lose weight."" In the past, Henson would put herself on diets to make everyone happy, but they wouldn't last long. There was an endless array of rules, from eating nothing but grapefruits to nothing but carbs, until she realized that ""diets"" just weren't for her. ""For me, 'diet' is a four-letter word for failure,"" she said. What she was looking for was a lifestyle change. And not because her friends and family wanted it for her, but because she wanted it for herself. With Anytime Fitness' hours, Henson had no trouble finding time to work out. She goes to the gym every day after work for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. She even created a mantra: . ""I have a desire to work out. I keep a determination to work out. I created a discipline to work out, and I choose to work out."" What she struggled with most was changing her eating habits. She started by cutting out soft drinks and dropped 18 pounds in the first month. Her mom, known as Mama Henson to many of Henson's friends, cheered her on daily and was excited to see her daughter start to adopt a healthier lifestyle. ""Every day she would ask me, 'How much you lose today?' I would laugh and say, 'Mom, I can't lose every day.' But she would tell me that I was trying and that's all that matters,"" said Henson. After cutting out soda, Henson started making healthier food choices. She continued to eat at fast food restaurants because it was convenient, switching out fried chicken for grilled, a side of fries for a side salad. By December 2011, Henson was down 64 pounds and healthier than ever. Unfortunately, her mom's health was deteriorating. Mama Henson had suffered several seizures and mini-strokes that severely weakened her. Henson's healthier lifestyle would help provide the mental and physical strength she would need in the final months caring for her mother. Two months before her mother died, Henson remembers walking into the house after a workout. She had lost 100 pounds at this point. Her mother looked up at her and said, ""You're pretty."" ""We both just started crying,"" Henson said. ""I don't have a clue why she said it; it was a memorable moment."" Mama Henson passed away in August 2012. Whenever Henson loses sight of why she's working out or skipping sweets, she thinks of her mom's smile and how much she wanted her daughter to be happy. ""I knew she was proud of me for losing the weight,"" Henson said. ""I know she felt I was going to be OK now that I had lost the weight."" upwave: Try it now! Cut back on sugar . In the past year, Henson has made even more changes to her diet. She has started to eat products like quinoa, whole wheat bread and fresh vegetables. ""There was a time when you couldn't have gotten broccoli anywhere near me."" But now she roasts it and includes it in her meals for the week. She cooks in bulk on the weekends, freezing meals in individual containers for during the week so she knows exactly how many calories she's eating. She aims to eat 1,200 calories a day. In less than three years, Henson has lost 166 pounds, or 50% of her body weight.  On March 8, she celebrated the three-year anniversary of her first step into Anytime Fitness. Losing the weight has helped her find an inner strength. It allows her to see a glimpse of the strong, accomplished woman her mother always saw. One of Henson's passions has been participating in 5K walks for charity. Since she started working out three years ago, she has participated in five walks and recently finished one in 46 minutes, her personal best. Henson's transformation has been so complete that her doctor, who has been monitoring her progress since she started losing weight, uses her pictures to show patients what a little determination can do. ""The smallest of changes one can make in their present lifestyle can garner big changes,"" Henson said, ""not only in the physical body, but in the mind.""","Teena Henson decided to lose weight after seeing a gym ad in a newspaper .
Family members, especially her mom, always said Henson should lose weight .

"Democrats pulled their TV advertising in Kentucky from now through election day, leaving Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes without air support from the national party, which had invested heavily in trying to unseat the Senate's top Republican. It's a sign of how stretched Democrats are in defending their own turf across the country that they can no longer afford to go on offense in the marquee race against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But Grimes sources insist they'll be fine on their own. The campaign, sources said, is flush with $4.4 million cash on hand -- much more than other Democrats on the ballot this year. ""Money is not an issue in this campaign,"" a Grimes source said. While the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is coming off the air, national Democrats are still likely to spend money on the ground in Kentucky before election day to help boost Grimes' get out the vote operation. ""We continue to make targeted investments on the ground and will continue to assess the race to decide on future television buys,"" a Democratic source with knowledge of the DSCC's strategy told CNN. The move comes as Democrats focus their resources on defending the party's endangered incumbents. Senators like Alaska's Mark Begich, Arkansas' Mark Pryor, Colorado's Mark Udall, Louisiana's Mary Landrieu and New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen are all fighting for survival -- and to keep the GOP from winning the six seats it needs to capture the chamber's majority. Grimes has been under fire for twice in the last week -- first in an editorial board meeting, and then in a debate with McConnell -- dodging questions about whether she voted for President Barack Obama -- which led NBC's ""Meet the Press"" moderator Chuck Todd to say that the Democratic secretary of state had ""disqualified herself,"" and Republicans to immediately place that comment in a TV ad. A Grimes source said that question had come up in debate prep, and she answered it the same way she did during Monday night's debate, saying that as the state's chief election officer, the privacy of the ballot box is ""a point of principle with her."" The source said Grimes' campaign hasn't polled on how the fallout over her refusal to disclose how she voted has affected the race, but sees it as a national media-fueled issue. ""The people of Kentucky accept her explanation,"" the source said, adding that ""not one person has come up to her to say she needs to divulge"" how she's voted.","The DSCC has gone dark in Kentucky's Senate race .

"Not long ago, the threat of terrorist attacks against the United States boiled down to two words: al Qaeda. But this week's U.S. airstrikes against al Qaeda offshoots show the President is playing whack-a-mole against a new generation of terrorists. The attacks Tuesday inside Syria came in three waves and targeted ISIS, the Khorasan Group and, apparently, al-Nusra Front. The groups share a similar ideology. But there are key differences. Here's how each stacks up: . ISIS . What its name means: . The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Some world leaders use the acronym ISIL, or the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. But the group now calls itself just the Islamic State, believing it has already established a caliphate across Sunni parts of Syria and Iraq. How it started: . Back in 2004, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi launched al Qaeda in Iraq. He later tried to ignite a sectarian war against Iraq's Shiite majority. The new al Qaeda group was rebranded in 2006 as the Islamic State in Iraq. It would add ""and Syria"" to its name later. The group exploited a growing perception among many Sunnis that they were being persecuted by Iraq's Shia-dominated government, starved of resources and excluded from a share of power. What its goal is: . ISIS has been trying to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. But it doesn't stop there, one former ISIS militant told CNN. ""The main and principal goal of the Islamic State that they tell their new members is to establish an Islamic state that will encompass the Arab world,"" the ex-ISIS fighter said. ""And after that, we go to other countries."" The group also claims its leader has authority over 1.5 billion Muslims around the world. Who leads it: . Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took the reins of ISIS in 2010 at age 39 after the previous leader, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, was killed in a joint U.S.-Iraqi operation. Prior to taking over ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was part of al Qaeda in Iraq. He served four years in a U.S. prison camp for insurgents, at Bucca in southern Iraq, where he likely developed a network of contacts and honed his ideology. He was released in 2009 and went to work. Why the U.S. is targeting it: . ISIS has been pretty vocal about wanting to attack Americans and other Westerners -- even though U.S. officials say ISIS fighters aren't a direct threat to the U.S. homeland right now. ""At this point, we have no information that ISIL is plotting an attack inside the United States,"" Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, testified to Congress last week. The dangers, officials say, are to U.S. personnel and infrastructure in Iraq. There's also a risk of militants with U.S. or other Western passports potentially returning home and staging attacks. A senior ISIS leader recently called for lone-wolf attacks in the United States and France -- two countries that have been conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. ""The best thing you can do is to strive to your best and kill any disbeliever, whether he be French, American or from any of their allies,"" the ISIS official said. ""Rig the roads with explosives for them. Attack their bases. Raid their homes. Cut off their heads. Do not let them feel secure. Hunt them wherever they may be."" Inside the mind of an ISIS fighter . AL-NUSRA FRONT . What its name means: . ""Al-Nusra Front"" is translated from ""Jabhat al-Nusra,"" which means ""Victory Front."" How it started: . Al-Nusra was formed during the ongoing three-year Syrian civil war. It has emerged as one of the most effective groups fighting the Syrian regime, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. ""A number of separate rebel groups have emerged and preparations are being made for a post-Assad Syria as these groups vie for dominance and international support,"" the Quilliam Foundation said. What its goal is: . Unlike most Syrian rebels, which are seeking political change, al-Nusra Front is fighting for ideological reasons. Like ISIS, al-Nusra Front is trying to establish an Islamic state -- though primarily in Syria. It's been a formidable force against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. But even though it has helped the Syrian opposition by taking out regime fighters, it has also hurt the moderate opposition by making world leaders hesitant to help rebels. The group has claimed hundreds of attacks in several cities, including suicide bombings, and is responsible for the deaths of ""numerous innocent Syrians,"" the U.S. State Department said. Who leads it: . Al-Nusra posted a statement saying its leader, Abu Yousef al-Turki, was killed in the U.S.-led airstrikes Tuesday in Syria. The statement was accompanied by a so-called proof of death -- a photograph -- of the former fighter. CNN cannot independently verify al-Nusra's claims, but the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the terror group was among those targeted during the airstrikes. Why the U.S. is targeting it: . The United States has not identified al-Nusra as a group targeted in its strikes in Syria. But it is a rebel group that the U.S. has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. Al-Nusra ""has sought to portray itself as part of the legitimate Syrian opposition while it is, in fact, an attempt by AQI to hijack the struggles of the Syrian people for its own malign purposes,"" the State Department said. THE KHORASAN GROUP . What its name means: . Calling the group ""Khorasan"" doesn't actually make sense in Arabic or any other language, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Khorasan is not an organizational name or even some exotic acronym, but an ancient Islamic historical term from the far east of the Muslim world,"" the think tank said. ""It is used today by al-Qaeda (and others who are fond of archaic Islamic terminology) to describe the Afghanistan-Pakistan-Iran region."" How it started: . The new al Qaeda franchise is a collection of al Qaeda members who have moved into Syria. U.S. President Barack Obama called the Khorasan Group ""seasoned al Qaeda operatives."" Khorasan's existence was publicly acknowledged only last week, when U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said it was operating in Iraq and Syria with a focus on exporting terror to the West. What its goal is: . The Khorasan Group's mission is to find new ways to attack the United States and Europe. For al Qaeda, which is struggling against ISIS for the crown of leading global jihad, the creation of Khorasan makes perfect sense. Sources say the Khorasan Group is trying to emulate the success of ISIS in using social media to recruit Westerners -- people who could be trained and then sent home to launch terror attacks. Who leads it: . A short and slight 33-year-old named Muhsin al Fadhli, according to intelligence sources in the United States and the Middle East. He arrived in Syria in April 2013 and began working with al-Nusra Front. At some point, he parted ways with al-Nusra. Why the U.S. is targeting it: . The Khorasan Group was actively plotting against a U.S. homeland target and Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday. The intelligence community discovered the plots against the United States in the past week, an intelligence source told CNN. The source did not say what the Khorasan Group's target may have been, but said the plot may have involved a bomb made of clothes dipped in explosive material. The U.S. blitz on Khorasan Group targets this week came a surprise to many. The United States wanted to catch the group off guard by mixing strikes against it with strikes against ISIS targets.","ISIS, al-Nusra Front and the Khorasan Group all spawned from al Qaeda .
The U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS and the Khorasan Group this week .
Al-Nusra says its leader was killed in the strikes; the U.S. has not confirmed ."
"(CNN)Blaming a school project for an hourslong traffic jam sounds about as far-fetched as blaming a dog for eating your homework. But  Atlanta Police said it was a Georgia State University student's art project attached to the outer frame of the 14th Street Bridge in downtown Atlanta that shut down all north and southbound lanes of Interstate 75/85 for two hours on Monday. ""Georgia State has taken responsibility for the object,"" Assistant Chief Shawn Jones said at a news conference Tuesday. The department said it received a 911 call regarding a suspicious package around 12:50 p.m. Monday.   When crews went to investigate, they ""found an object that looked like an explosive,"" Jones said. Jones wouldn't describe what the object in question looked like, but a photo gallery obtained exclusively by CNN affiliate WSB, showed a soda can covered in duct tape. Police moved to shut down all lanes of traffic to ""conduct controlled disruption to render it safe,"" Jones said.  The results were eerie scenes of a usually bustling thoroughfare left empty. No explosives were found and all lanes of interstate traffic reopened shortly after 4 p.m. Georgia State announced Tuesday that an art project was to blame. ""Georgia State University sincerely apologizes for the traffic problems resulting yesterday from the mounting of a student camera at the 14th Street Bridge,"" Don Hale with university media relations said in a release. No one from the Atlanta Police Department or the Department of Transportation was made aware of the 18 cameras deployed at various locations in the city, Jones said. Photos of other cameras show them attached to trees, fences and windows around the city. Some include notes that identify the soda can as a ""Georgia State Art Project."" Some instruct passersby to ""Please do not take down!"" Police are working with the school to remove all the cameras, the university release said. Jones said the incident is still under investigation and it has yet to be determined if charges will be filed.","All lanes of Interstate 75/85 shut down for two hours Monday.

"(CNN)The video is beyond horrific. Appearing online Tuesday, it seems to show a Jordanian military pilot being burned alive while confined in a cage. ISIS has released footage of its killings before. But this latest video is different in key aspects, and ups the stakes in ways few could have imagined. ""It's a kind of atrocity pornography,"" Karima Bennoune tells CNN. She is the author of ""Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here: Untold Stories from the Fight Against Muslim Fundamentalism."" ""It's truly horrifying when you watch the video and you see them really relishing in inflicting suffering deliberately on another human being, and in showing that suffering to the world,"" Bennoune says. CNN is not showing images of the pilot's killing. Here are ways in which the latest ISIS video marks a potential turning point: . The 22-minute video is highly orchestrated, shot from multiple camera angles. The pilot, Moath al-Kasasbeh, is forced to play a part in his own execution. He's seen walking and sitting at a table, speaking, before he appears inside the cage.  A member of ISIS lights a long fuse that leads to al-Kasasbeh. Fire engulfs the pilot and he eventually collapses. A bulldozer then comes to bury him, his hands sticking out from the debris. ""ISIS is in the business of propaganda and terrorism is the business of theater. And in many ways, I think they're upping the ante in terms of the attention and the brutality that they're engaged in,"" says Juan Zarate, a former U.S. deputy national security adviser. Zarate adds that he thinks ISIS is trying to send a message to the Arab members of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. ""They're going to be treated brutally, and in fact, maybe perhaps more brutally than other members of the coalition,"" he says. Previous ISIS videos have shown the killings of Western captives. One posted last week shows the death of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto. What makes the Jordanian pilot's case different is that he hailed from a Middle Eastern nation taking part in the anti-ISIS coalition. Al-Kasasbeh was Muslim, as are the vast majority of those killed by ISIS. The manner of execution also is different. In previous videos, hostages were beheaded. A masked man with a British accent, dubbed ""Jihadi John,"" has appeared in at least six videos, standing near hostages. He does not make an appearance in footage of the pilot's death. Sometimes, ISIS has threatened who it will kill next. At the end of its latest video, ISIS shows names and addresses of people it claims are Jordanian pilots. A reward is offered for their deaths. Many analysts are predicting the video will backfire on ISIS, isolating anyone on the fence about its ideology and tactics. But Maajid Nawaz, a former extremist and author of ""Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,"" makes the point that ISIS is not speaking to those who oppose it. It's going after existing terrorists, competing with al Qaeda for foreign fighters. He tells CNN: ""This is a race to the bottom when it comes to the gruesome depictions that they're showing.""","ISIS has released footage of its killings before, but latest video is different in key aspects .
""It's a kind of atrocity pornography,"" says author Karima Bennoune ."
"The suspect in the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater screening of the new Batman film early Friday had colored his hair red and told police he was ""the Joker,"" according to a federal law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation. At least 12 people were killed in the rampage and 58 were injured, one fewer than earlier reported. Of those injured ""nearly everyone was shot,"" Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said Friday night, adding that a handful of people were hurt in the resulting chaos. Ten of the victims were killed inside the theater while two others died at hospitals. As of Friday evening, the 10 bodies had been removed from the complex and authorities were preparing to begin ""the agonizing process"" of notifying families, Oates said. A mug shot of suspect James E. Holmes has not been released. Witnesses to the shooting described him as wearing a gas mask that concealed much of his face and head. But the federal law enforcement source's information about the suspect's appearance fits with a statement from New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who was briefed by Colorado authorities Friday. Oates declined to comment on Holmes' appearance other than to describe what he was wearing, and said he would not release his booking photo ""for investigative reasons."" The Joker has long been a fixture in Batman comics and was famously brought to life by the late Heath Ledger in 2008's ""The Dark Knight,"" the predecessor to Friday's release of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Ledger won a posthumous Academy Award for his sinister portrayal of the iconic villain who encourages anarchists to take over Gotham City. Meanwhile, authorities were faced with the difficult task of entering Holmes' Aurora apartment, which was left rigged with traps. ""It's booby-trapped with various incendiary and chemical devices and trip wires,"" Oates said, adding that it could take days to work through the apartment safely. Five buildings around the apartment building were evacuated, Oates said. Residents were allowed back home briefly Friday night to retrieve such emergency items as medicine. Authorities have postponed until Saturday any attempts to enter the apartment and are bringing in resources from the federal government to help with the situation, Oates said. Shootings cast pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' blockbuster weekend . Police say Holmes, 24, dressed head-to-toe in protective tactical gear, set off two devices of some kind before spraying the Century 16 theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns police recovered at the scene. Oates said the guns were purchased legally by Holmes at stores in the Denver area in the past two months. More than 6,000 rounds of ammunition were also purchased online, according to Oates. A receipt obtained by CNN shows Holmes bought some of the tactical gear, including a vest and magazine pouch, online on July 2. Oates said investigators are ""confident"" that Holmes acted alone. The shooting unfolded inside a darkened theater packed with Batman fans, some in costume for the premiere of the movie. Aurora police said how the suspect entered the theater is still under investigation. A law enforcement source working the investigation told CNN that the gunman walked into the movie theater after purchasing a ticket. After the movie was under way, he went out a rear exit door, propping it open, and gathered weapons before re-entering through the door, the source said. As he re-entered, he tossed in a canister before starting to shoot, according to a second law enforcement source involved in the investigation and several witnesses. Screaming, panicked moviegoers scrambled to escape from the black-clad gunman, who shot at random as he walked up the theater's steps, witnesses said. It was a scene ""straight out of a horror film,"" said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater. ""He was just literally shooting everyone, like hunting season,"" Ramos said. In Aurora, the agonized seek answers through faith . A federal law enforcement official told CNN the man used tear gas, but Oates said Friday afternoon that it was not clear what the substance was. Holmes surrendered without resistance within seven minutes of the first calls from panicked moviegoers reporting the shooting, Oates said. Victims flooded overwhelmed hospitals. One of the injured is just 4 months old, the child's mother said. The infant was treated and released from the hospital. ""I don't know how else to explain it. It's horrific,"" said Tracy Lauzon, director of EMS and trauma services at Aurora Medical Center. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . Oates said the man was wearing a ballistic helmet and protective gear for his legs, throat and groin, black gloves and a gas mask. Jennifer Seeger, who survived the attack, said she had seen the man and thought his get-up was part of the entertainment for the film's debut. She said the man first shot toward the ceiling, then began shooting at people. He reloaded during his attack, she said. ""He was just literally just massacring anybody that got up that was trying to run away,"" Seeger said. As of Friday afternoon, 30 people remained hospitalized, 11 of them in critical condition, according to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Holmes is scheduled to appear in an Arapahoe County, Colorado, courtroom Monday morning, Rob McCallum, spokesman for the Colorado Judicial Department, said Friday. The court file was sealed, according to a court order. He is being held in the Arapahoe County jail, Oates said. A statement from Holmes' family in San Diego asked for ""privacy during this difficult time."" ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,"" the statement said, adding, ""We are still trying to process this information."" Shooting turns movie into surreal horror: 'This is real' The FBI is assisting in the investigation, officials said, though it did not appear that the incident was related to terrorism. Prior to Friday's shooting, Holmes' criminal record in Aurora consisted only of a traffic summons. Aspiring sports reporter feared dead in shooting . President Barack Obama canceled campaign events Friday, telling supporters at what had been scheduled as a rally in Fort Myers, Florida, that ""there will be other days for politics."" ""This will be a day for prayer and reflection,"" he said, calling for the country to unite as one and support the victims. Flags at the White House were lowered to half-staff Friday afternoon in honor of the victims. iReporter witness: 'We have to run' A law enforcement source said two of the guns used in the attack were purchased at a Bass Pro Shop in Denver, while the two others were bought at separate Gander Mountain Guns outlets in the area. Investigators also found a drum magazine, capable of carrying 100 rounds of ammunition, which was attached to the AR-15 rifle, two law enforcement officials said. KWGN: Witnesses first thought gunfire was part of movie . A statement from Bass Pro Shops said its Denver store followed appropriate protocol on the sale of the two weapons. Authorities also searched the suspect's car in the parking lot of the movie theater and found more magazines and ammunition, a federal law enforcement official said. ""It was everywhere,"" the official said. Opinion: Gun control won't stop mass murder . Christopher Nolan, director of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" condemned the shooting as ""savage"" and ""appalling."" ""The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me,"" Nolan said in a statement on behalf of the cast and crew of the film. ""Nothing any of us can say could ever adequately express our feelings for the innocent victims of this appalling crime, but our thoughts are with them and their families."" Four Aurora theaters showing ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will have extra security for the foreseeable future ""out of an abundance of caution,"" Oates said. Warner Bros., the studio behind the film, canceled the movie's Paris premiere, while New York police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said his officers would watch over screenings of ""The Dark Knight"" in the city to prevent copycat shootings. AMC Theatres, meanwhile, said it would not permit guests in costumes that make others uncomfortable, nor will it allow face-covering masks or fake weapons. 911 tape: 'I need somebody to shut this movie off' Aurora, a Denver suburb, is about 13 miles from Littleton, Colorado -- site of the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre.

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican hero for pushing austerity measures that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions, rallied supporters Monday night, one last push before a recall that's drawn lots of outside interest and money. ""We can't spike the ball on the 10-yard line. We've got to take it all the way into the end zone,"" Walker said in a Green Bay restaurant, within walking distance of the Packers' famed Lambeau Field. ""Because when we do it's a win not just for us. It's a win for our kids and grandkids to make sure they have a better future than the one we inherited."" Walker faces Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett on Tuesday in a rematch of the 2010 governor's race that he won by getting more than 52% of the vote. Recall vote is judgment day for Wisconsin governor . This time, the stakes are higher after a vitriolic campaign that epitomized the political divide across the country. The three most recent polls had Walker ahead of Barrett, though the Milwaukee mayor's final tracking poll indicated the tightest of races -- 47.8% to 47.7% -- according to his Facebook page. Campaign finance filings definitely put Walker far ahead, as he's garnered the lion's share of the tens of millions of dollars that have come into the campaigns. Barrett told supporters Monday that Wisconsin voters are tired of Walker, whom he described as ""a governor who's more interested in being the rock star of the far right."" At a rally outside the State Capitol building, which demonstrators occupied last year to try to block Walker's policies, Barrett supporters sang union songs and waved signs opposing the governor. A victory by the first-term governor could give Republicans a major boost in efforts to make Wisconsin a battleground state in the November presidential election. What's at stake in Wisconsin? President Barack Obama easily won the state in 2008, but Walker's unyielding commitment to fiscal austerity in the face of chaotic protests last year made him the poster child for tea party conservatism. Along with the gubernatorial recall, voters also will decide whether Walker's lieutenant governor and four Republican state senators keep their jobs. Does Obama's absence portend outcome of Wisconsin recall vote? The recall effort was spurred by a Walker-backed law, signed in March 2011, to limit the collective bargaining rights of state worker unions. During a bitter fight over the law last year, Democratic legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum, and tens of thousands of protesters converged on the State Capitol building in what became an occupation. After the law was signed, Democrats immediately began a recall effort that eventually led to Tuesday's vote. The campaign has been fierce, with campaigners complaining of keyed cars, verbal harassment and a general lack of tolerance for differing opinions. The Justice Department on Monday dispatched federal observers to monitor Milwaukee polling places Tuesday to ensure no voter discrimination takes place. A litany of Republican stars have campaigned for Walker, including fellow governors Chris Christie of New Jersey, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia, as well as U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio from Florida. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group built around many of the same principles as the tea party, has pumped more than $10 million into Wisconsin backing Walker's policies. ""It's big for the people of Wisconsin and their economic future, but I think it's even bigger nationally as well,"" said Tim Phillips, the group's president. ""I think every governor, every state legislator around the country is looking at Wisconsin, and they're going, OK, if I got the courage to stand up and do what I think is right to get my state moving again ... will someone have my back? And hopefully the answer is going to be, you bet."" Barrett, meanwhile, got his own high-powered support from former President Bill Clinton, as well as Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. However, his campaign fundraising has badly trailed the support Walker received. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee announced Saturday it is spending $100,000 in the last five days before the Wisconsin recall vote, bringing its investment to $300,000. In addition, Obama never hit the trail for Barrett, which Republicans surmised was because the president believes Barrett will lose. On Sunday, Barrett told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that his campaign never asked Obama to campaign on his behalf, adding that ""we understand he's got a lot going on."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledged the uniqueness of the contest, while also stressing there's no doubt where the president stands. ""The president's made clear all along his opposition to those who would take away workers rights -- to actions that would take away or diminish worker's rights,"" Carney said. ""And he's also made clear his support for Tom Barrett."" While Tuesday's vote will culminate a two-year fight over collective bargaining rights for public employee unions, both parties are casting the debate as a larger referendum on the role of government and policies supported by both parties. Barrett, however, has continually framed the race as a state contest instead of a national affair. ""I want to make sure that everybody understands this is about Wisconsin values. It's not about Washington, D.C. It's about right here, who is going to control the future of this state,"" Barrett said Sunday. ""Will it be tea party, the national right wing, or is it going to be the people of the state of Wisconsin? And I'm putting my money on the people of the state of Wisconsin."" Walker has defended his budget actions as necessary for the fiscal health of his state and described his campaign as one of a strong leader who is making the necessary ""tough decisions.""","""We've got to take it all the way,"" Gov. Scott Walker tells backers in Green Bay .

"(CNN)The future of the United States lies in North America. This is not a geographic truism, but a strategic imperative. Generations of Americans, distracted by far-flung crises, have long taken our own region for granted. This must change if the 21st century is to be an American century. The United States, Canada and Mexico are bound by a shared economic, environmental, demographic and cultural destiny. How we move forward together is key to our success. In recognition of our shared destiny, the three countries should create a North American passport that would, over time, allow their citizens to travel, work, invest, learn and innovate anywhere in North America.  Work, tourist and student visas are necessities in the modern world to regulate the flow of people between sovereign states. In the North American context, much like within the European Union, our economies and societies are far more integrated than our immigration system recognizes -- and a North American passport, much like the EU passport, would align our laws with reality. Podcast: A North American passport? Such a move would provide a dramatic break from Washington's historical negligence of its  ""near abroad,"" which stems from a rare luxury. In contrast to other major continental powers through the centuries, the United States has not had to worry much about its neighbors and devote the bulk of its military resources to protecting its borders. With no real threat next door, the United States has felt free to roam elsewhere in the world, as unconstrained and secure as if we were an island nation. Meanwhile, our neighbors bolster our prosperity.  Mexico and Canada are now the top two export markets for the United States, and two of our top three trading partners overall. Trade has exploded in the two decades since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which has created an integrated manufacturing platform and labor market. Canada, a stalwart ally that embodies the best of our shared democratic values, has long been the No. 1 source of imported oil to the United States, with Mexico usually coming second or third. The North American region has become the fastest-growing producer of oil and natural gas in the world and will surpass Saudi Arabia and OPEC within a decade or two as the global energy leader. This potential must be leveraged regionally, with cross-border infrastructure investments and environmental planning. Even if Washington still thinks in terms of tidy lines separating nation states, mineral resources are about as influenced by such lines on a map as the water gushing down the Colorado River. Mexico, an emerging powerhouse with more than 100 million people, is striving to consolidate its democratic gains and become a predominantly middle-class society. The United States has a strong stake in this effort. Mexico is the linchpin to our relations with the countries of Central and South America. The economic prosperity, education and security of Mexico's people will help determine the overall competitiveness of North America on the global stage. Moreover, Americans on this side of the Rio Grande must acknowledge the ""Mexicanness"" in the United States and treat Mexicans living here with the dignity and respect they deserve. The inception of NAFTA marked an important step toward leveraging these geographic realities for a shared North American success. NAFTA has been a boon to our growth and competitiveness. Integrated production platforms, sometimes spanning all three countries, have helped draw manufacturing back from competitors across the Pacific. But the promise of NAFTA has fallen short in a critical respect; while trade and investment have grown, the barriers to movement have remained too high for the people who help drive and stand to benefit from that growth. As evidenced by the recent political firestorm over President Obama's executive move to allow more undocumented workers to avoid deportation, it would take farsighted and courageous political leadership in all three countries to press for a North American passport. But the fact is that allowing North Americans to move more effortlessly across the borders would help alleviate our contentious domestic immigration battles. We have more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in this country because we didn't create a realistic, legal avenue for the number of Mexicans who would -- and should, given our level of integration -- come to the United States over time.  Moreover, by erecting a wall along the border and making crossings so difficult, costly and dangerous, we have interrupted the old ""circularity"" of migratory flows, trapping millions of workers on this side of the border. If we established a North American passport and adapted our legal framework to economic realities, allowing people to move within our North American economy, we wouldn't need to debate whether to offer more than 10 million people U.S. citizenship.   Even a few years ago, immigration was a far more polarizing issue in states like Arizona. Now the tide is slowly changing. More Republicans are recognizing that their prior stance on immigration needs to change if they want to win over voters in the next presidential election. A North American passport would reflect the unique relationship and shared interests among our nations. In the face of growing competition from rising powers elsewhere in the world, simply taking our geography for granted and focusing our attention elsewhere is no longer a viable option.","The future success of North America depends partly on how the U.S., Canada and Mexico work together .
Andrés Martinez, Daniel Kurtz-Phelan: We should have a North American passport, like the European Union passport ."
"Chinese relatives of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers wept, begged and cursed a Malaysian diplomat in Beijing on Monday. They went to a meeting at a hotel there, expecting a long-awaited briefing from Malaysian technical experts, but erupted in anger when the diplomat announced a change in plans. There would be no briefing. ""We don't know at this point whether they are alive or dead. And you haven't given us any direct proof of where they actually are. We want our loved ones back,"" a father of a missing passenger cried. He's not the only one waiting for answers. In Kuala Lumpur, Nur Laila Ngah smiles, but it's a brave face she's putting on. Her husband Wan Swaid Ismail was a member of the cabin crew on the flight that disappeared more than six weeks ago. ""Emotionally, it's up and down. You know? Sometimes, I'm OK. Sometimes, so-so. Sometimes -- always -- very sad,"" she said. The couple had been planning to celebrate their 13th anniversary this year. They have three children, ages 12, 10 and 8. Recalling a conversation she had with her husband before he left, Laila said: ""I was asking him, 'Are we going to have the next 13 years together?' Of course."" Their children, she said: ""They have faith that their father will be coming back."" Nothing new . But 46 days into the search, that possibility seems less and less likely. The underwater drone scanning the ocean for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was wrapping up its ninth mission Tuesday with ""no contacts of interest"" in its last eight, the Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. The Bluefin-21 has scanned about two thirds of the intended territory without finding any sign of the missing plane. These efforts may be a main focus of the search, but they aren't the only part. The coordination center announced Tuesday morning that up to 10 military aircraft and 10 ships would participate in the day's search for the Boeing 777 and the 239 passengers and crew on board. Later, it said that planned air activities had been suspended because of poor weather conditions triggered by Tropical Cyclone Jack. ""It has been determined that the current weather conditions are resulting in heavy seas and poor visibility, and would make any air search activities ineffective and potentially hazardous,"" the coordination center said in a statement. According to U.S. Navy spokesman Chris Johnson, there is ""currently a broad discussion among all stakeholders"" about how the search operation should proceed in the long run. The discussions are ""in the early stages"" still, he said, but authorities are looking ahead for planning as far out as July. Few answers . For families of the missing passengers, the wait is agonizing -- and infuriating. Malaysia's Foreign Ministry says it understands their need for answers, but doesn't have many to offer. That is perhaps the most frustrating thing for Mohamad Shaari, whose cousin and his new wife were on the flight. They were on their way to Beijing for their honeymoon. He believes they're still alive. ""The sea cannot just swallow a plane,"" Shaari said Sunday.  ""I believe the plane has been hijacked."" It's a common belief. ""I believe the government didn't try to hide ... any information from us,"" said Hamid Ramlan.  ""They are telling the truth, but then mostly members of ... the families -- they do not want to believe.""  That includes his wife. ""My wife cannot accept that.  She still believes that the plane was hijacked and she believes that my daughter is still alive."" His daughter and new son-in-law were another honeymoon couple on the flight. The families' list . It was early on March 8 when Flight 370 set off from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, destined for Beijing. What happened next  has been a confounding mystery, with the frustration of passengers' family members compounded by a scarcity of details from authorities. New bits of information that have come out six weeks later may help round out the picture but don't answer the main question: Why did the plane go off course, and where is it now? These recent developments include a senior Malaysian aviation source's assertion that the jetliner deviated from its flight path while inside Vietnamese airspace. It turned left, then climbed to 39,000 feet -- below its maximum safe limit of 43,100 feet -- and maintained that altitude for about 20 minutes over the Malay Peninsula before beginning to descend, the source said. Malaysia Airlines has declined to answer CNN's questions on various matters -- including the fact that, according to the source, the missing jet was equipped with four emergency locator transmitters. When triggered by a crash, ELTs are designed to transmit their location to a satellite. Relatives of people aboard the jetliner have drawn up 26 questions -- many of them technical issues -- that they want addressed by Malaysian officials. Among them: What's in the flight's log book? Can they review the jet's maintenance records? Can they listen to recordings of the Boeing 777 pilot's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost? There's no word on when families will get the answers they're looking for. Their wait continues.

"Indonesia's top rescue official says authorities believe the missing AirAsia jet is likely at the bottom of the sea, based on radar data from the plane's last contact. ""(Because) the coordinate that was given to us and the evolution from the calculation point of the flight track is at sea, our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea,"" Bambang Sulistyo, head of Indonesia's national search and rescue agency, told reporters Monday. But searchers still don't know where the plane is, he said, and may need help from other countries for help with an underwater search. The search for AirAsia Flight QZ8501 resumed on Monday, a day after the commercial jet disappeared in Indonesian airspace with 162 people aboard. Ships, planes and helicopters are looking for the missing aircraft, Indonesian authorities said. It's unclear if weather played a role in the aircraft's disappearance, but rescuers say it could be a factor that influences how quickly they find the plane. Large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on Sunday, the agency said. By Monday morning, weather in the area appeared to be clearing up, CNN International meteorologist Tom Sater said. Authorities say they're combing a ""very broad search area."" AirAsia says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at 7:24 a.m. Sunday Singapore time (6:24 a.m. in Indonesia). The missing plane, flying from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, went missing as it flew over the Java Sea between the islands of Belitung and Borneo -- a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters, according to Indonesian authorities, who are leading the search and rescue operations. Before the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers, one of the pilots asked to fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather, officials said. AirAsia statement on missing airliner . In addition to Indonesia's teams, several other countries have joined the hunt for the missing plane. A C-130 plane from Singapore has been participating in the search, and the country's military says it's sending two more ships to the search area. Malaysia's transportation minister said his country has deployed three vessels and three aircraft to assist in the search. And the Royal Australian Air Force said Monday that it was deploying a patrol plane to help. And Indonesia has reached out to the United Kingdom, France and the United States for help with sonar technology that may be needed for an underwater search, Sulistyo told reporters Monday. Now that a day has passed since the plane went missing, investigators should have more data to help them find it, said Peter Goelz, former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. ""They've had a full 24 hours now to gather all of the available radar data from all of the available sources,"" he said. ""They should be able to put that together, along with any satellite data, and have a more precise location on where to target their search."" Waiting and weeping . After hours of waiting in anguish for any word about the passengers aboard the missing plane, several dozen of their family members met with airport and airline officials in a closed-door briefing Monday at the airport in Surabaya. As they waited for news before the briefing, some took cell phone pictures of a flight manifest posted on a wall. The black-and-white papers showed every passenger's name and seat number, but not their fate. Others simply sat and dabbed tears from their eyes. ""Our concern right now is for the relatives and the next of kin,"" AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said during a news conference in Surabaya. He confirmed that storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a change in flight plan, but added, ""We don't want to speculate whether weather was a factor. We really don't know.""  Once the aircraft is found, there will be a proper investigation, Fernandes said. Of the people on board the Airbus A320-200, 155 are Indonesian, three are South Korean, one is British, one is French, one is Malaysian and one is Singaporean, the airline said. Eighteen children, including one infant, are among the passengers, the carrier said. Seven of the people on board are crew members. Families of AirAsia flight passengers given support through the 'nightmare' Questions over pilots' communications . Flight 8501 ""was requesting deviation due to en route weather before communication with the aircraft was lost,"" the airline said. The flight's captain asked permission to climb to a higher altitude, the Indonesian Transportation Ministry's acting director general for air transportation affairs, Djoko Murdjatmojo, said, according to the national news agency. According to flight tracking websites, almost the entire flight path of the plane was over the sea. What role did weather play? CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said that if there was an onboard emergency, the pilots should have issued a mayday call or a pan-pan call. ""Mayday means you're immediately in danger of losing the flight; pan-pan means that it is urgent but that you can continue the flight and request an alternate route or an alternate airport,"" said Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""It's disconcerting in that the standard procedures for an emergency don't seem to have been deployed,"" she said. But Alan Diehl, a former Air Force and NTSB accident investigator, said pilots don't always make mayday calls in an emergency. ""You know that the controllers can't really help you,"" he told CNN. ""You and your co-pilot are going to have to solve this."" It's too soon to know what happened to the missing plane, he said. Details released so far show some similarities, Diehl said, with an Air Algerie flight that disintegrated and crashed in July after changing its flight path because of bad weather. But there's also a chance that the AirAsia flight didn't crash after losing contact with air traffic control, he said. The Airbus A320 is equipped with a ditching switch, Diehl said, that essentially turns the plane's fuselage into a boat. ""If they got the aircraft down on the water safely,"" he said, ""it should be floating."" 'Very good' safety reputation . As word spread of the missing plane, the airline changed the color of its logo on its website and social media accounts from red to gray. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo said his nation was ""praying for the safety"" of those on board. Pope Francis also prayed for the missing, according to Vatican Radio. AirAsia is a Malaysia-based airline that is popular in the region as a budget carrier. It travels to about 100 destinations, with affiliate companies in several Asian countries. The missing plane is operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, in which the Malaysian company holds a 48.9% stake, according to its website. AirAsia has a ""very good"" reputation for safety, CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said. Flight 8501's captain has a total of 20,537 flying hours, with 6,100 of them with AirAsia Indonesia on the Airbus A320, the airline said. The first officer has a total of 2,275 flying hours, AirAsia said. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16, it said. The French Foreign Ministry said the first officer is the French citizen who is on the plane. A state-run company in Indonesia that manages airports identified the first officer as Remi Emmanuel Plesel. Airbus said the plane had ""accumulated approximately 23,000 flight hours in some 13,600 flights."" The aircraft manufacturer said it would provide full assistance to authorities in charge of investigating the missing plane. The loss of contact with the AirAsia plane comes nearly 10 months after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which dropped off radar over Southeast Asia on March 8 with 239 people on board. The Malaysia Airlines plane, a Boeing 777-200ER, lost contact with air traffic control over the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. Searchers have yet to find any debris from Flight 370, which officials believe crashed in the southern Indian Ocean after veering dramatically off course. But some aviation experts don't think the search for Flight 8501 will be as grueling as the search for MH370. ""We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,"" Quest said. ""We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia. There will be much better radar coverage. There's certainly better air traffic control coverage.""","Indonesian official: ""Our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea""

"(CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight and comedian Micah ""Katt"" Williams were arrested Wednesday, accused of stealing a photographer's camera last month. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said each man was charged with one count of robbery. The alleged incident, involving a female photographer of celebrities, took place September 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills. Knight, 49, faces up to 30 years in prison because he has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. Williams, who was arrested when he showed up at court for a different assault case, faces a maximum of seven years. Knight was arrested in Las Vegas. Prosecutors said they will ask for Knight's bail to be set at $1 million and for a $75,000 bail for Williams, 43. Beverly Hills Police are still investigating the case, authorities said. CNN reached out to representatives for both men Wednesday night without immediate success. Knight founded the successful Death Row Records in 1991, signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. Video shows man shooting 'Suge' Knight at VMA party . Williams began his career as a stand-up comic, gaining attention in 1999 for his often raunchy comedy club appearances. Television appearances on the BET network led to more success. His 2006 HBO special ""Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1"" raised his profile even higher. He has acted in several movies, including Eddie Murphy's ""Norbit,"" and his voice is featured in several popular cartoons, including ""The Boondocks.""

"Paint peeling off the walls. Sheets for curtains. Broken blinds. A mangled wicker chair made settable with a  board. An ancient stove with a giant hole. And there's also the pile of underwear in the living room. What looks and feels like the most rundown frat house on campus is actually the Capitol Hill home of some of the most powerful men in Washington. ""Welcome to the Omega House,"" joked Dick Durbin, who is the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate. ""This is where I've lived for 31 years,"" boasted Chuck Schumer, the Senate's third-ranking Democrat. It's hard to believe half the Senate Democratic leadership lives in these conditions, together. But they have for decades. When Rep. George Miller, D-California, the third roommate and landlord, came in the door, he immediately ribbed the Senators as deadbeats. ""You guys get the rent from them?"" asked Miller. The house is so legendary that it inspired the new television series ""Alpha House"" on Amazon.com. 'How can this work?' None of the real ""Alpha House"" members has seen the show, so they said. But they were all quick to say the characters -- who are Republicans -- are nothing like them. ""How can this work?"" asked Durbin. ""Republican Senators trying to make out they would live in a place like this."" They have a point, which may be why the creators of ""Alpha House"" cleaned up the fictitious home. Maybe it's that life is stranger than fiction. Or, more likely, no one would believe prominent politicians would live the way they do in the real Alpha House. ""Wait a minute!"" exclaimed Miller, the owner, when we pointed that out. But he was feigning offense. Thirty seconds with the three and it is clear they revel in the notoriety of their living conditions. Still, it has been years since they all gathered for this kind of interview and tour of the Capitol Hill row house. The odd living arrangement began in the early '80s -- when Miller's family decided they no longer wanted to live in D.C., and moved back to the California district he represents. Miller was living in the house alone until one night when there was a snowstorm and former Democratic Rep. Marty Russo of Illinois stayed over so he could walk to the Capitol. They decided to make it permanent since it was convenient. They soon convinced Schumer, a House member at the time, to move in. They had other roommates over the years that have since retired or been defeated, including former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, when he was in Congress. But what is most striking about the place, aside from the mess, is that it's a time warp. They've done virtually nothing to update since Miller's family left three decades ago. Jackson Browne and the Beatles . Records -- real vinyl -- line the bookshelf. One of them was Jackson Browne's ""The Pretender,"" which came out in 1976. Another was an old Beatles album. ""The same exact records are there now as the day I moved in, 1982, 31 years ago,"" Schumer said. Then there are the dust-covered books that were bestsellers in the early '80s. The furniture is a hodgepodge of what the lawmakers salvaged from various relatives and other parts of their lives. Durbin took one of the couches from his son, who was about to throw it out. ""He put it out in the trash -- it had to be 12, 14 years ago -- and I said it's better than anything we have. So we reclaimed it,"" Durbin recalled. He said the coffee table is 46 years old -- the first piece of furniture Durbin and his wife bought when they were married. ""We're not afraid of the burglars,"" Miller said, ""because we've been burgled twice and they took nothing."" The living room, virtually the only room on the first floor of the house, also serves as Schumer's bedroom. But ""bedroom"" is a generous term. He sleeps on a mattress next to the kitchen. He half-made his bed for our visit, which Durbin said was a lot more effort than Schumer usually makes. ""I spruced it up for your coming here,"" joked Schumer. Too much information . There is no bathroom on the first floor, so Schumer has to use one on the second floor, where Miller and Durbin have actual bedrooms, with doors. ""When you're my age, at four in the morning to trudge up the stairs to the bathroom, it's no picnic,"" Schumer shared. Next to his mattress is a door to the outside, with broken and bent blinds. ""I can see the weather without having to get out of bed,"" Schumer said. ""It's a special effect."" His ties are strewn over an old couch, which serves as his makeshift closet. And then, there's the kitchen. The freezer doesn't work. The refrigerator is a sight to behold, but exactly what you would imagine based on the rest of the house: beer cans and old food, including a baguette so hard that Schumer grabbed it and demonstrated how you can use it as a weapon. The stovetop has a giant hole, which Miller said, perhaps in jest, was made by the rats they've found in the house -- which they still have traps around to catch. ""I thought the rats were in the Senate. I didn't know they came to the House,"" Miller said without missing a beat. Since the only visible cookware is a kettle so rusty and old that Miller joked it was a gift from Ben Franklin, the three men resort to the easiest meal possible: cold cereal. The counter is covered with bulk boxes of Raisin Bran, Mini-Wheats and Kashi. And there is a giant plastic bag of sweetener, which looks like it has been swiped from various fundraisers along the way. ""I prefer Raisin Bran. But I like the Mini-Wheats,"" Durbin said. ""When you come home late at night and you have to still stay up to work, my incentive? Some people like a nice, you know, jigger of scotch. Mine is Raisin Bran. It keeps me up and I read the newspapers,"" Schumer said. Early risers . What is a typical day in the house like? Durbin is usually the first one up and out at 5:30 a.m. when he goes to the gym. Next is Miller, who usually takes a morning walk around the monuments. ""They leave while I'm sleeping. We do it by design. We hate each other,"" Schumer said, laughing. In all seriousness, they don't do much hanging out together here. Unlike the ""Alpha House"" characters, the real lawmakers are rarely home at the same time. ""He comes in at 12 o'clock at night talking on his cell phone,"" Miller said of Schumer. ""Half his staff must be in Hawaii for picking up the phone at midnight."" It is hard to believe such high-profile politicians live in these conditions. ""When my wife comes, she will not stay here,"" Schumer confessed. What helps make it work is that they're only in Washington about three nights a week. And, Miller said, they're good friends. ""We all have different schedules. We all have different interests. You can come back here. You can catch up with one another. You can catch up with the House and the Senate. We know one another's families, so you know what the kids are doing. You know what the grandkids are doing,"" Miller said. ""I might add location, location, location,"" Durbin interjected. The house is just blocks from the Capitol. ""It is close to where we work. And it's easy to get back and forth, and I think that has spoiled us,"" Durbin said. Durbin sums up another reason he's lived here for 21 years, and Schumer for 31, this way: . ""We love it. It's home.""","What resembles a frat house is actually home to prominent Democratic lawmakers .

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon urgently investigated whether six American troops killed in Afghanistan on Tuesday may have died from enemy fire after their helicopter crashed, rather than from the crash itself, two senior U.S. officials said. ""We do not know how those killed were killed,"" one of the officials told CNN. ""It's unclear if it was the crash or contact with the enemy after the helo came down."" One person survived. It was the single-deadliest day for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since a helicopter wreck killed seven Americans and four Afghans in August 2012. On Tuesday, the Pentagon said initial reporting indicated that six members of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force were killed when their Black Hawk helicopter crashed. Military officials cited potential mechanical failure and said at the time there was no indication of enemy activity in the area where NATO forces move around frequently. Later in the day, questions surfaced about whether the troops may have actually survived the crash and then came under mortar fire. ""We believe there was some sort of enemy engagement once the helicopter crashed,"" one of the officials said. Both officials declined to be named because of uncertainty over what occurred. They emphasized strongly there had been no conclusion about the report of enemy fire. Crew members of a second helicopter flying in the area would be interviewed. Investigators also would look at the wreckage and conduct autopsies for clues. Names of those killed were not released. Interactive: Coalition troops killed in Afghanistan, Iraq .

"President Obama arrived in Seoul on Friday to news that North Korea may be counting down to a nuclear weapons test. Such moves out of Pyongyang are no surprise and are typical behavior for the North, Obama told reporters while in Tokyo, his previous stop on his Asia trip. The President said he was prepared to deliver a firm response if a test is conducted during his visit. North Korea's heightened activity at its nuclear test site was already known. But now, the final step needed for an underground detonation has been taken, a South Korean government official said Thursday. The North has closed off the entrance to the tunnel at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, the official said. That gives Pyongyang 11 days to either detonate a nuclear device or cancel the test. It would be the North's fourth test of a nuclear weapon. United front . Obama and South Korean President Park Geun-hye want to display a united front against North Korea, and the communist dictatorship reacted earlier in the week to the American President's visit with condemnation. Its Foreign Ministry has called the trip ""a reactionary and dangerous one, as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region."" At a joint news conference Friday, Park praised Obama for his presence during renewed tensions on the peninsula. ""President Obama's visit to Korea sends a strong message to North Korea that its provocative acts cannot be tolerated,"" she said. Obama called North Korea ""the most isolated country in the world."" International sanctions and condemnation have led to extreme suffering for its people, he said. In light of possible new provocations, he said the United States and South Korea have agreed that they need to find new ways to pressure Pyongyang, such as ""further sanctions that have even more bite."" Park said that the two countries would ""spare no efforts"" to deter North Korea. But she also underlined the South's desire to tend to the dire needs of the North Korean people and to work toward Korean reunification. Ferry disaster . The possibility of a nuclear test adds a dark cloud to the grim mood overshadowing Obama's visit -- the sorrow over the capsizing of the ferry Sewol. As he often does at home, he is acting as ""consoler-in-chief,"" offering support to survivors and victims' families as he pauses from policy and diplomatic demands. More than 180 people have been confirmed dead, many of them high school students, and the nation has been consumed with grief. Many of the nearly 500 on board are still missing. The tragedy has occupied most of Park's time over the past week. Obama presented her with a framed American flag that was flown over the White House the same day the ferry sank as a symbol of condolence. In an interview with Korean news outlet JoongAng Ilbo, he said: . ""Michelle and I sent our deepest condolences to the South Korean people, and as parents we cannot begin to imagine what all those grieving parents are going through, having lost their sons and daughters."" Stately ceremonies . The President also tended to American servicemen and women in South Korea on Friday. He laid a wreath at the National War Memorial to commemorate those who died in the war between the Koreas from 1950 to 1953. Nearly 3 million people died on all sides, including more than 36,000 American servicemen. The conflict ended in an armistice that stopped the fighting, but a peace treaty was never signed. The United States has maintained a large military presence in South Korea since then. The President also congratulated U.S. military personnel and spouses of soldiers who were being naturalized as U.S. citizens Friday. And he took the opportunity to stump for immigration reform. ""Thirteen of you made the profound decision to put on the uniform of a country that was not yet fully your own,"" he said from a stage. ""Seven of you married a military soldier."" He praised the new citizens, who had immigrated from 14 countries, as an asset to the United States. He said Americans must ""keep in mind the value of our immigrants to our way of life. It is central to who we are."" After they took the oath of citizenship, the President posed for a photo with the entire group. Pacific allies . Obama headed to Seoul from Tokyo, where a formal state visit --- complete with a royal audience and a black-tie dinner --- was meant to exhibit strong ties between Japan and the United States. At a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama was pressed on whether he would use military force to defend an obscure set of islands controlled by Japan that are at the heart of a heated regional dispute with China. He said the U.S. security pact with Japan does extend to the islands -- known as Diaoyu to the Chinese -- and insisted his implicit offer to defend them against any Chinese incursion did not amount to drawing a red line around the contested land. ""The treaty between the U.S. and Japan preceded my birth, so this isn't a red line that I'm drawing,"" Obama said. ""There's no shift in position, no red line. Were simply applying the treaty."" The group of islands and rocks jutting out of the ocean is tiny and uninhabited. But the longstanding dispute over them has sent tempers flaring in Beijing and Tokyo, especially in recent years. The area around them in the South China Sea between Taiwan and Okinawa is believed to be rich in oil resources. Senkaku is administered by the Japanese, but the Chinese say they are the rightful owners. The missing plane . Seoul is the first of two stops on Obama's tour where citizens are coming to grips with major transportation disasters --- on Saturday, Obama flies to Malaysia, where government officials continue to search in vain for the Malaysian Airlines jetliner that disappeared more than a month ago. Those officials have come under withering criticism, accused of botching the search and keeping family members of those on board in the dark. So far, the White House has avoided faulting Malaysian leaders for the efforts, instead highlighting the U.S. efforts to help find the plane. Ukraine . Reporters questioned the U.S. President on the situation in Ukraine and his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama praised the unity of other countries, particularly in Europe, in condemning Moscow's ""meddling"" in Ukraine. He placed much of the blame on Russia for the breakdown of a peace agreement made last week in Geneva, Switzerland. The Ukrainian government has been carrying out its side of that agreement, he said. It has, for example, offered amnesty to those who will lay down their arms. The agreement also calls for both sides to refrain from violence. On Thursday, the Ukrainian government said its forces killed five pro-Russian activists while destroying opposition roadblocks. ""What we have not seen is Russia speaking out clearly, condemning the pro-Russian militias that have taken over these buildings,"" the President said. Bigger sanctions need to be prepared in case of a Russian ground invasion, he said. He also said that Russia's economy, which was already weakening, would suffer as investors bailed out of the country over the Ukraine crisis. And he directed criticism at Putin. ""Mr. Putin, in my second term, has had an increasing tendency to view the world through a Cold War prism and to see Russia's interests as invariably in conflict with the West's,"" he said.

"(CNN)Climbing a height equivalent to Mount Everest just once would be a shuddering thought for most people, but can you imagine trying to scale 8,848 meters more than 20 times in six months ... on skis? That's the distance Mireia Miro estimates she covers every season in a bid to stay fit for the lung-busting sport of ski mountaineering. ""In a normal winter, when we start skiing in November and we finish in April, sometimes May, I can do around 200,000 meters of elevation gain,"" Miro told CNN's Human to Hero series. The dedication to fitness has helped the Spanish dynamo reach the summit of her sport winning a clutch of titles in recent years. But not even trophies can match the winning feeling of being at one with nature. ""I love being in the mountains -- it makes me feel part of the world, part of the Earth,"" she says. ""I don't know how to explain it ... it's a little bit difficult ... but when I'm in the mountains, especially ski mountaineering, in winter alone, I have a peaceful feeling and I feel part of the things that surround me,"" she adds. ""When I go up, I'm able to think of nothing -- it's as if your head is empty. For me, it's kind of a way to disconnect from the world."" Today, under a canvas of blue sky that could have been painted by her namesake Joan Miro, the Catalan skier is quietly blazing a trail through the snowy terrain, negotiating the gentler slopes of the Pyrenees before effortlessly switching up a gear to tackle steeper climbs. ""What I like in the mountains in winter is that you can choose your own trail. When I'm on the skis, I can always choose where I want to go."" she explains. Combining elements of cross-country and alpine skiing, ski mountaineering, or ""skimo"" for short, can be done for recreation or competitively with skiers racing against the clock over a set pre-set course. ""Senior women normally do 1,500 meters -- that's quite a lot, but we do three or four uphills and three or four downhills. The first women normally do that in one hour 30 minutes, one hour 40 minutes maximum -- (you are) always pushing yourself."" There are dangers, notably avalanches when venturing off piste, but Miro has avoided them so far. ""I'm lucky, I can say that I haven't had any really scary situations,"" she says. With around 25 races to complete every season, Miro has to constantly be in peak physical shape which means putting in the hard yards almost every day. The staggering uphill climbs she completes during a season -- more than 120 miles worth -- are as much a mental battle as a physical one, she says. ""I think that the mind is the motor of the body. If your mind is ready, is open to new things, you will enjoy it. If your mind is closed and you don't want to improve, you won't enjoy it."" With that philosophy, it is perhaps no wonder that the 26-year-old has been so successful winning dozens of races in recent years -- the high point coming in 2011 when she skied to both the World Championship and World Cup titles. Miro is also one of only a handful of women to have won the legendary Pierra Menta twice. The annual ski mountaineering race in the French Alps sees teams of two compete over four days on a monster of a course with elevations totaling 10,000 meters. ""I was dreaming of (winning the) World Championships (and) I was dreaming of Pierra Menta, but I didn't expect to win them because I thought I would never have the level to do it. So when I won both, for me it was like, wow, this is one of the best moments of my life!"" Unlike many skiing stars, Miro wasn't clipped into her bindings from an early age. In fact, she grew up in Barcelona on Spain's north-eastern coast more interested in swimming and martial arts. But annual summer holidays to the Pyrenees soon fostered a lasting affection for alpine activities. ""My family took me to the mountains. We went for picnics, we went to see the lakes, we went to see animals, to see flowers but then when I was 12, I realized I wanted more. I wanted to learn more about mountains,"" she says. Her initial ski mountaineering outing was almost her last though. ""The first time I went other people were telling me 'you will love it! You will enjoy the descents, it's very beautiful'. But I was so tired when I arrived at the summit that I couldn't get down. I just did one turn and fell on the ground! So it was like: 'I don't like this sport. It's too tiring!"" A skiing career looked to have been stopped in its tracks before it had even started, but when she signed up for tests at a training center -- Catalonia's Ski Mountaineering Technical Center --  at the age of 17, it changed her mind and the course of her life forever. ""I decided to go and just try and they picked me! That was the moment I started training and competing,"" she said. Miro was in good company at the center, counting superstar sky runner Kilian Jornet as one of her peers. Skyrunning is a sport that Miro also likes to compete in during the summer months, primarily as a way to keep fit for winter ski racing, although a troublesome knee hampered her progress in both activities last year. But the injury didn't completely ground her. ""Last year, I started BASE jumping. It's very different from ski mountaineering or skyrunning but I love it ... It also makes me feel part of things that are around me and part of nature,"" she says. ""With BASE jumping you realize that you are nothing and you have to take chances and you have to live your life every day and give all your energy to live it in the best way possible."" Miro has recently made a return to the slopes and is currently competing at the Ski Mountaineering World Championships in Verbier, Switzerland. After feeling the thrill of jumping off tall buildings last summer, heading back to the slopes could have felt like a bit of a comedown. But the Catalan native is adamant that scaling snowy peaks will always rock her world. ""I love ski mountaineering because it gives me the feeling of freedom. Ski mountaineering is part of me, I think that I need it.""","Spanish ski mountaineer Mireia Miro won the world championship in 2011 .

"(CNN)The day after a CNN investigation uncovered airport employees access airplanes and tarmacs without undergoing daily security screening, officials admitted that no one checks criminal backgrounds after workers are hired. ""It's fair to say that once an employee survives an initial background check ... which gives them access to the airport ... they don't go back and check criminal history?"" asked Rep. John Katko, R-New York, chairman of a House Homeland Security subcommittee, on Tuesday. ""That is correct from my knowledge,"" said Gary Perdue, the FBI's deputy assistant director of counterterrorism. These security loopholes and others threatening U.S. airports were critiqued at a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Transportation Security, where lawmakers questioned current regulations guiding airport security. The hearing followed three recent breaches in Atlanta, including a gun smuggling operation in December, involving a Delta baggage handler and passenger. The baggage handler allegedly brought the guns to work, entered the gate area and passed the weapons onto a passenger who had already gone through security. A CNN investigation found that only two of the nation's major airports -- Miami International Airport and Orlando International Airport -- require all employees with secure access to pass through metal detectors. The Miami airport also conducts random criminal background checks after hiring employees. Miguel Southwell, the general manager of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where the breaches occurred, expressed support for implementing full screening of employees with access to secure areas of the Atlanta airport Tuesday, but he did not specify if and when this screening will begin. ""We recognize that 100% screening of airport employees has operational and cost challenges,"" Southwell said in his written testimony. ""But the unmistakable fact, as recent events suggest, is that we need to be consistently vigilant in our efforts."" ""Any system is only as strong as its weakest link,"" Southwell added. Southwell said the Atlanta airport will begin reprogramming employee badges to limit the number of points employees can enter secure areas of the airport. Mark Hatfield, the acting deputy administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, said the TSA is now examining these breaches to determine what investments and policy changes may be necessary. Hatfield cited a 2008 study by the Homeland Security Institute that concluded random screening of airport employees proved nearly as effective as 100% screening, but he added an updated study could benefit current discussions. Katko questioned the logic of spending billions of dollars per year on passenger screening while not implementing similar security for employees. ""What good is all the screening at the front door if we are not paying attention enough at the back door? The answer is common sense,"" Katko said . In 2014, the TSA performed 7,234 hours of random employee screening in Atlanta and 257,979 hours of nationally, but at Tuesday's hearing, Hatfield said the Atlanta breaches show U.S. airports remain ""open"" and ""porous"" to threats. ""We can do better,"" he said.","Security loopholes threatening U.S. airports are critiqued at a hearing before a House panel .

"(CNN) -- First a soldier guarding a hallowed war memorial was gunned down in Canada's capital. Then shots erupted in the halls of the country's Parliament minutes later. The two shootings in Ottawa Wednesday left lawmakers barricaded inside offices and parts of the city on lockdown for hours as police searched for suspects. Ottawa Police lifted the lockdown Wednesday night and said there was no longer a danger to the public. But many questions remain about the shootings: Who was the gunman? Why did he open fire? And was he acting alone? ""It appears there was just one shooter, and that shooter is dead,"" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""But it has been a traumatic experience, obviously, for not only our city but the country."" Investigators haven't provided any possible motives for the shooting. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper didn't provide details about the investigation in a televised address to the nation Wednesday night. ""In the days to come, we will learn more about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had, but this week's events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere in the world,"" Harper said. ""Let there be no misunderstanding: We will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated."" It is unclear whether additional suspects were tied to the shootings or whether additional arrests have been made. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said more information would be provided in a press conference Thursday. As authorities continued to investigate, details began to emerge about the man they suspect was behind the shooting. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was identified by Canadian officials to their American counterparts as the suspected gunman, multiple U.S. officials told CNN. Bibeau, who was born in 1982, was a convert to Islam and had a history of drug use before he converted, two sources said. His passport had been confiscated by Canadian authorities when they learned he planned to go fight overseas, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN's Susan Candiotti. The official said it was not clear when that happened. Canadian broadcaster CBC reported that Bibeau had a record of drug arrests going back 10 years. 'Murdered in cold blood' Cpl. Nathan Cirillo was ""murdered in cold blood"" as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial, Harper said, expressing condolences to the slain Canadian soldier's family. The soldier appeared to have been shot in the back, said Peter Henderson, a journalist who was at the memorial at the time of the shooting. Other soldiers who were nearby doing drills at the time ran to help, he said. Three people brought to The Ottawa Hospital after the shootings have been released, hospital spokeswoman Hazel Harding told CNN. Earlier, they were described as being in stable condition. Shortly after the shooting at the memorial, a gunman entered the nearby building on Parliament Hill, officials said. ""I heard rapid fire -- gunshots going very loud -- and I figure maybe 20-plus shots within 10 seconds,"" Canadian Deputy House Leader Kevin Lamoureux told CNN. He was one level below the gunshots. Gunfire first erupted in the building's foyer. Then a second round of shooting happened about a minute later in a hallway or near the entrance to the Parliament's library, Wingrove told CNN. Several officers had weapons drawn, he said, and most of the dozens of shots that he heard appeared to have been fired by officers at the gunman. When the shooting ended, a person was lying motionless on the ground near the library entrance, Wingrove said. Parliament member James Lunney tweeted: #HOC in Lockdown, lone gunman shot security guard, shot his way down Hall of Honor....we are all safe. Gunman dead! Thnk God & our scrty!"" In Twitter posts, several Canadian lawmakers hailed a top security official as a hero, crediting him with shooting the gunman inside Parliament. ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,"" Craig Scott, a member of Parliament, wrote. Another soldier killed Monday . A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that a connection to terrorism hasn't been ruled out. On Monday, a man who Canadian authorities said was ""radicalized"" killed a Canadian soldier with his car. The man was then shot and killed. Police: Man who ran down and killed soldier was 'radicalized' There was no immediate indication that the Monday and Wednesday incidents were related. In response to the shootings, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, has increased its alert posture, CNN has learned. That means that it has increased the number of planes on a higher alert status ready to respond if needed. NORAD and Canadian authorities are in contact, an official told CNN. Prime Minister secure during shooting . MP Tony Clement tweeted that he heard ""at least 30 shots"" and apparently was able to take cover with colleagues. He also tweeted that Prime Minister Harper was secure. Harper was safely evacuated from the building, tweeted his press secretary, Carl Vallee. Hours after the Parliament attack, Harper spoke by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama. ""Obviously, we're all shaken by it,"" Obama later told reporters, ""but we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're standing side by side with Canada during this difficult time."" Watson said that Wednesday was ""a sad and tragic day for our city and our country."" ""There's no pain greater than losing a loved one -- to have it happen in such circumstances as this morning is beyond expression, and underlined by a sad anger within my heart,"" he said. Canada raised its terror threat level . The violence at Parliament comes just days after Canada raised its terror alert Friday. The suspect in Monday's vehicle attack, Martin Rouleau Couture, reportedly converted to Islam about a year ago. Police arrested him last July and confiscated his passport, but lacked enough evidence to keep him in custody, said Martine Fontaine of the RCMP. ""When he was arrested, he was about to go to Turkey,"" Fontaine said. ""We stopped him as he was about to leave Canada for terrorist actions. He was questioned when he was arrested. We have not been able to determine any real threat at this time.""

"Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the Holocaust the most heinous crime in modern human history, his office said in a statement Sunday. He called the Holocaust an embodiment of racism, in response to a question by Rabbi Marc Schneier on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, the statement from the Palestine Liberation Organization said. He said Palestinians reject racism and ethnic discrimination, and he called on the world to fight it. ""The Palestinian people, who suffer from injustice, oppression and denied freedom and peace, are the first to demand to lift the injustice and racism that befell other peoples subjected to such crimes,"" the statement read. The PLO called on Israel to ""conclude a just and comprehensive peace in the region, based on the two states vision."" Monday is Holocaust Remembrance Day. Ceremonies begin after sundown Sunday. In his 1983 doctoral dissertation, Abbas wrote of ""the Zionist fantasy, the fantastic lie that six million Jews were killed"" and said only 890,000 Jews were killed by Nazis -- and that these were chiefly the victims of a Zionist-Nazi plot, the Jerusalem Post reported Sunday.  But in 2011, he said he did ""not deny the Holocaust"" and that he had ""heard from the Israelis that there were six million"" victims, adding, ""I can accept that,"" The New York Times reported. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he was struggling to reconcile Abbas' remarks on the Holocaust with the decision by his Fatah movement last week to seek a unity government with Hamas. Abbas ""can't have it both ways,"" by calling the Holocaust the most heinous crime in modern history while embracing Hamas, a ""terrorist organization that denies the Holocaust and openly calls for a new extermination of the six million Jews of Israel,"" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu said Abbas is likely seeking to carry out ""damage control"" with his latest remarks. ""What he's trying to do is to placate Western public opinion that understands that he delivered a terrible blow to the peace process by embracing these Hamas terrorists, and I think he is trying to wiggle his way out of it."" A tweet Sunday from Netanyahu's office said Abbas ""is forging a pact with Holocaust deniers."" It included a photo of Abbas smiling alongside Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal. Fatah and Hamas announced Wednesday they will begin discussions to form a unity government. An interim government could be finalized in the next five weeks, with elections possible by early 2015, Fatah spokesman Fayez Abu Eita said. After the reconciliation was announced, Netanyahu's office said Israel canceled peace negotiations that were scheduled to take place that night. Israel and the Palestinian Authority face an April 29 deadline to agree on a framework for a comprehensive peace treaty, but the sides appear far apart.

"(CNN)The family of a Jordanian fighter pilot mercilessly killed by ISIS is calling for total revenge. Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, 27, was burned alive while confined in a cage. In response, Jordan executed two prisoners -- Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be suicide bomber whose release ISIS had previously demanded as part of a prisoner exchange, and Ziad Karbouli, a former top aide to the deceased leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The pilot's father is demanding his country do more. ""These were criminals and there is no comparison between them and Moath. His blood is more valued than Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad Karbouli,"" said al-Kasasbeh's father, Safi. ""I demand that revenge should be bigger than executing prisoners."" His son's horrific death was recorded and the video was posted online Tuesday. CNN is not showing the images, which drew global condemnation and prompted protests and vows of retaliation in Jordan. King Abdullah has promised a strong response, saying that ISIS isn't just fighting his nation, but warring against ""noble Islam"" itself. The country now wants to step up airstrikes against the terrorist organization, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. But the pilot's uncle, Yassin Al Rawashdeh, told CNN that he also wants to see ground troops involved in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Said the pilot's father: ""I demand that this criminal organization (ISIS) ... should be annihilated."" What comes next? Demonstrators took to the streets in Amman and the pilot's hometown immediately after the video was made public. One protester held a poster that read: ""They burned our hearts, so let's burn their dens, and their prisoners in our prisons."" Jordanian government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani has vowed ""an earthshaking retaliation"" and ""a revenge that equals the tragedy that has befallen the Jordanians."" Exactly what that response will look like remains to be seen, although the outlines of it are starting to take shape. Jordan's military is seeking to conduct more of the anti-ISIS airstrikes assigned by the coalition, a U.S. official told CNN. According to that official, the number of strikes Jordan can carry out will depend on the location of the targets, weather and other factors. ISIS apparently made a big show of the pilot's brutal execution in Raqqa, its stronghold in Syria. An activist network, ""Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently,"" reported that the killing was being shown, repeatedly, on large screens across the city. One of ISIS' propaganda production outlets posted a video online that appears to show a crowd cheering as flames around the pilot grow. The video features a tight shot of a boy, looking up as if in awe and saying that he would ""burn the pilot"" himself if he had a chance and that ""all Arab tyrants should also be burned."" The boy can also be heard saying ""Obama the dog."" Because the video is carefully orchestrated propaganda, CNN has no way to know if people in Raqqa really feel this way, if other children were present or whether the video participants' responses were authentic or a result of intimidation. There are anti-ISIS activists inside Raqqa who operate very quietly. One of them, with ""Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently,"" told CNN on Tuesday that on January 8, he was standing in the street when several ISIS fighters approached, bragging that they had set the pilot on fire. Other ISIS members acted impressed but dubious, and a disturbingly juvenile moment ensued in which the ISIS fighters making the claim said that it was true, they were there and saw it. Jordan last week said it was willing to release al-Rishawi, the would-be suicide bomber, in exchange for al-Kasasbeh, but the swap never happened. The Jordanian government repeatedly asked ISIS to show proof that the pilot was still alive. Shortly after the video of al-Kasasbeh's killing became public, Jordanian military spokesman Mamdouh Al Amri said that authorities believe the pilot had been killed as far back as January 3, before ISIS began making its public demands for the release of al-Rishawi. King Abdullah arrived back in Jordan on Wednesday after cutting short a visit to the United States, where he met with President Barack Obama. ""The brave pilot gave his life defending his faith, country and nation and joined other Jordanian martyrs who gave their lives for Jordan,"" Abdullah said in a televised statement Tuesday, describing ISIS as a cowardly and deviant group that has nothing to do with Islam. Al-Kasasbeh was captured by ISIS in December after his fighter jet crashed near Raqqa. The pilot was one of eight children, according to the Jordan Times. He was from Karak governorate and graduated from King Hussein Air College, the newspaper said. At the time of his capture, his father told the paper that his son was ""a very modest and religious person"" who memorized the Quran and ""was never harmful to anyone."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described al-Kasasbeh as everything ISIS is not: ""He was brave, compassionate and principled."" ""That he was murdered after his father's plea for compassion reminds all the world that this foe has no agenda other than to kill and destroy, and places no value on life, including that of fellow Muslims,"" Kerry said. ISIS is known to be holding at least two Western hostages still: John Cantlie, a British journalist who has appeared in a number of ISIS-produced videos, and an American woman who is a 26-year-old aid worker. CNN's Ali Younes, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Greg Botelho, Becky Anderson, Jim Sciutto, Barbara Starr, Ed Payne, Caroline Faraj, Jessica King and Samira Said contributed to this report.","The pilot's uncle tells CNN he wants to see ground troops in the fight against ISIS .

"(CNN)No agreement was reached in Belarus on Saturday in talks aimed at ending months of deadly fighting between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian rebels, a diplomat with knowledge of the discussions said. The talks in Belarus' capital, Minsk, ended ""with no signature"" on any proposals ""after a couple of hours (of) discussions"" relating to the bitter conflict that has killed thousands of people in eastern Ukraine, the diplomat said on condition of anonymity. Discussions were unlikely to resume on Sunday, according to the diplomat. ""Differences were very wide and the atmosphere was described as not fruitful to agreement or cooperation,"" the diplomat said. At the meeting were representatives of the Ukrainian government, Russian government and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, as well as representatives of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin and Vladislav Deinego, according to Ukraine's national news agency, Ukrinform. The talks, which came on a week when fighting escalated in eastern Ukraine, had been expected to start Friday but were delayed. A previous ceasefire agreement negotiated in Minsk in September crumbled long ago. In the past 24 hours, 15 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 33 were wounded, Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council said in its daily update on the situation. The town of Vuglegirsk was the focus of the fiercest fighting on Saturday, the NDSC said, adding that separatist forces are trying to seize it so they can attack the town of Debaltseve afterward. Debaltseve, northeast of Donetsk city, has been the scene of fierce fighting in recent days as separatist forces seek to surround Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian authorities have evacuated 310 civilians from Debaltseve, the NDSC said. But the town's residents remain at risk. Twelve civilians have died in Debaltseve as the result of the militants' shelling, Vyacheslav Abroskiv, Donetsk regional police chief, reported on his official Facebook page. He said he was in the town and that the shelling was continuing. The reports of civilian deaths in Debaltseve come a day after shelling in Donetsk city killed 12 people, according to an official with the pro-separatist City Council. CNN could not confirm 12 deaths in Donetsk, but its team in the city saw seven bodies after a series of shell blasts near the center. It's not clear who is responsible for the shelling. In previous instances, each side has blamed the other. The chief monitor for the OSCE mission in Ukraine, Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan, condemned the shelling of densely populated civilian areas in eastern Ukraine. ""Yet again, innocent civilians have been impacted by the crisis, and yet again we are seeing more bloodshed,"" said Apakan. OSCE monitors were on the scene in Donetsk city Friday to examine what happened. ""It should be understood that the main outcome of such violence is a surge in human suffering. I urge all sides to exercise maximum restraint, and fully assume their responsibility to prevent further displacement and suffering, and to redouble their efforts to reach a political settlement,"" he said. The government in Kiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of fueling the violence by sending troops and military equipment over the border into Ukraine. Moscow denies the allegation, although it has said some Russian soldiers are fighting as volunteers. From mid-April to January 21, the conflict killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others, according to the United Nations. Journalist Victoria Butenko and CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Saturday's talks in Minsk went for two hours but yielded no signatures, diplomat says .

"Washington (CNN)It took less than six hours for a terror attack in Paris to trigger a budget fight in Washington. Republicans had seen an upcoming battle over funding for the Department of Homeland Security -- which, in addition to its anti-terrorism duties, also enforces immigration laws -- as an opportunity to force a confrontation with President Barack Obama over his move to limit deportations. House leaders are set to unveil the bill re-igniting that fight Friday. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN after the Paris attack Wednesday that the party should rethink those plans -- or at least make sure they're narrowly tailored. ""I hope that we could challenge the executive action of the President in a mature fashion,"" he said. ""I've never been for shutting down Homeland Security."" The Homeland Security Department's funding is due to expire Feb. 27 -- a date chosen by Republicans in December, as they hashed out a deal to keep the rest of the government up and running through much of 2015, specifically to force Obama into a confrontation over immigration. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Wednesday that the department needs to be funded through an appropriations bill -- not the sort of continuing resolution Congress has used in recent years to keep agencies afloat. Johnson: Paris attack sign of 'evolving nature of the terrorist threat' He said right now, priorities like the Secret Service, the Coast Guard, border security efforts and pay increases for the agency's employees are all being shorted. ""We can't continue to function through a continuing resolution. That poses a real risk to homeland security,"" he said in an interview with CNN. Speaking with CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday night, Johnson added that the fight over Obama's executive action on immigration that has bogged down DHS funding in political controversy ""doesn't really make any sense,"" because it's impossible to defund the action Obama took to delay deportations and prioritize searches at the border. The President has said he'd veto any DHS funding bill that attempted to roll back his immigration move, Johnson said, and he urged lawmakers against ""playing political football with the budget of the homeland security capability of this nation."" ""There are things that need to be funded -- new starts, new funding for border security, counterterrorism, the Secret Service, that cannot wait much longer,"" Johnson said. ""For the homeland security of this nation, we need an appropriations bill and we need it soon,"" he added. He also said had spoken that morning to House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, a Republican, about his concerns and expressed confidence they would finally come to an agreement on funding the department. ""[McCaul] shares my concern,"" he said. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, agreed with Graham, telling CNN: ""I think we have to rifle shot these things, rather than meat axe. And so, we'll be talking about best ways to address it without shutting down the government."" Obama, Kerry condemn terror attack in France, vow to help . Rep. Peter King, meanwhile, said the Paris attack should be a ""wake-up call,"" and warned conservatives to make sure they don't harm the department's broader functions. ""If they want to target immigration to retaliate against the President, that's fine,"" the New York Republican told reporters on the hill. ""But we have to make it clear that Homeland Security -- at a time we saw this massive attack in Paris -- that we can't be cutting funding or programs which would protect Americans from a terrorist attack."" Tying the two issues together brings the risk that Republicans could be blamed if the department shuts down -- either because Congress can't agree on a way to fund it, or because Obama vetoes a bill that doesn't pay for Homeland Security's immigration-related functions. Even some strident conservatives said they needed to avoid being seen as putting funding for the entire department at risk. ""I believe we should fully fund DHS and at the same time prevent the president from violating the constitution,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. The GOP took majority control of both the House and Senate on Tuesday, giving them extra leverage to try to undo Obama's executive action, potentially through the Homeland Security funding bill. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Wednesday that those plans haven't changed. ""There are terrorists around the world who are intent on killing Americans and other freedom loving individuals around the country. I believe that the President's executive action with regard to immigration are outside of the Constitution and outside of his power and I believe that we can deal with that issue in the Department of Homeland Security bill without jeopardizing the security of our country."" House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers said the terror attacks will not alter the Republicans' plans on the Homeland Security bill, which he said they will introduce on Friday and vote on it early next week. When the fight over the President's executive actions started last fall, Rogers and others argued that the agency tasked with carrying out the new policy couldn't be stripped of money by Congress because it is set up to self-fund operations through fees it collects. Rogers told reporters ""the only way to get at the use of these fees would be to change the basic law"" but said no decisions were final yet about the details of the bill. Conservative GOP Rep. John Fleming said he thinks spending bill still needs to target agencies dealing with immigration -- it can crafted in ""in such a way that it really hits the accounts."" ""This is not a seminal moment. We know that terrorism is going to happen in the future and we need to be prepared for it,""  Fleming said, but blamed the President for mixing immigration fight with security issues by taking his executive action. CNN's Dana Bash and Alexandra Jaffe contributed to this report.","Some Republicans say the party should rethink its plans to use Homeland Security funding as a vehicle to fight Obama on immigration .

Sixteen percent had no opinion on this issue.

"President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up their Sunnyland summit Saturday with a late-morning stroll in the California desert. Obama declared the visit ""terrific."" Over two days, the two leaders met for a total of eight hours at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands, just outside Palm Springs in California. The summit, held just four months after Xi took office, was meant to launch a close new relationship with a new Chinese leader. The backdrop was unusual. Opinion: Obama, talk about political reform with Xi . Sunnyland is a private estate of the Annenburg family. It is better known for hosting Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, and Ronald Reagan spent New Year's Eve 18 times there. Aides say the location offered the two leaders a quiet place to work through a range of issues. Among them: . North Korea -  The leaders agreed to keep up pressure on the country to rein in its nuclear ambitions. Cyber attacks -  According to the White House, the Chinese acknowledged the problem, agreed to investigate and work out ""rules of the road."" ""I believe we can work together on this rather than at cross-purposes,"" Obama said. Climate change - For the first time, China agreed to work with the United States to  limit the production of greenhouse gases. Obama gave the Chinese leader a parting gift: a bench made of California wood. During the summit, President Xi publicly invited Obama to visit China. White House officials say the president agreed.

"The European Union has imposed sanctions related to the crisis in Ukraine on another 15 people, bringing the total number targeted to 48. The EU said the people are collectively responsible for actions that ""undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine."" The targets include Dmitry Kozak, Russia's deputy prime minister; Russian military chief Valery Gerasimov; and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, including Denis Pushilin, the self-declared leader of the ""Donetsk People's Republic."" EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said she was alarmed by the worsening security situation in eastern Ukraine, and she called on Russia to take ""concrete steps"" in support of an international deal signed this month aimed at easing tensions. She warned that if necessary, the European Union ""will look at possible additional individual measures""  related to the crisis. Ashton also condemned an attack on the mayor of Kharkiv on Monday and the continued detention by pro-Russian militants of a team of military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. ""All persons still illegally detained by armed groups in eastern Ukraine need to be immediately released,"" she said. On Tuesday, pro-Russian activists in eastern Ukraine took control of the regional government headquarters in Luhansk. Video shows them as they approach the building, smash doors, wave flags and chant ""Russia! Russia!"" Pro-Russia activists also tried to break into that city's police headquarters by ramming a truck at the entrance, according to state-run news agency Ukrinform. A local reporter for Ukrinform, who was on the scene at police headquarters, described a fight, involving an explosion and gunfire. The activists demanded that police surrender their weapons and exit headquarters. They also claimed that the Luhansk police chief had submitted his resignation and that a new ""people's police"" chief had been ""assigned,"" though not everyone in the crowd agreed with the selection, the news agency reported. On his official website, Acting President Oleksander Turchinov said the events in eastern Ukraine ""illustrated inactivity, helplessness, and sometimes criminal betrayal of the law enforcement agencies in the Donetsk and (Luhansk) regions."" He said, ""It is hard to admit, but it is true. The vast majority of the law enforcement officials in the East are not able to fulfill their obligations to protect our citizens."" New heads of security have been appointed in Donetsk and Luhansk, he said. Western nations accuse Moscow of supporting the separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings in cities across the region and are holding the OSCE team hostage. Russia disputes that claim, saying it has no direct influence over the pro-Russian activists. Russia: 'Aren't you ashamed?' In a statement on its website Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the EU sanctions ""cannot but cause rejection"" and show a lack of comprehension of Ukraine's internal political situation. ""Instead of making the Kiev faction sit at the negotiating table with southeastern Ukraine, our partners follow Washington's lead with new unfriendly gestures regarding Russia,"" it said. The EU action is ""a direct invitation for local neo-Nazis to continue to promote anarchy and outrages regarding the civilians of the southeast,"" it said, repeating Russia's contention that ultranationalist groups are behind the unrest in Ukraine. The statement concluded with the question, ""Aren't you ashamed?"" On Monday, Russia promised a painful response to sanctions imposed by the United States. Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy minister for foreign relations, called the U.S. measures ""meaningless, shameful, and disgusting."" ""It will only intensify all the processes in Ukraine which it intends to change or stop,"" Ryabkov told CNN, speaking English. ""The U.S. does literally nothing to impress its cronies and clients in Kiev on whom there is full responsibility for constant deterioration of the situation in Ukraine. This is what needs to be changed and not the policy of Russia. ""A response of Moscow will follow, and it will be painfully felt in Washington."" Russia has not specified what measures it will impose against Western interests. According to Russia's state-run ITAR-Tass news agency, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his government has proposed imposing sanctions against the EU and the United States, but that he has not yet authorized them. ""The government of the Russian Federation has already proposed some retaliatory steps. I think there's not a need,"" the President reportedly told journalists. ""We would not like to resort to some steps -- retaliatory measures. I hope there will be no need,"" Putin said, according to ITAR-Tass. Ukraine crisis: The full sanctions list . U.S. sanctions . But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry appeared unfazed. He pledged Tuesday in an address to the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, that NATO would stand united to defend its members' territorial integrity. In its latest round of sanctions, the United States targeted seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Putin. The White House said the seven Russians, including two from Putin's inner circle, are subject to a freeze on any assets they may hold in the United States and a ban on U.S. travel. The two seen as closest to Putin are Igor Sechin, chairman of Russian oil giant Rosneft, and Sergey Chemezov, director general of Rostec, a state-owned industrial conglomerate in Russia. The companies the United States named are linked to officials and oligarchs who were designated last month, and the list included neither Rosneft itself nor gas exporter Gazprom. In addition, the United States will deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. The Commerce and State departments will revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions, the White House said in a statement. The move, Obama told reporters in Manila, Philippines, was intended to spur Putin to ""walk the walk, not just talk the talk"" in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. If the latest round of sanctions does not work, the next phase could target economic sectors like banking, Obama said. In all, the United States and European Union have imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 66 individuals, most of them senior Russian officials. The United States has sanctioned 18 companies in total. Analysis: Sanctions-lite won't move Russia . 'Stolen assets' Meanwhile, Britain is hosting a two-day international meeting aimed at helping Ukraine's government recover stolen assets, following claims of widespread corruption within the government of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. UK Home Secretary Theresa May, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the head of the Ukrainian delegation, acting Prosecutor General Oleh Makhnitskyi, are all taking part in the London forum. ""What we have committed to do is to persevere, to follow leads wherever we can find them,"" said Holder. Makhnitskyi said investigators were focused on years when Yanukovych and his associates were in charge. ""The Ukrainian society already demands results from the government,"" he said. Yanukovych fled to Russia in February after months of street protests that were sparked by his decision to drop closer trade ties with Europe and turn instead toward Moscow. In Ukraine, presidential elections have been called for May 25. But Oleg Tsarev said he had dropped out of the race. On his website, he said that he received death threats when he arrived in Kiev and that Ukrainian National Television turned down his request to participate in televised debates. ""In this regard, I have decided to withdraw my candidacy, because in such circumstances, being a candidate is not helpful,"" Tsarev said. ""We will seek other channels and opportunities to convey our thoughts and positions to residents of the central and western Ukraine."" Ukraine crisis: Who will blink first, Vladimir Putin or the West? Kharkiv mayor being treated in Israel . Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, who underwent surgery after being shot in the back Monday, is being treated in Israel, a hospital official said Tuesday. Kernes arrived overnight at Elisha Hospital in Haifa, the hospital's chief accountant Jacob Karwasser told CNN. The mayor was in stable condition, he said, and has family members with him. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the shooting. Police said an investigation was under way.

"(CNN)NBC medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman apologizes for violating quarantine. The husband of the Ebola-stricken Spanish nurse lashes out. A U.N. worker being treated for the disease in Germany dies. And the World Health Organization tweets that 8,914 Ebola cases and 4,447 deaths have been reported. With multiple developments under way, here's what you need to know Tuesday to get caught up on the latest: . U.S. DEVELOPMENTS . An apology for breaking quarantine . NBC medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman has issued an apology after she reportedly violated the quarantine her team was placed in when their cameraman contracted Ebola. ""As a health professional I know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public, but I am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused,"" she said in a statement. Cameraman says thank you . The NBC freelance cameraman who's recovering at the Nebraska Medical Center after contracting Ebola thanked everyone for their support in a Facebook post Monday. ""There have been some dark and profoundly frightening moments in this ordeal,"" he wrote. ""I won't ever know exactly when I slipped up and contracted the virus. I had been taking precautions but obviously they weren't enough."" Dallas nurse is 'clinically stable' Officials are still trying to figure out how a Dallas nurse who cared for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was infected. Nina Pham, a recent nursing college graduate, got her certification less than two months earlier. On Monday, she got a blood transfusion from American Ebola survivor Kent Brantly and is ""clinically stable."" Complete coverage on Ebola . Duncan's waste disposal blocked . A judge has granted a temporary restraining order blocking the disposal in a Louisiana hazardous waste landfill of incinerated waste from the Texas apartment where Ebola patient Duncan stayed. The company that incinerated the waste told CNN it had followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and had no plans to move the waste to Louisiana. 70 caregivers involved . About 70 staffers at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital were involved in Duncan's care, The Associated Press reports. On Monday, CDC Director Tom Frieden said, ""We do not today have a number of such exposed people or potentially exposed health care workers."" The blame game begins . The Agenda Project, a liberal advocacy group, has released an online ad that interlaces self-described ""disturbing footages of the Ebola outbreak"" with a mash-up of top Republicans -- including those tied up in crucial midterm contests and potential 2016 candidates -- saying the word ""cut."" The ad describes how the CDC saw its discretionary funding cut by $585 million from 2010 to 2014 and the National Institutes of Health has faced $446 million in cuts during the same period. WEST AFRICA DEVELOPMENTS . Chocolate companies join fight . Much of the production of the world's largest chocolate companies comes from West Africa, and the companies are worried the virus will disrupt production. Nestlé and Mars say they have already responded to a call from the World Cocoa Foundation, a nonprofit that helps small cocoa farmers. The group plans to disclose Wednesday how much it has raised. Others in the group include Hershey, Godiva, Ghirardelli, General Mills and Mondelez International. U.S. troops battle invisible enemy in Liberia . IN OTHER COUNTRIES . Ebola patient dies in Germany . A U.N. worker being treated for Ebola in Germany has died. The Sudanese man had contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, the St. Georg clinic in Leipzig said. Husband pens scathing letter . Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who contracted Ebola, is in critical condition and is having trouble breathing, authorities said. In a scathing letter, her husband said she received only 30 minutes of training in putting on protective gear and called for the resignation of Madrid's regional health minister.  ""Please explain to me how one puts on a protective suit, since unfortunately my wife doesn't have a master's degree in that,"" he wrote. CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine E.

"U.N. Security Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the ""growing threat"" posed by foreign terrorist fighters, a measure that U.S. President Barack Obama applauded while insisting it ""must be matched and translated into action"" to have any effect. ""Resolutions alone will not be enough, promises on paper cannot keep us safe, lofty rhetoric and good intentions will not stop a single terrorist attack,"" Obama said. If governments abide by the resolution and fully cooperate with one another, the world should become safer, the President said. But it won't be easy, especially given the potential of terrorism to spread beyond the Middle East: Obama noted U.S. intelligence estimates over 15,000 individuals from more than 80 nations have gone to fight in Syria, exacerbating the conflict there and raising the possibility they could ""come home"" and carry out deadly attacks. ""If there was ever a challenge in our interconnected world that could not be met by one nation alone it is this: terrorists crossing borders and threatening to unleash unspeakable violence,"" Obama said. The resolution passed Wednesday requires nations to ""suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting, equipping"" and financing of ""foreign terrorist fighters,"" according to Obama. It also also calls on government to ""help build the capacity of the states on the front lines of the fight."" But it will take more than corralling groups like ISIS militarily to permanently address the threat, Obama said. ""Potential recruits must hear the words of former terrorist fighters who have seen the truth: that groups like ISIL betray Islam by killing innocent men, women and children, the majority of whom are Muslim,"" the President said, using his administration's favored term for ISIS. Obama also said the world must do better at addressing root problems -- from economic insecurity and political instability, including in Syria, where he called for ""a political solution"" to the years-long civil war there -- that play a role in drawing some to join terrorist groups. ""We must work to address ... the oppression, the lack of opportunity, too often the hopelessness that can make some individuals susceptible to appeals of extremism and violence,"" he said. Unanimous vote, but hints of possible issues . After Obama's roughly 10-minute remarks, other world leaders echoed his anti-terrorism views, from Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's blasting of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram's ""despicable campaign against humanity"" to South Korean President Park Geun-hye calling them the ""scourge of mankind."" ""Terrorism is nothing new. It's been with us for years,"" French President Francois Hollande said at the Security Council meeting. ""But it has taken on another dimension, and it wants to conquer territory now."" There are no ""easy answers or quick fixes"" to addressing the terror threat in the Middle East, Africa and beyond, British Prime Minister David Cameron said. But something must be done, he added -- and for it to work, the world's governments must be on the same page. ""We need a response that involves every part of government and society, and every country involved in the widest possible international coalition,"" Cameron said. The fact countries like Britain and France are backing the United States is hardly surprising. But, as Obama said, what made Wednesday's vote notable is that ""it is very rare where the United Nations achieves the kind of consensus that we see represented in this resolution."" In fact, officials from China and Russia -- two (of the five) Security Council permanent members who often stymy U.S. efforts at the United Nations, including those related to the Middle East -- assertively staked out anti-terrorist positions on Wednesday. In their words, though, there were hints of possible diplomatic obstacles down the road. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, for instance, warned ""against any attempt to narrow down the problem"" to select groups, urging the world not to have ""double standards in dividing terrorists into good terrorist and bad terrorists.""  He also said any efforts must ""address longstanding conflicts"" like those between Palestinians and Israel. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned about ""terrorist organizations and extremist ideologies ... competing with us for future generations,"" calling this ""a battle bearing on the future of the world."" The world must act, he agreed, but only with the United Nations' stamp of approval. Wang didn't give examples, though the United States and several Arab allies recently launched military strikes against ISIS targets in Syria -- without the U.N.'s or Syria's explicit approval. ""The United Nations and the Security Council have to play the leading role in the global war on terrorism,"" the Chinese minister said. ""This is the only way to maintain unity, achieve effective coordination and take assertive action."" Obama: U.S. leading, but can't do it alone . Before leading the Security Council meeting, Obama made a more far-reaching appeal earlier Wednesday for world cooperation against terror, climate change, Ebola and a host of other issues, saying the world stands at a crossroads ""between war and peace; between disorder and integration; between fear and hope."" Many of the world's problems, the President said, stem from ""the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world."" The United States is taking a leading role in addressing many of these issues. ""I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done,"" he said. ""We are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom, and we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come."" But, Obama said, America cannot do it alone. The leaders of the nations gathered Wednesday must decide whether they ""will be able to renew the purpose of the U.N.'s founding, and whether we will come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism."" Obama outlined the U.S. government's plan for tackling ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, including airstrikes, training and equipping forces battling the group, and working to cut off its financing and flow of recruits. But, as he's said many times before, American ground troops won't be part of the fight. ""Already, over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition. Today, I ask the world to join in this effort,"" the President said. Those who have joined ISIS ""should leave the battlefield while they can."" How Obama came to launch strikes in Syria . Touches on Ebola, Ukraine, other topics . While terrorism dominated Wednesday's conversation, it wasn't the only topic that Obama addressed in his General Assembly speech. Among them: . Ukraine: Russia's involvement in Ukraine represents ""a vision of the world in which might makes right -- a world in which one nation's borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed,"" Obama said, referring to efforts to recover the remains of victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, shot down over Ukraine in July. If Russia rolls back its involvement, the United States ""will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia's role in addressing common challenges,"" Obama said. Ebola: While the United States is sending medical workers and the military to build treatment centers in Africa, the President called for a ""broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, destabilize economies, and move rapidly across borders."" Iran's nuclear program: Obama urged Iranian leaders to work with the United States and others to resolve Western concerns over the country's nuclear program. ""We can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful,"" he said. Global poverty: ""We will do our part -- to help people feed themselves; power their economies; and care for their sick,""  he said. ""If the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children can enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity."" Climate change:  The United States will work on the issue within its own borders, but ""we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every major power,"" Obama said. ""That's how we can protect this planet for our children and grandchildren."" Syria: Even as it provides even more support -- including militarily -- to moderate opposition forces battling President Bashar al-Assad's government, Obama said that ""the only lasting solution to Syria's civil war is political: an inclusive political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity or creed.""

"Rep. Don Young has never been known for mincing words, but his comments Tuesday regarding suicide to an Alaska High School took the ""breath away"" from his audience. School officials told local news that the Republican congressman was disrespectful and offensive in responding to sensitive questions from students and faculty at Wasilla High School on Tuesday -- even when one question turned the conversation to suicide. Young told the audience that a lack of support from friends and family can lead to suicides, Wasilla High School principal Amy Spargo told CNN affiliate KTUU. Those comments came just days after a Wasilla student committed suicide. ""All of us first hand have been sitting with crying kids and we've been talking to these families and we know how much these students are loved and supported and it just felt cruel to imply that there's more the people who are left could have done,"" Spargo said. ""The comments certainly took our breath away."" Young is the only member of the House of Representatives from Alaska, which has the highest suicide rate in the country. And Spargo told the Alaska Dispatch News that a friend of the recent suicide victim shouted at Young that the victim had both friends and support and that ""it's depression -- you know, a mental illness."" The congressman's answer according to Young: ""'Well, what, do you just go to the doctor and get diagnosed with suicide?'"" And Young also reportedly told the school principal he thought the student who interjected was disrespectful. Rep. Young's spokesman Matt Shuckerow told Alaska Dispatch News in an email that the congressman did not ""mean to upset anyone with his well-intentioned message."" ""In light of the tragic events affecting the Wasilla High School community, he should have taken a much more sensitive approach,"" Shuckerow said in the email. But Young didn't just offend students and families mourning the death of one of their classmates. Young also fielded a question on same-sex marriage. According to Spargo, Young said ""You can't have marriage with two men. What do you get with two bulls?"" Young's appearance at the high school was also reportedly peppered with profanity. It's not the first time Young has sparked controversy by opening his mouth, referring to immigrants who worked on his famiily ranch as a kid as ""wetbacks."" ""We used to hire 50 or 60 wetbacks to pick tomatoes,"" Young said last year.","Rep. Don Young reportedly told students suicide is due to a lack of support .

"Dismayed, angry but saying they'll fight in a new struggle for civil rights, protesters marched peacefully Tuesday in Houston, Atlanta and Florida while thousands of Americans found other ways to demonstrate their feelings. Pro boxer Terrell Gausha told the entertainment news site TMZ that he would no longer wear the American flag. News filtered out that entertainer Stevie Wonder said he will no longer perform in Florida so long as the state's controversial Stand Your Ground self-defense law remains in effect. A mocked-up image of Martin Luther King Jr. wearing a hoodie went viral on the Internet. And a page on the popular blogging service Tumblr drew hundreds of often poignant essays from people -- many of them white, middle-class and far removed from the civil rights struggle -- who said the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, and Zimmerman's acquittal, had moved them profoundly. ""I think if I looked like Trayvon I could've been shot or arrested or antagonized and hated. I could've been dead at 17,"" wrote one poster who identified himself as a 31-year-old white man. ""I think if Trayvon looked like me he could've grown up to be someone that did something wonderful for the world."" A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman Saturday following a nearly four-week trial. The Hispanic former neighborhood watch volunteer acknowledged shooting and killing Martin last year, but said he did so in self-defense after the teenager attacked him. Juror: 'No doubt' that Zimmerman feared for his life . Critics of the verdict, however, say they believe the jury got it wrong -- that Zimmerman was an overzealous wannabe police officer who racially profiled Martin and hatefully shot him down. They want federal civil rights charges and changes to laws like Florida's Stand Your Ground, fearing a spate of similar incidents. ""Anyone walking or committing no crime can be followed or approached by another civilian and they can use deadly force and say it was self-defense,"" the  Rev. Al Sharpton said Tuesday in Washington. ""That is something that is frightening and cannot be allowed to sustain itself in our society."" Although Zimmerman's attorneys did not seek a Stand Your Ground hearing before trial, the judge's instructions to the jury did allude to provisions of the law, and a juror interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday said it came into play during deliberations. Jeantel 'upset, angry' by verdict . Call for change . Sharpton's National Action Network is planning 100 protests across the country Saturday calling for civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Similar calls echoed across the Internet. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 490,000 people had signed a MoveOn.org petition started by the NAACP asking for the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Two petitions to the White House seeking such charges had more than 30,000 signatures between them Tuesday morning. Petitions in support of Zimmerman had a few thousand signatures. Despite outrage, federal charges uncertain in Zimmerman case . Protests nationwide . Since the Saturday verdict, protests have occurred across the country, including New York, Washington, Boston, Atlanta, Houston, Las Vegas and Kansas City. ""I was devastated, a little bit heartbroken. But this is as much as we can do,"" protester Kennan Blair told CNN affiliate WSB during Monday night's protest there. In Cleveland, protesters gathered on the steps of the Cuyahoga County Justice Center carrying bags of Skittles -- the candy Martin had just bought before he was killed, CNN affiliate WEWS reported. ""I could have been Trayvon Martin,"" one African-American teen wearing a hoodie -- the same garment Martin was wearing -- told the station. ""But this case isn't about racial issues. This case is about violence. This case is about the judicial system."" Why this verdict? On Tuesday: . -- Protesters in Florida staged a sit-in Tuesday at the governor's office, demanding a special legislative session to consider changes to the Stand Your Ground law, a spokeswoman told CNN. -- In Houston, police on horseback and bicycles shepherded protesters staging a protest outside the Harris County Courthouse. -- In Atlanta, civil rights leaders gathered to denounce the verdict and announce their participation in Sharpton's planned rallies Saturday. ""Our message to the public is clear,"" the Rev. Markel Hutchins said. ""This is not over, all is not lost. There is still hope and we must continue to fight."" Some protests have turned violent. In Los Angeles, police went on emergency footing for the third night in a row Monday after violent demonstrations wracked part of the city, CNN affiliate KCAL reported.They warned over stricter enforcement beginning Tuesady. In Oakland,  demonstrators threw rocks, bottles and firecrackers at police, Officer Johnna Watson said early Tuesday. Authorities arrested nine people there, she said. Race perhaps simplest disagreement in post-trial interviews . Appeals for calm . Civil rights leaders appealed for calm out of respect for Martin and his family. ""His name and memory should not be smeared by reckless violence,"" Sharpton said. Civil rights leader, John Mack, now a member of the Los Angeles police commission, said those behind the violence ""have their own agendas that have nothing to do with justice, and very little to do with Trayvon Martin."" Taking Zimmerman's side . Of course, not everyone disagreed with the jury's verdict. On a Facebook page dedicated to discussion of the trial, Facebook user Lorraine Keeley said the jury got it right. ""The jurors have spoken. ... kudo's to this great defense team,"" Keeley wrote. More controversially, conservative rock singer Ted Nugent called Martin a ""dope smoking, racist gangsta wannabe"" in defending the verdict in a column for the website Rare. ""Here's the lesson from all this, America,"" Nugent wrote. ""Teach your children to not attack people for no good reason whatsoever. Conduct yourself in a responsible, civil manner, and everything will be just fine. Try to kill someone and that someone just may be exercising his or her Second Amendment rights and you could get shot. It's called self-defense, and it is the oldest, strongest and most righteous instinct and God-given right known to man."" Meanwhile, Zimmerman's parents, Robert and Gladys Zimmerman, offered more conciliatory words in an ABC interview. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragedy,"" Gladys Zimmerman said. Now that he's free, can Zimmerman make a living?","Protesters demanding changes to Florida law stage sit-in at governor's office .

"(CNN)What would happen if the legend of the Lost City of Atlantis was crossed with the screenplay of Kevin Costner's 1995 hit movie ""Waterworld""? Maybe something like The Ocean Spiral -- an underwater metropolis that generates energy from the seabed and is capable of providing homes and accommodation for 5,000 people. Sure, such blue-sky thinking may only seem plausible in the world of Hollywood CGI, but this is the futuristic concept proposed by Japanese construction firm Shimizu Corp. According to literature released by the company, expertise is being sought from Tokyo University, Japanese government ministries as well as energy firms to bring the project to life. Shimizu also say projects like the Ocean Spiral may be necessary in the future to confront increasing global problems such as rising sea levels and the need to create new, clean energy sources. Under the sea . Divided into three distinctive zones, the structure will stretch all the way to the crushing black depths 2.8 miles under the sea off the coast of Japan. A giant sphere with a diameter 500 meters (1,640 feet) situated just below the surface will form the first section and house residential zones, businesses and hotels. This inhabited area will be connected to a nine-mile spiral (section 2) that that descends to the seabed where a deep-sea submarine port and factory (section 3) will create the energy required to power the sphere by using micro-organisms that turn carbon dioxide into methane. If that's not high-tech enough, power generators situated along the spiral will then use differences in seawater temperature to create additional energy by applying thermal conversion technologies. Technology wait . Shimizu has a history of imaginative, high-concept projects including a space hotel and floating botanical cities. The company says the Ocean Spiral would take five years to build and the technology required will be ready in 15 years. Funding for what is likely to be a cash intensive exercise will also have to be secured. Until such times arrive, all we're left with is a series of cool artist renderings to whet (or should that be wet?) our appetites.","Ocean Spiral is a proposed underwater city from Japanese construction firm Shimizu Corp.

"In the final, chaotic moments before the South Korean ferry Sewol rolled over and sank into the chilly waters of the Yellow Sea, 48 girls obeyed the orders of crew members and put on their life vests. Perhaps afraid, they all crammed into a single room meant for 30. None of them survived. The account of the recovery of the girls' bodies, offered Friday by rescue officials, offers a glimpse of the final moments aboard the sinking ferry, which went down on April 16 with 476 people aboard. It also illuminates the daunting task facing divers trying to retrieve bodies while maintaining a fading glimmer of hope that perhaps, somewhere aboard the ferry, someone remains alive. Rescue officials spoke of a forest of floating objects, doors forced shut by enormous water pressure, and of currents that tug at the breathing tubes that keep them alive as they look for the dead. Civilian diver Chun Kwan-geung, one of the many rescuers working in the murky waters, spoke of having to break out windows to get to the lower decks of the ship, which now lies on its right side on the seafloor some 73 meters (240 feet) below the surface. ""The rescue effort is getting slower,"" said South Korean navy Capt. Kim Jin-hwang, commander of the rescue operation. ""The divers already searched all the places easily accessible. They are expecting the search to become harder because of increasing currents and harsher weather. But the navy will not stop until the last body is found."" As if highlighting the point, Kim's divers are trying to find their way into another dormitory-style room where 50 girls were believed to be as the ship began to sink. So far, rescuers have retrieved 187 bodies. Another 115 people remain missing, although no one has been rescued since 174 were plucked from ship and sea the day the ferry sank. As the effort inside the ship continues, South Korean authorities are pressing a criminal investigation into the sinking. It's resulted in the arrests of the ship's captain and 14 other members, searches of the company that owned the ferry and the home of the man whose family controls it, and a wide-ranging probe into the country's marine industry. Safety concerns about sister ship . Prosecutors in Mopko, South Korea, who are leading the ferry investigation told CNN's Nic Robertson on Friday that authorities have yet to determine what caused the sinking. Leading theories include changes made to increase the ferry's passenger capacity and shifting cargo. On Friday, investigators checked out the Sewol's sister ship, the Ohamana, and said they found 40 of its life rafts weren't working, emergency slides to help evacuate passengers were inoperable, and equipment to tie down cars and cargo either was nonexistent or didn't work very well. Like the Sewol, the Ohamana had been modified to add more passengers, the prosecutor's office said. The ship arrived in Incheon on April 16, the same day the Sewol sank, and has not left yet, officials said. Investigators are looking into whether those modifications could have contributed to the Sewol's fate. Kim Yong-rok, an opposition lawmaker who represents Jindo, an island near where the ship sank, told CNN that modifications to add 117 more passenger cabins to the ship raised the ferry's center of gravity. On Friday, the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced it would ask lawmakers to consider legislation prohibiting modifications to ships to increase passenger capacity. Government investigators are also probing the private organization that conducts ship safety inspections on behalf of the government to determine if any wrongdoing was involved in the certification of the Sewol after its 2013 modifications. Families confront officials . The revelations about the sister ship came the day after angry relatives of missing ferry passengers cursed government and police officials for failing to do enough to save the lives of their loved ones as hopes of finding survivors dimmed. The relatives berated Fisheries Minister Lee Ju-young and two coast guard officials, accusing them of misleading the public about the operation and of wasting time. ""How can you fool us into believing you were out there trying to save our children?"" one mother yelled at the officials. Also, officials at the South Korean headquarters for the task force coordinating the search told CNN that they believe the body of a boy who reportedly made the first emergency call from the ship after it began to list sharply has been recovered. DNA tests will help officially identify the remains, officials said early Friday. Also on Friday, an official involved in the investigation in Mokpo asked for patience. ""I know a lot of people are curious as to the cause of the accident, but we don't have the information yet,"" said Heo Yong-beom, a maritime safety judge. ""We will try our best to satisfy and answer questions."" 'We join you in mourning' Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama, in South Korea for a previously scheduled trip, presented South Korean President Park Geun-hye with an American flag that flew over the White House the day the ferry sank. ""I'm very mindful that my visit comes at a time of mourning for the people of this nation,"" he told the U.S. and the South Korean delegations. ""As allies but also friends, we join you in mourning the missing, and especially the young people."" The delegations held a moment of silence, then Park thanked Obama for the gesture. ""The Korean people draw great strength from your kindness,"" she said. Young crew member hailed as heroine . In recent disasters, captains didn't hang around .

"Yemen's human rights minister wants child marriage outlawed after an 8-year-old girl reportedly died of internal injuries that she suffered on her wedding night. When reports emerged last week that a girl named Rawan, from the northern Yemeni town of Haradh, died a few days after being married off to a 40-year-old man, Yemenis were horrified. International outrage quickly grew, as the alleged incident highlighted once again the extremely controversial issue of child marriage in Yemen -- a country where the practice is still legal. Residents of Haradh told local media outlets that Rawan's cause of death was internal bleeding, believed to be the result of sexual intercourse that tore her uterus and other organs. Local officials, however, have denied the story is true. Amidst the numerous claims and counterclaims, Hooria Mashhour, Yemen's human rights minister, has declared enough is enough — telling CNN that the growing anger over Rawan's case has presented Yemen with an opportunity to finally do the right thing. Yemeni girl from YouTube wants education, not marriage . ""This isn't the first time a child marriage has happened in Yemen, so we should not focus only on this case,"" Mashhour said. ""Many child marriages take place every year in Yemen. It's time to end this practice."" ""I personally have (talked to) the human rights coordinator for the ministry on the ground in Haradh,"" said Mashhour, ""and he informed me that nearly everyone he spoke to is denying the story, but he feels strongly suspicious. We feel people may be hiding information due to fear."" CNN spoke with several locals who requested anonymity, as they feared possible reprisals. Many said they'd been ordered to stop discussing the case with the media, insisting officials there were actively downplaying what had happened. ""No one is talking about this story because its an embarrassment,"" said one resident, ""but this is what poverty can do to people."" Photos: Trading childhood for marriage . Many Yemenis say they are forced to sell off their girls to older, wealthier men. Mohammed Ahmed, head of Haradh's police department, called the reports ""baseless."" ""Residents heard this story from one another and it spread very quickly, like a rumor,"" Ahmed said -- adding that Rawan's father had been called into the town's police station for questioning and had denied the incident. ""When he came to us he brought a little girl with him who he said was Rawan to prove his case, and they were both photographed together by the police,"" Ahmed said. Yemeni child rights advocate Ahmed Al-Qureshi told CNN he's been investigating the case for more than a week and  there's still a lot of confusion surrounding what exactly happened. He's demanding more transparency from officials. Married at 13 to a man in his 70s . ""The government is informing us that the Rawan is in their custody and still alive, while other local sources are saying that she was secretly buried,"" said Al-Qureshi, who heads up Seyaj, one of Yemen's leading children's rights groups. ""The government is refusing to allow us to visit the girl in their custody,"" he said. ""The evidence we have now cannot prove that Rawan was killed, and that is why we need the government's cooperation."" In Yemen, deeply tribal and conservative, the issue of child marriage is an extremely complicated one. According to rights group Human Rights Watch , more than half of all young girls there are married before age 18. About 14% of girls in Yemen are married before age 15. In the wake of Rawan's case, the group issued a statement urging Yemen to ""protect its girls from the devastating effects of early marriage by setting 18 as the minimum age for marriage by law."" HRW added that ""the current political transition and drafting process for a new constitution offer a unique opportunity for the Yemeni government to enact laws protecting the rights of girls."" ""Thousands of Yemeni girls have their childhood stolen and their futures destroyed because they are forced to marry too young,"" said Liesl Gerntholtz, HRW's women's rights director. ""The Yemeni government should end this abusive practice."" In 2009, Yemen's parliament passed legislation raising the minimum age of marriage to 17. But conservative parliamentarians argued the bill violated Islamic law, which does not stipulate a minimum age of marriage, and the bill was never signed. Activist groups and politicians are still trying change the law, but more than 100 leading religious clerics have said restricting the age of marriage is ""un-Islamic."" Over the last few years, several Yemeni child bride cases have emerged that have shocked the world. In 2008, 10-year-old Nujood Ali became a heroine to Yemeni girls and an international sensation when she went to a court in Sanaa and asked a judge for a divorce. After a highly publicized trial, she was granted one. In 2010, a 12-year-old Yemeni bride died of internal bleeding following intercourse three days after she was married off to an older man, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. Over the summer, an 11-year-old Yemeni girl named Nada Al-Ahdal became an internet sensation when a video of her accusing her parents of trying to marry her off in exchange for money was uploaded to YouTube and quickly went viral. While her parents denied Nada's story, and child rights activists questioned the veracity of her claims, the video was still viewed by millions of people.

"(CNN)To any parents who are anti-vaccine -- or perhaps better described as vaccine-hesitant -- let me say first that I can relate. When I had my first daughter nearly nine years ago, like probably a good number of new moms, I was irrationally worried about my child's safety (yes, I checked to make sure she was breathing every night!). I closely followed online discussions about most parenting decisions, so I was well aware of that now infamous report, which claimed to find a link between autism and what we call the MMR vaccine (it stands for measles, mumps and rubella). Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Vaccines are a matter of fact . Eight years ago, when it was time for my daughter to get her first MMR shot, I kind of freaked. I expressed my fears to my pediatrician, who is a big believer in homeopathic remedies, to give you a sense of how liberal she can be when it comes to modern medicine. What is your message to those who don't vaccinate? ""It is totally safe. The science is sound,"" she assured me. I remember her saying words to that effect, but my mom gut wasn't totally convinced. To placate me, she said we could do the shots separately. Instead of one vaccine, my daughter braved three different shots for measles, mumps and rubella. (She will have my head when she reads this!) A few years later, that report was officially discredited, debunked, you name it. When my younger daughter was scheduled for her first MMR shot, my worries were dramatically reduced -- so much so that I didn't insist that we separate the vaccine into three different shots. I had the doctor give her the whole shebang. While I struggled years earlier with the decision, I never truly considered not vaccinating my daughter. With a measles outbreak that is now getting national attention, I am convinced I made the right call. The unvaccinated, by the numbers . But I'm not an expert, just another parent looking to do what's best for my child. So I reached out to a number of infectious disease experts, people who have no financial or political stake in the debate other than to ensure the safety of our children, to ask them one simple question: Why should parents vaccinate their kids? The diseases are still around . Tara Smith, associate professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, points out how the diseases we vaccinate against such as measles, while rare, still exist in the United States. ""The diseases are much worse than any potential side effect from the vaccines, so for me it's a risk-benefit,"" said Smith, who has vaccinated her three children, ages 15 years old, 12 years old and 13 months. Vaccines work, but some parents choose not to use them . ""I would much rather have my children get the vaccine than the disease itself."" People might not realize that measles is not just fever and rash, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases and public health specialist. ""Measles is also pneumonia, brain infection, it's the leading cause of childhood blindness in the world,"" said Gounder, who added that some parents who don't want to vaccinate want to avoid anything that's not natural for their kids. ""If you want to do something natural, vaccination is far more natural than if your child ends up on a ventilator or needing antibiotics or if they end up with a brain infection so if you are trying to balance what's the most natural way to take care of your child, I would say measles vaccine is pretty high up there."" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told the story of a boy whose parents claimed their religion prohibited them from getting vaccines. At age 1, the boy developed pneumonia and meningitis caused by a type of streptococcal bacteria that the vaccine protects against, so had he been vaccinated, he would not likely have gotten ill, according to Offit. Measles outbreak: Different states, different rules on vaccinations . The boy is currently alive but will never see, speak, walk or hear again, he said. ""He will live in a vegetative state probably for five years until he dies from something else. Basically, we snuffed out potentially a 75-year-old perfectly normal life because of a false concern that vaccines would do harm, or in their misguided notion that somehow religion teaches us anything other than we should care for our children,"" said Offit, author of ""Bad Medicine: When Religious Beliefs Undermine Modern Medicine,"" set to be released next month. Other children are at risk . A mother who is vaccine-anxious, though still vaccinating her children -- albeit on a very spread out time line -- told me she should have the right to do what she wants regarding her children. Theoretically, if my children are vaccinated, then what she does or does not do with her kids should have no impact whatsoever on my child. But that's totally incorrect, the experts say. When people don't vaccinate their children, they increase the risk for people in the population who can't be vaccinated, such as infants under age 1, children and adults with weak immune systems and people with cancer. ""Right now, what we're seeing a resurgence of, besides measles, is whooping cough, which is especially deadly in infants who are too young to be vaccinated. So, you are not only putting your own children at risk but potentially putting others in the community at risk from that,"" said Smith, who also leads an emerging infections laboratory at Kent State. Smith also says people who have been vaccinated are slightly at risk. ""Like anything in the world, there's no 100% guarantee,"" said Smith. For example, she said the measles vaccine is 99% effective, which means one in 100 who receives two doses of the vaccine could still get the disease. Measles puts Congress on the spot . Offit, who is also professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, says while we haven't had a case of polio in the United States since the 1970s, it still exists around the world. ""So is it possible that people who are asymptomatically shedding polio virus walk into this country? I think it happens all the time,"" he said. ""And if enough people choose not to vaccinate, then these diseases come back and that's what we're seeing."" Gounder also cites the financial costs to the community if diseases like measles continue to spread. ""We're also all taxpayers and the amount of resources that are now being used in California per se as a result of the Disneyland outbreak, there's a tremendous amount of resources to track down everybody who's been in contact with those cases,"" she said. ""If you end up on a ventilator in intensive care because you have measles, if you have a brain infection that causes lifelong brain damage, that's a burden on all of us."" Saying 'you should vaccinate' doesn't work . But the message that parents should vaccinate their children, a message that has been growing louder and louder in recent weeks, doesn't necessarily seem to be working, all of the experts I spoke with said. Telling parents what they should do may just have them dig their heels in deeper in their anti-vaccine approach to their children. What's needed, said Offit, is more conversation parent to parent. It's not doctors versus parents, he said, Doctors are parents too. Paul, Christie show support for voluntary vaccines . ""What I do is basically say, 'When you love your child, you bring your child to us to care for your child. By saying you don't want to get vaccines, you are asking me to practice substandard care,'"" said Offit. '""'You are asking me to send your child out into a world that is becoming progressively more dangerous. It's an unloving thing to do. It's a dangerous thing to do. Please don't put me in that position.'"" Smith says she tries to tell her story as a scientist and as a parent. ""I have three children, and they are all fully vaccinated, including a 13-month-old at home (who) just recently got his MMR and his chicken pox vaccine,"" she said. ""I acknowledge as parents we all just want to do what's best for our kids, there's no doubting that, but what I feel is best is to follow the science. And I feel very secure in that science as a scientist."" More disease = more vaccinations . Sadly, what may get more people to get on board and start vaccinating their children is more disease itself. Offit recalled how his parents didn't need to be convinced to be vaccinated because when they were young, teens died of diptheria, whooping cough killed 8,000 people a year and people got paralysis from polio. ""But for my children, who are 22 and 20, they not only don't see these (diseases), they didn't grow up with these diseases,"" said Offit. ""For all the talking we do, nothing talks louder than the virus itself or the disease."" ""And that's what you are seeing now,"" said Offit. People who have been on the fence about getting the measles vaccine themselves or getting the vaccine for their children are starting to get vaccinated because now they fear the disease, he said. ""It's too bad it has to come to that because it's always the children who suffer our ignorance and that's certainly the truth here."" Do you think children should be vaccinated?

"Australia ordered federal police to take over security at the house of parliament Friday, a day after police conducted  one of the nation's largest counter-terrorism operations in the port city of Sydney. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said an urgent review of parliamentary security was ordered amid intelligence reports of ""chatter"" of potential threats by ""terrorist support networks."" Meanwhile, several Islamic organizations in Australia sounded the alarm, warning about a surge of Islamophobia after Thursday's predawn counter-terrorism raids resulted in the detention of at least 15 suspects. ""Fair-minded Australians should not allow bigots and media shock jocks to undermine the cohesion within society,""  the Grand Mufti of Australia said, according to a statement released by a group of Islamic organizations. Several hundred demonstrators peacefully protested against the police raids, some of them holding signs that said ""terror raids cannot break the spirit of Muslims."" Among the suspects detained this week was Australian Omarjan Azari, who was later formally charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. Azari was denied bail and is expected to reappear in court on November 13, authorities said. Police told CNN another 24-year old man was released on bail after being charged with possession of ammunition without license and a prohibited weapon. All other detainees have now been released, with two women issued future court attendance notices, police said. In an interview with Australia's Seven Network on Friday, Abbott said a senior Australian member of the ISIS militant group in Syria had been overheard instructing sympathizers in Australia to carry out acts of violence. ""Because we believed that a demonstration execution was likely quickly, we acted as we did to disrupt this particular network,"" Abbott said. Australian authorities estimate 60 citizens are fighting alongside ISIS and other militant groups in the Middle East. This month, Australia was quick to accept U.S. President Barack Obama's call for an international coalition to battle ISIS. Canberra announced plans to dispatch military advisers to assist the Iraqi military.  Australia is also sending fighter jets and combat support aircraft to the United Arab Emirates  to assist in the campaign against ISIS.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott: Urgent review of parliamentary security ordered .

"An investigative report prepared by the House Intelligence Committee finds little to support questions raised about CIA actions on the ground in Benghazi, Libya, the night of a deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound. Read the full report . The final report, from Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, and ranking member Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, concludes there was no intelligence failure prior to the attack, no stand-down order to CIA operatives trying to go assist at the besieged consular building and found conflicting intelligence in the wake of the attack about the motive and cause, which were reflected in early public comments by the administration. But the investigation also found the security at the diplomatic outpost was weak and it described a ""flawed"" process used to create talking points for House Intelligence Committee members and then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, whose public statements after the attack incensed critics who said the administration was avoiding calling the attack terrorism. Fast Facts: Benghazi attack . The declassified version of the report attempts to knock down other accusations about the Benghazi incident and aftermath, finding no evidence of CIA employees being intimidated from testifying and also no indication the CIA presence in Benghazi was partially to secretly ship arms from Libya to Syria. The September 11, 2012, attack left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods dead, and immediately sparked controversy, with Republicans accusing the Obama administration of mishandling the attack and manipulating the talking points used to discuss it for political reasons. The intelligence panel, along with several other House committees, spent the past two years interviewing witnesses and examining evidence about the Obama administration's response to the attacks and the related controversy that has been a flashpoint between Republicans and President Barack Obama over his conduct of foreign policy. Another House committee, the Select Committee on Benghazi, is conducting its own investigation. ""The Select Committee on Benghazi received the Intelligence committee's report on the Benghazi terrorist attack (in August), and has reviewed it along with other committee reports and materials as the investigation proceeds,"" spokesman Jamal D. Ware said in a statement.

"In a church in Irbil, 40-day-old Yeshua lies asleep in a crib, his sister playfully rocking him. It's a peaceful scene. Their mother watches over them, but her face shows the fear and despair many Iraqi minorities have felt over the past few days. The Sunni militant group ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, has steamrolled into Iraq's north, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities from their homes. The militants have beheaded some who won't bend to their will and are ""putting people's heads on spikes"" to terrorize others, a senior U.S. administration official said. Nearly 40,000 Yazidis are trapped on the top of Mount Sinjar with few resources; many with just the clothes on their back, U.S. President Barack Obama said in an address late Thursday evening. ""These innocent families are faced with a horrible choice,"" Obama said. ""Descend the mountain and be slaughtered, or stay and slowly die of thirst and hunger."" So who are these people being threatened by the Islamic State? And why do the militant Islamists have them in their cross hairs? The Yazidis . The Yazidis are one of the world's smallest and oldest monotheistic religious minorities. Their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and the ancient monotheistic religion of Zoroastrianism. Yazidis worship one God and honor seven angels. Unlike Muslims and Christians, they reject the idea of sin, the devil and hell itself. Many Muslims regard them as devil-worshippers because the Yazidis revere an angel who, their tradition holds, refused to obey God. Their religious differences have made them a target for persecution throughout history, most recently during the U.S. war in Iraq -- in 2007, more than 700 people were killed when suicide bombers attacked a Yazidi village. Before that, they were targeted for centuries under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Iraq's Yazidis trapped, hiding from ISIS in the mountains . President Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry have said that if the Yazidis are not protected, their slaughter could quickly escalate to a genocide. To help the trapped people, the U.S. has sent them humanitarian airdrops. Obama has authorized airstrikes against the Islamic State fighters who are threatening the Yazidis there. Opinion: What chance to Yazidis have against group too brutal for al Qaeda? The U.S. State Department's 2013 International Religious Freedom Report estimates that approximately 500,000 Yazidis live in the northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. Another 200,000 live in other parts of the world, according to the website YezidiTruth.org. Like the Kurds, they mostly reside in Iraq's north, many in the town of Sinjar in northwestern Nineveh province, bordering Iraq's Kurdish region. The province is home to mostly Arabs and Kurds, who have jostled for control over it for centuries. Iraqi Yazidi lawmaker: 'Hundreds of my people are being slaughtered' But Yazidis also reside in Turkey, Syria, Armenia, Iran and parts of the Caucasus region. The people speak Kurdish and are of Kurdish descent, but most see themselves as ethnically distinctive. Iraqi Christians . Before being targeted by ISIS, an enormous portion -- some say as many as half -- of Iraq's Christians fled the country at the start of the U.S. war in 2003. Al Qaeda in Iraq, which preceded ISIS, brutally targeted the country's Christian minority. According to the State Department, Christian leaders and nongovernmental organizations estimate that there are approximately 500,000 Christians in Iraq -- a that figure has declined by nearly 300,000 in the last five years. At one point there were over a million Christians living in Iraq. 7 terrible countries for Christians . Most Iraqi Christians are Chaldeans, who are communicants with the Roman Catholic church. They predominantly reside in northern Iraq. The al Qaeda splinter group has taken control of the country's largest Christian city, Qaraqosh. And last month, Christians in the country's second largest city, Mosul, were told they must convert to Islam, pay a fine or face ""death by the sword."" ""Christian communities are particularly affected: a people fleeing from their villages because of the violence that rages in these days, wreaking havoc on the entire region,"" said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for Pope Francis. The Pope said on Twitter: ""I ask all men and women of goodwill to join me in praying for Iraqi Christians and all vulnerable populations."" ISIS overtakes Iraq's largest Christian city . Turkmen . The majority of the world's Turkmen, a Turkic-speaking, traditionally nomadic people, live in Turkmenistan and elsewhere in Central Asia. But a small minority of them can be found in the Middle East, primarily in northern Iraq, Iran and Turkey. The city of Tal Afar, whose population is mostly made up of Turkmen, was caught in the crossfire of sectarian violence between Shiites and Sunnis during the recent Iraq war -- a suicide attack killed 150 people in 2007. The city's  population dwindled from about 200,000 to 80,000 in just a few years. Sunni Turkmen make up 1% to 2% of Iraq's population, according to the State Department. A smaller group of Shia Turkmen live there, as well. Shiites . Despite the risk ISIS poses to Yazidis, Turkmen, Christians and the country's other minorities, the risk to Iraq's majority Shia Muslims is far more widespread. In their quest to create an Islamic caliphate stretching from Syria to Iraq, ISIS has targeted Shiites in both countries. In June, the group claimed on Twitter that it killed at least 1,700 Shiites in June. ISIS is also fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. Assad is a member of the Alawite sect, on offshoot of Shia Islam. Like many of the minorities in in the Nineveh province, Shiites and Alawites have been labeled as infidels by ISIS. Shiites outnumber Sunnis in Iraq on the whole. Most of Baghdad is predominantly Shiite, but large portions of Iraq's western and northern territories contain Sunni majority populations.

"On the southern edge of Turkey, rolling brown pastoral hills slope gently to the Syrian border, with small towns like this one dotting the horizon. The calm on this side of the border, however, belies the scene on the other side. Just across the border in northern Syria, the Islamic extremist group known as ISIS is fighting a full-tilt battle in its effort to capture and control new territory, part of its push to create a sprawling Islamic caliphate, or separate Islamic state, modeled on the first caliphate that spread across the region in the centuries following the death of the Prophet Muhammad around 640 AD. As ISIS fighters expand their control, it is in the border region, in villages like Besaslan, where the Islamic State group can make some of the money it needs to finance its wars. Oil-smuggling operations involving millions of barrels have recently been uncovered. The oil comes from wells and refineries that ISIS has taken over inside northern Iraq and northern Syria, and until very recently it was easy to smuggle it into this quiet part of southern Turkey. One reason is that cheap, smuggled oil is a much-prized commodity in Turkey, where oil is so expensive that it almost doesn't matter who is selling it, even if it's your enemy. In Hatay, Turkey, just a half hour's drive away, gasoline costs roughly $7.50 per gallon. Growing international alarm over ISIS expansion and the group's increasingly visible atrocities -- such as beheadings of Western journalists and aid workers, the videos of which are disseminated online -- have brought renewed pressure on ISIS and its funding methods on the borders. U.S.-led coalition forces just a week ago attacked and destroyed many ISIS oil facilities, precisely to cut off the group's funding. But the border smuggling is only one way that ISIS generates money. The U.S. Treasury Department does not have hard figures that it can make public on the group's wealth but says it believes ISIS takes in millions of dollars a month. Sources familiar with the subject say that ISIS' ""burn' rate"" -- how much the group spends -- is huge, including salaries, weapons and other expenses. For ISIS' oil sales, sources told CNN, the group probably makes between $1 million and $2 million per day, but probably on the lower end. Matthew Levitt, director of the Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington, D.C., calls ISIS ""the best-financed group we've ever seen."" Opinion: Will U.S. strikes hurt ISIS' oil riches? Levitt is a national expert on terrorism and its financing, working previously on intelligence and analysis at the U.S. Treasury and the FBI. ISIS, Levitt says, is funded like no other traditional terrorist group in the past. Besides revenue from oil smuggling, the group receives money through donations from wealthy sympathizers in countries including Qatar and Kuwait. But the group has another method of funding itself: through organized crime within the territories it has vanquished and now controls. The group, says Levitt, was born among crooks and thugs from a broken Iraq, and at its root it is a criminal enterprise. ""We shouldn't be surprised,"" says Levitt. ""Remember, the Islamic State called ISIS is what used to be called the Islamic State of Iraq, and al Qaeda in Iraq, the Tawhid Network, the Zarqawi Network; it's all the same. And they were always primarily financed through domestic criminal activity within the borders of Iraq."" Levitt says ISIS operates as a massive organized crime group with virtually no law enforcement to rein it in -- and its long history has allowed it to set roots and develop over many years. It means ISIS can demand money from people wherever it has established control. Want to do business in ISIS-controlled territory? You pay a tax. Want to move a truck down an ISIS-controlled highway?  You pay a toll. Villagers in ISIS territory reportedly are charged and pay for just about everything. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? ""There are reports that people in Mosul (Iraq) who want to take money out of their own bank accounts need to make a 'voluntary' -- not so voluntary -- donation to the Islamic State, to ISIS,"" Levitt says. ""So controlling territory has given them opportunities that other groups like al Qaeda, who haven't controlled real territory, haven't had."" It is the centuries-honored tradition of conquest and control: What you take is what you have. In Mosul, ISIS looted the central bank and other smaller provincial banks, resulting in a financial windfall of tens and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. ISIS formed in the void created by the pullout of U.S. troops and the retreating Iraqi army, says Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force in Washington. In the lawlessness that followed, he says, ISIS took over, robbed banks, began taxing and extorting the population, and now funds its war and expansion across Iraq and Syria almost independently. Moustafa lobbies U.S. lawmakers for more support of moderate Syrian rebels who are now fighting both ISIS and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. He recently helped bring together several Congressional delegations to meet with moderate rebel groups on the border as part of that effort. Coalition airstrikes, he says, aren't enough to destroy the kind of self-financing mob that ISIS has become. Instead, you need to take back the territory and restore civil order. ""They're taxing the people; that's a huge revenue,"" he says of ISIS. ""But not only that. They also control sort of the breadbasket of Syria, in terms of Raqqa (their defacto capital). They've got the cotton and the wheat and all these other things. All of these serve as sort of economic and powerhouse or funding for ISIS."" Fighters who are willing to do battle against ISIS are frustrated that the United States has not helped them more, Moustafa says, pointing out that it is largely a decision for the U.S. president. ""It is a White House decision,"" Moustafa said. ""And it always has been.  And I think the White House is slowly moving in the right direction. I can tell you that the policy that the White House has right now -- if it had this policy three years ago, there would have never been an ISIS, and we probably would have gotten rid of the Assad regime."" The Obama administration has heard this criticism before and counters that the President has been calculating in his response to the situation in Syria. ""It's not difficult to contemplate or imagine a scenario where if the United States had put -- dumped a bunch of arms into that country three years ago, that members of ISIL or other extremist groups would be toting American arms as they wage their campaign of violence throughout that region,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said last month, referring to ISIS by another acronym. ""So the President has been very deliberate about this."" U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have recently begun targeting ISIS locations, attacking ISIS-controlled oil facilities and even grain silos. But as long as ISIS controls any ground where civilians can be taxed, extorted and robbed, say experts, ISIS will remain self-financing.

"Indians awoke on Monday to find their 162-year-old telegram service rendered obsolete, superseded by SMS, e-mail and Twitter. Arguably one of the oldest victims of the digital age, telegrams were the fastest communication method from the 19th century. But Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), India's state-run telecommunications company, announced online that ""declining revenues"" motivated their decision to end the service. They added that their employees would be transferred to their landline, mobile and broadband divisions. It comes as no real surprise when even the mail has seen better days. The U.S. postal service lost $16 billion in 2012 and $1.9 billion in the three months ending March 30. It also used up a $15 billion loan from the Treasury. In Britain, telegrams came to an end in 1982 and the queen now sends cards instead of the famous telegram congratulating centenarians and those celebrating diamond wedding anniversaries. The first ever telegram read: ""WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT?"" and was sent from the U.S. Supreme Court in 1844 in Morse Code from Washington to Baltimore. Unlike letters, many telegrams had the unique characteristic of typed capital letters and an abrupt ""STOP"" to mark the end of a sentence. They were usually sent to congratulate, commiserate, or deliver money or urgent news. Possibly one of the most notable tragedies to be conveyed was the sinking of the Titanic ship in 1912. Bruce Ismay, the head of the ship's owners White Star Line, sent this message to the headquarters in New York: ""Deeply regret advise your Titanic sunk this morning fifteenth after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life further particulars later."" The shortest ever message was sent by Oscar Wilde (or, according to other sources, Victor Hugo) to his publisher, enquiring about the sales of his latest novel: ""?"" wrote the author. ""!"" replied his publisher. Many discovered the comical possibilities of such an exchange. American author Mark Twain served a witty one-liner to London in 1897 when his obituary had apparently been published: ""THE REPORTS OF MY DEATH ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED."" And if a message was misunderstood, humor ensured that all was not lost: ""HOW OLD CARY GRANT?"" a reporter questioned the actor. ""OLD CARY GRANT FINE. HOW YOU?"" was his supposed quip. And it's not just email, SMS or social media that make some of us inexcusably lazy to talk to someone in the same room. British actor Peter Sellers' wife Anne answered the door to a couriered message from her husband ordering her to bring him a cup of coffee. He was in the upstairs study. And he didn't even add a ""please"" or a ""thank you."" His explanation could have been that words were of the essence in a telegram, since they were charged. However, 10-15 words sometimes cost the same as a single word. In a handy booklet called: ""How To Write Telegrams Properly"" published in 1929, Nelson E. Ross set out telegram etiquette, including an appeal to preserve politeness, regardless of word count: . ""A man high in American business life has been quoted as remarking that elimination of the word 'please' from all telegrams would save the American public millions of dollars annually,"" wrote Ross. ""'Please' is to the language of social and business intercourse what art and music are to everyday, humdrum existence. ""By all means let us retain the word 'please' in our telegraphic correspondence."" Telegrams marked moments in history or lives and are carefully preserved by individuals, framed in museums, or auctioned to collectors. Many even rushed to telegraph offices on Sunday in India to send a souvenir telegram to their families and friends, or even themselves. But all may not be lost: some global telegram companies are still in operation, even offering iPhone apps to update the service. Also, in Argentina, employees are required to send a telegram when resigning. However, although Twitter may not have the same permanence or command as its predecessor, its success speaks of its convenience: ""Last January [2011], we had 6.86 million followers; today, at the end of December [2012], you are 15.4 million strong,"" boasts Twitter on their blog. Compare this to around 5,000 telegrams sent by BSNL in India a day and it is easy to see how far they lag behind. Commenting on electronic bill paying, United States Postal Service chief financial officer Joseph Corbett sums up the battle: ""It's extremely difficult to compete with free."" What are your memories of the telegram? Share them in the comments section below.","India's 162-year-old telegram service came to an end Monday .

"(CNN) -- Pat Robertson, the evangelical Christian who once suggested God was punishing Americans with Hurricane Katrina, says a ""pact to the devil"" brought on the devastating earthquake in Haiti. Officials fear more than 100,000 people have died as a result of Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti. Robertson, the host of the ""700 Club,"" blamed the tragedy on something that ""happened a long time ago in Haiti, and people might not want to talk about it."" The Haitians ""were under the heel of the French. You know, Napoleon III and whatever,"" Robertson said on his broadcast Wednesday. ""And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said, 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the French.' True story. And so, the devil said, 'OK, it's a deal.' "" Native Haitians defeated French colonists in 1804 and declared independence. ""You know, the Haitians revolted and got themselves free. But ever since, they have been cursed by one thing after the other."" Robertson has previously linked natural disasters and terrorist attacks to legalized abortion in the United States. Soon after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, killing more than 1,800 and wreaking unprecedented devastation on New Orleans, Louisiana, Robertson weighed in with his own theory. ""We have killed over 40 million unborn babies in America,"" Robertson said on his September 12, 2005, broadcast of ""700 Club."" ""I was reading, yesterday, a book that was very interesting about what God has to say in the Old Testament about those who shed innocent blood. And he [the author] used the term that those who do this, 'the land will vomit you out.' ... But have we found we are unable somehow to defend ourselves against some of the attacks that are coming against us, either by terrorists or now by natural disaster? Could they be connected in some way?""","Robertson says native Haitians made deal with the devil for freedom from France .

"(CNN)Someone in the cockpit of a TransAsia Airways flight apparently made a mayday call because of an engine problem shortly before the plane crashed Wednesday into a river in Taiwan, killing at least 32 people. A male voice on a recording of radio conversations between air traffic control and TransAsia Airways Flight GE235 says, ""GE235. Mayday, mayday. Engine flameout."" The recording was verified by LiveATC.net, which records air traffic control feeds around the world. It is unclear whether the man was a pilot. The passenger plane clipped a bridge and plunged into a river in Taipei, according to the island's official news agency, CNA. Rescuers scrambled to pull survivors from the submerged wreck of the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop aircraft, which went down shortly after takeoff from the Taiwanese capital. Fifty-eight people were aboard the flight when it veered out of control as it flew to Kinmen, off the coast of the Chinese province of Fujian. The toll, according to CNA: 32 people confirmed dead and 11 missing. The search and rescue effort continues. Many of the 15 people who survived the crash were injured. Two other people, who were in a car on the bridge that was clipped by the wing of the plane as it went down, also were hurt. The plane's cockpit crew were among those confirmed dead, authorities said. Crews have recovered the aircraft's ""black boxes,"" CNA reported. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder,  which is designed to retain all sounds on a plane's flight deck,  were found in the tail of the plane, Ang Xingzhong, the executive director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, told the news agency. The flight data recorder stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance, including air speed and cabin pressure. A pilot who once flew ATRs for American Airlines said it looked like the plane was gliding when dash-cam video from several angles captured the moments of the crash. Stephen Fredrick pointed to the position of the nose, slightly down, and the wings, level. ""As it gets closer to the highway, there's a change in the pitch attitude (position of the plane) and it appears the aircraft (left) wing stalls, or loses lift. That's what causes the dramatic turn to the left,"" Fredrick told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""It's what causes the aircraft to come down more forcefully and crash."" The plane was 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the airport, Fredrick said, at a point where the pilots should have been able to continue with the flight even if one engine failed. The distance indicated to him that the engine problem occurred well after takeoff. ""It appears that it could have had a single-engine flameout, it could have had a dual-engine flameout,"" he said. ""Those are things we're going to learn."" The left propeller was also set to a position for flight, rather than to a position for an inoperable engine, he said. That could have caused drag and prompted the left wing to stall, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Pilots normally before a flight will turn on a system that automatically adjusts the position of the propellers, the experts said. A dash-cam video captured the moment the plane hurtled out of control above the city's Nanhu Bridge before crashing into the Keelung River, just after 11 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET). CNA reported that the pilot appeared to try to control the plane as it descended, but the aircraft's wing grazed the overpass, clipping a passing taxi. The two people in the taxi were injured but are in stable condition after being taken to a hospital, CNA said. The news agency reported on the efforts of one father who was injured in the crash. The man, who was not identified, was aboard with his wife and 1-year-old baby. The father, upon learning that his wife and child had been sent to separate hospitals, rode a bike to find his wife and baby, CNA said. The wife and baby are injured but did not suffer life-threatening wounds, doctors said, according to the news agency. The father was barely injured. Rescuers in lifeboats pulled survivors from the water and the wreckage. Some passengers appeared to be wearing life jackets as they waited their turn to board  rescue boats. The military said it had 165 personnel and numerous vehicles nearby to assist rescue efforts if required. Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration said it had ordered local airlines to carry out inspections on all their ATR 72s before they can fly again. The special checks will look at various aspects of the engine system, including fuel and propeller control. TransAsia has to inspect 10 planes, while another carrier, Uni Air, has to examine 12 aircraft, according to the agency. Hours after the crash, TransAsia Airways CEO Chen Xinde extended a ""deep apology to the victims and our crew."" He said 31 of the passengers aboard the flight were Chinese tourists, including three children. Twenty-two were from Taiwan, including one child. The airline had sent the passenger manifest to authorities, and families were confirming the identities of the deceased, he said. TransAsia said Thursday that it has started to give families emergency condolence money of 200,000 Taiwanese dollars ($6,360) per victim. It said it would also give extra funds for funeral arrangements of 1.2 million Taiwanese dollars ($38,160) to families identifying bodies. The 31 Chinese tourists were traveling in two tour groups: the Xiamen Airlines International Travel Service Co. and the Xiamen Tourism Group International Travel Service Co. Chou Jih-shine, the vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation -- a quasi-governmental agency that covers cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations -- said the agency had informed its Beijing counterpart. Chou added that the agency had sent personnel to the crash site. Officials from China will participate in the investigation into the crash, Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council said Thursday, according to CNA. Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration said the plane was less than a year old and had last completed a safety check on January 26. The agency did not offer any information on what may have caused the crash. The TransAsia crash is the latest in a number of plane disasters involving Asian carriers. AirAsia Flight QZ8501 crashed on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore. There were 162 people on board. In July, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard. TransAsia was involved in another deadly disaster in July of last year. Forty-eight people died on TransAsia Airways Flight 222, another ATR 72 aircraft, as it was attempting to land in the Taiwanese Penghu Islands during bad weather. TransAsia had lost two other ATR 72s previously -- one that crashed in the mountains in 1995, killing the four crew members on board, and one that crashed into the sea in 2002, killing the two pilots, according to CNA. The biggest recent mystery has been the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. It disappeared on March 8, 2014, and has not been found. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Ed Payne and Katie Hunt contributed to this report.","Death toll rises to 32, official news agency reports; 11 people still missing .

"(CNN)The Irish writer James Joyce once said an excellent puzzle would be to try to cross Dublin without walking past a pub. A similar challenge for many cities in the United States would be to drive more than 20 miles on surface streets without hearing your wheels thrum over a perpendicular rail crossing. Trains and cars must share an uneasy co-existence here in the nation that railroads built, and for many drivers -- especially those who live near active tracks -- the act of crossing them also comes with a brief pause, perhaps mindful of the 3,000 tons of angry steel that could theoretically be barreling toward them. The horrendous possibility became a reality in the town of Valhalla, New York, on Wednesday evening when a Metro-North train slammed into an SUV that apparently got stuck on the tracks after a crossing bar dropped down on it. The driver, who apparently had gotten out of her car to investigate, was killed in the crash along with five passengers on the train. Fatalities such as these are not an aberration. An average of about five people each week are killed in train collisions, far more than those who lose their lives in commercial airline crashes. The exact cause of the Valhalla gate-lowering won't be known until the National Transportation Safety Board finishes its investigation. But the nation's big railroads usually take the position that careless motorists or daredevils trying to beat the lowering gates are always the cause of the problem. Evidence indicates, however, that the victims are sometimes not at fault because the gates are malfunctioning or the lights are broken. State and local governments are responsible for keeping crossings safe and equipment up to date, but railroads can be complicit in allowing conditions to deteriorate to dangerous levels. Vegetation sometimes grows around signs without being trimmed, for example. A 2004 investigative series from The New York Times found a persistent pattern of railroad cover-ups in cases of fatal crashes. In some cases, records were destroyed and malfunctioning gates were quickly fixed before lawyers could examine the evidence. Five years later, the freight railroad network BNSF was fined $4 million by a judge for its ""staggering"" and ""egregious"" conduct in a lawsuit involving the deaths of four people struck by a train at a crossing with a broken gate. The railroad ""knowingly advanced lies, misleading facts and/or misrepresentations"" in the legal proceedings, Judge Ellen Maas wrote. Short of running it underground or up on viaducts, there is no way to run a railroad across open land in the United States without crossing multiple surface streets and country lanes, putting the unwary at risk of being flattened by oncoming trains. The ""bells and bars"" safety system designed to prevent this horror emerged in fits and starts through the last 180 years, and there are no current movements to replace it with anything else. The early railroaders of the 1830s got around this problem by posting guards at major crossings and instructing them to keep people away with force when a train was on the way. The first hand-cranked gate was patented in 1867. Automatic flashing warning lights were introduced in 1913, and the familiar X sign known as a ""crossbuck"" became ubiquitous through the nation. The striped bar called a ""boom barrier"" that automatically descends across the tracks used to cover two whole lanes of traffic, but it was eventually shortened to one lane to allow motorists trapped inside to find a way to maneuver out before the train plowed into them. That appears to have been what the Valhalla driver was attempting to do when she was struck. Better driver education and the painfully slow attempts by railroads and states to upgrade faulty crossing equipment have shown results over the last four decades. Total car-versus-train collisions are down from about 12,000 in 1972 to just over 2,000 in 2013. But it does not change the fact that most American cities are seeded with permanent killing zones that can trap inattentive drivers.","Metro-North crash killed six people at railroad crossing in Valhalla, New York .
Overall, train fatalities down in U.S., Tom Zoellner says .
But ""bells and bars"" system still relies mainly on caution, proper gate maintenance, he says ."
"Police in Arkansas said Wednesday a man fatally shot while handcuffed in the back of a police car had called his girlfriend that night and told her he had a gun and was scared. Chavis Carter, 21, died July 28 while in the back of a Jonesboro Police Department car from a close-range gunshot. On Wednesday, police issued a news release, saying that because of the unusual nature of his death, they were going to release some information in the wake of many Freedom of Information requests even though the investigation is ongoing. The lead investigator interviewed Carter's girlfriend Wednesday, police said, and she told him that Carter called her from the police car, said he loved her, that he was frightened and had a gun. The girlfriend's name is not mentioned in the release. The police report from that night shows officers originally put Carter in the back of a car without handcuffs before determining that there was a warrant for his arrest in Mississippi. They searched him a second time before leaving him handcuffed in the back seat of a patrol car where he died. Police said Wednesday they presume Carter hid the gun while in the car the first time. Phone records indicate he made two calls that night. The Arkansas medical examiner has ruled Carter's death a suicide. ""At the time of discharge, the muzzle of the gun was placed against the right temporal scalp,"" the crime lab's report states. Police said they discovered a .380-caliber Cobra semi-automatic pistol when they found Carter's body slumped over. An attorney for the Carter family said Wednesday that he was disturbed to learn that no gun residue test was done on people at the scene. ""Anyone searching hard for the truth would have performed those tests on Chavis and the arresting officers,"" Benjamin Irwin, a Memphis-based attorney for the Cochran Law Firm said in a written statement. Jonesboro police said they prepared Carter's hands to be examined, but the crime lab has a policy that it doesn't test suicide or homicide victims. ""Police have been too busy trying to prove their conclusion to consider any other possible scenarios,"" Irwin said. ""The lack of a gun residue test is further proof that the search for critical evidence has been overlooked."" Many people in Jonesboro were skeptical about the shooting, as was Carter's mother. ""I think they killed him,"" Theresa Carter told CNN on August 15.  ""I mean, my son wasn't suicidal."" She also said her son was left-handed and wondered how police could find a bag of marijuana and not find a gun when they searched her son. There have been several protests in Jonesboro by citizens who don't believe the explanation by police. Police have released a video in which an officer dramatizes how someone could shoot themselves while in the back of a police car. The officer was the same height and build as Carter, police said. They also have released the interview room video of a witness who said police were standing outside the car when a shot was fired. The autopsy also showed that Carter tested positive for marijuana, amphetamines (including meth) and benzodiazepines, classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as depressants. Also in Wednesday's release, the police said they talked to witnesses who appeared in a video from Carter's cell phone. One of the witnesses, who is in jail, said he texted Carter and requested he bring the gun to a drug deal that July night.","Girlfriend was interviewed by a detective on Wednesday, police say .

"Joyce Brothers, who pioneered the television advice show and was called the mother of media psychology, has died, her daughter said Monday. She was 85. ""She passed away peacefully and in her home ... with her family all around her,"" Lisa Brothers Arbisser said. Brothers, whose charming, reassuring demeanor appealed to television audiences, became a television star as a game show contestant, a sports interviewer, then as a psychologist answering audience questions about relationships and other emotional subjects. She grew her fame as a frequent guest on television talk shows and as an advice columnist for Good Housekeeping magazine for four decades and for newspapers throughout the United States. She also made many cameo appearances parodying herself on television sitcoms and in movies. She once told a reporter, ""I don't give advice. I just tell people, 'This is what we know.' "" But give advice was what she did, and America listened: . ""Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success."" ""The best proof of love is trust."" ""Marriage is not just spiritual communion and passionate embraces; marriage is also three meals a day, sharing the workload and remembering to carry out the trash."" Dispensing advice on public airwaves didn't please all of her colleagues. Some members of the American Psychological Association asked early in her media career that her membership be revoked because they didn't think dispensing advice outside a one-on-one setting was appropriate. Media psychology became part of the organization's structure in 1986, according to the APA website. Born Joyce Diane Bauer, she married Milton Brothers in 1949, according to a biography provided by her family. He died in 1989. Brothers became a practicing psychologist in 1958, five years after she got her master's degree at Columbia University. By then, she had already caused a stir on television, winning the top prize on ""The $64,000 Question"" in 1955. The topic: boxing. The family biography said she appeared on the show when her husband was in medical school and they were living with her parents. Her husband suggested she try out as a boxing expert, seeing that would make her an unusual contestant -- a woman versed in pugilism. When the show asked her to be on, she memorized the Encyclopedia of Boxing in a few weeks. She repeated her success two years later on ""The $64,000 Challenge,"" leading to a job on ""Sports Showcase."" In 1958, she was the host of a self-titled show on local television that became so popular, NBC syndicated the program nationally. Amid the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s, she demonstrated her well-versed knowledge of boxing to a congressional panel, her family biography said. Years later, she wrote books and had radio shows. And America saw her often on television, not only giving advice but making fun of herself. On one episode of the ABC smash hit ""Happy Days,"" she counseled Fonzie's dog, Spunky. She made a vocal appearance on the animated series ""The Simpsons"" in the memorable ""Last Exit to Springfield"" episode. On an episode of ""Frasier,"" a show about one of TV's famous fictional psychologists, she took Frasier Crane's place in a commercial about nuts. Brothers also appeared on shows like ""The Love Boat"" playing a character, often a doctor. She is survived by her sister, Elaine Goldsmith; her daughter; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. The family didn't disclose the cause of her death, which happened in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Her funeral is scheduled for Tuesday at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.

"(CNN) -- Actress Emma Watson not only stirred the Internet with her recent moving speech before the United Nations, but she also joined a cadre of celebrities who have used their star power to bring attention to gender issues. Watson, best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the ""Harry Potter"" films, spoke Saturday as part of the launch of a new HeForShe campaign, which is aimed at getting men involved in stopping violence against women. (HeForShe is a U.N. initiative for gender equality.) The actress was appointed as a goodwill ambassador for U.N. Women six months ago and advocated for everyone to be involved in the movement. ""How can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation?"" Watson said. ""Men -- I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too."" Watson is just one of several celebrities who have spoken out in an effort to protect women. Actress Charlize Theron has been a U.N. ambassador of peace and recorded public service announcements for the Stop Rape Now program as part of the U.N. Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict. Through her association with the beauty company Avon (where she has been an honorary chair of the Avon Foundation), Reese Witherspoon has taken on the issue of domestic violence. In 2009 Witherspoon visited the House of Commons in the United Kingdom in support of the Four Ways to Speak Out program. ""You're not alone, and if you reach out, there's someone next door to you in your life who is ready to give you support and care and love, and it's important to know that,"" the actress said at the time. And female celebrities are not the only stars who have taken up the cause. In 2010, country singer Tim McGraw was awarded a True Ally Award at the 2010 Men Stopping Violence annual awards for his work to reduce domestic violence, which has included efforts with his wife, singer Faith Hill, to raise funds for battered women's shelters. ""I am a product of domestic violence,"" McGraw reportedly said then. ""It is a learned behavior. I learned a lot. I learned how not to treat my wife, how not to treat my family. My wife, Faith Hill, is my inspiration and my partner in all I do."" In her U.N. speech Saturday, Watson said she hopes to recruit everyone in the battle to assist women. The British actress said she wanted to end the belief that feminism is equivalent to ""man-hating."" ""We want to try to galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for change, and we don't just want to talk about it,"" she said. ""We want to try and make sure that it's tangible.""","Emma Watson speaks as part of her role as a U.N. goodwill ambassador .

"In the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, makeshift barricades, concertina wire and masked men in camouflage greeted visitors to the regional administration building Wednesday. Seized by armed men Tuesday, the building in Ukraine's restive Donetsk region is just the latest to fall under the control of pro-Russian militants. Government sites across more than a dozen towns and cities in Donetsk remain occupied, despite an international deal agreed to earlier this month that called for illegal armed groups to disarm and go home. And the militias, resolutely defiant, show no signs of changing their stance. In the foyer of the Luhansk government building -- outside which pro-Russian flags now fly -- more armed men, sandbags and wire surrounded a desk through which access to the rest of the building was controlled. A handful of employees waited, looking very uncomfortable. At a briefing inside for reporters, a man who described himself as the press secretary for the headquarters of the ""southeast army,"" Oleg Desyatnichenko, said this was the threatened takeover of additional buildings. He said the activists had given the local government an ultimatum Saturday about holding a referendum on greater autonomy for the region. There was no response, he said, so the activists moved in. Video footage seen Tuesday showed the pro-Russian militants as they approached the building, smashed doors, waved flags and chanted ""Russia! Russia!"" Desyatnichenko said the seizure of key administrative buildings, including the police station and prosecutors' office, would allow the separatists to control local government and access resources needed to hold the referendum. A controversial referendum in Ukraine's Crimea region last month resulted in its annexation by Russia, a step widely condemned by the international community. Separatist leader: 'I am not worried' In the town of Slavyansk, to the west of Luhansk, Denis Pushilin, self-declared chairman of the ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" was also defiant, despite the international pressure for the groups to disband. At the start of this week, additional sanctions were imposed by the United States and European Union on dozens of individuals and businesses seen as backing Russia's intervention in Ukraine or as being close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Pushilin is among those named in the EU sanctions list. But he appears unfazed by the prospect of asset freezes and visa bans. ""I am not worried by the sanctions. I have no reaction,"" he told CNN. ""I have no money in Europe."" He said the same applied to Igor Strelkov, also on the sanctions list, whom the European Union accuses of being a Russian special forces soldier. Pushilin also confirmed that pro-Russian separatists have seized the police department in the town of Horlivka. ""Where they are still enemies of the people, we will do this. We are making such operations in places where the police are not on our side,"" he said. Separatists in Slavyansk continue to hold a team of Western military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, seized outside the town Friday. Asked what they intended for the seven observers -- described by their captors as ""prisoners of war"" -- Pushilin said they ""would decide about them later."" He repeated the separatists' assertion that the observers are NATO spies and said they would like to exchange them for people detained by pro-Kiev authorities. OSCE negotiators continue to meet daily with the pro-Russians in Slavyansk to discuss the observers' release, and there is a sense that progress is being made, OSCE spokesman Michael Bociurkiw said Wednesday. The negotiating team has seen the observers each day and reports that they are all in good health. Turchynov: Military is ready for combat . Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said Wednesday that the country's armed forces have been put on full combat readiness because of the threat from Russia. Speaking at a meeting with the heads of regional state administrations, he said the authorities' task was to prevent the spread of the ""terrorist threat"" from separatists and pro-Russian saboteurs to other regions of Ukraine. He accused groups in Slavyansk of ""killing and torturing people, capturing people,"" and he said that in addition to automatic weapons, they had heavy weapons like grenade launchers. Russia's Foreign Ministry responded late Wednesday by denouncing what it called ""these militaristic statements of Kiev authorities."" ""We insist on an immediate termination of the Kiev militaristic rhetoric aimed at intimidating its own population, on preventing the use of force and initiation of the internal Ukrainian dialogue to seek national reconciliation within the country,"" the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. On Tuesday, Turchynov also said events in eastern Ukraine ""illustrated inactivity, helplessness, and sometimes criminal betrayal of the law enforcement agencies in the Donetsk and (Luhansk) regions."" He said, ""It is hard to admit, but it is true. The vast majority of the law enforcement officials in the east are not able to fulfill their obligations to protect our citizens."" New heads of security have been appointed in Donetsk and Luhansk, he said. Amid the heightened tensions, Kiev city authorities said ""special tactical training exercises"" would take place in the capital Wednesday night and warned that ""convoys of combat machinery"" would be moving around the city. But the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense denied any such drills were taking place overnight, saying military personnel in Kiev would remain at their bases. The government in Kiev says Russia is behind the unrest and is supporting the militants. The Ukrainian Security Service said Wednesday that a Ukrainian citizen had told investigators he was recruited by Russian intelligence agents while on a trip to Crimea, and that he and others were trained by Russian law enforcement instructors to carry out ""subversive activities"" in Ukraine. The security service said the Ukrainian citizen, referred to as ""K,"" led a group of 10 people in separatist actions in the Kharkiv region, including the seizure of administrative buildings, earlier this month. Putin: No need for retaliatory steps . Western nations also accuse Moscow of supporting the separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings and holding the OSCE team hostage. But Russia disputes that claim, saying it has no direct influence over the pro-Russian activists. Rather, Putin said Tuesday that the United States had ""managed the process from the start."" In remarks to journalists reported by state news agency ITAR-Tass, Putin added that he had not yet authorized a Russian response to the latest round of Western sanctions. ""The government of the Russian Federation has already proposed some retaliatory steps. I think there's not need,"" he is quoted as saying. The standoff over the former Soviet republic has become the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the end of the Cold War. In Washington, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday that Russia can't ""have it both ways"" in dealing with the rest of the world. ""If Russia wants to benefit from the international order, it has to respect that order and abide by the rules,"" Biden told the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. But he added that Ukraine's new leaders have to move quickly to overhaul a system badly in need of reform. ""There is a common view, East and West, that the government has to begin to deliver, that corruption is incredibly corrosive,"" said Biden, who met with Ukrainian officials in Kiev last week. ""It may not be politic to say, but it is a reality."" Cracking down on corruption and modernizing outdated institutions could act as ""the most significant bulwark against Russian aggression"" by restoring public confidence in the country, he said. ""This needs to be a government that exists to serve the people, not enrich the powerful,"" he said. Earlier, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told the Atlantic Council that Russia was failing to live up to the deal it signed on April 17 to ease tensions in Ukraine, and said it was ""fair to say they have escalated the crisis even further."" Kerry and Biden both pledged that the NATO alliance -- which now includes several former Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact states -- would stand united to defend its members' territorial integrity. In June, President Barack Obama will be visiting Poland, a key U.S. ally in eastern Europe, a neighbor of Ukraine, and a member of NATO. He'll travel there for the 25th anniversary of democratic elections in that country, Biden said. The European swing will include stops in Belgium and France for the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Russia taking 'dangerous steps' An emergency session of the U.N. Security Council was called Tuesday at Britain's request. Mark Lyall Grant, UK ambassador to the United Nations, accused Russia of ""taking further dangerous steps aimed at fomenting instability in Ukraine"" while seeking to blame the Kiev government for destabilizing the country. ""Russia directed paramilitary actions in Slavyansk, Kramatorsk, Luhansk and other towns in eastern Ukraine,"" he said. ""Russian military jets and helicopters have made incursions into Ukrainian airspace. Russian actions are clear attempts to escalate tensions within Ukraine."" But Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, suggested Western diplomats were focused only on criticizing the actions of protesters in southeastern Ukraine. Mass protests in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, led to the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in February. Russia says the interim government in Kiev is illegitimate and backed by ultranationalist groups. Ukraine is also in deep economic trouble -- and Russia has threatened to turn off natural gas supplies if it doesn't pay its bills. Ukraine's overall debt for Russian gas has now reached almost $ 3.5 billion, Russia's gas giant Gazprom reported Wednesday, according to ITAR-Tass.","Russia calls on Kiev to halt ""militaristic statements""

"By calling National Guard troops into Ferguson, Missouri, authorities are taking the situation ""to the opposite extreme of community policing,"" a former FBI assistant director says. Tom Fuentes, a CNN law enforcement analyst, notes that just a few days ago, authorities were out on the streets shaking hands with marchers. Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol ""was like Gandhi, promising to ensure their safety,"" Fuentes said. But growing violence -- amid protests over the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown by a police officer -- changed the situation. ""Given these deliberate, coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in Ferguson, I am directing the highly capable men and women of the Missouri National Guard ... in restoring peace and order to this community,"" Gov. Jay Nixon said in a statement Monday. Police in the Ferguson area, just like many all over the country, have military equipment, which they used last week. So why bring in the Guard at all? ""You don't want extremely tired, fatigued, overtaxed police officers out there day after day, night after night,"" Fuentes said. And state patrol officers who came in from out of town and are staying in hotels, working around the clock, are surely getting fatigued as well, he said. ""You don't need more military equipment; it's more of a manpower issue."" But there are other reasons it may make sense to replace police on the scene, analysts say. Members of the National Guard may better follow a ""unified chain of command,"" said Jason Fritz, an Army veteran and senior editor of War on the Rocks, which analyzes national security issues. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . In this case, that could be a big improvement. ""I've never seen such a disjointed police effort as this,"" Fuentes said. Nixon said the Guard will assist Col. Ron Replogle, head of the State Highway Patrol, ""in restoring peace and order to this community."" In a later statement, Nixon said the Guard's ""immediate and limited responsibilities"" are to ""provide protection, and ensure the safety of our Unified Command Center, which was the target last night of a coordinated attack. The Guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission."" ""With these additional resources in place, the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence, and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard."" If military police are among the Guard troops, they'll have special training in crowd control that may help, Fritz says. Fuentes rejects that idea, saying National Guard troops' training does not prepare them for situations like this. ""It's not their mission to do local law enforcement,"" he said. But Fuentes and Fritz agree on another big reason it might make sense to bring in the National Guard: Residents are fed up with police. Marchers have accused police of responding with disproportionate violence against a mostly peaceful crowd. And residents have described protesters helping protect stores from being looted while police did nothing. Police also infuriated protesters by releasing a video that they said shows Michael Brown involved in a convenience store robbery -- even though police themselves have said it does not relate to the police officer having stopped Brown as he was walking down the street. By bringing in National Guard troops, Nixon is moving both Ferguson and St. Louis County police out of the way. ""That might be enough,"" Fritz said. Magazine: The Aftermath in Ferguson .

"After 19 years of marriage, Chris Rock has filed for divorce. But unlike his trenchant standup routines, where he often poked fun at marriage, the comedian is being tight-lipped about the reason. ""This is a personal matter and Chris requests privacy as he and Malaak work through this process and focus on their family,"" his representative said in a statement Sunday. Malaak is Malaak Compton-Rock, the mother of Rock's two girls, 12-year-old Lola Simone and 10 year-old Zahra Savannah. ""After much contemplation and 19 years of marriage, Chris and I have decided to go our separate ways,"" Compton-Rock said in a statement, People reported. ""My children remain at the center of my life, and their well-being is my top priority. It is in this spirit that I sincerely ask that their privacy and the privacy of our family be respected during this transition in our lives."" In his comedy acts, Rock has been brutally incisive about marriage -- as he is about all other issues. But Rock's divorce might not come as a surprise to his fans. ""Marriage is so tough, man,"" he once said. ""Nelson Mandela got divorced.

"John McCain says he is ""most likely"" running for re-election in 2016, but is aware that he will be a top target for conservative groups gunning for establishment Republicans in primaries. In an interview with CNN, the Arizona senator stepped closer to pulling the trigger on a campaign for a sixth term and seems to be spoiling for the fight. But he also said he's not sure Republicans can hang on to the Senate in two years after grabbing it back from Democrats in the midterm elections. ""I am approaching it, that decision, and it's most likely that I will announce that I am a running again,"" said McCain, who will be 80 at the time of the 2016 election. McCain had previously said he was considering and ""leaning towards"" a campaign but would announce his intentions in early 2015. The veteran senator is about to get his firmest grip on power in Washington since his defeat to President Barack Obama in the 2008 election. He will serve as chairman of the influential Senate Armed Services Committee when Republicans take the majority in January. But McCain said he would run the committee on the assumption that he will be chairman for only two years, because the Republican majority's fate will also be decided in 2016. ""It is certainly not clear whether we keep the Senate or not,"" he said. ""That will depend on how we can show the American people with a Republican majority that we can govern or not."" McCain knows that tea party and other activists are already lining him up and could seek to exploit positions on immigration and torture that have put him at odds with the conservative base. ""I will be at the top of the list, there is no doubt about that,"" said McCain. ""I expect a vigorous campaign. For me to expect anything else would be foolish. And I'm not foolish."" In his last election, in 2010, McCain fought off a vocal primary challenge from conservative former House Republican and radio host J.D. Hayworth. Since then, a number of Tea Party-backed candidates have made a practice of challenging longtime lawmakers and candidates favored by the party establishment in primaries.","McCain edges closer than ever to 2016 campaign .
