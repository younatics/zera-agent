They have transformed their dull street into a glorious green garden and been lauded by the council several times. But the community-spirited residents of Rockcliffe Avenue in Whitley Bay have now been told by the same authority they must ditch the whole thing - because it is a 'health and safety hazard'. Their efforts transforming the dull suburban alleyway have helped cut anti-social behaviour in the area, revitalised the street and got neighbours working together. Uplifting: One resident said that the pathway had even helped the area overcome its anti-social behaviour problems . Defiant: Michael Kelley, who led the transformation, says he is 'absolutely livid' Street in bloom: Michael Kelley with his flowerpots, which are now deemed a health and safety risk . Haven: Locals from all around Whitley Bay come to enjoy the flowers on Rockcliffe Avenue . Since residents began transforming the . path six years ago, they have been awarded a number of community prizes . by North Tyneside council. In the prestigious North Tyneside in . Bloom contest in 2010 they were honoured for ‘best street effort’ and . just last year they won ‘best community effort’. In a sudden reversal, however, the . council which awarded those prizes has now insisted the plant pots are . dangerous and may obstruct people walking down the alley. Those who have worked for years to . maintain the beautiful ‘secret garden’ say it is ridiculous that it is . being targeted by ‘jobsworth’ council chiefs. ‘This area has become a wildlife . corridor and attracts butterflies, hedgehogs, bees and bats. Children . from the nearby nursery come here for nature walks,’ said Mike Kelley, . 55, who led the transformation. ‘Now the same council that gave us the awards wants us to remove the planters. I am absolutely livid.’ Haven: Residents say the uplifting pathway has improved the whole area . Hard work: The residents of Rockcliffe Avenue have made a huge effort to make the street look well-cared for and attractive, spending thousands on their gardening . Well-maintained: Thousands of pounds have been spent on maintaining the flowers, which will be removed unless residents change the containers . They say if residents want to save the . displays they must ‘apply for grant funding’ to find more suitable . plant pots which comply with highways legislation. Mr Kelly, who has spent about £8,000 on the street displays, said locals are deeply upset and angry. ‘This community has put in a lot of effort to make the street look nice,’ he added. ‘I have been putting out various . planters and have spent a lot of money doing it. Other residents have . added to that and also look after their gardens well. All this has . helped us to win awards.’ Retired home carer Jenny Craig, said: . ‘This pathway has given so much pleasure to so many people. It has . improved the area, which used to suffer from anti-social behaviour some . years ago. It’s like a little haven.’ Fun for children: Laura Guthzeit, manager of Rainbow Childcare Nursery, centre, going for a walk with Mathew, left, and Macy-May Stretton, right . In jeopardy: Residents have been told to apply for a grant for new plant pots if they want to hang on to their flowers . Obstruction: Gardening organiser Michael Kelley pointed out that even if they do get new plant pots that will not over come the supposed access problems . Mother-of-two Laura Turville, 32, of . nearby Edwards Road, Whitley Bay, added: ‘I bring my two children here . all the time and they love it. We call it the secret garden. I think . every street should be like this,’ while local nursery manager Laura . Guthzeit, 29, said: ‘We bring the children here and they love it. ‘They point out all the little . features and flowers. It’s a safe place to walk down here.’ Despite the . upset in the community, North Tyneside Council maintained residents will . have to apply for grant funding for new planters which meet ‘required . standards’ and do not obstruct those with ‘accessibility needs’. A spokesman added: ‘North Tyneside . Council appreciates the efforts of residents of Rockcliffe Avenue over . the years. However, the number of planters has increased to an extent . where they obstruct the pavement. ‘Not all residents agree to the scale of this community effort and have concerns about impact on the pathways. ‘Under highways legislation we have an obligation to protect the rights of the public at large.’","Gardening scheme has brought local community together and cut anti-social behaviour .

Apple says it received between 4,000 and 5,000 requests from U.S. law enforcement for customer data for the six months ended in May. The company, like some other businesses, had asked the U.S government to be able to share how many requests it received related to national security and how it handled them. Those requests were made as part of Prism, the recently revealed highly classified National Security Agency program that seizes records from Internet companies. Transparency: In a statement posted on their website Monday, Apple revealed how many requests they've received for government surveillance, and how many accounts were targeted . Prism appears to do what its name suggests. Like a triangular piece of glass, Prism takes large beams of data and helps the government find discrete, manageable strands of information. Prism was revealed this month by The Washington Post and Guardian newspapers, and has touched off the latest round in a decade-long debate over what limits to impose on government eavesdropping, which the Obama administration says is essential to keep the nation safe. Apple Inc. said that between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices were specified in data requests between Dec. 1, 2012, and May 31 from federal, state and local authorities and included both criminal investigations and national security matters. Spying: The National Security Agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. Apple said Monday that they tried to give 'the narrowest possible set of information to the authorities' when dealing with surveillance requests . It said that the most common form of request came from police investigating robberies and other crimes, searching for missing children, trying to locate a patient with Alzheimer's disease, or hoping to prevent a suicide. The company also made clear how much access the government has. 'We do not provide any government agency with direct access to our servers, and any government agency requesting customer content must get a court order,' Apple said in a statement on its website. Apple explained that its legal team evaluates each request and that it delivers 'the narrowest possible set of information to the authorities' when deemed appropriate. The company said that it has refused some requests in the past. The company said it complied with 79 per cent of requests. Personal information: All Siri queries, in addition to iMessages and FaceTime chats were not made available for government surveillance . Some of the information off-limits to government surveillance requests include Siri queries, iMessages, and FaceTime chats. Facebook Inc. has said that it received between 9,000 and 10,000 requests for data from all government agencies in the second half of last year. The social media company said fewer than 19,000 users were targeted. Apple's stock rose $2.12 to $432.17 in morning trading on Monday.

Britain is 'breaching the human rights' of controversial Wikileaks founder Julian Assange by not allowing him to leave his embassy hideout to go sunbathing, Ecuador's foreign minister has today claimed. The south American country claims the fugitive's human rights are being trampled on by being prevented from enjoying London's summer sunshine. Assange, 41, has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in Kensington, west London, for nearly a year. He was granted asylum as he fights extradition to Sweden on sex assault charges. Met Police keep a 24-hour watch on the building and have orders to arrest him if he steps outside of the building. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino insisted today ahead of a meeting next Monday with William Hague in London his country would continue to protect Assange. Insisting the Australian could only sunbathe through the window of his embassy hideout, he said: 'We believe he has a fundamental right to sunbathe.' He added: 'His right to intimacy, mobility, a normal life and health is being restricted. 'I will be asking the British government to allow Mr Assange to sunbathe and enjoy the warm weather and sunshine because unfortunately, at this moment in time, he hasn't been able to do so for a year.'

French airplane maker Airbus, along with UNESCO, invited aeronautics and engineering students from all over the world to develop their most innovative air travel ideas and compete to see whose has the greatest potential to turn the industry on its head. The Airbus Fly Your Ideas competition is in its third year and exists to inspire the next generation of engineers to channel the future of air travel, always with one eye on sustainability. This year’s high-concepts were inspired by a need for more energy friendly air travel and included engines that run on methane, body heat-powered in-flight entertainment, air hockey-inspired luggage movers, and many more. High-concept: The Airbus Fly Your Ideas competition asks the world's most promising engineering students to come up with innovative airplane concepts for a cash prize. One team thought up this Smart Tech Zone . ‘We're trying to encourage the next generation of leaders to think about ways in which the aviation industry could be made more eco-efficient, and to be sympathetic to its environmental impact,’ said Airbus' senior manager for research and technology Dale King. The competition commenced in September 2012. The initial 618 submissions from 82 countries were quickly whittled down to 100 teams for round 2. From there, 100 became just 5 finalists with projects related to the topics of energy, efficiency, affordable growth, traffic growth, passenger experience, and community friendliness—which have each been identified by Airbus as the six key challenges of the 21st century for a sustainable aviation industry. Hot commodity: Malaysia's Team Embarker sees a future where body heat powers small electronic devices in the plane . Electrifying: And the technology exists. An Oregon startup created a chip that turns body heat to electric energy . Australian’s Team CLiMA from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology drafted a proposal for the development of aircraft fueled by a blend of biomethane and liquefied natural gas, called Bio-LNG. ‘Even if you replaced (jet fuel) with liquid natural gas,’ said the Australian team’s Luke Spiteri, in reference to his team proposal’s potential to improve a jet’s eco-friendliness, ‘you could cut CO2 emissions 20%.’ The Brazilian representatives had a decidedly child-like spin on their proposal. Team Levar from the University of Sao Paulo’s contribution was a proposal for a luggage loading/unloading system for airplane cargo compartments that create an aircushion to move baggage, much like the tiny jets of air that propel air hockey pucks. India’s Team AVAS proposed a jet engine exhaust that uses intelligent, shape shifting alloys to reduce noise. Cleaner burning: Australia's team CLiMA foresees planes powered by methane and natural gas . Team Flybrid of Italy’s Technical University of Milan’s contribution was an electric/turboprop combination for hybrid propulsion in small aircraft. And the final team, Malaysia’s Team Embarker has a shocking concept. From Universiti Putra Malaysia, they foresee a plane where body heat is turned into electricity used to power small electronics and overhead reading lights. Though the technology does exist to turn body heat to power, we can thus far only produce very little form one person’s body. Child's play: The University of Sao Paolo team imagined an air jet-propelled baggage transport system inspired by air hockey tables . Tan Kai Jun, Malaysian team leader, sees a plane where each seat is covered in the heat-to-electricity material. ‘It's a small amount, but imagine this collected from 550 seats throughout 10 hours of flight. A plane has a lifespan of a few hundred flights -- over time that's a big reduction,’ he told CNN. Though each of the finalists’ ideas were groundbreaking, there could of course be only one winner. The air-powered luggage mover, proposed by the team from the University of Sao Paolo, took home the big prize. In addition to a cash award of €30,000, their school will play host to a group of Airbus experts for a week of workshops and training.",Airbus and UNESCO challenged engineering students to come up with their most innovative airplane concepts as part of the third biennial Fly Your Ideas Competition .

Tragic: Sandra Wiltshire, 68, died along with her dog Bruce when they were trampled by cows last year, an inquest heard today . A retired accountant was trampled to death by a herd of cows as she walked her dog, an inquest heard today. Sandra Wiltshire, 68, died alongside her beloved golden Labrador, Bruce, after the incident in a field near their home in Chippenham in Wiltshire last year. Mrs Wiltshire was declared dead minutes after paramedics arrived at the scene, while her companion Bruce was put down by a vet later that day. An inquest in Salisbury in Wiltshire heard the field Mrs Wiltshire and Bruce - who was not on a lead - were walking in had no public right of way and was private land. The jury ruled that Mrs Wiltshire died as a result of an accident, a verdict recorded by the coroner, with injuries caused by hooves. A spokesman for the panel told David Ridley, coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon: 'She had been attacked by cattle while walking her dog. Following attendance by paramedics and police she was pronounced dead.' Mrs Wiltshire mainly walked rescue dog Bruce, described as 'overweight' and 'slow' in fields by the River Avon near their home. Her husband George Wiltshire, a taxi driver, did not attend the hearing but a statement he had prepared was read. It said: 'Sandra walked Bruce twice a day every day and enjoying taking him out. 'It kept her fit and energetic. She would take him out to the fields out by the river. 'When she walked Bruce, if they were in the fields he would always be off the lead and would be miles behind Sandra. 'Bruce didn't cause any trouble.' Best friends: Bruce was being taken for a walk by owner Sandra Wiltshire when the cows struck, and he was later put down . Mr Wiltshire said he last saw his wife the night before her death, when she looked 'happy and healthy'. Mrs Crawley, her husband Raymond and their dog Judy had been walking . around the fields when they spotted Bruce caked in mud, lying on the . floor. Around 30 feet away lay Mrs Wiltshire, whose face and hands were covered in mud. 'I shouted out to the person saying ""are you alright?"",' Mrs Crawley told the court. 'The female voice spoke back saying ""no, not really, I have been attacked by cows. I have been here since 7.30.'' Mrs Crawley ran to get help and then returned to Mrs Wiltshire after asking a nearby walker to call 999. 'I saw Bruce the dog lying about 30ft away from Sandra,' Mrs Crawley said. 'I could hear him whimpering. I realised he wouldn't stand up and was covered in mud. 'It was clear Sandra wasn't very well at all. I did think at that moment there was no hope.' Terrible event: Blackbridge Road in Chippenham, close to where the accident last year took place . The jury was told local people were aware that the fields, part of Rawlings Farm, did not have public right of way. But the land was regularly used by walkers, despite a sign stating Private Fishing which related to an access path for an angling society. Michael Franklin, who lived near Mrs Wiltshire, saw her walking Bruce on the morning of the incident last year and said the cows had charged towards him and his dog on two previous occasions. 'I waved and shouted and they stopped in their tracks,' he said. Paramedics and police attended the field and Mrs Wiltshire was pronounced dead at 8.56am, shortly after they arrived. Farmer Charles Mifflin said the herd of Simmental cattle that used the field comprised of 16 cows, 14 calves and one bull. Tragic: Sandra Wiltshire was trampled by cows while out walking her dog in the countryside (stock photo) Mr Mifflin, who runs two farms, described the breed as 'very quiet'. 'They are friendly like most cattle, they come up to nose and make friends with you,' he said. 'These are working fields, it is land that is farmed. People don't appreciate that it is a workplace.' A post mortem performed by Dr Lawrence John, a consultant pathologist at Great Western Hospital in Swindon found . Mrs Wiltshire suffered extensive bruising when she was trampled. He said: 'One on the right lower thigh was consistent with having been made by a hoof.' Dr John said the cause of death was multiple blunt traumatic injuries and being trampled by cows. Speaking after Mrs Wiltshire's death, her mother Brenda Beint of Calne in Wiltshire, said the family was shocked. Mrs Beint said: 'I cannot tell you how much I miss her. 'Sandra was a lovely, bubbly personality and she and I always enjoyed our time together.'","Sandra Wiltshire, 68, died alongside her beloved golden Labrador, Bruce .

Wanted: Convicted kidnapper Peter Watton is being hunted by police across Britain over a savage rape 48 hours after his release from prison . A convicted kidnapper is today being hunted by police across Britain for allegedly raping a jogger just 48 hours after he was freed early from jail. Fugitive career criminal Peter Watton, 37, has been described by detectives as 'risk to the public' and should not be approached. Yet he had been allowed back on the streets by prison authorities only last week - just half way through a six year sentence for the drug fuelled abduction and robbery of a terrified teenager. Just two days after Watton's release from jail on June 12, a female jogger, 44, was taken prisoner and raped as she was out exercising on the afternoon of Friday June 14 with her pet dog on parkland in the Handbridge area of Chester. It is feared the woman was held for up to eight hours before she managed to escape and call police in the early hours of the following morning. Cheshire Police has launched a massive manhunt and took the unusual step of naming Watton as the man they wanted to speak to over the attack. A picture of a bike used by the rape . suspect was also released. Police believe the bike may have been stolen . and are keen to speak to anyone in the Chester area that may be missing a . grey/blue 'X rated' mountain bike. Officers also urged other women living in the historic city not to go to isolated places alone including the banks of the River Dee. The rape victim is being counselled by specially trained detectives and is said to be 'deeply traumatised' by her ordeal. Probe: Police with dogs searching the area of Chester where the woman victim was raped . Watton, from Crewe, had been jailed at Chester Crown Court in July 2010 for kidnap and robbery after he and two accomplices abducted an 18-year old boy whilst armed with a screwdriver and forced him to drive them around while they tried to score drugs. Later the lad was blindfolded and taken to a flat where Watton stole a laptop and a significant amount of clothing. He also threatened two more people whilst one of two pals - a convicted rapist- threatened to 'burn the place down.' Watton had previously been jailed for six years in 2000 for an attempted kidnapping and had a lengthy record of dishonesty offences. He was freed on parole on June 12 under laws allowing prisoners to be released after serving half their sentences. Today Cheshire Police said Watton was is in breach of his licence conditions and is wanted on a recall to prison but urged anyone who sees him to call 999 and not tackle him themselves. Help: Police have released the picture of this bike, similar to the one used by the attacker in Chester . Detail: The bike is branded x-rated and police believe that it was Watton who was on it . Det Supt Andy Southcott said 'We have a number of active lines of inquiry that we are progressing and believe that Peter Watton may be able to assist us in our investigation. 'I would urge anyone who has any information about Watton's whereabouts or who sees him not to approach him but to contact Cheshire Police immediately on 999. 'My concern is not only for the public at large but also for Peter himself, and I would also appeal directly to Peter Watton to make contact with the Police or present himself at the nearest Police Station.' Det Insp Simon Lonsdale said ' This is a very serious but isolated incident. I would like to reassure the public that we have a number of lines of enquiry that we are following and extra police and support officers will be patrolling the area. 'People using the area around Eaton Road and the River Dee should remain vigilant and take basic precautions such as not going to isolated areas alone and reporting anything untoward to police'. Anyone with information about the whereabouts of Peter Watton should call Cheshire Police on 999 quoting incident number 6 of 15 June, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Concerning: Dancer Yulia Solodyankina, 22, was last seen leaving a concert in Edinburgh, on Thursday, June 6 . Fears are growing for the safety of a university student who went missing after leaving a pub. Yulia Solodyankina, a Russian national, was last seen leaving a concert at the Wee Red Bar in Lauriston Place, Edinburgh, on Thursday, June 6. She left the venue after telling friends she was not feeling well. Miss Solodyankina, who is studying physics at Edinburgh University, was supposed to have been performing with dance music group Anansi but left the pub before they took the stage. The student from Moscow is then said to have been spotted on CCTV at a Tesco Extra on Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, wearing a backpack. They tried to contact Miss Solodyankina on her mobile phone, only to discover it had been switched off. Her phone and her laptop were then found in a city centre flat she shares with friends. Fellow students say her disappearance is out of character and are asking the public for information on her whereabouts. The student’s parents have flown to Edinburgh to try to help with the investigation. Third-year engineering student Antoine Dao, 21, her boyfriend of six months, said Miss Solodyankina’s parents were ‘clearly very worried’ and her father had sent a Facebook message pleading for her safe return. Mr Dao said: ‘She likes to be connected with the world at all times. This is not like her at all. The message I got from her on Friday didn’t give any indication that anything was wrong. ‘It was just general chit-chat, and she mentioned she had the gig at Musselburgh the next day and said she was getting ready for it.’ Fellow student Matthew Crisp said: ‘This is very out of character for Yulia. ‘She’s a quiet, shy person, but always considerate, very aware of other people’s feelings and she would never do anything like this. ‘She has also always seemed an intrinsically happy and well-grounded person, not someone who would disappear like this.’ Clues: Yulia last sent a text message at 2pm the day after she was last spotted but has not been seen or heard from since . Movements: The 22-year-old Edinburgh University physics student, who is from Moscow, was at the bar with fellow members of the band Anansi, in which she is a dancer, but has since disappeared . A group set up by her friends on Facebook has already received more than 1,000 ‘likes’ from fellow students. Inspector Barry Darling of Police Scotland said: ‘We know Yulia enjoys music and dance and it may be that she is at one of the many festivals which take place across the country at this time of year. ‘We appeal to Yulia, or anyone who has seen her in the past week, to contact us to let us know she is safe and well.’ An Edinburgh University spokesman said: ‘We are assisting the police in every way we can and are liaising with the student’s family as appropriate at this difficult time.’ Videos and photographs on Facebook show dancer Miss Solodyankina performing with Anansi at The Meadows Festival in Edinburgh earlier this month. Anansi describe themselves as ‘a group of drummers, dancers and fire performers, named after the trickster spider in the Ashanti tales’.","Dancer Yulia Solodyankina, 22, was last seen in Edinburgh on June 6 .

He was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where a CT scan revealed he had suffered a severe traumatic brain injury, bleeding on the brain and a broken jaw. Brzozowski, of Yarmouth, was sentenced to three years in prison at Norwich Crown Court yesterday after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm. The Polish immigrant, who has a baby, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120. But Mr Evans' mother Linda Etheridge, 50, has blasted the sentence. She said last night: 'It's disgusting. He took my son's life. 'Michael's walking round at the moment with half a skull. 'I have to take him where he wants to go. He can't go anywhere by himself.' She fears her son will never work again after the devastating assault. 'His right hand can't work at the moment but he's practising with the Xbox controller,' said Mrs Etheridge, of Yarmouth. 'He can't use a knife and fork or a pen. 'We've only just been able to get him to go out, up town. He would freak out. 'He was always out with his mates before - he liked pool and nights out.' She said Michael's memory is now so poor he could not recognise his two-year-old niece when she visited him. 'Michael is a different lad completely. The way he talks is different, his laugh is different,' she added. Happier times: Michael, at the back, pictured with his mother, Linda, stepfather Andy and his younger brother . 'He was convinced he was Batman and could jump off buildings but luckily that's passed,' said Mrs Etheridge. 'As he's got better we've had to explain things to him. When we explained how his injuries had affected him he was apologetic.' 'He remembers places he used to go and places he used to work. He used to work at a hotel in Essex and he remembers it like yesterday. But he couldn't tell you what he did yesterday.' Mr Evans was out with friends in the town centre when his group was involved in a bust-up with Brzozowski and his friends. Michael was walking away with his hands in his pockets when he was hit in the head by the amateur boxer. Brzozowski after he was arrested. Recorder Mark Dennis told the thug as he jailed him: 'It was yobbish, violent behaviour' Brzozowski, who moved here from Poland eight years ago, went home after the vicious attack, calmly got changed and was going out to a nightclub when he was arrested after police tracked him on CCTV. Mr Evans' stepfather, Andy, 60, said the last seven months since the late-night attack last November have been 'hell'. He said: 'Nobody could tell us if Michael was going to live or die. It was constant stress.' Michael is due to have a special titanium plate fitted in his skull on June 27, but his parents are taking events day by day. 'Hopefully there will be a bit more improvement then, but really they can't tell us,' said Mr Etheridge. 'It's all in the lap of the gods.' 'Michael's still struggling to walk, as he has a fused hip, and had learned a special way of coping with it before the attack.' 'He's a 28-year-old 12-year-old at the moment. 'He has no memory of the incident and he has no idea of what this guy looks like or anything. 'It's been hell,' said Mr Etheridge. 'If we weren't so strong it could have easily divided us.' Mr Etheridge attended yesterday's court hearing and has watched CCTV footage of his son being attacked. He said of Brzozowski's three-year jail term: 'It's what I expected. 'He was charged with it being GBH without intent as it was one punch. I don't think it's right, but I suppose that's the law.' Chris Youell, prosecuting, said Mr Evans nearly died from the unprovoked attack, had to have an emergency operation and spent three months in hospital. Recorder Mark Dennis told the thug as he jailed him: 'It was yobbish, violent behaviour, late at night, when in drink. 'It was a life-changing event for the victim, who will never be the same person again. 'You know how to punch and how to hurt someone, and you know the consequences of a heavy punch.' Mr Burrows said after the case: 'This is a very sensitive case with devastating effects all round. 'No-one ever minimises the level of injury or wider impact it has on the victim's family members. 'This single punch in drink will haunt Daniel for many years, if not the rest of his life.' Ross Burrows, defending, said Brzozowski 'misjudged the situation and felt threatened'. 'He threw the punch because he was trying to protect his group. His intention was to punch and run. 'It will stay with him for the rest of his life. He has not been out since and does not drink. It was a moment of madness.' Inspector Nick Cheshire, of Norfolk Police, said last night: 'This was an unprovoked attack which left an innocent man with serious head injuries, having been enjoying a night out with friends in Yarmouth. 'Brzozowski was arrested a short time later and was still drunk whilst in custody. 'The majority of people drink responsibly. But the minority who do drink to excess and behave violently or anti-socially cause a disproportionate amount of trouble and distress to the local community.'","Michael Evans nearly died after the brutal and unprovoked attack .

A young girl contracted swine flu and died two years after she was seriously injured when her father shook her, a court heard today. Benjamin Curtis, 30, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, was today jailed for two years at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey after admitting the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott, as his trial was due to begin. Curtis - who had already served 20 months in prison for assault, imposed before two-year-old Ocean died - was told by Mr Justice Nicol that the results of his shaking were ‘catastrophic’. Imprisoned: Benjamin Curtis (right), 30, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, was today jailed for two years at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey after admitting the manslaughter of Ocean Elliott (left), as his trial was due to begin . Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting, said the swine flu which killed Ocean ‘is really neither here nor there’. She told the court: ‘Whatever the organism that attacked her body would almost certainly have killed her, because her system was so affected by the neurological injuries she had sustained.’ Ms Glynn said Ocean died on August 2009 having contracted the H1N1 virus the previous month, but by that time she was already severely ill - following the shaking more than two years beforehand. In April 2007, when she was three and a half months old, she had sustained serious neurological injuries inflicted on her by her father, Ms Glynn said. These included injuries to the brain and eyes. ‘These injuries were so bad that they left Ocean disabled with severely delayed development, functionally blind and suffering from seizures (which) the doctors found difficult to control.’ She could not sit up on her own, walk or clear secretions from her respiratory system ‘which caused her to suffer from coughs, colds and pneumonia’. Ocean was aged two and a half when she died. Ocean's mother: Lisa Elliott, now 29, had started her relationship with Curtis in 2005, and there was disharmony . Ms Glynn added: ‘It is clear, and . accepted in the plea, that the shaking in 2007 was a significant . contributory factor to the cause of death.’ Curtis pleaded guilty at the start of his trial in February 2008 to assault, and jailed for 20 months. He said Ocean was crying and screaming, he lost control momentarily and shook her about four to five times back and forth. He was tired and frustrated and had no intention to cause serious harm. The judge told Curtis: ‘Like most babies, she cried. You picked her up and shook her four or five times. You may have been tired. You may have been uncertain as to how to placate Ocean. ‘You may have been cross with your partner. But none of that is any excuse whatsoever for your loss of temper and mistreatment of that baby. The results were catastrophic.’ The judge said he acknowledged that Curtis’ actions had no intentional malice to the baby. He added: ‘Consequences matter and when the consequences become the more serious they can lead, as in your case, to more serious charges.’ He would make a reduction in the sentence for the fact that Curtis had been prosecuted already for the same wrongful act. The judge said that if Curtis had . contested the present charge, he would have given him three years, but . because of Curtis’s plea of guilty, he would reduce it to two. Ms Glynn had told the court that Ocean’s mother Lisa Elliott, now 29, had started her relationship with Curtis in 2005, and there was disharmony, with each adult enduring violence from the other. Ms Elliott had signed an agreement with social services that she would not leave her daughter on her own with Curtis. But she did not comply with this, including on the evening of the assault. She left the address where they were living in Woking, Surrey, to go to bingo with a friend. Vincent Coughlin QC, defending, had told the court: ‘We accept the defendant must return to prison.’ He said it had been pointed out in a report that Curtis in 2008 had taken responsibility for his actions ‘and would do anything to turn back the clock’. Sentencing: Curtis - who had already served 20 months in prison for assault, imposed before Ocean died - was told by Mr Justice Nicol at Guildford Crown Court (pictured) that the results of his shaking were 'catastrophic' He was of low intelligence, and presented as an individual vulnerable in his own right. 'Where is the justice? Two years isn’t long enough, what will he serve, a year of that? I would have preferred five years' Lisa Elliott, Ocean’s mother . Ms . Elliott said on leaving court: ‘Where is the justice? Two years isn’t . long enough, what will he serve, a year of that? I would have preferred . five years. ‘At least then he would serve two and a half years - about the same time that Ocean had to live. She’s a child, babies cry. The only reason I left him that night was because I knew there was going to be World War Three between us, I thought by going out it might defuse it. ‘If I for one second had known that he would lay his hand on my child, I would never have left her.’","Benjamin Curtis jailed in Guildford, Surrey, after admitting manslaughter .

Steven Rea, who grabbed a drunken 14 year-old by the throat and branded him a 'horrible little individual', now faces the end of his career after he was convicted of assault . A police sergeant who grabbed a drunken 14-year-old by the throat and branded him a 'horrible little individual' faces the end of his career after he was convicted of assault. Sgt Steven Rea, 39, of Chelsfield, Kent, was caught on CCTV attacking the teenager in the custody area of Bexleyheath police station in southeast London. The Met Police officer then advised subordinate police officers who were propping up the boy: 'I tell you what - let him drop.' When the victim appeared to slump over the sergeant's desk during the incident last October 13, Rea said: 'Get off my desk, you horrible little individual.' Rea claimed he only tried to lift the teenager up but District Judge Jeremy Coleman rejected his defence after a trial at Westminster Magistrates Court. The judge said: 'In the custody suite he [the victim] was being difficult and irritating. However, he was not being violent. 'Sgt Rea decided to use shock tactics and he agrees that CCTV shows him accurately and he did this in order to gain his cooperation. 'He had lost his temper and left the neutral area behind his desk. What he did next was completely out of character.' The assault Rea then perpetrated on the boy went well beyond 'necessary force, albeit after provocation', the judge said. William Emlyn-Jones, defending, told the court: 'This finding will undoubtedly bring this career to an end.' Relatives of Rea openly wept in the gallery as the verdict was read. CCTV footage played in court showed how Rea attacked the boy as he was lying on a bench at the police station. Rea was behind his desk when he told the teenager: 'Right your [custody] clock starts now, young man'. The boy then raised his middle finger. Rea moved around his desk and shouted: 'Now you have f****** upset me, get up, stop being a p****', before picking the victim up by the throat and roughly shoving to the floor and then across the room. The boy had been arrested earlier in the night after the theft of a bottle of vodka from Iceland. Questioning Rea about the assault on October 13 last year, prosecutor Carl Kelvin asked: 'How is that compliant with your officer safety training on how to deal with people who are an unknown risk or potentially show aggression?'. 'I took a calculated risk in what I did', Rea replied. The 39-year-old custody sergeant was caught on CCTV attacking the teenager in the custody area of Bexleyheath police station in southeast London . Mr Emlyn-Jones claimed his foul language merely added 'emphasis' and did not reflect any 'anger'. Rea claimed he only tried to lift the boy, adding: 'I expected him to lift himself with my assistance.' His barrister hailed him as an 'exemplary character' and a 'public servant'. 'The use of force was not just necessary but clearly unavoidable by his [the victim's] conduct. Something had to happen - something had to be done about him. 'He couldn't couldn't be allowed to just loll about in the custody area. The only question is whether he [Rea] used reasonable force. 'All he did in fact was try and pick him up. He didn't slap him, or punch him, or kick him. 'He used - ironically - too little force rather than too much.' The judge accepted that the victim had been 'deliberately uncooperative' but said there was no doubt the sergeant's actions amounted to assault by beating. Stan Fitzpatrick, an inspector at Bexleyheath Police Station, had told the court earlier that Rea was 'a credit to my team.' 'I certainly would have him back anytime', he said. Rea was handed a six month conditional discharge and costs of £500. He denied the charge but was convicted of assault by beating. Detective Chief Superintendent Alaric Bonthron, MPS Directorate of Professional Standards said: 'The custody sergeant has responsibility for the welfare of those within the custody suite especially the young and vulnerable. 'The public has a right to expect that anyone brought into a custody suite will be treated in an appropriate manner. 'Steven Rea let everyone down when he assaulted this boy and it is right that he has been convicted at court.'","Police sergeant Steven Rea caught attacking teenager on CCTV .

"By . Keith Gladdis And Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 19:26 EST, 17 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:04 EST, 18 June 2013 . The High Street faces a new tidal wave of casino-style betting machines in bookmakers after a court kicked out a vital test case yesterday. The warning came after Newham Council - which already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street - tried to prevent gambling chain Paddy Power from opening yet another one. But a judge sided with the chain, saying there was no evidence that the outlet would attract violence, underage gambling and street drinking - despite  powerful evidence that this is already happening in and around other betting shops. The Judge has allowed Paddy Power to open another betting shop in Newham as there is no evidence that connects gambling and anti-social behaviour . Last night campaigners said the ruling would be a ‘red rag’ to other bookmakers who would take more and more councils to court and force their way on to high streets ‘up and down the country’. They said it also proved that councils were ‘powerless’ to act on behalf of their residents to end the scourge of unfettered gambling. Newham is one of the poorest boroughs in the country, and the East London-based council believes bookmakers are deliberately targeting it with the fixed-odds betting terminals, branded the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling. Each roulette-style machine allows the user to stake up to £100 a time on the spin of a virtual wheel every 20 seconds. The profusion of betting shops on England’s high streets is blamed on Tony Blair’s controversial 2005 Gambling Act, which relaxed planning rules on the opening such outlets. Last night Labour MP David Lammy, who has campaigned against the profusion of the casino machines, reacted with horror to the ruling. ‘This court case proves that councils are utterly powerless to stop themselves being overrun by betting shops, and all because of our laissez-faire approach to planning,’ he said. Newham Council already has 81 betting shops including 18 on a single street and tried to prevent gambling chain Paddy Power from opening yet another one . ‘This was a high-profile case being watched very closely and I have no doubt now that this will be a red rag to bookmakers to go for it, and take the opportunity to move into high streets up and down the country in even bigger numbers. ‘The world will look with bemusement that Britain could allow an Olympic borough to become a mini Las Vegas.’ Councillors in Newham had voted to block Paddy Power from opening a new shop at the site of a former kebab shop claiming it would attract anti-social behaviour and underage drinking. It also claimed to have evidence suggesting the primary use of the shop was for FOBTs and not traditional betting. However at an appeal against the decision at Thames Magistrates Court, district judge Paul Goldspring rejected claims that the shop would attract violence. He claimed the local authority did not have the power to turn down the application and ordered them to pay £33,900 costs. That meant the case would not be a landmark ruling that could halt the tide of betting shops opening to house FOBTs across the country. His decision yesterday came down to whether betting shops and FOBTs caused violent crime. Judge Goldspring said: ‘I find it significant the police did not object to the licence and agreed conditions.‘One would have thought, that if the concerns of the local authority were evidenced and well founded, the police would have said so then and at this appeal.’ David Lammy said that it was a travesty that the courts might force local authorities to use tax payer's money to fight gambling companies in court . Former Treasury minister Stephen Timms, the local MP for East Ham, had told the court the FOBTs ‘destroy people lives’ and the machines cause users to get angry when they lose and that violence can spill out into the high street. But the judge said his evidence was of ‘very little help’. He said: ‘While undoubtedly as MP he receives complaints about betting premises, 50 in three years of a constituency of 95,000 hardly proves his assertion.’ Speaking after the hearing, Councillor Ian Corbet from Newham said the decision underlined how little power local councils have in halting the increasing tide of betting shops. He said: ‘We have a major problem with these machines. I do agree with people who call them the crack cocaine of gambling. We will soon have the most betting shops in London, outside Westminster. ‘But this is not just a problem for us, it is a problem for the whole nation. We are not unique we are just at the extreme end of the scale.’ Mr Corbet rejected criticism by the judge for ignoring advice from the planning inspector to continue to contest the appeal. He said: ‘I don’t regret it at all. The only thing I regret is that we did not win.’ Anti FOBT campaigner Derek Webb, founder of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said the decision highlighted the weakness of the Gambling Commission. He said: ‘The Gambling Commission refused to support the Newham Council and is failing to uphold the licensing objectives of the 2005 Gambling Act, so is clearly unfit for purpose.’ Mr Lammy said: ‘It is a travesty that we are allowing Paddy Power to use their corporate might and forcing a local authority like Newham, which represents some of the poorest people in London, to use taxpayers’ money to fight them in court. ‘Because Paddy Power can afford expensive lawyers they have been successful.’ He added: ‘No one is against gambling, but these fixed-odds betting terminals are a menace and we now have a situation where boroughs like this have more betting shops than book shops. The MP for Tottenham admitted Labour had got it wrong when it relaxed gambling laws eight years ago. 'I am very clear that the Gambling Act 2005 was flawed, because it let these betting shops through the back door to saturate our high streets,’ he said. ‘Labour have accepted it was wrong but in the meantime the coalition need to act. We need to give local authorities the legal power to say: enough is enough.’ A spokeswoman for Paddy Power said: ‘Paddy Power is pleased that the judge has upheld our appeal and granted the licence. ‘We want to fund initiatives that support the local community, particularly around up-skilling, getting people into - and back into - work and social enterprise. ‘We would like to set up a meeting to discuss this with Newham Council and the local MP, Stephen Timms, to enable us to put the money to work as soon as possible.’","Newham Council tried to prevent Paddy Power opening a betting shop .

The 30-year-old Michelin star chef was horrified at forgetting to thank Jill, 65, at the reception he's tried to make it up to her by baking a humble pie. Mr Bainbridge had overcome his dyslexia to deliver the big speech word-perfect as he tied the knot with bride Katja. He thanked everyone right down to the tea lady who catered for their reception before leaving for a honeymoon in Iceland. But as he stepped onto the plane Mr Bainbridge realised what had happened. His mother helped him battle his dyslexia and supported him in his early days as he tried to make the grade as a chef.

Despite facing massive cuts and thousands of jobs being at threat, new figures show the overall spend by forces has only decreased by £1million a year since 2008. There are also concerns about safety, after Met informant Kester David, 53, was found burned to death two years ago and another force was fined for losing a memory stick containing a list of their informants. Scotland Yard has spent more than any other force in England and Wales, with its costs over five years topping £9million. Big spender: Britain's largest force, the Metropolitan Police, has splashed out £9million on snitches since 2008 . In total £25,268,798.40 has been spent by England and Wales' 43 police . forces, with more than £4million being spent on average each year. Concerns: Police informant Kester David, 53, was found burned to death under railway arches in north London two years ago . The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has today defended the practice of paying informants, or Covert Human Intelligence Sources as they are officially known, saying it is 'vital' in bringing criminals to justice. Commander Richard Martin, ACPO lead for covert human intelligence, said: 'The use of informants to assist in police investigations is one of many covert methods used to gather intelligence to aid forces in defending and protecting the public. 'Each force has a rigorous chain of command in place to ensure proper management of informants and decide appropriate levels of reward. We are looking to protect our neighbourhoods from harm and to ensure that when and where we use sources, we are tackling the serious crimes that damage our communities.' In responses to Freedom of Information requests, the forces refused to reveal how much was paid to each individual informant as it may lead to their identification.They said where an informant is identified it can endanger them. Other than the Met, West Midlands Police was the only force who spent in excess of £1million over the five year period. In total 11 forces spent more than £500,000. Warwickshire Police paid just £63,679.06 over the five years, the least out of all the forces.

Merseyside, where he has been on hunger strike for the past 13 years, . so he can 'take control' of the time and manner of his death. In a featureless room at the . high-security hospital yesterday, doctors gave evidence to a judge and . medical panel about whether Brady was psychotic or schizophrenic, or . sane enough to see out his life in jail. He sat taking almost continuous notes – . a slim, slightly hunched figure in dark glasses and a dark-coloured . jacket, with a full head of hair, grey now, but still swept back in the . teddy-boy style he sported in the early 1960s. His complexion looked . perfect on the screens that broadcast proceedings in public to the Civil . Justice Centre some 40 miles away in Manchester. At Ashworth, Brady is fed via a tube . and yesterday it was taped to the right side of his lip, leading to one . nostril, the only indication of his physical condition among all the . talk of his mental state. Yet in rare moments when he looked up . from his foolscap pad, he still had that air of menace. You had to . remind yourself that somewhere in his twisted, evil mind, the chilling . detail must still be lurking – names of every victim that he and Myra . Hindley killed: dates, method of torture, manner of death. Crucially, perhaps, he might even have . known the precise location where a 12-year-old boy, still missing half a . century later, was buried. Brady and Myra Hindley murdered five . youngsters in the 1960s. The victims were lured to their deaths, . sexually tortured and buried on the moors. Link: Proceedings are being relayed by video to Press and relatives of Brady and fellow killer Myra Hindley's victims at a court 40 miles away in Manchester . The mental health tribunal itself is taking place behind closed doors at Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside . Brady was last photographed helping police search for the remains of two of his victims on Saddleworth Moor in 1987, but has not been seen in public since their trial in 1966 . Pauline Reade, 16, vanished on her way . to a disco on July 12, 1963. John Kilbride, 12, was snatched in . November the same year. Keith Bennett was taken on June 16, 1964 after . he left home to visit his grandmother. Lesley Ann Downey, ten, was lured . from a funfair on Boxing Day, 1964. Edward Evans, 17, was killed in . October 1965. Brady was given life at Chester . Assizes in 1966 for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward. Hindley, . who died in prison in 2002 aged 60, was convicted of killing Lesley Ann . and Edward, and of shielding Brady. She was also jailed for life. In . 1987 the pair finally admitted killing Keith and Pauline. Moors murder victim Lesley Ann Downey, who was just 10 when she was sadistically murdered . But tribunal judge Robert Atherton . made it clear yesterday this was not an inquiry into Brady's crimes; nor . would he be asked the whereabouts of Keith. What quickly became apparent was that, . despite the earnest nature of the proceedings – swamped with medical . opinion and diagnosis, and peppered with specialist terms – this was the . Ian Brady show. He has fought for years to get this platform and is . expected to give evidence later. Yesterday he addressed the judge only . once, mumbling in a quiet, gravelled, voice, tinged with a Scottish . accent. He leaned over repeatedly to whisper to his lawyer – she . appeared at one stage to put her fingers to her lips to quieten him. Brady did not look at the camera once . during more than four hours but simply to appear was grandstanding . enough. This was only the second time such a hearing has opened its . doors to public scrutiny, and, in this case, to relatives or friends of . the dead. Alan Bennett, Keith's brother, watched . the hearing and afterwards accused Brady of 'attention-seeking'. On his . blog, he added: 'Brady looked fit and well which is what I expected . after being told many times over the years that he has never been . fitter, despite his farcical supposed “hunger strike”.' The hearing was described as a . 'macabre game' by David Kirwan, the solicitor who represented Keith's . mother Winnie Johnson until she died last year. The tribunal referred to the killer . throughout as 'Mr Brady' and heard arguments for and against suggestions . that he is mentally ill.

Dr Cameron Boyd, the medical member of the tribunal panel, said he met Brady last week. 'Asked if he wanted to die, he refused . to answer,' he said. Brady denied being psychotic and claimed he had . only been 'acting' when displaying such symptoms. Dr Boyd said he asked . Brady about the Moors Murders. 'He said it was an existential exercise, . personal philosophy and interpretation and in some way his behaviour was . petty compared to politicians and soldiers in relation to wars.' He said Brady believed the tribunal was not independent and its decision would be 'a political one'. Dr Adrian Grounds, a forensic . psychiatrist who examined Brady on behalf of his legal team, said . despite his behaviour, there was no evidence he was mentally ill. Brady claimed he had learned to copy symptoms of mental illness while working as a cleaner at Wormwood Scrubs prison, he said. It was 'inconceivable' that he would be sent to a secure hospital were he to be assessed today. Brady did exhibit 'delusions' and . believed staff at Ashworth  mounted 'conspiracies' against him. But this . 'paranoia' was a feature of his serious personality disorder. As Brady displayed 'hostility and . contempt' towards any attempt at therapy, there was no value in . continuing to detain him at Ashworth, Dr Grounds said.

A children's charity volunteer wrote a reference for paedophile Stuart Hall praising his charity work, a court heard today. NSPCC East Cheshire branch chairman Patricia McMillan wrote a letter of reference praising Hall's work as a charity auctioneer since 2008, his barrister Crispin Aylett QC told Preston Crown Court. It came to light as Mr Aylett put Hall's mitigation to the court, which also revealed Wigan Athletic FC chairman Dave Whelan had written Hall a reference again praising the work he had done for charity. An NSPCC spokesman later confirmed that Mrs McMillan had resigned from her role with the charity. Praise: Wigan Athletic FC chairman Dave Whelan (left) wrote a reference for Stuart Hall (right, pictured today) Mr Aylett asked the judge to carry out the sentencing with a degree of proportion, saying: ‘My task this morning is to apologise for what the defendant has done and to ask for the mercy of the court.’ ‘It is not my intention to pick a fight with all of those who have put pen to paper on the subject of the life and times of Stuart Hall.’ Victim 1: Susan Harrison, formerly Melville, who waived her right to anonymity. Met Hall aged 16 at an awards day in 1967. He later touched her under her skirt while giving her a lift home from BBC studios. Victim 2: 17-year-old who met Hall during early 1970s filming of It's A Knockout. He pushed her against a hotel door and fumbled her until she fought him off. Victim 3: Kim Parker, formerly Wright, who waived her right to anonymity. Met Hall in Blackpool in 1974 when she was 16 or 17. He touched her breasts as she worked on an exhibition stand. Victim 4: Aged 17 when she was pushed against a wall and had her breasts groped by Hall while at a family friend's house. Victim 5: A 13-year-old who met Hall at a party at the house of his family friends. She got drunk and he carried her to the bathroom where he assaulted her in a 'frenzied maul'. Victim 6: Was 15 when she met Hall as he worked on BBC North West Tonight. He kissed her in her home and on a later date approached her with a battery-powered massager which he asked to use on her private parts when she used his dressing room to get changed. Victims 7, 8 and 9: An 11-year-old, 14-year-old and another girl aged 13 or 14 who attended elocution lessons together at Hall's home. He dressed them in men's shirts and fondled them as he wore only small white underpants. Victim 10: Was aged 10 when her family was given tickets to It's A Knockout. He invited her to swim in his outdoor pool and bought her steak and champagne before fondling her in the bathroom. Victims 11 and 12: Girls aged nine and 13 who Hall knew through family friends. He indecently assaulted the younger girl as she lay half-asleep in her home. He forced the elder girl to kiss him after suddenly pulling over while taking her home from a tennis centre. Victim 13: Was aged 10 or 11 and was offered an elocution lesson by Hall at his home. He took her to his bedroom and told her to take her clothes off, where he held a tape measure around her chest as she practised saying sentences. Mr Aylett said that his client - later jailed for 15 months - had been arrested ‘as a consequence’ of the investigation into Jimmy Savile ‘who used young girls on a scale that is simply staggering’. He referred to the 1,300 complainants in that case and said: ‘Instead, in the dock today is a frightened and bewildered 83-year-old man answering for the touching - no more, no less - of all of 13, not 1,300, victims over a quarter of a century ago.’ He said many years had passed since the last offence and that Hall had led an ‘unblemished life’ over those years, doing charity work and with the support of his loving family. The barrister said the defendant had pleaded guilty and that there was ‘very little evidence’ of sexual arousal on the part of the defendant. ‘Inevitably some of the victims were . more affected than others. In the main victims appear to have kept their . undoubtedly unpleasant experiences in proportion to the actual abuse . they suffered. ‘In many . cases this appears to have manifested itself in them being revolted by . the sight or sound of the defendant on television or radio.’ Referring . to the victims who were assaulted during Hall's ‘elocution lessons’ Mr . Aylett said they had expressed a ‘degree of ambivalence in regard to . what happened to them’. He . said one victim told police the assault was ‘not a serious indecent . assault’ and she was thankful that nothing worse happened. Mr Aylett said many of the victims had . the similar ‘refrain’ in that they told police they had come forward . out of concern that the defendant may do the same to others, or . something more serious than what happened to them. The . barrister also said that many of the victims had told their parents . about the abuse at the time but that they had taken no action. He said with the exception of two of . the complainants, all the victims who were under 16 had told an adult . and none of them had contacted police or sought to take it up with the . defendant. Mr Aylett said he was not criticising ‘any of those adults’ or saying that ‘standards were different in the 70s’. But . he said it did ‘reflect on the minor nature of the abuse’ - with the . one exception of the 13-year-old girl Hall attacked in a bathroom, which . he conceded was a more serious assault. Mr . Aylett said that even at the ‘height of his fame’ Hall took the time to . write to fans, many of them ‘elderly and lonely’ and that Hall still . had the ‘love and support of his family.’ The . barrister rubbished claims in a newspaper that Hall had spent years . ‘laughing in the faces of his victims’ and said that it was Hall's . ‘celebrity’ which had brought him to the attention of the police. He said ‘but for his celebrity’ the offences ‘would never have seen the light of day.’ Distancing itself: The NSPCC (headquarters in central London pictured) said it did not supply a character reference for Stuart Hall - and the views 'were of a volunteer speaking in a personal capacity' Jailed: Veteran BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall arrives at Preston Crown Court where he was later sentenced . He . said Hall ‘brought laughter to millions’ as the presenter of It's a . Knockout and Jeux Sans Frontieres, the latter of which reached a . European TV audience of 200 million people. The . lawyer said Hall then went on to be an accomplished football reporter . on the radio renowned for his ‘linguistic craftsmanship’. He said Hall was frail and suffering from numerous health problems and had suffered from depression and anxiety since his arrest. He said Hall's comments outside magistrates' court when he said his accusers were telling ‘spurious’ and ‘pernicious lies’ were ‘ill-advised’. 'One can only begin to imagine the defendant's fear as the cell door slams shut on that first night' Crispin Aylett QC, defending Stuart Hall . Mr Aylett also criticised the probation officers who wrote the pre-sentence report, saying they ‘did not like Mr Hall’. He said: ‘One of them said, 'I hope you get five years and they take you for every penny that you've got.’' The judge called these remarks ‘disgraceful’. Mr Aylett said the nature of fame had changed over the years and that in the 60s and 70s it was a ‘different world’. He said Hall was 83 and would find prison very hard, adding: ‘One can only begin to imagine the defendant's fear as the cell door slams shut on that first night.’ The NSPCC posted the following statement on its official Twitter site: ‘We'd like to clarify that the NSPCC did not supply a character reference for Stuart Hall. ‘The views were of a volunteer speaking in a personal capacity and do not in any way reflect the views of the NSPCC.’ A spokesman for the charity later added: 'The volunteer concerned has now stood down from her role with the NSPCC. 'Our priority is, and always will be, to the victims of child abuse and we will not allow anything to get in the way of this.'","NSPCC East Cheshire branch chair Patricia McMillan wrote reference .

Sad: Mary Jukes died and was cremated without her family being informed by the care home where she was living, it has emerged . A nursing home cremated a patient and scattered her ashes without telling her son, who only found out she was dead three months later, it was revealed today. Dementia-sufferer Mary Jukes died aged 84 at Landmere Nursing Home in Wilford, Nottinghamshire, but managers failed to tell her son Stephen, 56, while he was abroad. Mr Jukes revealed it was only when he telephoned a member of staff about his mother's health that he discovered she had passed away. 'I told them: ""'I'm coming over to see my mum, how is she?"" to which she bluntly replied ""She's dead"",' he said today. Still in shock he asked for help to arrange her funeral, but they then told him they had already cremated her and disposed of her ashes. Tragically, it was her dying wish to be buried next to her late husband. Stephen, who runs a music shop, then demanded to know why he had not been informed of her death, and they told him they had lost his number. Her care plan had gone missing, which included contact details for Mary's family as well as her funeral requests which stated she wanted to be buried in a pre-paid plot next to her late husband Leslie, who died of heart failure in 2000 aged 82. Mrs Jukes passed away on February 9, 2009, they cremated her a month later without informing her family. Yesterday Stephen began fresh legal proceedings against the care home and demanded an apology from the former owners, scandal-hit Southern Cross Healthcare Plc. Distraught: Stephen Jukes, 56, (left) whose mother (right in 2003) died whilst he was out of the country for three months in a care home who failed to notify him of her death . Last wish: Mary Jukes on her ruby wedding anniversary with husband Leslie, who she wanted to be buried next to but never had the chance . Speaking for the first time since his mother's death in February 2009, Stephen said: 'My mum was a lovely woman who loved my father dearly, and always wanted to be buried next to him. 'If the care home had let us know, we could have arranged the funeral she wanted and given her the send-off she deserved. 'That nursing home is a shambles, a disaster, it should be shut down and condemned to hell. 'My mother lived a wonderful life, we are a fantastic family, but this care home has treated us worse than you would treat a dog. 'They didn't even put up a plaque, so there is nothing to remember her by whatsoever. 'When it happened I didn't sleep for days on end. It literally threw my life into turmoil. 'I can't explain it enough. I spent my whole life trying to be a good son, but now I feel I have let her down. 'Deep down I know it's not my fault, it's those heartless care home workers who are too lazy to make people aware of their relatives passing away.' Investigation: Nottinghamshire Police have also launched a probe into alleged abuse of patients at Landmere Nursing Home . Father-of-two Stephen cared for his elderly mother who lived round the corner from him in Beeston, Notts., for more than 10 years. Happy moment: Mary and Leslie on their wedding day, the couple had pre-paid for a burial plot together . He visited her every day but when her dementia worsened in 2007 doctors recommended she was moved into a nursing home for round-the-clock-care. Stephen, who has two grown-up children, said: 'It was heartbreaking for the family to move her into a nursing home because she had been so active in her life but we had no choice. 'She still got lots of visits but she was becoming less and less aware of who people were. 'When I went to Bulgaria to finish building a house I told the nursing home to call me if anything changed with my mum's condition and they promised to let me know. 'I came home in June 2009 and the next day I rang the nursing home and said to the woman who picked up . 'I couldn't believe it, she didn't say she was sorry or anything. What made matters worse was the nursing home said she'd been dead for more than three months and they had cremated her. 'I was gobsmacked, they not only failed to tell us when or even how she died but they cremated her against her wishes. 'It's appalling, they treated her like an old piece of furniture.' Mary, who worked as an executive officer for Nottingham City Council for 30 years before retiring, had her ashes scattered at Wilford Hill Crematorium. Stephen initially began legal proceedings against the nursing home but was forced to abandon them when the costs began to escalate. But he is now taking fresh proceedings against them to raise awareness of the appalling lack of respect his mother received. Distraught: Stephen Jukes called the home to ask about her mother's health because he was abroad and a staff member said: 'she's dead' He said: 'I'm not interested in the money but I want people to know they should be careful when trusting these nursing homes because some of them simply don't care about the people in them.' Following a damning report from the Care Quality Commission, Nottinghamshire County Council has terminated its contract with the home. Nottinghamshire Police have also launched a probe into alleged abuse of patients at the nursing home.","Mary Jukes died at her East Midlands care home while her son was abroad .

He was one of the party who found the frozen bodies of three of his friends and later wrote in his autobiography the horror of realising how close he came to saving them. Apsley Cherry-Garrard (right) was awarded the Polar Medal for his Antarctic efforts but was haunted by not being able to rescue his friends. He is pictured with the rescue party before the search was launched . The rare medals are expected to fetch at least £30,000 when they go under the hammer tomorrow . The young explorer's life was shadowed by his Antarctic experiences . When he returned from the Antarctic, he was awarded the Polar Medal and the Royal Geographical Society’s Scott Memorial Medal, which are now going under the hammer. They have been in the hands of a renowned collector of gallantry medals for the last 50 years and he is now selling them. Christopher . Hill, of medal specialists Dix Noonan Webb of London, said: 'Cherry-Garrard wrote a book about the expedition and called it ""The . Worst Journey in the World."" 'It completely reveals the hardship suffered and the type of character required of the men who went on these expeditions. 'It . is a sad thing in Cherry-Garrard’s case that his life was forever . shadowed by what could have been had he carried on that bit further. 'Birdie Bowers and Edward Wilson were very close friends of his and he was deeply affected by what happened.' Captain Scott, Edward Wilson, Lawrence Oates, Henry Bowers and Edgar Evans made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912, only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them to it a month before. On their return journey, the five men endured dreadful conditions and suffered from a lack of food and frostbite. Meanwhile Cherry-Garrard, who was a . member of the 11-strong support party, had been ordered to the supply . depot to re-stock it with food and was meant to meet the group after . their historic trip. However, after days of waiting he followed . orders given to him and returned north to the expedition’s headquarters . in order to spare the sledge-dogs.

Lawrence Oates died on March 16 after famously walking out of the tent to give the others a chance of survival. Scott, Edward Wilson and Henry ‘Birdie’ Bowers all died on or around March 30. PO Evans had died on February 17. Eight . months later, at the end of the Antarctic spring, Cherry-Garrard was a . member of the search party that went out and found the three men dead in . their tent alongside their diaries.

Cherry-Garrard was a 24-year-old zoologist and went on the expedition to help gather penguin eggs.

'It is evident that he has suffered most severely - but Wilson tells me that his spirit never wavered for a moment.' Cherry-Garrard's collection of 27 letters he sent home from the South Pole went under the hammer with a guide price of £80,000 in October. In them he wrote: 'We have found the bodies of Scott, Wilson & Bowers, and all their records... Their death was, I am quite sure, not a painful one – for men get callous after a period of great hardship – but the long fight before must have been most terrible.'

A teacher who had sex with a 'damaged' 15-year-old schoolgirl and streamed the sickening footage on the internet has been jailed. William Hanna, 63, and his girlfriend Diane Whitehouse, 58, 'degraded' their young victim in the sordid sessions they held in a Birmingham hotel room, a court was told. The couple, who said they thought the teenager was 18, met the schoolgirl online and used web cameras to stream the encounters. A third man, Ian McGlasson, was also jailed for holding bondage sex sessions with the same victim. Jailed: William Hanna, 63, (left) and Diane Whitehouse, 58, (right) who held sordid sex sessions with the 15-year-old victim in a Birmingham hotel room. They claimed they thought she was 18 . Hanna - who was working as a teacher when he was arrested - was given seven years behind while his girlfriend, who he met on a swingers' website, was locked up for six years behind bars by a judge at Birmingham Crown Court. The victim's mother discovered the abuse in 2010 after McGlasson, 47, sent her a Facebook . message in which he claimed to be her daughter's boyfriend. She said she was haunted by seeing sickening images of her 'brainwashed' daughter online. Nicholas . Cartwright, prosecuting, said that Hanna and Whitehouse filmed the . encounters with the victim at the Etap hotel in Birmingham. Bondage sessions: Ian McGlasson, 47, was also jailed for having sex with the vulnerable underage girl . On one occasion, the court heard a stranger appeared in the room, dressed in a cat suit, and had sex with the 15-year-old. The teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was not a pupil at the school where Hanna taught. Mr Cartwright said McGlasson also had sex with another 15-year-old girl. Speaking after the case, the victim's mother said: 'I could not believe it. He was older than my own husband. I tried to get my daughter to . go to the police, but she had been brainwashed good and proper. 'I spoke . to the police and I would do it again in an instant. I found some of the pictures from the hotel room online and it was horrendous. 'That has damaged me forever. It's . awful to know that it's your child when you recognise a mole on a . stomach and a charm on a necklace. 'I am glad they were handed proper . jail sentences, but I wish it had been for longer. It will never be over . for us. We have to live with this every day. 'I will always be paranoid and it has permanently damaged my daughter and our family.' The victim's mother only discovered that Hanna had been a teacher during the court hearing. She added: 'I just can't believe that . he had been teaching when all this was going on. They read out glowing . references, but he was doing these vile things. 'They sat shaking their heads . throughout and tried to say they thought she was 18, but there was no . disguising my daughter's age. 'Her Facebook had pictures of her in her school uniform. These people are in their late 40s, . 50s and 60s. I just hope that, if anybody else has been a victim of them . in the past, they have the bravery to come forward and speak to the . police. 'I was terrified to go to court and . face them. But I had to show that my daughter had a mother and there was . no way I was hiding from them.' Passing . sentence, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said Hanna and Whitehouse had taken . advantage of an 'intensely troubled and damaged child' and 'relished' her young age. He told . them: 'You treated her not as a damaged child who needed protection, but . as somebody who could be simply used as you wished.

'You involved her in sexual activity which must have had the effect of damaging her even further.' Of the live streaming, the judge said: . 'In addition to the degradation of that child, she knows an unknown . number of people have had the opportunity to view that degradation.' Sally Hancox, mitigating for Hanna, said the court case was a 'terrible legacy' for the final years of his teaching career. Andrew Baker, mitigating for . Whitehouse, said she had not been the prime mover and had only been . involved in two of the four occasions sexual activity took place. Former Frankley Community High School teacher Hanna, of Birmingham, was found guilty of inciting a child to be involved in pornography and three charges of sexual activity with a child. Whitehouse, of Cannock, Staffordshire, was convicted of two charges of sexual activity with a chold. McGlasson, of Reading, was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions. He admitted six charges of sexual activity with a child, two of meeting a child following grooming and possessing and taking indecent images. All three defendants were also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council, speaking on behalf of Frankley Community High School, said: 'William Hanna was arrested at his workplace in November 2010 and suspended on the same day.

Yesterday Middleton was sentenced after pleading guilty to causing an . explosion likely to endanger life or injure property under Explosive . Substances Act 1883. Middleton made the pipe bomb in January this year and hit it 10 times until it exploded. He dialled 999 before running from the housing association property that he shared with his fiancee in Bolton, Greater Manchester. He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital . where he was treated for injuries to his left hand and underwent . extensive plastic surgery. His hand will never function normally again. Previously, Middleton had posted a pencil drawing of a tattoo design that he wanted, depicting an exploding bomb with the word 'kaboom' in the middle, on his Facebook page. Bomb disposal experts were sent to the scene after Middleton exploded the pipe bomb . But he told friends: 'mum wont let me have a pipe bomb on my arm i get it done'. About 40 homes had to be evacuated . while police and bomb disposal teams searched the area. Miss Emerson told police she heard a loud bang and saw a flash before seeing Middleton running out of the back door and his hand was pouring with blood. When he was arrested Middleton said he often made the £10 bombs because he got a 'thrill' out of it. Judge Timothy . Stead, sitting at Bolton Crown Court, told Middleton : 'You have caused yourself permanent pain, . disfigurement and disability, but mercifully no physical harm to anyone . else. 'I think you do now know how dangerous your actions were. If you haven't learned your lesson, you never will. About 40 homes in Lea Gate, Bolton, had to be evacuated after Middleton exploded the bomb . 'I'm . told you have learned your lesson and the evidence seems to suggest . that's so. You have suffered because of your own actions and I make some . reductions to allow for that.' One woman eye witness to the incident said she saw him run out with blood pouring from his hand. She said: 'I saw a man slumped over the fence clutching his arm with his hand virtually hanging off. It looked really bad and he looked very pale.' Middleton was also ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge.","Martin Middleton lost several fingers after hitting the bomb with a hammer .

A steep rise in the number of whiplash claims in the UK adds around £90 to the average insurance policy and has led to Britain being dubbed the 'whiplash capital of the world'. There are some 1,500 whiplash claims in the UK every day and insurers have warned the Government that the cost of car insurance will only fall if an independent medical panel is set up to assess injuries and make it easier for firms to challenge claims. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has told the House of Commons Transport Committee that the motor insurance industry paid out £10.7 billion in claims in 2011, of which whiplash claims cost around £2.2 billion. Compensation culture: An increasing number of insurance claims has seen Britain dubbed the 'whiplash capital of the world' and insurance premiums are on the rise . The ABI said that while there were a number of factors that affected the price of a premium, and individual insurers priced their policies differently, the cost of claims was highly indicative of the overall level of premium that an average motorist can expect to pay. It added that the average paid premium in 2011 was £440. With whiplash claims representing 20 per cent of overall claims expenditure, or £90 of the average premium. The ABI said in its written evidence: 'There are a number of contributing factors that have led to the rise in whiplash claims. 'The first factor is the dysfunctional compensation system which has led to a growing compensation culture in the UK. Costly: Whiplash claims add an average of £90 to car insurance premiums according to the Association of British Insurers . 'Aggressive marketing by claims management companies and referral fees paid by claimant solicitors (banned from April 1 this year), have led to an increasing number of personal injury claims in general, and whiplash claims specifically.' Answering in its written evidence the question: 'Is it correct in describing Great Britain as the ""whiplash capital of the world?""', the ABI replied: 'Yes'. It went on: 'Although the lack of an objective test for minor whiplash injuries is an international problem, it is the UK’s civil litigation system and wider compensation culture which has led to the steep rise in whiplash claims in recent years.' High claims: The UK still has substantially higher than average percentage of whiplash claims as a proportion of personal injury claims, than its EU counterparts . The ABI added that little had changed since 2004 when Europe-wide research showed that the UK had twice the average percentage of whiplash claims as a proportion of personal injury claims compared with the European average. It added that latest figures show that 'the UK still has substantially higher than average percentage of whiplash claims as a proportion of personal injury claims, than our EU counterparts'. The Government has proposed creating a panel of medical experts to oversee accident claims. It also wants to make it easier for firms to challenge claims by raising the threshold of claims in the small claims court from £1,000 to £5,000.","There are 1,500 whiplash claims in the UK everyday say insurers .

No laughing matter: In an interview with Radio Times, comedian Barry Cryer has criticised today's 'homophobic' and 'unbeleivable' sitcoms . Comedian Barry Cryer has criticised today's sitcoms for lacking believable characters and claims that modern comedy writing is 'no laughing matter'. Mr Cryer, 79, said that writers had forgotten how to create people who viewers could identify with and wrongly focused on making jokes. In an interview with Radio Times magazine, Mr Cryer said that sitcom writing has 'gone back at least 30 years' in its current format. Criticising current shows such as ITV1's Vicious, starring Sir Ian McKellan, he said: 'We're living in an era of back-to-basics sitcoms and it's no laughing matter. 'From Vicious to Mrs Brown's Boys to The Wright Way, the old-fashioned situation comedy is suddenly all the rage again. 'It's a serious business writing comedy. You don't necessarily need funny lines all the time. 'The key is to create characters. Characters people can identify with. But right now we've gone back at least 30 years in terms of format.' Cryer, who penned jokes for the likes of Tommy Cooper, Les Dawson, and Morecambe and Wise, said that ITV sitcom Vicious, about a bickering gay couple, should have been 'fantastic' thanks to 'two great actors' in Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Derek Jacobi. But instead he said that the sitcom is 'homophobic'. He told the magazine: 'But it was insult, insult, insult every other line. You don't believe in them. You don't like them, for a start. 'It was positively homophobic. It made John Inman look restrained.' Criticism: Barry Cryer is not a fan of ITV1's Vicious which is 'an insult' despite starring 'two great actors' in Sir Ian McKellan, left, and Derek Jacobi, right . Not a fan: Mr Cryer claims that comedies like Mrs Brown's Boys, pictured, have taken comedy 'back to basics' Impressed: Miranda is one of the few comedies singled out for praise by Barry Cryer . He added: 'The great sitcom writers of the past didn't think jokes were remotely important. Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who wrote Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe and Son, knew that instinctively. 'Johnny Speight who created Alf Garnett never did jokes; he just wrote great characters. And for immaculate writing it would be hard to beat Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais's Porridge. 'That show had a great gallery of characters and not a duff moment in any episode. That's it. Great characters trapped in a situation.' The I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue panellist said that he rated BBC1 sitcom Miranda and the second series of Rev. He added: 'We will laugh again soon...It's straightforward stuff: character, character, character. You don't need jokes, you don't need funny lines.

She added: 'I heard rumours that he had been spiked, that it had been put in his drink. I heard that a day or two after it happened, and that it happened before he got to the flat. 'I think he might have tried to climb down to the lower balcony.'

A plumber has built what he himself admits is probably the most dangerous bicycle in the world, powered by a homemade jet engine, which can achieve speeds of 50mph. Colin Furze, who already holds three Guinness World Record titles for his inventions, including the world's fastest mobility scooter, modified his friend's mother's old Rayleigh pushbike. The 32-year-old, who has nicknamed the modified bicycle Norah after her, attached a jet engine to the back and extended the frame so the rider is supposedly a ‘safe’ distance away from the heat generated by it. Worlds most dangerous bike: as this picture shows Mr Furze's new jet powered bike is anything but safe . But as the picture below shows neither . Mr Furze nor his friends are wearing safety clothes or equipment and at . one point come very close to blowing themselves up. The British inventor is well known online for his outrageous, and often dangerous stunts. He . last achieved notoriety when he debuted his gas powered 53mph pram last . year, shortly after becoming a father for the first time. The video of him testing that invention, fortunately not with his newborn baby inside the pram, gained over 1.4 million . views. Mr Furze also features on Sky TV's Gadget Geeks and gained . his first Guinness world record for making the world's largest bonfire . in 2006. He spent four months working on the bicycle, before testing it out in a local airfield.

Remodelled: Colin Furze took four months to build hid bike extending it at the back to protect riders from the heat generated by the jets but still extremely close to the gas canister holding the fuel . The pulse jet uses the same technology as the V1 Doodlebug bombs, used during the Second World War. ‘This is my craziest creation yet and the scariest one to ride,"" said Colin, from Stamford, Lincolnshire, ‘Mr Furze admitted. ‘My . friend's mum was throwing out her bicycle, which she had ridden into . town every day and loved so I decided to give it a new life. ‘I . had to lengthen the frame by about a metre as the heat the jet engine . chucks out is immense and I didn't want to be sitting on top of it. ‘It's . quite pleasant to ride at speeds of up to 35mph but after 40mph it is . very shaky and extremely difficult to control.

David Cameron once famously voiced his disgust at the incessant use of Twitter in a 2009 radio interview, but that hasn't stopped the word 'tweet' officially entering the English language. 'Tweet' - to post a message to Twitter - has been included in the hallowed pages of the Oxford English Dictionary. Although the word 'tweet' is already in the OED in relation to bird song, it now has an additional official definition in the June 2013 edition. 'Tweet', as relating to micro-blogging site Twitter, is now an official word, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, although oddly 'retweet' (sharing another's tweet) was included in 2011 . Look the other way: Twitter is so popular editors of the OED broke their ten-year rule to include it in the June 2013 edition . Twitter is an online phenomenon, with 340 million tweets posted every day. Even the Pope, known as the voice of God, and the Dalai Lama have Twitter feeds. Because Twitter has become such an . important part of daily life in such a short space of time, the . dictionary's editors were willing to bend their own rules to include 'tweet' in the OED, the accepted authority on the evolution of the English language. John Simpson, chief editor, said: 'The noun and verb tweet (in the social-networking sense) has just been added to the OED. 'This breaks at least one OED rule, namely that a new word needs to be current for ten years before consideration for inclusion.' Justin Bieber - 40,527,096 followers . Lady Gaga - 38,313,777 followers . Katy Perry - 37,924,271 followers . Barack Obama - 32,819,023 followers . Rihanna - 30,041,865 followers . Taylor Swift - 29,302,825 followers . YouTube - 29,137,313 followers . Britney Spears - 28,133,826 followers . Justin Timberlake - 21,564,556 followers . Instagram - 21,384,076 followers . He added: 'But it seems to be catching on.' Interestingly the OED had already added 'retweet' (sharing another's tweet) as far back as 2011. 'Tweet' is just one of a number of technology words that will also enter the June 2013 edition, including big data, crowdsourcing, e-reader, mouseover, redirect (the noun), and stream (the verb). A slightly more oddball entry is the phrase 'to have a cow'. The American slang term meaning, ‘to have a fit’, is often associated with the character Bart from the animated series The Simpsons, but the phrase actually dates back to 1959. Mr Cameron was forced to apologise after he used the word 't***' during a breakfast radio show interview. When Absolute Radio host Christian O'Connell asked him about his views on Twitter, the Tory leader said: 'The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it – too many twits might make a t***.' The power of Twitter has even helped shaped the U.S. elections. Barack Obama, Twitter's third most-followed person, and his administration used it to rally voters and defend his reign as president in the 2012 election. He famously posted a picture of himself embracing First Lady Michelle Obama with the words 'Four more years' after he won. In December Pope Benedict XVI, using the papal account 'Pontifex', sent his first tweet. It read: 'Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart.' Twitter is an online social networking service and microblogging service that enables its users to send and read text-based messages of up to 140 characters, known as 'tweets'. Twitter was launched in July 2006 by entrepreneur Jack Dorsey and rapidly gained worldwide popularity, with over 500 million registered users as of 2012. Roughly 340 million tweets are posted daily and Twitter handles more than 1.6 billion search queries per day. Since its launch, Twitter has become one of the ten most visited websites on the Internet. It is based in San Francisco.","Editors of lauded dictionary include new word definition in 2013 edition .

It is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the British sporting calendar and last year attracted record crowds. But it looks as though the stands at next Sunday's British Grand Prix may be a little more sparsely populated with attendance figures expected to fall dramatically. Even hardened Formula One fans are thought to be put off by ever-increasing ticket prices. The cheapest tickets for the Silverstone race start at £145 and sources have said that sales this year 'aren't all that strong', according to The Independent. Drama: Fernando Alonso (red car) is chased down by eventual winner Mark Webber in front of packed stands at last year's British Grand Prix. Attendances are expected to drop this year due to high ticket prices . Big occasion: Last year's winner Mark Webber is pictured celebrating after he took the chequered flag at Silverstone . Yesterday, Silverstone's website showed that just a third of 33 ticket categories have sold out so far with only races in Abu Dhabi and Brazil more expensively priced than their British counterpart. Last year's British Grand Prix, won by Australian driver Mark Webber, saw a record 127,000 attendance pack the spectator areas. As many as 30,000 others who had tickets were reportedly told to stay away after torrential rain turned car parks into mudbaths worthy of Glastonbury music festival and saw surrounding roads struggling to cope with the sheer weight of traffic attending the event. Race organisers have spent money improving non-tarmacked car parks and invested in better public transport provisions to the venue such as park and ride. Bad experience: Many spectators were told to stay away from last year's event after torrential rain left car parks and paths more like a Glastonbury mudbath than a Grand Prix . No show: Although race organisers have spent money improving the track's non-tarmacked car parks, it looks as though less spectators will turn up this year anyway . But with ticket sales at an apparently disappointing level, it looks as though their efforts may have been in vain. A spokesman for Silverstone told The Independent: 'We had record crowds in 2011 and 2012 and during our initial sales period for this year's event ticket sales were not as strong, however they have picked up significantly in the last six to eight weeks and we are pleased to announce that although the crowd will not be as big as last years it will still be one of our biggest of recent years. 'There are a number of influencing factors ranging from the current economic climate through to what is going on in the championship - British drivers on the podium always have a positive impact on ticket sales. Billionaire: Ticket prices are high because television revenue and sponsorship money goes to Bernie Ecclestone's company F1 Group . 'Thirdly, there is no doubt that some people came last year, got soaking wet and didn't have a good experience.' Tickets to the WImbledon men's final, the Grand National and last month's Champions League football final at Wembley stadium are all less than the cheapest ticket at the British Grand Prix. The high ticket prices have also been attributed to the sport's unusual source of revenue. Television rights, advertising and hoarding sales and corporate hospitality money all goes straight into the pocket of the sport's rights holder F1 Group, which is owned by Bernie Ecclestone. Therefore, ticket sales is the only way that venues make any money from the sport - barely enough to break even when the annual hosting fee is taken into account. Unlike races in other countries, the British Grand Prix is not afforded the luxury of any Government subsidies. Ticket prices have risen more than 40 per cent for the British Grand Prix since Silverstone signed a new contract to host the annual spectacle for another 17 years in 2009. But a contractual clause with Mr Ecclestone's company, which sees the hosting price go up by five per cent each year, sees organisers left with no choice but to raise ticket prices.","The cheapest seats at Silverstone next Sunday will cost fans £145 .

'I'm happy, I'm so happy he's okay. I was so worried about him,' Jonathan's mother, Cherry King, told KATU News after hearing he was found. 'We haven't talked to him yet. They put him in holding so they can make sure he stays where he's at until we come and get him.'

Map: Jonathan Marshall King was found 700 miles from where he went missing, equivalent to an 11-hour car ride . As of Sunday night, local police said there are no details on how the boy managed to get to Great Falls from his hometown in Gresham, which is over 700 miles away and over an 11-hour car trip. Jonathan apparently hitchhiked to Montana to be with his 14-year-old sister, who was staying in Great Falls with a cousin, KATU News reported. Though she didn't know he was coming, Jonathan told his sister he had plans to run away. 'A couple of weeks ago, he told his sister that he wanted to run away downtown, but he was having some problems and he'd been meeting with the bishop and he felt better,' his mother told KPTV. Great Falls police called local police in Gresham at 7 p.m. Sunday night to report the boy had been found. The Kings first reported Jonathan as a runaway to police the previous Tuesday when they got a call from officials at Gordon Russell Middle School saying he hadn't shown up for class. Before going missing, Jonathan's parents last saw him when he left home at 8:45 a.m. and began the one mile walk to school. Search: Jonathan Marshall King's parents, pictured, believed he had run away from home . Help: Before he was found, Jonathan Marshall King's family distributed fliers around Gresham, Ore. 'Somethings not right. He's always on time,' Jonathan's father Jason King told KATU before he was found Sunday. 'He's always been on time.' Jonathan's parents distributed hundreds of fliers and spoke to his friends in the days he was missing. 'I'm scared. I'm scared that something happened to him,' his mother told KATU. At first, they believed he had runaway, but after several days with no news, Jonathan's parents questioned their rush to judgement. 'We realized we probably made a mistake. We went through his clothes and realized none of them were missing,' his mother said. Plea: Before he was found, Jonathan Marshall King's mother, Cherry King, asked her son to come home. 'If we did anything to make you mad we're sorry,' she told KATU . Police also believed Jonathan ran away at first because some items were missing from his room, according to The Oregonian—though he didn't have a history of this type of behavior. His father thought the worst. 'I'm worried he tried talking to somebody or somebody had seen him on the way to school and coerced him to a car or vehicle or something,' he told KATU. Jonathan's mother pleaded to her son to KATU the day before he was found safe. 'Please come home and if we did anything to make you mad we're sorry,' she said Saturday, crying. 'We don't want you to get hurt.'","Jonathan Marshall King, 13, was reported as a runaway on June 11 .

Photographer Stephen Webber, 41, deceived Laura Chapman, 26, after she contacted him in a bid to further her modelling career. He told her that she was going to be recruited by MI5 and a Russian hitman called 'Efjania' had been instructed to assassinate her. Webber even claimed they had both been infected with a killer virus. Miss Chapman was so terrified that she stayed with Webber for a week as they moved between various hotels along the south coast of England, sparking a huge police hunt. As the lies became more unbelievable, she realised she was in a dangerous situation and wrote a 'goodbye' letter to her family. They were eventually traced to Eastbourne, East Sussex, and her first words to officers were: 'Are you police? Am I safe?'. Webber was convicted of kidnap, causing grievous bodily harm, making threats to kill and criminal damage at Hove Crown Court and jailed for nine years. Richard Barton, prosecuting, described the case as 'kidnapping by fraud' and said Webber was 'intelligent and plausible'. The court heard how Miss Chapman contacted Webber in July last year to discuss some modelling shots. During the time she then modelled for him, over several months, he instilled a sense of paranoia in her. Eventually, he told her she was going to be recruited by MI5 and made her watch the television programme Spooks about spies as the beginning of her 'training'. Over the next six days, he took her to a string of hotels, telling her a series of increasingly elaborate lies. Unable to escape and fearing for her life, Miss Chapman tried to keep Webber calm as she did not want him to hurt her. As Webber's (right) lies became more unbelievable, Laura Chapman (left) realised she was in a dangerous situation and wrote a 'goodbye' letter to her family . Mr Barton said Webber twice stabbed Miss . Chapman, so she suffered scratches, tried to strangle her, pushed her . and lied to her boyfriend and family. Webber also frequently staged imaginary conversations on the phone with contacts at MI5. 'He talked about ""shooting to kill"",' said Mr Barton. 'He collapsed on the ground in shock on hearing that colleagues had been killed. She was terrified. 'He took her phone and bank card. He was in control.' The pair were in Eastbourne discussing a plan to fake Miss Chapman's death and send the photographs to Efjania when they heard police sirens. Mr Barton said Miss Chapman's first words were: 'Are you police? Am I safe? Why have you not found me until now? I have not slept for five days.' After the sentencing, Detective Inspector Mick Jones said: 'Stephen Webber is clearly a dangerous individual whose deceit and manipulation led a vulnerable young woman into believing that he was a spy for MI5 and that they were both in life-threatening danger. 'This led to the victim being too frightened to leave him over a five-day period in which they travelled to Eastbourne, staying in local accommodation whilst their alleged pursuers hunted for them. 'The victim was so fearful of the situation presented by Webber that she was too afraid to attempt to escape.'","Laura Chapman contacted photographer Stephen Webber for her career .

A couple who drove 270 miles across Britain to catch a 20-hour cross-Channel ferry to Spain ended up on a tiny ten-minute commuter boat instead after following their sat-nav. Pensioners Bob and Pat Banks had booked themselves on the £100million Pont Aven from Plymouth to Santander in Northern Spain but then got stuck on the nearby Torpoint ferry after a wrong turn. They were due to join 2,400 holidaymakers on the overnight crossing on the huge Brittany Ferries' flagship, but accidentally took a boat which held 70 cars and ferried them to Cornwall for £1.50. Lost: Bob and Pat Banks, pictured on their holiday after eventually making it to Spain, despite taking a ferry to Cornwall when they followed their sat-nav . Map: After missing their turning at the end of their long journey from Leeds, they ended up crossing an estuary to Cornwall, not to Spain . The couple had made it safely their home in Leeds to Plymouth - and drove straight onto the Torpoint ferry instead which takes just ten minutes to cross the River Tamar. Mr and Mrs Banks quickly realised their mistake - blamed on their satnav - when they found themselves trapped among 70 cars on the local crossing. And instead of seeing the shores of Spain they were greeted by the sight of Cornwall. The embarrassed couple, who are in their mid-seventies, explained what had happened to staff on the Torpoint ferry. Target: The Banks family were heading for the Brittany Ferries ship, Pont Aven, but took a wrong turn . Spot the difference: Instead the couple took the Torpoint Ferry, which helps drivers cross the River Tamar for £1.50 . They radioed the nearby continental ferry port as they took them straight back to Plymouth on the return crossing. The couple, who split their time between Leeds and Alicante, were then fast-tracked onto the right ferry just in the nick of time for their crossing. 'We'd had some hold-ups on the drive down and got to Plymouth only 40 minutes before the departure,' Mr Banks said. 'So we were more than relieved when our sat nav announced that we had reached our destination. 'On joining one of the queues we were then ushered on to the ferry. 'When the truth dawned on us we had to accept the worst. It was impossible to drive off - we were jammed in. 'Feeling very embarrassed I got out of the car and explained the situation to the attendant. 'Expecting him to take one look at us and think that we were a couple of confused old codgers, we are in our mid-seventies, I would never have believed the response.' Where it went wrong: This sign shows that the Banks should have turned left for their ferry, but instead went straight on . Bob and Pat were allowed to straight on and off in Cornwall and then taken back to Plymouth where they were let off first. A Good Samaritan driver then volunteered to guide them the right ferry which they boarded just in time for their 20-hour overnight crossing. Bob added: 'We'll be forever grateful for the kindness shown by a gentleman in the adjacent queue who we happened to speak to. 'I told him of our hopeless situation and he at once asked if we knew our way to the ferry. 'He said that if we waited for him once we were off then he would lead us there. 'We arrived by the skin of our teeth and were the last car to board. 'Our good Samaritan just turned around and waved to us, not waiting for any thanks for what seemed like a miracle to us.' Help! The couple got trapped on the ferry to Cornwall but staff radioed the main ferry port to hold the ferry to Spain . The Torpoint ferry is a car and pedestrian ferry connecting Devon to east Cornwall. The service was established in 1791 and three chain operated ferries costing around £5million each are currently in service. Each can carry 73 vehicles and operates using its own slipways and parallel chains across the busy River Tamar. It is dwarfed by the German-built Pont Aven, which has been sailing for Brittany Ferries since March 2004. It vessel boasts a spa, swimming pool, cinema and luxury boutiques. Guests stay in in 652 spacious cabins and can unwind in six different bars and restaurants, including a swanky cocktail lounge. In comparison amenities on the Torpoint Ferry include several slot machines and a vending machine dispensing coffees, teas and chocolate bars. Torpoint Ferry bosses said they were more than happy to help out Bob and Pat - who were not the first holidaymakers to find themselves on the wrong crossing. Manager Rod Sugden said: 'Believe it or not it's not the first time, sat navs tend to lead you to the Torpoint ferry rather than the Channel ferry port.'

"By . Christopher Wilson . PUBLISHED: . 19:25 EST, 17 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:25 EST, 17 June 2013 . Feathered friend: The Viscount circa 1935, with Blue Boy the macaw perched on his shoulder at a garden party at Tredegar House . He was one of the richest peers of the realm, a multi-millionaire with such a stash of inherited wealth he never needed to think about working. But Evan, Viscount Tredegar, was more than your average spoilt aristocrat — he was one of the most riotously outrageous and toxic eccentrics ever to emerge from the English upper classes. He studied for the priesthood, but practised black magic and befriended sinister occultist Aleister Crowley. Even though he married an English actress and a Russian princess, he was a promiscuous homosexual. He wrote poetry and dressed like Shelley, yet he was so juvenile that he trained his parrot Blue Boy to climb the inside of his trouser-leg and pop its head out of his flies. The bizarre viscount even ran a homing-pigeon scheme for military intelligence during World War II, but was court-martialled for revealing its secrets to two Girl Guides. And all around him, as he made his wayward path through life, friends had the mysterious habit of dying. ‘His friendship was a kind of curse,’ says William Cross, author of a new biography of the Welsh peer. Evan Tredegar became a figure of horrified fascination to High Society Britain in the Twenties and Thirties as he pursued his twin lusts — higher learning and sex. What else would you expect from a man whose mother believed herself to be a kingfisher and built bird’s nests big enough to sit in? The dystopian world that Evan Frederic Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar, built for himself was only made possible by colossal wealth. When he came of age, the vast Welsh estate his family had owned since the 14th century was bringing in the equivalent of £65,000 a day — or £24 million a year. Early life: Evan Morgan pictured with his father, the then Viscount Tredegar, when he was a 2nd Lieutenant in the Welsh Guards . Home was Tredegar House, a ghostly, depressingly ugly pile near Newport in South Wales. Evan’s father had made himself useful during the First World War by handing over his private yacht to the Royal Navy — on condition that he was appointed its captain. Money rather than service bought the gold braid with which he festooned himself — so while he was still a schoolboy, Evan learned that a title, and colossal wealth, could get you anything you wanted. At Eton, he forged the friendships that were to shape his screwball life. His best friend Peter Churchill, a cousin of Winston, spent part of his childhood in North Africa and claimed to have sold sexual favours to men in return for pocket-money. W  hile still at Eton the pair became pageboys to the royal court at Windsor at a time when, author Cross claims, ‘mothers of vulnerable sons were known to insist their cherished boys steer well clear of the well-known paedophiles at court’. But it was too late — both boys had already acquired a preference for their own sex, and before long Evan was kicked out of Eton under the inevitable cloud. It further counted against him that while at school he had created a circle of black-magic enthusiasts. Inspired by Peter Churchill’s tales from North Africa of temples, casbahs, souks and arcades where magicians and tricksters plied their trade, the boys dabbled in rites and rituals which were to become a central part of Evan’s life. With no need to work, Evan settled on becoming a poet. The first timer: Despite never hiding his homosexuality and having a constant string of illicit affairs, Viscount Tredegar married Viscountess Lois Sturt in 1928 . Moving in the arty circle centred on the bohemian Cafe Royal in London, he became friends with the painter Augustus John and the writer Ronald Firbank, a dandy with red-lacquered fingernails. During this period Evan developed a taste for partying and buying sex from working-class rent boys. The viscount was no looker — Virginia Woolf described him as ‘a little red absurdity with a beak of a nose, no chin, and with the general likeness of a callow but student bantam cock that has run to seed’. And in the helter-skelter world of Britain after World War I, filled with flappers and cocktails and drug addicts, Evan was constantly in search of newer, darker, sensations. He was fatally attracted to dangerous people. The occultist Aleister Crowley was known to society as ‘the wickedest man in the world’ and in the Twenties people were genuinely terrified by the mention of his name — a byword for all that was mad, bad and dangerous to know. Born the son of a brewer in Leamington . Spa, Crowley, who called himself ‘The Great Beast 666’, had built up a . terrifying reputation as a disciple of the Devil. His stated purpose was to destroy the country’s religious and spiritual equilibrium. Number two: Princess Olga Sergievna Dolgorouky became Viscout Evan Tredegar's second wife . Little wonder then that the vicious Viscount, with his schoolboy dabblings in the occult, should hasten to Crowley’s side — the pair met for the first time in Paris. Later Crowley went to stay at Tredegar House where Evan proudly revealed his Black Magick room — ‘far greater than I thought!’ marvelled Crowley. Despite his ostentatiously weird life — in his garden he kept a boxing kangaroo, a honey bear and a baboon, while in his bed he kept rabbits — Evan Morgan was still considered by ambitious mothers to be one of the country’s most eligible bachelors. Only when girls got close to him did they realise how completely impossible life at Tredegar House would be. However, Lois Sturt, daughter of the land-rich Lord Alington, was not so choosy. She had some of the same madness that infected Evan Tredegar and a whole swathe of the post-war Bright Young People. Needy, nervy, self-centred and eccentric, she was also pretty, sexy and willing to overlook Evan’s homosexuality.They married when she was 28 and he 35. But it was doomed from the start. Lois had already developed an addiction to drugs which would kill her before long. When they married in Knightsbridge, the crowds had to be held back by police, but the high-society union between Lois and Evan was not what it seemed. Each agreed the other could sleep with whom they pleased as long as it didn’t interfere with their life together. But Evan’s relentless all-male promiscuity and his love of rent boys soon rattled Lois, and before long they parted. Later . he married the shapely Princess Olga Sergievna Dolgorouky, a refugee . scarred by her escape from the Russian Revolution, but otherwise an . innocent abroad. The marriage was annulled, unsurprisingly, on the grounds of his non-consummation after three years. Evan showed far greater devotion to his menagerie at Tredegar than he did to either of his wives. Easy life: Lord Tredegar, pictured at Tredegar Park near Newport with writer H G Wells, could live comfortably off his estate which brought in £24million per year . Birds were a big part of his life. His Australian parrot, though described by Evan as ‘witless and uncontrollable’, was nothing of the sort. After teaching it the trick of crawling up the inside of his trouser leg and poking its head out of his flies, the Viscount promptly walked into the Cafe Royal and performed the routine in front of a packed house. One of the onlookers recorded that ‘the effect on old ladies present can be imagined’. Periodically, Evan would decide that he must do something serious with his life. When war was declared in 1939, he managed to get himself taken on by MI14, the secret service department detailed to handle carrier pigeons bringing back messages from frontline troops in France. So unused was he to the discipline which goes with military work, that he let two Girl Guides look at the map used to plan the 1942 Allied attack on  Dieppe — which, coincidentally, turned out to be one of the war’s greatest military disasters. Such was the horror of superior . officers when they learned that he had divulged highly secret troop . deployment details — even though it was only to a couple of teenage . girls — that Tredegar was court-martialled. Story of a life: Evan Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar, died in April 1949, aged 55, survived by his beloved parrot . He . was found guilty and banished to an honorary post in the Welsh Home . Guard, but even that small responsibility proved too much for him. Hopeless in war, the Viscount remained equally rudderless  in peace. Throughout his life the ostensibly . high-minded Evan described himself as a poet, modelling himself on . Shelley and even dressing as the Romantic poet, but he failed to attract . the praise of any but the most sycophantic critics. Rich though he was, . Evan could not buy literary success — and rich though he remained, he . could no longer buy friendship in the way he once had. Indeed, his friendship was something of a curse. Those who were close to Evan seemed to die in their droves — often tragically young. First was Guy Colebrooke, a fellow royal pageboy, who died aged 27. Then Ronald Firbank died of lung cancer at the age of 40. He was followed by fellow-drinker Sir Guy ‘Fatty’ Laking, who succumbed to alcohol poisoning at 26. One of Evans’s lovers, the Earl of Lathom, keeled over from tuberculosis brought on by a dissipated life, while another lover, the Hon James Rodney, was killed in a house fire. Friends Peter Watson, a wealthy art patron, and Sir Johnnie Philipps both drowned in their baths. And another friend, the artist Nina Hamnett, plunged out of a window, impaling herself on the railings 40ft beneath. There were suicides, too: the artist Kit Wood, the composer Peter Warlock, fellow Etonian Brian Howard and writer Richard Rumbold. Even his first wife’s brother, the Hon Gerard Sturt, killed himself. His sister Gwyneth succumbed to drug abuse and her body was found washed up on the Thames shore in 1924. And so the party — that gay, abandoned, reckless party of parrots, poetry and promiscuity — eventually ended. Evan Morgan, whose riches so completely detached him from life, finally parted company with it on April 27, 1949 — a victim to cancer at the early age of 55. The trouser-climbing parrot survived him.

A £1.5billion rescue plan for the Co-operative Bank will slash the income of thousands of pensioners, it emerged yesterday. The 169-year-old bank will be floated on the stock market to plug a giant hole in its balance sheet. It hopes to raise £1billion in a mix of shares and bonds, plus a further £500million by selling its general insurance arm. Not co-operating: The Co-operative Bank's plan to tackle their £1.5billion losses may see thousands of Britons lose out on their life savings . But the Co-op Group, which has 4.7million customers and whose interests run from funerals to pet insurance, wants savers who own its bonds to help foot the bill. Up to 7,000 who handed over a chunk of their life savings will lose out. As part of its grand plan, the Co-op will no longer pay income to its bondholders, most of whom are retired. Some were being paid as much as 13 per cent in annual interest – or £1,300 for a £10,000 investment. Instead, in exchange for their bonds, . investors will be offered either a cash payoff, shares in the new bank, . or new bonds. But they face losing 35p for each £1 of Co-op bonds they . hold. Future: Chief Executive Euan Sutherland is hoping for financial success when Co-op bank goes on the stock market . The price of many bonds has halved over the past couple of months, leaving thousands out of pocket. Bonds worth £60million are held by individual investors, paying annual interest of 5.5 to 13 per cent. These bonds are a type of investment, and not to be confused with the fixed-rate savings-account bonds offered in branches. Known as retail bonds, they are simply an IOU written to investors to raise funds for business growth. In return for money, the lender pays savers interest. Patrick Connolly, of financial adviser Chase de Vere, said: ‘Many people will have considered these Co-op bonds to be safe, but this highlights just how much of a huge risk there can be when investing. I fear there will be more pain as they’ll be forced to accept further losses as part of the rescue plans.’ The bailout follows months of setbacks for the Co-op. In March, it revealed a £600million loss as a result of having to pay compensation for the mis-sale of payment protection insurance, and losses on bad loans. The following month, it pulled out of a bid for 632 Lloyds branches. Then in May, a downgrade from the ratings agency Moody’s saw the bank’s debt being given ‘junk’ status. The Mail also revealed it had put a halt to new lending to small firms. Analysis by Alex Brummer, City Editor . The implosion at the Co-operative Bank that will wipe out the savings of thousands of smaller investors and trusts is the result of hubris and mismanagement on a mammoth scale. Instead of the ultimate owners of the bank – the wealthy Co-operative movement – digging into its own coffers, it is the bondholders who are being asked to carry the can. It is the closest Britain has come to a Cyprus-style rescue in which ordinary investors are made to pay for errors of management and government. The crisis at the so-called ethical bank is the result of political interference in decision-making and inadequate banking disciplines. This has left a £1.5billion black hole in the bank’s balance sheet, placed the whole Co-operative movement at risk and created huge uncertainty for the bank’s 4.7million customers. Successive governments have contributed to the crisis. It was Gordon Brown’s administration that sought to back a new ‘super-mutual’ bank as a challenger on the high street. The Labour Party’s favourite bank, the Co-operative, was chosen as its preferred vehicle and the Government backed a 2009 merger with the much larger Britannia Building Society. Trust gone: The implosion at the Co-operative Bank is the result of 'hubris and mismanagement on a mammoth scale' Dozens of Labour MPs, including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, are sponsored by the Co-op movement. The Britannia deal turned out to be a disaster. Large numbers of mortgages on the Britannia’s books were rotten and the society had become embroiled in commercial property deals that went wrong in the recession. Much of this was hidden from public view until George Osborne gave the nod to the Co-operative Bank bid for 632 Lloyds branches. The former Financial Services Authority should have stepped in and made it clear that the Co-op lacked the management and balance sheet resources to enter the big league. Not surprisingly the deal fell apart when the Co-op revealed heavy property losses and acknowledged it lacked the systems to manage the bank. It was then that credit ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the bank’s debt to ‘junk’ status. That meant traditional customers, such as local authorities and non-governmental organisations, could no longer safely hold deposits with the bank. Under the complex rescue package just unveiled by the Co-op after extensive talks with the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulatory Authority watchdog, it is bondholders rather than the Co-op movement who will bear most of the pain. That has left investors in the bonds angry, disappointed and disillusioned with both the Co-op and the government that allowed this series of catastrophic errors to happen.","Plan to float the Co-operative Bank on stock market will hit customers .

In an effort to decrease a growing wave of iPhone thefts known as 'Apple picking', the tech company unveiled a 'kill switch'-style update to make the expensive gadgets less appealing to would-be robbers. New iPhones will be equipped with a 'kill switch' to make them useless if stolen, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developer's Conference last week according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The tech-giant is the first to respond to calls from law enforcement agencies frustrated by an increase in violent cell phone thefts known as 'Apple picking'—though Microsoft, Samsung and other manufacturers are not immune to the problem. 'Kill Switch': As part of an update to the operating system and the 'Find My Phone' application, iPhone users will be able to deactivate their devices online . Developing: Apple announced the 'kill switch' at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference, where Apple CEO Tim Cook, pictured at the conference, and other executives spoke about the new update . As part of the latest operating system update to the iPhone this fall, users will be able to deactivate their stolen smartphone online through what Apple calls an activation lock—effectively a 'kill switch'. Even if the owner's SIM card is removed, a thief can't erase the phone's data without a username and password. An Apple ID and password are also required to turn off the new 'Find My Phone' application--which tracks a stolen or lost phone's GPS location. A custom message, such as 'This iPhone is lost. Please call me' will be continuously displayed even if thieves manage to erase the phone. 'We think this is going to be a really powerful theft deterrent,' Apple's senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said at the developer's conference on June  10. Kill switches will be added to all Apple mobile devices, the Chronicle reported. Law enforcement agencies and advocates have been battling a spike in 'Apple picking' for several years, as mobile electronic gadgets become even more popular. One poll showed nearly 10 per cent of cell users said they've had their phone stolen at some point, according to Time. Update: Apple's senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, pictured, said the company thinks the new kill switch feature will be a 'really powerful theft deterrent' Some 'Apple picking' crimes have been particularly violent. In February, three people were stabbed on a New York City subway platform in a fight over an iPhone. This month, a woman was mugged at gunpoint in the city for her Android device. In three incidents last September, women were attacked for Apple and Samsung gadgets, according to a statement by  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Theft of Apple products alone has increased so much in New York City that the city's police established a unit to work with the company to retrieve stolen products, according to the New York Post. Hot commodity: iPhones and other Apple products have become increasingly vulnerable to thef . 'We’re looking for ways to find individuals who have stolen Apple products and return the products to their original owners,' NYPD spokesman Paul Browne told the Post. 'It is being done to learn the pattern who is stealing.' Overall crime in the city would have decreased had it not been for stolen mobile devices, CNN reported. The city saw an 40 per cent increase in mobile thefts in 2012. Apple's announcement came just three days before Schneiderman and San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón launched a nationwide 'Secure Our Smartphone' Initiative to find a 'meaningful' solution to smartphone thefts. 'The epidemic of violent street crime involving the theft and resale of mobile devices is a very real and growing threat in communities all across America,' Schneiderman said in a statement when the initiative was launched Thursday. 'Smartphones have become a part of our everyday lives. Over half of the U.S. population owns a smartphone, creating an environment ripe for violent street crimes,' added Gascón. Cell phone thefts make up 30 to 40 per cent of all robberies in America, according to a Consumer Reports statistic noted in their statement. Representatives from Apple, Google/Motorola, Samsung and Microsoft also participated in a smartphone summit at Schneiderman’s office in New York on Thursday. When the new 'kill switch' feature was announced, Schneiderman and Gascón said in a joint statement they 'are appreciative of the gesture' but said they 'reserve judgment on the activation lock feature until we can understand its actual functionality'. The activation lock feature only works when a device is connected to WiFi or is turned on with its data plan activated. 'We are hopeful that the cell phone industry will imbed persistent technology that is free to consumers that will make a phone inoperable once stolen, even if the device is off, the SIM card is removed, or the phone is modified by a thief to avoid detection,' the joint statement added.","iOS 7 update this fall will include new 'Find My Phone' application features allowing owners to deactivate their device online .

A woman fired from her teaching job because of a menacing, abusive ex-husband's behavior is back in the news. But this time it's good news. Thanks to her courage leading her to take her story to television, Carie Charlesworth has been offered a fresh start with a brand new teaching position. Sometime after her story aired on San Diego local news, Charlesworth was contacted by a concerned viewer. The woman, who did not want to release . her name, runs a private school in Los Angeles and offered to take . Charlesworth on as a new employee. Brave: Carie Charlesworth thought her career as a teacher was over when she took her story--of being fired for being the victim of constant domestic violence--to local television . And Charlesworth, who thought all the . publicity would spell the end of her career as a teacher, was overcome . by emotion. 'It's good to know that people generally care about other people,' a teary-eyed Charlesworth told San Diego's NBC 7. Though Charlesworth said she would be willing to relocate for the job, she and the good Samaritan still have much to discuss. Nonetheless, the offer itself was enough to bring hope back to a woman whose life was so recently torn apart. A victim of domestic violence has been fired from her job as a sixth-grade teacher in California because the private school have deemed it too dangerous to keep employing her. Darker days: Second-grade teacher Carie Charlesworth says the Diocese that runs her school called her a liability and fired her because of her menacing ex-husband . Carie Charlesworth recently received a . letter from the Diocese of San Diego informing her that her . ex-husband’s ‘threatening and menacing behavior’ was too much of a . concern, and they could no longer allow her to work at Holy Trinity . School in El Cajon. The . shocking decision not only impacted Charlesworth’s career and ability . to earn, but her four children who also attended the school have also . been barred from returning. ‘They’ve taken away my ability to care for my kids,’ she said. ‘It’s not like I can go out and find a teaching job anywhere.’ The incident dates back to January when Charlesworth was forced to call police after what she called ‘a very bad weekend with him.’ The next day, she spoke to her principal to warn them about her ex-husband, Martin Charlesworth. Not long afterwards he showed up at the school parking lot - forcing the entire school to go into lockdown. Since then Charlesworth and her four children have not returned to the school. Her ex-husband was jailed on two felony charges, but is due to be released later this month. A letter was sent to parents at the time of the incident explaining what happened and explaining that Charlesworth and her children had been put on ‘indefinite leave.’ In a letter from the Diocese who runs Holy Trinity School, Charlesworth was informed that she and her four kids were barred because her ex-husband was 'too dangerous' Three months later Charlesworth received the letter informing her that she was fired – a move which despite 14 years working in the Diocese means she is now barred from working at any of its area schools. The letter from the Diocese explained that Charlesworth was being fired because of her husband’s ‘twenty-plus year history of violence, abuse, and harassment of people - mostly women.’ ‘We know from the most recent incident involving you and Mrs. Wright (the principal) while you were still physically at Holy Trinity School, that the temporary restraining order in effect were not a deterrent to him,’ stated the letter. ‘Although we understand he is currently incarcerated, we have no way of knowing how long or short a time he will actually serve and we understand from court files that he may be released as early as next fall. 'In the interest of the safety of the students, faculty and parents at Holy Trinity School, we simply cannot allow you to return to work there, or, unfortunately, at any other school in the Diocese.’ Charlesworth, who says she feels like she’s being treated like a criminal, has hired a lawyer and intends to sue the school. But NBC reports that several parents at the school said the district did the right thing in a no-win situation because they feared for the safety of their own children. There was even a movement to  'pull kids out of the school' if Charlesworth returned. 'I mean that’s why women of domestic violence don’t come forward, because they’re afraid of the way people are going to see them, view them, perceive them, treat them,' said Charlesworth.

'Unrelenting pressure': Culture Secretary Maria Miller said companies such as Google had not done enough to ensure sickening images are banished from the internet . Corpses and animals have greater protection from being abused in online pornography than women, campaigners have claimed. As web firms are summoned to a Whitehall summit on tackling the tide of internet filth, ministers were urged to close a legal loophole which means it is legal to include scenes of rape in pornography. The rule, which insists that actors are over the age of 18, is at odds with the ban on possessing necrophilia and bestiality. An open letter signed by Mumsnet, the National Federation of Women's Institutes, the Trades Union Congress, rape crisis centres, and academics at Durham University demands 'urgent action against violent and misogynistic pornography' found on the internet. It adds: 'We specifically want the Government to close a loophole in the pornography legislation which allows the lawful possession in England and Wales of pornographic images that depict rape, so long as the actors are over 18. 'Depictions of necrophilia and bestiality are criminalised by the same legislation, meaning that animals and dead people are better protected than women and girls,' said the letter to the Daily Telegraph. ""A change in the English law would send a clear message that it is illegal to possess pornographic images that promote sexual violence against women.' The call comes as Culture Secretary Maria Miller accused internet firms of ‘acting blind’ over the proliferation of child abuse images on the net, as she summons them to a major summit on web safety today. She claimed companies such as Google had not done enough to ensure sickening images are banished from the internet - and promised to put ‘unrelenting pressure’ on them to do so. She revealed that web firms will be tasked with coming back to ministers with action plans to tackle the pernicious issue of child porn before the autumn. Progress: Last week, Google donated £1million to the Internet Watch Foundation, which polices child abuse images and can get them taken down . Mrs Miller said the fact that millions . had been pledged by Google before the summit even starts proves their . paucity of action beforehand. For . the last year, the Daily Mail has consistently highlighted the scandal . of online porn and how easy it is for children to access it. The issue . was again illustrated in the aftermath of the Tia Sharp and April Jones . murder cases. Both killers accessed pornography in the run up to the murders. Last . week, Google donated £1million to the Internet Watch Foundation, which . polices child abuse images and can get them taken down. 'Child abuse images are horrific and widespread public concern has made it clear that the industry must take action. Enough is enough' Culture Secretary Maria Miller . Days . later, they put aside millions of pounds more to set up a global . database of such pictures so they can be more effectively removed. And . at the weekend, broadband providers BT and TalkTalk said they would put . up pop-up warnings if anyone tries to link to a page potentially . including child abuse images. Mrs Miller claimed that such progress had only taken place because of the impending summit, which opens today. ‘Child . abuse images are horrific and widespread public concern has made it . clear that the industry must take action,’ she said. ‘Enough is enough. ‘In recent days we have seen these . companies rush to do more because of the pressure of an impending . summit. Imagine how much more can be done if they seriously turn their . minds to tackling the issue. Pressure will be unrelenting.’ 'We can't do nothing': Claire Perry, the Prime Minister's adviser on families, has called on internet firms to take action in memory of murdered children April Jones and Tia Sharp . Internet . firms have come under growing scrutiny following the conviction of Mark . Bridger, who murdered five-year-old April jones after amassing a . library of internet child abuse images. Mrs Miller will demand that the companies use their technological know-how to come up with new way to tackle child abuse images. A . source at the Department for Culture said Mrs Miller was taking tough . action because she was the ‘only mother’ around the Cabinet table. 'I had an incredibly sad meeting last week with the parents of April Jones and Tia Sharp who said: ""We just can’t understand how you can put these terms into the internet""' Claire Perry, Prime Minister’s adviser on families . The . minister had almost got more money out of Google in just a few days . than HMRC had got out of them in the past year. The firm only paid . £6million in corporation tax last year. ‘It . is clear that Internet companies are not doing enough and can do much . more,’ the source said. ‘They have not come under this pressure before . and therefore have not felt the need to act. ‘The summit has already spurred the . industry into action. The fact that in the last few days alone Google . has found £4million to invest in this issue and the major ISPs have all . committed to the introduction of splash pages shows that there is so . much more than can easily be done when the companies engage. ‘Why has it taken a Whitehall summit for the industry to realise the seriousness of this issue? Why have these companies ignored the widespread public concern for years? ‘Companies have acted blind towards systemic problem of child abuse images. If they are allowed to act as though they are blind then they do not have to take responsibility. They must be made to acknowledge the extent of the problem and take responsibility.’ Last night Claire Perry, the Prime Minister’s adviser on families, called on internet firms to take action in memory of murdered children April Jones and Tia Sharp. ‘I had an incredibly sad meeting last week with the parents of April Jones and Tia Sharp who said: “We just can’t understand how you can put these terms into the internet”. ‘If I have to sit with parents who’ve had their children taken from them whilst images, the most appalling images of abuse are then found on those gentlemen’s computers, we can’t sit by and do nothing about that.’","Maria Miller requesting action plans from web firms before the autumn .

High price of success: Ticket prices for this summer's Wimbledon tennis final have soared after Andy Murray's victory at the Queen's Club on Sunday . Tickets for the Wimbledon tennis tournament are always hard to come by. But this year fans hoping to see Andy Murray if he reaches the final will have to fork out £13,500 for a pair of seats. Yesterday it emerged that ticket prices had soared after the British Number One’s win at the AEGON Championships at Queen’s club on Sunday, with loyal fans willing to gamble that the Scot will make it through. Prime Centre Court seats for the men’s final, which takes place on Sunday July 7, have peaked at £13,500 for a pair, according to the trading website Viagogo. And seats further back still cost £6,971 a pair. Anyone who failed to get a ticket at a more modest £66 in the hugely oversubscribed annual public ballot has little alternative but to shell out. However, you can enjoy the magic of Wimbledon without a bank loan. Each day, 6,000 outer-court tickets are available at the turnstiles, priced at £12, with a further 500 for Centre Court and 500 for Number One Court. But be prepared to queue. Those with outer court tickets can always watch the main event on a big screen at Murray Mount. Viagogo spokesman Steve Roest said: 'As Murray Mania season begins, getting involved in what could be sporting history is a must. It’s extraordinary to see how much his win at Queens has impacted ticket demand already.' Murray’s win at Queen’s comes after the 26-year-old pulled out of the French Open tournament last month, passing up on the chance of a fourth consecutive grand slam win because of a problem with his lower back. And it appears he may have Pilates to thank for the improvement to his back. A small fortune: Even seats further back on Centre Court will cost tennis fans almost £7,000 for a pair . The Scotsman has revealed that the secret to his successful recovery is not torturous ice baths or muscle-wrenching massage, but Pilates, a yoga-based discipline that improves flexibility, strength and endurance. He told the Radio Times: ‘I work in a small class. I’ve done big-group classes, Bikram yoga and so on, but I find Pilates helps me the most because the work can be tailored day by day.’ Therapy: Andy Murray has told Radio Times magazine that Pilates has been helping with a problematic back injury . Murray, who is ranked the second best player in the world, will no doubt be hoping that Pilates, which is favoured by celebrities including Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow, helps him win Wimbledon and become the first British player to take the trophy since Fred Perry in 1936. Murray, who describes missing the French Open as being ‘really hard’, said that losing to Roger Federer in last year’s Wimbledon final was the toughest loss he has ever suffered. He told the magazine: ‘I was struggling after I’d lost at Wimbledon. It was one of the toughest matches for me to lose. ‘Three or four days afterwards, I woke up thinking I’d won Wimbledon. When I realised I hadn’t, that set me back again, but once I was back on the practice court I started to feel better.’ He added that he hasn’t been able to bring himself to watch the losing match and admitted that he rarely watches videos of himself playing. Murray’s comments come as female tennis star Laura Robson revealed that her own technique for getting over a loss is to watch sad films. She said: ‘Sometimes after I lose, I torture myself even more and watch a really sad movie. 'It’s probably not the best idea, but then you can’t watch them when you’re having a good day, because it ruins your day. If your day’s already ruined, then it’s fine.’ Miss Robson, 19, who partnered Murray in the mixed doubles tournament at the Olympics last year, described him as ‘a funny guy who doesn’t take himself too seriously off court’. Runner up: Murray was disappointed to finish second in last year's Wimbledon Championship after he was beaten in the final by Roger Federer, left . Emotional: Andy Murray won many new fans after he openly wept after losing last year's Wimbledon final . She added: ‘He’s an incredible player and we’re lucky to have him. He moves so well, returns so well, so I tried to take as much as I could from the time we spent on court together. Hopefully that’s paid off a bit.’ Murray, who was criticised for his aggressive style of play at the beginning of his career, won the hearts of the nation after becoming emotional when he lost the final. He graciously accepted his runner’s up prize, then sobbed through a television interview on Centre Court. Now he is putting all his efforts into making sure he is ready for this summer’s tournament. He said: ‘I’ll be short of match practice [for Wimbledon], but hopefully I’ll have had more time on the grass courts and have a bit of a head start.’ Joker: Laura Robson, who won an Olympic silver medal with Murray in the mixed doubles at last year's London Games, says that Murray doesn't take himself too seriously off court . And Murray, who lives in Oxshott with his girlfriend Kim Sears and their dogs, Maggie May and Rusty, has transformed his Regency-style home into part living space, part fitness centre. He uses high-tech Pilates machines called the Reformer and the Cadillac and spends his spare time walking the dogs around the leafy Surrey village. He said: ‘I love walking the dogs. I grew up around my grandparents’ retrievers and Labradors. 'My parents both worked, so after school my brother and I would go round to Gran and Grandpa’s house and they always had two dogs, a boy and a girl. ‘It’s great that Kim and I are able to have two of them, too. Kim takes them out in the morning and when I’m back from training we go out again.’","The Scotsman's win at Queen's on Sunday has seen ticket prices soar .

LoveFilm has agreed a deal with Disney that will see users of its online movie streaming service able to watch some of the studio's best-loved classics. All-time family favourites such as Dumbo and The Lady And The Tramp will be available to viewers alongside modern day Disney productions such as Wall-E and Ratatouille. The Amazon-owned service said that more Disney titles are likely to be added to the LoveFilm selection list. On demand: Viewers who subscribe to Amazon's LoveFilm movie streaming service will be able to watch Disney films such as classic favourite Dumbo, pictured . Modern classic: As well as some of Disney's all time classics, viewers will also be able to enjoy more modern films to come out of the studio such as Wall-E, pictured . Available at a click: A growing list of Disney films will be available to watch on LoveFilm's Instant streaming service . Simon Morris, Chief Marketing Officer at LoveFilm, said: 'Disney is renowned for creating world famous, quality family entertainment that parents can trust; from the earliest animations to modern classics. 'We are thrilled to enhance our relationship with the launch of Disney movies on demand, and even more excited about bringing our members so much new content in the process.' LoveFilm announced the deal with Disney as rivals Netflix revealed that it had signed its own contract that will see its service offer new shows from DreamWorks Animation from 2014. Though financial details were not disclosed, Netflix said the agreement includes more than 300 hours of new TV episodes in a multi-year deal. Analysts estimated the contract could be worth several hundred million dollars over time. The transaction is a major coup for both the video streaming company and the movie studio that  produces the new content. It helps Netflix compete with pay TV . channels such as HBO and Showtime, and it gives DreamWorks a potentially . lucrative outlet for its shows as it tries to shed its reliance on two . or three big-budget movies each year. New to Netflix: Dreamworks' The Croods (pictured) will be exclusively viewable on Netflix . 'This is arguably a groundbreaking deal,' said Tuna Amobi, a Standard & Poor's equity analyst who covers both Netflix and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. While concerns remain about how much the deal will cost Netflix in the end, the company said it can debut the original series in the 40 countries where Netflix operates. That could help spread the costs over more territories and more subscribers if Netflix continues to grow overseas. 'The big question is if this is going to be an international catalyst in terms of subscriber growth,' Amobi said. Investors hailed the deal as a win-win. Netflix shares rose $15.24, or 7.1 per cent, to close at $229.23 on . Monday, while DreamWorks shares rose 93 cents, or 4 per cent, to close . at $23.74. Mutually beneficial: The deal gives DreamWorks a potentially lucrative outlet for its shows as it tries to shed its reliance on two or three big-budget movies each year . Netflix is doubling down on original children's programming, hoping to strengthen its push to become a family entertainment brand. The new content should ease some of the pain of losing a range of kids shows from Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon network, including future episodes of 'Dora the Explorer,' which Amazon.com Inc. snapped up for its streaming service in early June. The deal suggests DreamWorks will significantly ramp up its production of TV shows. Currently, it only produces 'Dragons: Riders of Berk' for Cartoon Network, which completed a run of 20 episodes at 23 minutes each - less than 8 hours of content in all - in March. Hit: The success of 'House of Cards,' the political drama starring Kevin Spacey that debuted to rave reviews on Netflix in February, paved the way for the company to buy more original content . A second season of 'Dragons' is set for release in the fall, and Netflix had already contracted with DreamWorks for a series based on its upcoming film, 'Turbo.' But the deal suggests that several new series will have to debut each year to fulfill the industry standard deal length of five to seven years. New series will be based on characters either from future film hits, past franchises like 'Shrek,' or even older hits, including the hundreds of characters like 'Casper the Friendly Ghost,' which DreamWorks acquired when it bought Classic Media last July for $155 million. Miss: After 'Arrested Development' debuted last month, Netflix's shares dropped more than 6 per cent because critics had mixed reviews . The multi-year agreement tops the undisclosed amount Netflix spent on 'House of Cards,' the political drama starring Kevin Spacey that debuted to rave reviews on Netflix in February. Netflix has been adding original programming to its roster of older movies and TV show reruns, and is set to launch the Jenji Kohan-created 'Orange Is the New Black' next month. The company has said that for the next several years, it will contain original content spending to within 10 per cent of its $2billion in annual content costs. Netflix's increased focus on children's programming is seen as a departure from the tactics of traditional premium pay TV channels such as HBO, Starz and Showtime, whose original shows tend to be tailored to adults. It also ramps up the competition for . children viewers with Amazon, which said last month it will produce . three new original kids shows for members of its Amazon Prime . subscription plan. Netflix . has said it has 29.2 million streaming video subscribers in the U.S. and . 7.1 million internationally as of the end of March. Those figures are . up 5.8 million and 4.1 million respectively from a year ago. In . December, Netflix announced it will offer Disney movies, starting with . films released in 2016. It declined to make a similar deal for the . rights to Sony movies starting in 2016, which was kept by Starz. New to Netflix: Dreamworks' The Croods (pictured) will be exclusively viewable on Netflix . Netflix has gradually been shifting where it spends money - preferring exclusive and original content over shows that appear elsewhere, as was the case with content from Starz and Viacom. It let both of those deals lapse. The company studies the viewing habits of its subscribers to gather insights into whether the programming is likely to be a hit on its service, and how much to pay for it. But not all of its picks have been winners. After 'Arrested Development' debuted last month, Netflix's shares dropped more than 6 per cent because critics had mixed reviews. Monday's gains more than made up the lost ground.","LoveFilm to show 'growing list' of classic and modern Disney titles .

'It's been a long journey, that's for sure, but what I learned about love and compassion and forgiveness in 1986 has just kept me going.' On Monday afternoon, Paula Cooper walked out of the Rockville Correctional Facility in central Indiana a free woman after 28 years behind bars. The Indiana Department of Correction gave Cooper a change of donated clothes and $75. Prisons spokesman Doug Garrison said the Department of Correction has also organized a place for her to live after her release, however, he would not disclose where. Her parole officer would help her find a job and permanent housing, Garrison added. Cooper's sister, Rhonda Labroi, said the 43-year-old had worked hard to change her life in the decades since the crime and that her family was proud of her. Child: Paula Cooper was 15 when she brutally killed Ruth Pelke. She was sentenced to die in 1986, at age 16 . 'She entered prison as a very troubled teenager and is leaving a reformed woman,' Labroi told ABCNews.com in an email. 'We are proud of how much she's grown . and she has all of our support as she starts this second chance at . life. As always, our sincerest thoughts and prayers go out to the Pelke . family.' Cooper was just 15 in May 1985 when . she and two other teenage girls entered Ruth Pelke's home in . Gary, Indiana, by telling her they wanted to study the scripture.

Frail: Ruth Pelke, pictured right with her husband, was a frail 78-year-old Bible school teacher . Her prison record shows 23 violations, though only minors infractions since 1995 when she was sentenced to solitary confinement for assaulting a guard. She told the Indianapolis Star in a 2004 interview that she feels remorse for the killing. 'Everybody has a responsibility to do . right or wrong, and if you do wrong, you should be punished,' she said. 'Rehabilitation comes from you.

'My main concern is seeing her get settled and find a job,' he told the Star. The crime horrified Indiana. Cooper admitted to the murder, but prosecutors pushed for the death penalty, arguing the crime was unspeakably vicious and pre-planned. Investigators found she stabbed Pelke 33 times with a . kitchen knife as the elderly woman lay on the floor. One of the thrusts . was so hard, it passed through Pelke's body and damaged the wood . floorboards.

The . sentence sparked and uproar from anti-death penalty campaigners around . the world. Letters flooded the state General Assembly, the prosecutor's . office and the Indiana Supreme Court. Pope John Paul II himself pleaded for clemency for Cooper and sent an emissary to visit the prosecutors and beg not to condemn the girl. Cooper spent less than two years on death row, by 1988 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled minors couldn't be executed for any crime that happened before age 16. In 2005, a new court ruling raised the age to 18. The Indiana Supreme Court commuted her sentence to 60 years in prison that year. By 2002, the state raised the minimum age for execution to 18.

Getting telephone advice could be the key to putting the brakes on soaring patient demand on A & E, according to a review of emergency healthcare in the NHS. It warns the current system is ‘unaffordable, unsustainable and consuming NHS resources at a greater rate every year’. The review is a new bid to tackle a mounting crisis that some experts claim could lead to the system collapsing within six months. Getting telephone advice could be the key to putting the brakes on soaring patient demand on A & E, according to a review of emergency healthcare in the NHS . Patients face ‘fragmented’ services, are confused over where to get care out of hours and often contact more than one NHS service for help. Many patients are turning to urgent and emergency care services for conditions that could be better treated in primary care because they cannot get, it says. At least 100 million NHS calls or visits are made for urgent and unplanned care each year - about one-third of overall NHS activity - with rising emergency admissions to hospital. Poor care in hospitals at weekends - including lack of senior emergency doctors 24 hours a day - is to blame for the loss of 4,400 lives a year in England, says the review. But inadequate staffing in Accident and Emergency units mean a 24/7 service is not currently possible, it says. Telephone-led care could ease the pressure, preventing many unnecessary attendances at NHS hospitals, walk-in centres and GP practices, says the review. It claims telephone consultations are becoming increasingly popular and are less ‘resource-heavy’ for general practice than face-to-face consultations. Jeremy Hunt said 'huge pressures' in A&E reflect other problems in the health service because it acts as a barometer for the whole system . ‘However some patients lack confidence in telephone advice and are likely to pursue a second opinion inappropriately, leading to duplication of service provision’, says the review by NHS England. Following the example set in Australia and North America, where doctors are involved at an earlier stage as call handlers, could help reduce the number of patients sent to hospital. Critics claim the botched introduction of the non-emergency 111 telephone line in some parts of the country in April has also undermined patient confidence. The review says patients often ‘default’ to A&E units and the 999 ambulance service because of their reliability and ease of access. But around one-quarter of A&E attendances could be treated elsewhere, with the remainder being serious or life-threatening conditions. The review signals the start of a public consultation to produce new ways of organising urgent and emergency care. Professor Keith Willett, chairman of the review’s steering group, said ‘We know that A&E is the pinch point of the health and care system and that staff are working very hard to provide the care they know the public need. Telephone-led care could ease the pressure, preventing many unnecessary attendances at NHS hospitals, walk-in centres and GP practices, says the review . ‘To relieve the pressure and design a system that is sustainable and fit to meet future challenges, we need as many patients, doctors, nurses and NHS colleagues as possible to get involved.’ Earlier this month the Health Secretary said NHS leaders are creating a ‘vulnerable older people’s plan’ to help alleviate the stress on accident and emergency wards. Jeremy Hunt said ‘huge pressures’ in A&E reflect other problems in the health service because it acts as a barometer for the whole system. Professor Norman Williams President of the Royal College of Surgeons, said ‘For many patients Accident and Emergency departments are the go-to place where they know they will be seen and treated at any time of the day or night. ‘This has led to rising pressure that has put the system under enormous strain. It is important that a sustainable urgent and emergency care system emerges from the review so that hospitals can focus on treating some of the sickest patients, about a fifth of whom will require urgent surgery. ‘We need some innovative and workable solutions that deliver high quality care seven days a week and this will require all parts of the system working cohesively.’ Dr Mark Porter, Chair of council of the British Medical Association, said ‘This review recognises the complex pressures on urgent care and as such is more likely to produce sustainable solutions. ‘So far the Government’s response to this has been overly simplistic, with the blame being put squarely on individual parts of the health service. Emergency care providers are facing high levels of demand that are only going to increase in the years to come, and become more complex as the population grows and people live longer.’ Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said ‘The Government’s botched implementation of NHS 111 has resulted in trust in the telephone service being eroded. ‘On top of that, since 2010, walk-in centres have been closed and evening and weekend opening by GPs has fallen. ‘At the same time, the Government has slashed council budgets resulting in more and more older people left without the care and support they need to help them remain at home or to return home after a hospital stay.’ Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said ‘We need to look at transformative ways to improve the whole service in the long-term so people get the right care, and know where and how to access it.’","The review of emergency healthcare  is bid to tackle mounting NHS crisis .

A predatory Portuguese child rapist has gone on the run after he was granted bail and allowed to keep his passport while awaiting trial. Antonio Pedro De Alves attacked a 12-year-old girl in a supermarket car park after grooming her for six months on the internet while posing as a 15-year-old boy. De Alves, 41, skipped bail before he was due to stand trial in Stafford last week. Predator: Antonio Pedro De Alves, who had been living in Rugeley, Staffordshire, groomed a 12-year-old schoolgirl from the West Midlands by pretending to be a 15-year-old boy on social network Bebo . He was tried and convicted of rape in his absence with the help of harrowing evidence from his young victim. But it is feared that De Alves has escaped abroad – meaning the victim . and her family could face a tortuous wait until he is brought to justice . and jailed. An international arrest warrant is being  prepared to track him down. Yesterday a close friend of the victim’s family said: ‘It beggars belief . that a foreign national accused of raping a child was ever allowed out . on bail. ‘His victim has been astonishingly brave throughout, from reporting the . attack to police to giving compelling evidence at the trial. Her family . is incredibly proud of her. ‘The police, particularly the family liaison officer, have been . wonderful and supportive. But the family just cannot understand how this . man was allowed bail by the courts and to keep his passport. ‘Apparently he had been assessed and was not deemed a flight risk. But . the fear is that he has now fled abroad, probably back to Portugal. ‘If that is true, we can only hope that he is tracked down and . extradited back to the UK and is handed the lengthy sentence this scum . deserves.’ De Alves was living in Rugeley, Staffordshire, when he first contacted the victim on the social networking site Bebo. Posing as a sports-loving 15-year-old, De Alves spent six months gaining . the youngster’s trust online before he persuaded her to meet him at a . supermarket car park. Skipped bail: De Alves, 41, was due to stand trial for rape last week at Stafford Crown Court (pictured) When the schoolgirl arrived at the rendezvous point, De Alves claimed he . was a relative of the boy who had been asked to meet her because the . boy was running late. The schoolgirl was immediately suspicious and tried to flee – but De Alves dragged her into his car and brutally attacked her. Stafford Crown Court heard that after the victim went to police in 2011, . De Alves was arrested and his computers were seized. He was charged in . January this year after a year-long investigation. De Alves later appeared at court, but was inexplicably granted bail. After a two-day trial in his absence, De Alves was found guilty of one count of rape and acquitted of a second rape charge. The guilty verdict has brought some comfort to his victim, the family . friend said. But he added: ‘Justice will only be fully served when this . monster is caught and jailed for a very long time.’ An NSPCC spokesman said: ‘There may have been a reason to grant bail to a . child sex offender but it’s difficult to see how that was made with . good judgement. ‘He is obviously a dangerous man who should have been kept in custody or . at the very least strictly monitored so he could not go on the run. ‘This lamentable situation means that more children are now at risk of . abuse from someone who should now be languishing in prison.’ Vinny Bolina, spokesman for West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, . confirmed that the judge in the case had ordered that an International . Arrest Warrant for De Alves be prepared within 14 days. A spokesman for Staffordshire Police, said: ‘During the investigation De . Alves... answered police bail on numerous occasions pending detailed . examination of forensic evidence. ‘He failed to appear at crown court last week and was convicted in his absence. A warrant for his arrest will now be issued.’ The spokesman added: ‘Staffordshire Police follows strict, national . guidelines in relation to granting suspects bail and any bail conditions . that are imposed. ‘The protection and safeguarding of young people is a top priority for Staffordshire Police.’ Anyone with information about De Alves’s whereabouts should contact . Staffordshire Police on 101 or call the Crimestoppers charity, . anonymously, on 0800 555 111. An earlier version of this article incorrectly carried a headline stating the police granted Mr De Alves bail and allowed him to keep his passport.

Collector Phil Green suspected there was something extraordinary about a green rock he found in his backyard six years ago - but he had no idea it was out of this world. The Massachusetts man recently received confirmation from NASA that the mud-covered rock he pulled out of the Merrimack River, which runs behind his Amesbury home, was a segment of the Mir Space Station. Space rock: Amesbury resident Phil Green found a green rock from a nearby river six years ago which NASA confirmed was a piece of the Russian space station Mir . Out of this world: Amesbury resident Phil Green found this mud-covered rock in a river behind his house, and recently discovered it was a piece of a Russian space station . After a year-long analysis, the space agency sent him a letter saying they were 87 per cent sure his rock was a remnant of the Soviet spacecraft according to WHDH.com. Green, a custodian at Amesbury Elementary School, told the Eagle Tribune he found the rock while searching for arrowheads near the river, and it stood out to him. 'The river gets scoured really well by the ice in the wintertime, so you wouldn’t expect to find a small rock sitting on top of what’s almost like pavement and granite,' Green said. 'So I went over and picked it up.' He said the rock was a burnt shade of green with a distinctive glassy structure after he washed away the mud. One side had 'about a hundred tiny pores', most commonly seen in volcanic rock. Using a metal detector, the unique item collector found that it had no traces of metal in it. Not sure what to do with it, he left the rock outside for about five years until a friend came over and suggested it could be a meteor. Not long later, his sister-in-law, a Newburyport teacher, saw the rock and sent it to NASA to be analyzed, according to the Eagle Tribune. After waiting about a year, Green had given up hope of ever hearing anything about the mysterious rock. Then a couple of weeks ago, he received a package in the mail from NASA containing his rock, a plaque and a letter from NASA Analysis Engineer George Leussis confirming that the rock had indeed fallen from space. The 'rock' Phil Green found in a riverbed near his home was actually a chunk of the Mir space station, pictured . The letter confirmed that while the rock originated on Earth, it had definitely been subjected to a fall from low Earth orbit, which was the reason for the rock’s green color and strange properties, according to the Eagle Tribune. 'The material shows a composition similar to that used as ballast by the soviet space program starting in the mid 1980s,' Leussis wrote. 'This places its most likely origin as Mir, or one of the Progress-M class Russian resupply vehicles, that had undergone a TPS failure.' Mir was a Russian space station that operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001. When it fell to earth in March 2001, most of it landed in the South Pacific ocean.","Amesbury resident Phil Green found a green rock in a riverbed six years ago, and kept it in his yard .

Women from the north of England are more likely to be diagnosed with the deadliest form of skin cancer than their southern counterparts because of sunbeds and cheap holidays abroad, a study has found. Rates of melanoma - the most lethal form of cancer - had previously been highest in affluent areas of the . south where the hours of sunshine are longer, according . to research published today in the British Journal of Dermatology. But cases in women aged between 10 and 29 have drastically risen in the north west of the country - with experts blaming young women's overuse of sunbeds to try and look like their favourite celebrities. Hidden danger: Cases of melanoma have become most prevalent in young women, aged between 10 and 29, who are living in the north west of England because of sunbed use and cheap holidays (stock image) Research . leader Sarah Wallingford, from the University of Manchester's Institute . for Inflammation and Repair, says the findings suggest that . affordability of holidays to warmer climates has been important factor . in changing the regional discrepancy in melanoma rates. The study examined diagnoses of melanoma over eleven years from 1996 to 2006. Researchers at the University of . Manchester also found that the disease was found to be most prevalent . among the second most deprived socioeconomic group as well as the second . most affluent groups. Nina Goad, of the British Association . of Dermatologists, said: 'This study is interesting as it changes our . views on two important risk factors for skin cancer – where we live and . how rich we are. 'Latitudinal . position in England has long been associated with risk levels for skin . cancer, with southern regions always having the highest rates of the . disease. But for young women, the disease is now highest in the North . West. 'We know that across England, use of . tanning beds is highest among young women in the north and is also high . among lower socioeconomic status groups, so this may well be a strong . contributing factor to both these findings. Former Atomic Kitten Liz McClarnon, from Liverpool, pictured left, and Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts, from Lincolnshire, pictured right, have both admitted using sunbeds in the past and campaigned against their use . Previous . figures have always shown melanoma to be more common in affluent people . who can afford to fly abroad to warmer countries. These new findings suggest that holidays abroad becoming more affordable for everyone has contributed to those with lower incomes being diagnosed with the disease. Researchers at the University of . Dundee found that 90 per cent of sunbeds in the UK emit radiation that . is higher than the safety standards set by the EU. The . World Health Organisation has stated that sunbeds are as lethal as . cigarettes and they are listed as one of the most dangerous, . cancer-causing habits. Cases . of malignant melanoma - the deadliest skin cancer - have doubled in the . last decade, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. Around 13,000 Britons are diagnosed with the illness each year and it causes 2,800 deaths. Research . has previously found that a using a sunbed before the age of 35 . increases the risk of malignant melanoma by nearly 90 per cent. Under pressure: Nicola Roberts, pictured far right with her Girls Aloud bandmates in 2004, said she became obsessed with having a tan . Former Atomic Kitten star Liz McClarnon, from Liverpool, is just one of many celebrities who has admitted to using sunbeds - which significantly increase the risk of melanoma - and since spoken out about the shocking impact it's had on her skin. The 32-year-old gave up using sunbeds . ten years ago, now opting for fake tan, but by then a lot of damage had . already been done. Ultraviolet images taken of the singer's skin showed UV damage beneath the surface of her . skin with experts warning she will suffer from liver spots in years to come because of tanning sessions in her youth. After viewing the image, Ms McClarnon told The Sun: 'I’m worried much of the damage has already been done — the picture looks like an old woman. 'There are so many freckles you can’t see. I had already noticed a change in the pigmentation on my hairline. 'Apart from the risk of skin cancer when I look at that picture I’m just thinking, ""I don’t want to look like that old woman"".' Girls . Aloud singer Nicola Roberts, from Lincolnshire, has also previously . admitted to being a 'tanorexic'. She mainly used fake tan but admits she . tried sunbeds - only giving them up as they gave her more freckles. Self-confessed former tanorexic: Nicola Roberts, pictured with computer generated skin damage ahead of a TV show The Truth About Tanning, has called for sunbeds to be banned for under 18s . The singer, who spearheaded a . campaign to ban sunbeds for those under 18, told The Sun: 'I was . obsessed. If I didn’t have fake tan on I felt like death warmed up. The rest of the girls were lovely and bronzed. 'I used them [sunbeds] a couple of times but it would just burn me and give me freckles. 'Thank God it didn’t make me go golden brown. I dread to think of the position I’d be in now.' It comes after a survey carried out by Cancer Research UK earlier this year revealed that 45 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds who use sunbeds are unhappy with their bodies. The study also revealed that 30 per cent of people who use sunbeds do so to look more attractive. Eight out of every ten of these unhappy sunbed users claim that they feel pressurised to look different – 29 per cent said they were influenced most by peer pressure, 30 per cent said they were influenced by celebrities, and 45 per cent said it was the media that made them feel pressurised to look tanned. By contrast, the research revealed that only 36 per cent of young people who have never used a sunbed are unhappy with their appearance. Silent killer: The World Health Organisation says that sunbeds - one of leading causes of melanoma, pictured - are as lethal as cigarettes and they are listed as one of the most dangerous, cancer-causing habits . Caroline Cerny, senior health campaigns manager at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘We live in an image-obsessed culture and know many sunbed users continue to use them because they think they look better with a tan. ‘But actually they are making their skin look worse in the long run. The more unhappy they are with the skin they’re in, the more they may use sunbeds – it’s a vicious circle. ‘Sunbeds can result in premature ageing and wrinkles, as well as increased pigmentation on the skin. ‘No one wants to look older before their time, and crucially, using sunbeds also increases the risk of skin cancer.’ Other recent research found that a ten minute session on a sunbed is twice as likely to cause skin cancer as spending the same amount of time in the midday sun in the Mediterranean.","Rates of melanoma had previously been highest in the south of England .

Britain is sitting on a £1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining North Sea gas. The amount is bigger than previously thought and would potentially bring energy price stability and independence from imports for decades. Although only about ten per cent  of the gas is in unpopulated areas suitable for extraction, it would still be worth £150 billion. Boost: Britain is sitting on a £1.5 trillion shale gas bonanza that could be worth more than the remaining North Sea gas. It is hoped shale gas can transform the economy in the way North Sea oil did in the Eighties and Nineties . The level of untapped shale gas will be confirmed next month in a study by the British Geological Survey, commissioned by the Department  of Energy and Climate Change, according to industry sources. Ministers are then likely to give the go-ahead for drilling, hoping the enormous economic benefits can win over environmental concerns. But critics say the environmental cost is too high for ‘fracking’ – or hydraulic fracturing, the controversial method of extracting gas by forcing water, sand and chemicals at high pressure 6,000ft underground. Pilot wells caused two earthquakes in Lancashire last year and green campaigners warn the method could contaminate the water supply. US research also says that homeowners within two miles of a fracking site can expect property prices to plummet by almost a quarter. Sources close to Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he was ‘quite excited about the prospect of a new domestic resource and probably wants to be able to exploit it, but it is quite a disruptive process and we need to go in with our eyes open’. Although the shale gas reserves are unlikely to mean a fall in gas prices, there could be enough to prevent expected big increases for years. Oil and gas experts are also hopeful about the high concentration of gas in UK rocks, which is richer than even US shale deposits and would require fewer wells. The Coalition hopes that shale gas can transform the economy in the way North Sea oil did in the Eighties and Nineties. David Cameron has chaired a seminar to which he invited shale gas experts to come to Downing Street. Meanwhile the Chancellor is considering a ‘generous new tax regime’ for drilling companies. Energy  Minister John Hayes is expected to give the go-ahead  for drilling, which has been suspended for the last  year because of safety and environmental concerns. Last year, Cuadrilla Resources suspended its drilling operations after fracking caused two small earthquakes near Blackpool. A senior industry source with  intimate knowledge of the BGS survey said: ‘When the survey announces the size of the reserve, it will be an enormous figure. The potential is that it will be a bigger number than the total recovery from the North Sea.’ Hopeful: Sources close to Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he was 'quite excited' about the prospect of a new domestic resource . Substantial recoverable gas could enhance Britain’s energy security, offset declining North Sea output and reduce import dependence. About 70 per cent of the North Sea gas and oil reserves have been used up and in 20 years Britain will be dependent on gas from abroad – mainly Norway and Qatar. However, only about ten per cent of the shale gas is available for commercial exploitation because much of it has been found in heavily populated areas, such as the North West, North Wales, Isle of Man, South Cumbria, East Midlands and the North East. Many of these areas have already suffered a property price collapse, and so fracking would be likely to provoke fierce opposition. An ICM poll last month showed  67 per cent of homeowners would rather have a wind turbine near their home than a fracking well.  But Cuadrilla claims the estimated 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the Bowland Basin in the North West could create 5,600 jobs. Pro-frackers say the landscape is disturbed for a few months during initial drilling and that the ground can be returned to its former use. But Friends of the Earth claims that the longer-term effects below ground could be catastrophic. Andrew Pendleton, of the charity, said: ‘Our objection to shale gas is there are risks of water contamination by methane and chemicals, and the process involves very high use of water anyway. Then there’s the risk of earth tremors. ‘We don’t think shale gas would even stop the rise in gas prices  anyway and it is another fossil fuel creating carbon. Plus there is the risk methane will leak out, and it is a very powerful greenhouse gas.’","Although only about ten per cent  of the .

Steven Phillips spent 24 years in a Texas prison for a string of sexual assaults it was later determined he didn't commit. For his decades of unjust incarceration, the state of Texas awarded him nearly $6million in compensation after his August, 2009 release, which is in accordance with a relatively new Texas law that specifies the amount of compensation exonerated prisoners are to receive. Then came the legal bills - his attorneys charged him more than $1million for work they claim to have done to lobby Texas lawmakers to increase the amount of compensation for exonerees. Then came his ex-wife. Justice delayed: Steven Phillips spent 24 years in prison for crimes he didn't commit. He was awarded $6million for his time in prison - and now his ex-wife wants a piece of the action . Phillips and his former bride, Traci Tucker, were expecting their first child in 1982, when Phillips was first charged in the case that ultimately would send him to prison for more than two decades. They divorced nearly 10 years later, in 1992, after Phillips says they 'grew apart.' Now the two are engaged in an ongoing legal battle over compensation she claims she is owed for wages lost by her former husband's incarceration. “He was a victim of a wrongful justice system, and his family was also,” Tucker tells the Texas Tribune. Last year, a Dallas County judge awarded Tucker more than $150,000 of Phillips' compensation, a ruling Phillips has since appealed. The case is likely headed to the Texas Supreme Court, where justices will determine what - if any - sort of compensation former spouses of exonerated prisoners should receive. In 2009, the Texas Legislature passed the Tim Cole Act, which raised the compensation for exonerated prisoners to $160,000 for each year a person was wrongfully imprisoned. For the 24 years Phillips spent behind bars, he received a lump-sum payment of more than $2million. Additionally, he will receive a monthly annuity of about $11,000, as well as medical and education benefits from the state. Compensation: Traci Tucker feels she is owed compensation for the 24 years her ex-husband spent in prison . But Phillips contends that the compensation is not for lost wages. Rather, he claims in his appeal, it's a mandatory payment he is owed under the law for his time spent behind bars. Texas state Senator Rodney Ellis, one of the architects of the Tim Cole Act, seems to agree. In an affidavit filed in the case, Ellis writes that the legislature never intended to compensate exonerees for lost wages; otherwise it would have been based on their income prior to their incarceration and be subject to taxes (as the law is written, compensation for exonerees is tax-free). Ellis notes that the Legislature recognized that a man cannot support his children while in prison, which is 'we drafted the compensation statute to include any child support payments and interest on child support arrearage that are owed by the exoneree.' The affidavit was not allowed into evidence. After winning his freedom, Phillips is back in court fighting for compensation . Another of the law's architects, state Senator Rafael Anchia, says lawmakers had failed to consider former spouses of exonerees when drafting the law. 'This is an example of the law of unintended consequences,' he says 'We did not think about entitlement by . spouses who had become divorced from these innocent men while they were . in prison.' Regardless of the law, Tucker says she had every intention of sticking it out with Phillips while he was in prison. “To me, marriage was for life, and I was going to be with him forever, . and we were going to get through this — or so I thought,” she says. Prior to the divorce, Tucker claims she visited Phillips frequently and provided him with money to buy things in the prison's commissary. At his trial, Tucker was Phillips' star witness. The string of sexual assaults for which Phillips was wrongly convicted happened in 1982. Several women were attacked and forced to perform sex acts at gun point. At least two of the victims wrongly identified Phillips. Tucker provided Phillips' alibi, testifying that he couldn't be the person committing the assaults because she was with him when some of the assaults took place. Phillips was convicted anyway and sentenced to two 30-year prison sentences. He subsequently pleaded guilty to several other, similar crimes to avoid what would likely have been a life sentence had he been found guilty. In 2001, Phillips began learning about DNA and - with the help of the Innocence Project - was able to have his DNA tested against DNA found at the scenes of crimes supposedly committed by him. The DNA didn't match. However, it did match a convicted sex criminal Sydney Alvin Goodyear. 'This is one of the worst cases of tunnel vision we’ve ever seen. Police . seized on Steven Phillips as a suspect and refused to see mounting . evidence that someone else actually committed these crimes,' said . Innocence Project Co-Director Barry Scheck. 'Sidney Goodyear was a one-man crime spree who could have . been stopped much sooner if police had followed the evidence instead of . locking onto an innocent man.' After the Dallas crimes for which . Phillips was wrongfully convicted, Goodyear committed at least 16 other . sexual assaults and related offenses in multiple states. Of the lawsuit and inflated bill from his attorneys, Phillips - who says he has no ill-will against his ex - sums his situation up as follows: 'When the cheese is on the table, the rats come out.'","Steven Phillips was wrongly convicted of a string of sexual assaults he didn't commit .

Lessons in grief: Schoolchildren as young as three will be given lessons in how to deal with the death of a loved one (file picture) Schoolchildren as young as three are to be given lessons on how to deal with death and grief. Teachers will use elephants to help children understand the concepts telling them that when an elephant dies the rest of the herd is sad and gathers round the body. They will also use the idea that an elephant never forgets to talk about memories of loved ones who have died. Around 550 primary schools have signed up to include the topic of death on the curriculum, part of a UK-wide campaign to stop discussing death with youngsters being seen as a taboo. The campaign has been launched by the Child Bereavement UK charity. Jonathan Perry, headteacher at Lambrook School near Ascot, Berkshire, said that children at his school handled the classes well. He told The Independent: 'Often children are much better at dealing with matters like this than adults. 'Staff have been so impressed about the mature way children have discussed such matters.' Anne Chalmers, chief executive of Child Bereavement UK said that some parents may be concerned that their children are to discuss death in class. But she added that it would benefit families should they suffer a bereavement. She said: 'The idea behind the campaign is to raise awareness about how these issues can be talked about in a non-threatening way.' Around 24,000 children in the UK lose a parent every year, with more than one child in 30 experiencing the death of an immediate family member and one in 16 losing a close friend.

The only surviving German Dornier Do-17 bomber has arrived at an RAF museum for a restoration project after spending more than 70 years at the bottom of the English Channel. The badly-damaged Second World War aircraft was transported more than 200 miles from Ramsgate to RAF Cosford in Shropshire today, escorted by two low loader lorries. It was lifted from the seabed on the Kent coastline last week where it was shot down during the Battle of Britain. The world's last surviving German Dornier Do-17, arriving at the RAF Museum at Cosford in Shropshire . The badly-damaged German bomber was transported from the Kent coast near Ramsgate, Kent for the first stage of its conservation . The fragile fuselage and wings were unloaded by crane to go into hydration tunnels, where it will stay for the first stage of its conservation . The painstaking project is believed to be the biggest ever recovery of its kind in British waters. The aircraft will be kept in purpose-built hydration tunnels at RAF Cosford, where it will stay for the first stage of its conservation. Alex Medhurst, general manager at RAF Museum Cosford, told the BBC: 'After all the hard work, planning and setbacks, it's great to know the Dornier is finally here at Cosford. 'It will be a rare and exciting opportunity for visitors to get up close and personal to a unique piece of aviation history and the chance to view it in its salvaged state.' Conservationist Laura Pringle started work immediately hosing down the bomber as museum staff were thrilled to see the plane finally arrive . The aircraft serial number plate of the bomber shows a vivid piece of Second World War history . The plan to raise the plane - three years in the making - involved attaching lifting equipment to the strongest parts of the aircraft's frame and raising it whole in a single lift on June 10. The ambitious hour-long operation was endlessly delayed by strong winds for weeks on end, until finally good weather made the salvage possible. The existence of the aircraft at Goodwin Sands became known when it was spotted by casual divers in 2008 at a depth of 50ft, lying on a chalk bed surrounded by debris. The aircraft landing on a barge on June 10 after weeks of strong winds delayed the painstaking operation .

Judging by the serial number on the aircraft it was shot down on August 26, 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain. It was nicknamed the Luftwaffe's 'flying pencil' because of its narrow fuselage. Around 1,500 models of the aircraft were built, but this one is the last remaining. Originally it would have been camouflaged green and dark green on top with swastikas outlined in white on both rudders. The Dornier's bombs devastated large areas of London, Coventry and Norwich as one of the Luftwaffe's most important assets in the early phase of World War Two. Historians believe this particular plane took off on the morning of August 26, with eight other Dornier bombers from St Trond in German-occupied Belgium to bomb the RAF fighter base Manston in Kent. The Luftwaffe lost three of its Dorniers that day, including this one. After an attempted controlled landing, the plane somersaulted and landed on its back. All four crew managed to leave the aircraft. These German Dornier Do-17 aircraft flying over Athens were similar to the one found near the Kentish coast .

While marriage rates have plummeted to historic lows during the economic recession, a backlog of couples keen to tie the knot is expected to fuel a surge in weddings over the next two years. A new report from private provider of lifestyle analytics, Demographic Intelligence, forecasts a four per cent rise in the number of marriages from 2009 as the economy improves - up from 2.168 million this year to 2.208 million in 2015. I do: Marriage rates are expected to rise about four per cent over the next two years after plummeting to historic lows due to the recession . Marriage rates in the U.S. have been falling in the last 40 years . The marriage rate is at its lowest point in more than a century, with the number of weddings falling from 2.197 million in 2007 to 2.08 million in 2009. In 2007, just before the downturn, the marriage rate was a low 7.3 per 1000 population. It's currently just 6.8. Demographic Intelligence estimates more than 175,000 matrimonial exchanges have been postponed or . foregone since the recession began, with couples putting off the white wedding until financial conditions improve. But the report says the 'signs are right for a temporary boost in weddings', according to USA Today. Improving economic conditions and financial security are not only encouraging long-term couples to finally take the plunge, but pairs from different demographic backgrounds. According to the report, marriage numbers are stagnant or declining among those with a high school education or less, younger Americans, and the less affluent, but 'short-term increases in weddings will be concentrated' among women aged 25 to 34, the college-educated and the affluent. 'Declines in weddings are likely to set in towards the end of the decade, even though the number of young adults is increasing, because of the nation's ongoing retreat from marriage,' the report says.

The average age at first marriage is expected to rise to 29.2 for men and 27.1 for . women by 2015 - up from 28.2 and 26.1 respectively in 2010.

Hopkins Population Center director and sociologist Andrew Cherlin said the forecasts 'make sense'. 'Given the drop in marriage rates, it's surprising to see a group project an increase,' he told USA Today. 'If you're going to get married in time to have kids, you can't wait forever, so they may be saying that the postponement of marriages is running its course, and a backlog of young adults is about to schedule their weddings. But National Center for Family & Marriage Research co-director Wendy Manning said the projected wedding increases 'might be overly optimistic'. 'Not all those marriages are going to be among those young people entering into their first marriages,' she said. 'The report is focusing on the Echo Baby Boomers entering into their marrying years, which is true, but my issue is that one-third of marriages are remarriages, and the remarriages are not among the young people.'","The number of U.S. couples tying the knot fell .

It took a 'record-breaking' 80 anti-venom vials to save the life of Benjamin Smith who was bitten by North America's largest venomous snake in Florida more than two weeks ago. But not only did the 11-year-old survive the eastern diamondback rattlesnake's potentially lethal bite, he has claimed its skin as a symbol of his triumph. Record treatment: Benjamin Smith, 11, from Florida, is lucky to be alive after being bitten by the highly venomous eastern diamondback rattlesnake . Benjamin was running through a wooded area at a . friend’s birthday party in Newberry when he felt a sharp pain, like a knife had sliced through his right leg. When he looked down, he saw the five-foot rattlesnake shaking its tail. The Newberry boy started running before the defensive snake could strike a second time. He was scooped up by his friends and older sister who carried him to safety, according to The Gainesville Sun. The 65-pound boy was rushed to University of Florida Health Shands Hospital where he was given about 80 vials of anti-venom - what doctors believe is a new record. Last year, six-year-old Kaden Rivera was on the brink of death after being bitten by a deadly rattlesnake during a camping trip. Only after 42 vials of anti-venom did he stop frothing at the mouth and begin to stabilize. Most venomous snakebites usually require about four to 10 vials of anti-venom. And starting from about $500 per vial, depending on the type of snake, emergency treatment can be extremely costly. Snakebite victim Benjamin Smith, 11, left hospital with a basketball autographed by members of the University of Florida men's basketball team and other gifts . Benjamin's mother, Heather Smith, said her son was lucky to be alive. 'He is pretty much back to normal,' she told FoxNews.com. 'Now he just needs to . go for physical therapy on his leg. 'We have had a huge outpouring of prayers. The community has been extremely supportive.' Benjamin even received a basketball . autographed by members of the University of Florida men's basketball . team. After the attack, Benjamin's friend - the . birthday boy - and his father hunted down the pit viper and killed . it, according to FoxNews.com. They gave it to Benjamin, who is deciding what to do with it. 'Ben . wanted to make a wallet, but has been told by the taxidermist that it . would not hold up well,' Smith said. 'We are having the snake skin . preserved and Ben will decide later how to display it or if he wants to . make something with the skin.' Eastern diamondback rattlesnakes are the most venomous snakes in North America . According to National Geographic, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake is the largest venomous snake in North . America. It can reach up to eight feet in length and weigh up to 10 . pounds, with powerful hemotoxin in its venom that kills red blood cells . and causes tissue damage.

Neifi Juan Acosta, who is known for posting Bible verses on the walls of his New York City school, said he wanted to 'put on a vest like the terrorists do', according to several employees. Officials are now investigating the 56-year-old after teachers filed a complaint over the bizarre rant. Acosta allegedly made his remarks during a faculty meeting at Intermediate School 232 in the Bronx last November, in the wake of the destruction wreaked on New York by Hurricane Sandy, according to the Daily News. Controversy: The principal of the Bronx's Intermediate School 232, pictured, is under investigation . The school has racked up a good academic and disciplinary record under the principal's leadership, but he has apparently alienated some staff with his mercurial ways. During the tense post-disaster meeting, it seems that matters came to a head when Acosta attempted to chastise teachers by telling them they were 'putting themselves in God's seat'. When one member of staff asked why he was angry, he said he had been upset by the behaviour of the faculty. He allegedly continued: 'I know what I'll do - I'll call a conference in the cafeteria, and I'll put on a vest like the terrorists do and I'm going to blow you all up.' Teachers reported Acosta to the police, the city's Department of Education and the local teaching union. Although the NYPD concluded that the principal does not pose a terrorist threat, city officials have launched an investigation and are considering whether to censure him. Members of staff who are being interviewed as part of the inquiry say they have been targeted by Acosta posting biblical quotations outside their classrooms. The posters read: 'We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed but not driven to despair; persecuted but not forsaken,' concluding: 'We will never, ever surrender.' The principal has refused to comment on the allegations against him.","Neifi Juan Acosta 'issued threat during faculty meeting in November'

The Pentagon has unveiled plans to fully integrate women into all combat units by 2016, and women will be permitted to serve in all . the most hazardous and elite units in the military, including Navy SEALS and the Marine Infantry. This announcement comes after the January decision by former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta to allow women in combat. The groundbreaking decision overturned a 1994 rule that restricted women from artillery, armor, infantry and other combat roles. Tough: Marine Recruit Haley Evans at boot camp in February at MCRD Parris Island, South Carolina where female enlisted Marines have gone through recruit training since 1949 . The restrictions haven't worked in practice: women have taken part in combat frequently in both Afghanistan and Iraq, and hundreds of thousands of women have been deployed to the conflicts in those areas. Battle lines were blurred and women serving as medics, military police and intelligence officers attached to battalions found themselves in combat situations. As of last year, more than 800 women had been wounded in the two wars and more than 130 had died. Groundbreaking: Former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta (right) overturned a 1994 ban on women serving in combat units in January . At the time of the announcement in January, the Defense Secretary tasked the respective commanders the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines and special operations to create a timeline for the full integration women into all combat units. But not all leaders are sure about the plan. Major General Bennet Sacolick says he's worried not about how women will perform but how men will react to having them in their units. Expert panel: Representatives from the Department of Defense including Major General Bennet Sacolick, director of force management for U.S. Special Operations Command, centre, discuss plans to integrate women into combat roles . 'We send a 12 men, or 18 or even smaller into very austere, remote environments, by themselves,' Sacolick, Special Operations Commander, told reporters. 'So I think we have to, you know, that complicates integration,' he said. CNN reports that Sacolick wants to gauge current rangers, SEALS, green berets and their reactions to the idea of females in their ranks. 'The days of Rambo are over,' he announced, saying that the military today needs as much intellectual power as it does muscle, and that the concern is for women's health and welfare in male-dominated units. You know the drill: Drill Instructor Sergeant Linda Vansickle speaks to her Marine recruits during boot camp at MCRD Parris Island, South Carolina . By 2015, the army has planned to develop . gender-neutral physical standards for their Rangers that all soldiers . will need to comply with. Service branches have until January 2016 to decide which combat positions should be open to women, and any branches not opening certain positions to women will need to explain why and gain approval from the Defense Secretary. The special forces units are the most grueling in the military, involving physically demanding and dangerous and emotionally taxing work. Any woman applying for a position in them would undergo rigorous testing and training - and most male applicants fail to gain positions. Caracal: The Israeli Caracal battalion, two-thirds of whose members are women, was established in 2004 with the purpose of incorporating female soldiers in combat units, during a 23-kilometre march in Israel's Negev desert . Original fly girls: Nancy Harkness Love, director of the Women's Auxiliary Ferry Squadron (WAFS), and Colonel Robert H. Baker inspect the first contingent of women pilots in the WAFS at the New Castle Army Air Base, Delaware in 1942 . In WWI and WWII women were utilized as test pilots for fighter planes as WASPs (Women Airforce Service Pilots). In 1979 enlistment qualifications became the same for men and women, but enlisted women were still prohibited from combat roles. In the Gulf War, some 40,000 women were deployed in operations, but in 1994, the ban on women serving in combat units was enacted. 'The department remains committed to removing all gender barriers wherever possible and meeting our missions with the best qualified and most capable personnel,' said the new Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in a May 21 memo to service leaders that was released today. 'I remain confident that we will retain the trust and confidence of the American people by opening positions to women, while ensuring that all members entering these newly opened positions can meet the standards required to maintain our war-fighting capability,' he said.","Military heads have been tasked with devising a plan to integrate women into front-line combat positions by 2016 .

A father has been left appalled by waiting staff at a sports bar called Friendly's after he was handed a receipt that described his three-year-old son as a 'f****** needy kid'. For a father's day treat, Joseph Gibson stopped for a meal at the St Louis sports bar on Sunday, after the manager lifted his usual bar on people under the age of 21. But his request for an extra chicken leg for his son resulted in an unfriendly remark about the family being printed on the receipt. Offensive: Joseph Gibson with his three-year-old son, who a waitress referred to as 'f****** needy' on their bill . Mr Gibson, who had been spending the day with his son at the nearby Missouri botanical gardens, says his son was well-behaved in the bar. He was so shocked by the comment that he contacted the St Louis Post Dispatch, not because he wanted 'anything out of it. But I was pretty upset that it happened'. Friendly's manager Denny Domachowski said the waitress meant the comment as a joke to kitchen staff and intended to delete it before handing the $13.75 bill to Mr Gibson. 'The incident shouldn't have happened, and I made sure [the waitress] understands that,' Mr Domachowski told CNN. 'She didn't mean to offend the gentleman and his son. She had a good experience with them as customers. She was just in a hurry and forgot to take that off.' Apology: The manager of Friendly's in St Louis apologized for the inappropriate comment on a bill . He added that he apologized several times to the customer and reprimanded his employee. Mr Domachowski added that the sports bar had made a couple of concessions to Mr Gibson on Father's Day, by allowing a child in and by agreeing to the order of a single chicken leg. 'Normally, we don't allow substitutions. I figured because it was Father's Day, we'd give him the single leg and I'd have the rest for my lunch,' he said. Mr Gibson said he understands 'accidents can happen, but you can also do things to prevent them'. 'If it happened to me, it could happen again,' he said.

Gleason, who has lost the ability to talk or move, said the upshot of the DJs jibe was that at least ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, was now in the news and he thanked the public for their support. 'In the past 36 hours lots of people have been talking. Let's talk about this...' he wrote. 'There are zero treatments for ALS.

On the show, one host, pretending to be Gleason, told a series of jokes. According to USA Today, one of the jokes told was: 'Knock, knock,' 'Who's there?' 'Smother,' 'Smother who?' 'Smother me, do me a favor?' Gleason communicates, and wrote an article on Monday for Sports Illustrated, using eye-tracking technology. The station lists the hosts as Cellini, Shapiro and Dimino. But Mack didn't give the names of those fired. During . the segment, two of the on-air personalities took a call from a third . host who pretended to be Gleason by using a voice that sounded automated . - mimicking another famous ALS patient, Stephen Hawking. The host mimicking Gleason told a number of jokes and eventually asked the two others to do him a favor by smothering him. All three took to Twitter Monday evening to apologize to fans and others who criticized the segment. Nick Cellini tweeted: 'My apologies . to everyone.

Listeners and critics turned to the station's Facebook page to call for the hosts' termination. Gleason played for the Saints between 2000 and 2006. Team Gleason, an organization named after the former NFL player, is geared toward finding a cure for ALS, raising awareness of the disease and connecting patients to technology, equipment and services tailored to fit their needs. In an article on the New Orleans Saints website this week, Gleason revealed that he needs the help of friends and family to get out of bed each day. After rising, he is stretched for 25-30 minutes before showering, which usually takes 45 minutes. In addition, it takes an hour or two to be dressed, fed, and into his wheelchair, with its computer ready, to start the day. The man who used to spend his days training on a football field inevitably gets down when he considers how the aggressive disease has changed him and what it still has in store. But his 19-month-old Rivers is his continual motivating factor, he said. His partner Michel Gleason said: 'In order to thrive with this disease you need a few things – number one a good support system and number two you need some type of purpose in life to live and fight. With Steve, he's started a foundation in order to help with that purpose, but it's not even comparable to how important Rivers has been to him.'","Atlanta DJs Nick Cellini, Steak Shapiro and Chris Dimino were fired on Monday after the jibe about ex-New Orleans Saints safety Steve Gleason .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:34 EST, 14 November 2011 . The economic forecasts are gloomy and the threat of a double-dip recession looms large. Tomorrow the Bank of England will slash growth prospects to just 1 per cent down from 1.5 per cent just three months ago. It's not what a Chancellor toiling away for long hours at the helm of the economy needs to hear. Combined with the plethora of European summits it all appears to have left the more rotund than usual George Osborne with less time to go to the gym. George Osborne returns to Downing Street this morning after a brisk jog with what appears to be a more rotund than usual waistline . But this morning he stepped out into the morning gloom for a brisk morning jog in shorts and grey sweater. The . Chancellor is also aiming to get the economy moving at a faster pace . with a series of schemes for new toll roads, housing and power stations . to kickstart growth. Adding to his woes youth unemployment is expected to hit . one million for the first time since records began more than 20 years . ago and fresh details have emerged of Coalition infighting over their . plans to get the economy moving, with Business Secretary Vince Cable . ruling out Tory proposals to freeze benefits. The Treasury is desperate to get . money flowing into the economy now by bringing forward major building . projects that might not have got off the ground for several years. What a difference a year makes: George Osborne in October 2010 . Insiders stress that the Government will not change its deficit reduction plans, since that would be an admission they have resorted to Plan B. Instead, Mr Osborne is relying on money sitting idle in private sector pension funds and insurance schemes. Under the proposals, to be announced in the growth review on November 29, private investors will be asked to pay £50billion into infrastructure investment funds. In exchange for their cash now, . investors would get paid a dividend later in the form of tolls from new . roads, rental income from houses or a slice of energy bills. The . plans will flood the construction industry with cash and boost jobs but . are likely to hit consumers in the long-term in the form of higher . motoring and electricity costs. A No 10 source said: ‘Pension funds are sitting on large amounts of capital and are reluctant to put money in. ‘There’s very little public money . available so it makes sense to tap that money.’ Today Mr Osborne also insisted once again that the UK will not not bear the financial cost of bailing out the single currency. Writing in the Evening Standard, he said: 'The financial risks of standing behind the currency will ultimately be borne by eurozone citizens. The eurozone has the financial capacity to restore stability. They now need to deploy it without delay.' Mr Osborne also restated his opposition to a Financial Transaction Tax, warning that a levy on financial trading would be 'economic suicide' for Britain and Europe. The Chancellor said: 'Proposals for a Europe-only Financial Transactions Tax are a bullet aimed at the heart of London. The EU should be coming forward with new ideas to promote growth, not undermine it.' Despite 'grounds for optimism' following the formation of new governments in Greece and Italy, Mr Osborne warned that 'this remains the most dangerous moment for the world economy since Lehman Brothers went down in the autumn of 2008.' Once the immediate crisis is overcome, 'over time eurozone countries will have to pool more resources and share more control over each other's tax and spending decisions', said the Chancellor. 'Frankly, this is a big loss of national sovereignty for those countries. It is one of the reasons I have always opposed Britain joining the euro. But it is the only way to make a currency union work for the long term. 'Britain will not be part of this fiscal integration and this Government will make sure that our national interests and our voice in the EU are protected.' At odds: Nick Clegg, seen here with the Prime Minister, has blocked Tory-backed proposals to make it easier to sack people in order to lessen the burden on small businesses . Ed Balls said he welcomed the fund but added that one cannot have investment projects which don't affect borrowing . Mr Osborne has Lib Dem . support for his building projects, but friction remains at the top of the Coalition . about other plans. Nick Clegg has blocked Tory-backed proposals to make it easier to sack people in order to lessen the burden on small businesses. And Mr Cable yesterday ruled out plans floated by the Tories to freeze benefits, rather than uprate them in line with inflation. He said: ‘There is no doubt, of course they should be indexed and that’s fully understood.’ But the Business Secretary did back the £50billion growth plans. He said: ‘What we have to do is create a framework regulation so that private investors will have the confidence to invest in big projects and help get the British economy moving again.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls welcomed plans for the fund. But he added: ‘You can’t have public investment projects which don’t affect borrowing, which somehow rely upon the private sector. There is no meat there.’ Mr Osborne said last night: ‘I fully accept we need to have more initiatives, more government plans to stimulate housing, to get homes being built, to help construction, help infrastructure, help small businesses get more credit. ‘We’re going to announce plans for all those things in the next few weeks.’ The taxman's relentless pursuit of those who owe money has seen a four-fold increase in the use of legal powers to seize the assets of late-paying companies. In the past two years, HM Revenue & Customs has used its ‘distraint’ powers to seize assets for auction on 7,004 businesses – up from 1,675 in 2009. In many cases the actions left company bosses with no choice but to shut up shop. Assets seized are often sold on at fire sale prices that fail to even cover the full amount of unpaid taxes and reduce the chances of other creditors being repaid. Tax experts believe the aggressive pursuit is down to huge pressure being piled on to HMRC, which is also facing staffing cuts. Stuart McNeill, partner at accountants McGrigors, said: ‘By barging in and selling the assets of a late-paying company without making a proper commercial assessment of the firm’s medium-term viability, HMRC risks sacrificing full payment in a few months’ time for far less cash upfront.’ Taxpayers are meant to be able to negotiate late payment of taxes through the Government’s ‘Time to Pay’ scheme. But since HMRC was stripped of its ‘preferred creditor’ status in 2003, the taxman is no longer first in line to recoup any money owed if a company goes bust. ‘If they don’t take an informed commercial view, they may be dealing the killer blow to some companies with a good chance of survival – and increasing the unemployment figures,’ said Mr McNeill. An HMRC spokesman said it uses its powers when ‘other avenues are exhausted’.","Chancellor says eurozone must accept 'a big loss of national sovereignty' to stabilise its finances .

She may have been unsuccessful in the 2012 Olympic hurdles, but she scooped a gold medal in the bobsled World Championships earlier this year. Now, six months later, one of the sport world's most recognisable athletes has received her bobsled paycheck in the post - a total of $741.84. After shying away from the media in the run-up to the bobsled competition in January, Miss Jones has once again taken to the airwaves to voice her opinion. Scroll down for video...

Recording a brief video of herself, the athlete mocks the total amount she's received from her seven-month season. In the video, she says: 'Seven months with bobsled season. The WHOLE season.

And last year it was reported she became embroiled in a nasty catfight with two of her USA teammates in the aftermath of the Olympics. Peers Dawn Harper and Kellie Wells, who finished second and third respectively in Olympic 100m women's hurdles final, suggested that their medal success was overshadowed by Jones because of the hype around her personal story and a nude photo-shoot for ESPN magazine in 2009. Miss Jones was the gold-medal favourite for the 2012 London Olympics 100-metre hurdles, but finished fourth. Four years earlier in Beijing, the American came in as the favorite and was in position to win gold when she hit the ninth of 10 hurdles and wound up seventh. Miss Jones was one of 24 athletes announced last October as members of last season's U.S. bobsled team, giving her another chance to vie for a spot on the World Cup circuit.

These two bangles that could be mistaken for cheap glow-bands have sold for an incredible £3.7million pounds. The bright green bands are a far cry from the plastic bracelets commonly seen in nightclubs and are actually made from an extremely rare gemstone.

Jade a fortune: The bangles were carved from a huge piece of jadeite, which is the most expensive and rarest form of the gemstone jade . As almost all of the world's jadeite is found in the small country, the mines have been exhausted and top quality pieces now sell for huge sums of money. The bracelets, which are just two inches in diameter, are a translucent green colour, which is a shade considered to be one of the most prized forms of the precious stone. They were purchased by a phone bidder at the Tiancheng International Auctioneers sale in Hong Kong for an all-in fee of £3,732,365. Ellen Sin, director of the jewellery department, said: 'Around 99 per cent of the top quality jadeite is only found in Burma, including this pair of jadeite bangles. 'As the supply of high grade jade keeps dropping and the mines are being exhausted, exquisite jadeites become highly sought after.

'Their size is large and as they were carved from the same rough, it would have had to be very big so that there was enough material to carve two similar bangles. 'The two bangles have a fine texture and translucent with very few impurities, the most desired quality of jadeite. 'It is so rare to find a big rough with very fine quality texture. 'They are top quality and when they are carved from the same piece of rough they are invaluable jewels. 'As its appreciation overtakes that of diamond and gold, this makes jadeite greatly favoured among the wealthy who regard it as one of the major investment items.

'Pot princess': Andrea Sanderlin, 45, a suburban mother of three and avid equestrian, has been arrested and charged with running a multimillion-dollar marijuana growing outfit . A mother of three from the upscale New . York City suburb of Scarsdale who is accused of growing thousands of . marijuana plants was compared Tuesday to Colombian cocaine lords. Andrea . Sanderlin, 45, was indicted in federal court in Brooklyn on charges of . operating a sophisticated pot-growing operation in a Queens warehouse. ‘Whether . you're a suburban mom growing marijuana in a warehouse in Queens or a . cartel member making cocaine in the jungles of Colombia, manufacturing . and distributing illegal narcotics comes at a hefty price,’ said James . Hayes Jr., a Homeland Security agent, in a release announcing the . indictment. U.S. Attorney . Loretta Lynch said Sanderlin ‘chose to inhabit the shadowy underworld of . large-scale drug dealers, using drug proceeds to maintain her family's . facade of upper middle class stability.’ A call to Sanderlin's attorney, Joel Winograd, was not immediately returned. Sanderlin, a mother of two daughters and a son, pleaded not guilty in May when she was taken into custody on a federal complaint. Following her arrest, New York City tabloids . compared her lifestyle - living in a Spanish-style mansion, driving a . Mercedes SUV, horseback riding in equestrian gear - to the plot of . ‘Weeds,’ a television series about a suburban mom from California who . becomes a pot dealer to support her family. ‘Sanderlin . could have focused her talents on building a legitimate business . enterprise to support her family and serve as a role model for her . children,’ Lynch said in the statement. Grow house: DEA agents entered a Queens warehouse registered to Sanderlin's name to find two rooms filled with thousands of marijuana plants and equipped with state-of-the-art lighting, irrigation and ventilation systems . Sanderlin has been held without bail since her arrest. No arraignment has been scheduled. She . faces two counts of manufacturing and possessing marijuana with intent . to distribute and maintaining a drug-involved premises. If convicted, Sanderlin could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined up to $10million, Lynch said. After . being tipped off by an informant, agents from the Drug Enforcement . Administration followed Sanderlin's Mercedes from Scarsdale to Queens . and found nearly 3,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value . of $3million, as well as dried pot and paraphernalia. Sanderlin . is accused of operating the facility which had state-of-the-art . lighting, irrigation, electrical and ventilation systems and cost more . than $9,000 a month to run. It was the warehouse's unusually high electric bill that raised suspicions about Sanderlin’s line of work, officials said. The criminal complaint against Sanderlin was filed May 20 by Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent David Lee. It was first reported earlier this month by The Smoking Gun website. Lee says law enforcement agents entered Sanderlin's Queens warehouse using a search warrant to find two rooms designed to grow marijuana. He says each room had state-of-the-art lighting, irrigation and ventilation systems. Lavish lifestyle: A criminal complaint said that Sanderlin drove back and forth between her big Spanish-style mansion in Scarsdale and the grow house in Queens in a Mercedes . In a twist straight from the Showtime series 'Weeds,' which told the story of suburban mom Nancy Botwin, played by Mary-Louise Parker, who built a marijuana-growing operation, officials say Sanderlin had set up a greenhouse in Maspeth, Queens, where she cultivated 2,800 plants worth $3million. When DEA officials busted the 45-year-old Virginia native outside the warehouse, they seized the marijuana plants, as well as 'large quantities of dried marijuana,' along with special lighting, hydroponic watering system and ventilation equipment. Sanderlin, who lives with her two daughters, ages 3 and 13 in a well-appointed home on Saxon Woods Road in Scarsdale, has been charged with felony narcotics trafficking, which carries a minimum 10-year prison sentence. The woman's lawyer, Joel Winograd, descried his client as a 'full-time mother' who had never run afoul of the law before. According to federal officials, Sanderlin has been running her marijuana business through a shell company called Fantastic Enterprises Inc. Sanderlin's name first appeared on the radar of federal agents in April when they arrested five men suspected of running a marijuana-growing outfit from two New York City warehouses. That business was allegedly headed by 50-year-old Stephen Haberstroh, a Scarsdale resident and Sanderlin's longtime friend. During the investigation, one member of the pot-growing business told federal officials that Sanderlin, whom he referred to as 'Andi,' operated 'at last one marijuana grow house in Brooklyn or Queens,' according to a criminal complaint. DEA agents quickly linked Sanderlin to several industrial properties, which racked up unusually high charges for electricity, suggesting that the spaces were used as grow houses. Stakeout: Federal officials spent several days observing Sanderlin arriving at the warehouse on 57th Drive in Queens before they confronted her . Second outpost: Sanderlin was also linked to a warehouse on Tiffany Street in The Bronx . Federal officials also discovered that Sanderlin's company had an electric account at a one-story warehouse on 57th Drive in Queens, which used up $9,000 worth of charges a month. The bills were usually paid in cash, which also raised a red flag for investigators. After staking Sanderlin out for several days, on May 20 DEA agents moved in to arrest her as she approached the warehouse in her gray 2010 Mercedes-Benz SUV. Sanderlin refused to allow the officers to enter the property, but they came prepared with search warrants on hand. Fictional alter-ego: Sanderlin's story brings to mind the plot of the Showtime series Weeds, which followed California widow Nancy Botwin, played by Mary-Louise Parker, who became a marijuana grower to support her family . Upon entering the property, agents discovered over 1,000 pot plants housed in two rooms, as well as nearly 2,000 other plants that had been prepared for distribution. Queens Neighbor Noria Solis said she had been smelling pot in the area since December, but assumed that the odor came from local teens smoking marijuana. Although it remains unknown how long the mother of three has been growing marijuana, she has been leaving posts on message boards like cannabis.com about hydroponic growing techniques since 2008 under the user name andi68. According to the criminal complaint, Sanderlin had several addresses in New York registered to her name, including 420 Tiffany Street in The Bronx, where she had allegedly operated another grow house. Inside Sanderlin's sprawling four-bedroom Scarsdale home worth between $1.2 and $2.4million, DEA officials said they found $6,000 in cash and books on money-laundering and growing marijuana. They also seized $7,900 from the woman's nanny, who allegedly attempted to carry out the cash inside a brown leather bag to Sanderlin's boyfriend, who has been identified as Victor Garcia. Sanderlin also has a 27-year-old son from her first marriage at age 16. He lives in Brooklyn, and according to the New York Post, he has been arrested twice for marijuana possession. Sanderlin had recently began taking part in horseback-riding competitions and took lessons with her teenage daughter at Twin Lakes Farm, a riding academy and competitive show stable in Bronxville, according to owner Scott Tarter. Tarter described Sanderlin to CNN as a ‘beginner adult rider’ who joined the academy in January after buying a big black Friesian horse. Tarter described the 45-year-old woman as a normal, caring, local mother who boarded her horse at his stables. Palatial home: Sanderlin livse in this four-bedroom, five-bath mansion worth between $1.2-$2.4million in the tony New York suburb of Scarsdale . Tarter said he was led to believe Sanderlin was in the interior design business. ‘She was just like all the local moms here,’ he said. ‘She wasn't loud. I never saw her smoking or drinking or anything that would have made me believe this.’ In March, Sanderlin won several ribbons in a local equestrian contest, but sold her horse for more than $9,000 last month and was on the market for a new jumping horse. In an interview with The Post this week, Jenji Khan, the creator of the series Weeds, which ran for eight seasons on Showtime, called Sanderlin's arrest 'a bummer' and joked that 'it's tough being a stay-at-home mom.'","Andrea Sanderlin, 45, lives with her daughters, ages 3 and 13, in lavish Scarsdale, NY, home .

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 09:53 EST, 27 October 2011 . Row: Iain Duncan Smith has had a huge row with his party's chief whip over treatment during this week's contentious EU debate . Iain Duncan Smith has threatened to quit the Government if David Cameron ever again tries to force him to vote against his Eurosceptic principles. The Work and Pensions Secretary and former Conservative leader had an extraordinary stand-up row with Chief Whip Patrick McLoughlin as MPs were ordered to oppose a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU, the Daily Mail has learned. ‘Iain said, “If you ever put me in this position again, that’s it”. He was extremely unimpressed with how the whole thing had been handled, and made clear what he would do if there’s any repeat,’ said one MP who witnessed the confrontation late on Monday night. Several Cabinet ministers are understood to share a widespread view on Tory backbenches that Mr Cameron blundered badly when he decided to turn a vote designed as a non-binding expression of the view of Parliament on Britain’s future in the EU into a trial of strength. A rebellion gathered pace, rather than receded, after the Prime Minister announced he was rushing the vote forward so he could attend himself and imposing a three-line whip – the toughest party instruction on how to vote – as well as threatening with the sack Government members who stepped out of line. The two most staunchly Eurosceptic members of the Cabinet, Mr Duncan Smith and Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, would have had to quit if they had joined a record 81 MPs who rebelled against Mr Cameron. Yesterday, in an attempt to calm the row, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude insisted that the Coalition was committed to ‘rebalancing’ Britain’s relationship with Europe. Eurosceptic Cabinet ministers are understood to have extracted a promise from the Foreign Office that it will publish an analysis on how powers might be repatriated from Brussels. But today Downing Street is accused of branding a hardcore of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs ‘sh**s’ – a claim that will further infuriate the rebels. Abuse: Former Prime Minister John Major called rebels against him 'bastards' while David Cameron's aides are allegedly calling EU rebels 'sh**s' As Mr Cameron faced renewed demands to use German calls for talks on EU treaty changes as part of the deal to save the euro as an opportunity to claw back powers from Brussels, his inner circle was said to have referred one group of rebel MPs in the most disparaging terms. Sources close to him have called Tory Eurosceptics the ‘30 or 40 sh**s’ – a latter-day equivalent of John Major’s ‘bastards’, who he blamed for disrupting his premiership over European policy – according to the Spectator magazine. In the Commons, the Prime Minister said his Government had already taken back powers by extracting the UK from the European bailout fund to shore up Greece’s economy. He branded Labour leader Ed Miliband a ‘complete mug’ for saying he did not think Brussels had too many powers. ‘The Coalition agreement does talk about rebalancing power between Britain and Europe,’ he said. Mr Cameron admitted there were differences between the Coalition parties, saying the Liberal Democrats wanted ‘some rebalancing’ and the Tories ‘a lot of rebalancing’. Mr Miliband, however, was ‘a complete mug who wants no rebalancing at all’. There are intriguing signs of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats shifting their position, raising the possibility that they might agree to an attempt to negotiate a limited repatriation of powers. Former leader Lord Ashdown said: ‘I don’t think Europe needs to be as intrusive as it is and so does Nick Clegg. ‘What we’re talking about here is Europe having a greater say in the world because you work more closely together on defence, on security, on foreign affairs, on trade, where our future safety and jobs lie in a very inhospitable world, and at the same time we allow greater variation of nations to be able to govern their affairs on all those issues that touch on the citizen. I think that’s a more sensible balance. Pressure: David Cameron, flanked by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne during PMQ's yesterday, where he called Ed Miliband 'a complete mug' ‘But where Nick is right is in saying you can’t do this by unilateral grab – you can’t do that because the others will say “Thank you very much, no”.’ Several senior figures said privately that No 10 needed to shake up its political operation and reach out urgently to disaffected backbenchers. They warned Mr Cameron’s difficulties with his party went beyond Europe, suggesting he needed to change his leadership style and break out of his ‘cliquey’ inner circle. There is particular alarm in Tory high command at the number of new MPs who joined the rebellion. Of the 2010 intake, 48 broke ranks with Mr Cameron and voted in favour of a referendum. There are now calls for Mr Cameron to broaden his inner circle to improve relations. ‘Michael Fallon [deputy party chairman] is the only Thatcherite in Downing Street,’ said one source. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, one of those who defied the Prime Minister, accused Mr Cameron of using ‘bullying tactics’ to try to force MPs into line. However, supporters of an EU referendum were warned they risk costing the party victory at the next general election. Major Tory donor and former party deputy chairman . Lord Ashcroft branded the rebellion over Europe ‘self-indulgent’, and warned the message it will send to voters is that the party does not share their priorities. He called on Tory MPs to get the issue of Europe ‘in proportion’ and focus on issues that really matter to voters – such as the economy, jobs, healthcare, crime and immigration.","The Work and Pensions Secretary has been involved in a huge row with the Tory Chief Whip .

Shaun Hooley, 38, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had already been at work for four hours when he got a call to say his partner Rebecca Asquith had gone in labour. He immediately called his employers at Tates Travel and asked for a cover driver to be organised so he could finish work early to get to the Barnsley Hospital. Shaun Hooley was sacked from his job as a bus driver for Tates Travel because he left work to see the birth of his first son, Jacob . Shaun, who had been a bus driver since the age of 21 and had worked for Tates Travel for 10 weeks, drove his bus back to the depot and was told he was sacked. ‘Obviously I wanted to be there for the birth of my first son, what father wouldn't want that? ‘I made several phone calls to the office trying to come up with a solution to the problem. I didn't say I had to leave straight away. I didn't stop the bus and just rush off. ‘I did what I thought was the responsible thing. I called the office and asked if they could arrange for a cover driver to take over my route. I said I would call back later to see what arrangements had been made and in the meantime I carried on driving the bus. ‘I made more calls but I was getting nowhere so I drove my bus back to the depot. I waited until I had dropped off all my passengers and the bus was empty before I went back. Graham Mallinson of Tates Travel said cover was arranged for Shaun Hooley but he left work in breach of his contract . He added: ‘I have been in touch with . ACAS but I was told it had always been a gentleman's agreement that a . man could always leave to go see the birth of their child . ‘Because of that no law has ever been implemented.' ‘I was told by the boss of the company I had sacked myself because of my action. I was just looking for a little understanding, it was an emergency and I wanted to be with Rebecca. ‘I have been hard working and never let them down.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:33 EST, 17 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:47 EST, 18 June 2013 . A cold-blooded hitman who has admitted to murdering 20 people has taken the stand today against James 'Whitey' Bulger and said he was 'heartbroken' when he learned that his former boss was an FBI informant. John 'The Executioner' Martorano, one of the most feared men in organized crime, said on Monday he felt betrayed by Bulger and his partner Stephen 'The Rifle' Flemmi - which he said is why he decided to turn state's witness. Martorano, 72, is a star witness in the Bulger trial. He has said he had a detailed knowledge of many of the 19 murders Bulger is accused of committing and is expected to testify about Bulger's other misdeeds during his reign of terror as a Boston organized crime boss. Turning: John Martorano, who has admitted to killing 20 people, claimed he was 'heartbroken' when he learned that his former boss has been supplying information to the government . Facing justice: James 'Whitey' Bulger is accused of murder, extortion and running a criminal enterprise . He described shooting dead rival mob member Alfred 'Indian Al' Notorangeli from a car in 1974 while Bulger rode behind him another car that was ready to block out anyone to tried to get in the way of the hit. Before Martorano killed Notorangeli, he gunned down bartender Michael Milano, who had the misfortune of driving the same car as Notorangeli. Martorano called that murder 'a mistake,' because Milano wasn't the intended target. A crime scene photo from the time reveals Milano's car riddled with bullet holes. Martorano also said he killed one of Notorangeli's henchmen, Albert Plummer, in a hail of bullets. He served just 12 years in prison after admitting to the killings under a plea deal. He now lives in a quiet suburb of Boston on a golf course. He testified that he collects Social Security. However, he was also paid $250,000 for the film rights to his story and has made $80,000 off a 2012 book about his life titled 'Hitman.' He has also been paid thousands by the U.S. government, including a check for $20,000 from the Drug Enforcement Agency gave him when he was released from prison. Martorano worked closely with Bulger and Flemmi from the 1960s until the 1990s. On the witness stand on Monday, he called the men 'my partners in crime, my best friends, my children’s godfathers,' according to the Boston Globe. 'After I found out they were informants, it sort of broke my heart,' Martorano said on the witness stand. 'They broke all trust that we had, all loyalty.' Martorano is, by his own admission, a brutal killer. He worked as the lead enforcer and hit man for Bulger's Winter Hill Gang, for whom he gunned down at least 20 people. Innocent bystander: This photo presented to jurors shows the bullet-riddled car of bartender Michael Milano. He was killed after being mistaken for a member of Bulger's rival gang . Gruesome: The Buick was riddled with bullets in a hit on Albert Plummer, who worked for a rival mob boss . His victims include two businessmen who Bulger allegedly ordered killed because they had discovered that Bulger was skimming profits of a Connecticut company.

Emily Forrest also revealed that her estranged husband had also texted her the next morning saying: 'Don’t worry I’ll call you tomorrow. I love you’ as he boarded a Channel ferry with his student girlfriend. The 32-year-old also admitted that she had warned Forrest to cut off contact with the pupil before they eloped. Mrs Forrest had earlier fled the dock at Lewes Crown Court in tears yesterday as she described their last meal together on the evening before he left her. In court: Emily Forrest, pictured, fled Lewes Crown Court in tears yesterday after giving evidence at the trial of her husband Jeremy who absconded to France with his 15-year-old pupil . Married: Jeremy and Emily Forrest together before he allegedly ran off to France with a pupil . She gestured at her . estranged husband sitting a few yards away in the dock, saying ‘It’s . really distracting’, before breaking down and being escorted from the . witness box. Judge Michael . Lawson QC called for a break in the trial at Lewes Crown Court as the . 32-year-old stood with her back to the court weeping. It was the first . time Mrs Forrest had seen her husband since he allegedly absconded to . France with his 15-year-old pupil last September and spent eight days on . the run. When Mrs Forrest returned to the court . half an hour later she continued to give evidence behind a red curtain . hidden from her husband’s gaze. She told the court she and her husband . of a year had returned to the marital home in Ringmer, East Sussex, . after dining in Lewes town centre on September 19. ‘I went to bed and . Jeremy kind of tucked me in. He told me that he loved me.’ she said. ‘When I left in the morning I was in . quite a good mood because Jeremy told me he loved me so I was like . pestering him in bed, just being silly, just singing.’ She said her mood . turned to anger when 30-year-old Forrest texted her to say he would not . be home that evening and would miss a meal with her family. They later tried to telephone each . other and, after missing each other’s calls, Forrest sent a text saying: . ‘Don’t worry I’ll call you tomorrow. I love you.’ Parent: Julie Forrest, the mother of married teacher Jeremy Forrest outside Lewes Crown Court yesterday morning, where her son (right) faces an abduction charge . The text is believed to have been sent . minutes after Forrest boarded a Channel ferry with the schoolgirl, the . court has previously heard. Mrs Forrest also told how just a week . before her husband vanished they had a ‘really good evening’ at a . concert in Tunbridge Wells. ‘He said that I looked young. He said I looked 21. He was suggesting that was a good thing,’ she said. She told the court their marriage had . been in difficulty and they had had sex only once in the four months . before his disappearance. She said: ‘He was staying out a lot more, . drinking a lot of alcohol, coming back in the morning, not telling me . where he was. It was hard.’ At court: The mother of the 15-year-old schoolgirl who eloped to France with married teacher Jeremy Forrest arrives at Lewes Crown Court today . She said Forrest started using his Twitter account and she noticed that he was sending messages to pupils at his school. Despite the problems, Forrest raised . the subject of them having children together during the 2012 summer . holidays, she told the court. She said: ‘Jeremy brought it up quite a . lot – “When are we going to have kids? And do you want kids?”. I just . thought it was a bit weird because the relationship wasn’t great.’ The court has been told Forrest . started having sex with the schoolgirl, whose identity is protected by . law, around the start of June 2012. Earlier, the child’s mother said she . feared the worst after her daughter vanished last September. Trembling . and clasping her hands as she gave evidence, she said: ‘I thought she . was dead. And I did ask the police that as well.’ The girl’s mother also told how . Forrest phoned her in July, a few weeks before he allegedly abducted . her, to quash rumours that were involved in some way. She said: ‘I had never spoken to him . before. He said that there had been rumours at school that him and the . girl had been having a relationship and he was seriously concerned for . his career. ‘He said he wanted to nip it all in the bud before the school started again in September. ‘He said she was being a bit of a . pain. He said that she was hanging around him. He said he could not . allow this to ruin his career. I felt like I was coaching and consoling . him because he was becoming upset.’ She said Forrest was angry that her . daughter was doing nothing to stop the rumours, adding: ‘I offered my . apologies for my daughter’s behaviour. He kept going over and over again . about his career. The schoolgirl's mother told Lewes Crown Court she 'went mad' at her daughter when she confronted her about Forrest . ‘He said he did not want it to get . worse.’ She told the court she later confronted her daughter over . Forrest’s claims. She said: ‘I went mad. I was mortified my daughter . could put someone in this position. ‘Clearly I was upset and I had a go at her. She said it was not true. She was crying and broke down.’ The mother told the court how on the . morning of her daughter’s disappearance she was up unusually early and . that when she left she was ‘jumping around like a jellybean’. The teenager returned after school to . pick up her bag for a sleepover with a friend, her mother said, adding: . ‘She came over to me, jumped all over me. She would do that anyway. ‘This particular time she grabbed me and said “Mum, I love you”.’ Hours later the schoolgirl and Forrest took an overnight ferry from Dover to Calais, the court has heard.

"By . David Wilkes . UPDATED: . 17:40 EST, 26 December 2011 . It was one of the most  controversial events of the Falklands War. The sinking of the Argentine warship the General Belgrano by a Royal Navy submarine with the loss of 323 lives led to accusations of unnecessary force by Britain and became a cause celebre for anti-war campaigners. It was claimed the ship was returning to its home port and was outside an exclusion zone imposed by Whitehall. Invasion: The Argentinian cruiser General . Belgrano sinks after being hit by a torpedo as its crew takes to life . rafts in the South Atlantic Ocean during the Falklands War in 1982 . But now, just months before the 30th anniversary of the attack, a new book based on a top secret report has revealed that the  Belgrano was heading into the exclusion zone when it was hit. The contents of the report have never been publicly revealed before, but its existence was hinted at by Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister at the time, a year after the attack of May 2, 1982. Quizzed about the Belgrano by teacher Diana Gould on BBC TV’s Nationwide programme during the 1983 election campaign, Mrs Thatcher said: ‘One day, all of the facts, in about 30 years’ time, will be published.’ Resolute: Margaret Thatcher sent a task force of 100 ships to regain control of the Falklands Islands after the Argentine junta invaded . The book’s author, Major David Thorp, tells how after the war Mrs Thatcher ‘requested a complete and thorough investigation into the sinking as pressure was building from opposition parliamentary backbenchers . . . for a ministerial enquiry’. Major Thorp, who spent 34  years working as a signals expert in an elite military intelligence unit,  was ‘provided with every conceivable document, file, report and note imaginable that related to, or included  the name, Belgrano’. These included the Official War Diary from HMS Conqueror, the hunter-killer submarine which fired the two torpedoes that sunk the Belgrano in the South Atlantic. All the information was covered by the highest security classification. It is thought that much of the material will be made public via the National Archives next year under the 30-year rule on the release of secret documents. Major Thorp, now 72, was in  charge of a signals interception section hidden on the amphibious warship Intrepid as it travelled with the Task Force. In his book The Silent Listener, he writes: ‘Shortly after the UK’s announcement of the exclusion zone, the Argentinian Navy HQ notified its warships, possibly for the purpose of re-grouping, of a pre-arranged rendezvous (RV) point. ‘When the co-ordinates for the RV were plotted on a map, the actual location, though east of the Falkland Islands, was nevertheless inside the 200 nautical miles exclusion zone. ‘Some considerable time prior to the . Conqueror firing its torpedoes, my analysis revealed that the General . Belgrano had been instructed to alter course and head in the direction . of the RV inside the exclusion zone. ‘The findings of my report stated that . the destination of the vessel  was not to her home port as the . Argentine Junta stated, but the objective of the ship was to relocate to . a pre-arranged RV within the exclusion zone.’ Sunk: The Argentinian destroyer Belgrano was torpedoed by HMS Conqueror with the loss of 368 lives . Major Thorp’s report was never disclosed by Mrs Thatcher because she did not want to reveal the extent of Britain’s ability to intercept enemy electronic and radio signals. The book was cleared for publication by the security services. The strike on the Belgrano signalled the first loss of life in the Falklands conflict. Two days later Argentina hit back with a missile attack on the British destroyer HMS Sheffield, killing 20. The sea battle continued for many more weeks, then the conflict turned to the land before the Argentine forces finally surrendered and peace was declared on June 20, 1982.","Argentina destroyer was sunk by British submarine with loss of 368 lives .

A call centre made famous by a BBC reality TV series has been fined £225,000 for harassing families with nuisance calls. The BBC has portrayed the company’s millionaire boss ‘Big Nev’ Wilshire as a lovable rogue, a consumer champion and even a hero. However, the sinister reality is that his staff, who are sometimes seen dancing their way through calls, wearing fancy dress and taking part in bizarre motivational games, are causing real distress. The BBC series ‘The Call Centre‘ has heavily promoted Mr Wilshire and his business, which is based in Swansea and operates under the name Save Britain Money Ltd. Scroll down to watch . Mr Wilshire's companies pestered people who had registered with an official watchdog to block marketing calls . Staff use various brand names, including ‘We Claim You Gain’, when cold calling homes to find people who might be able to make a claim for mis-sold payment protection insurance(PPI). They also promote government energy saving home improvement schemes, such as loft insulation, under a brand called Nationwide Energy Services. The idea is that any leads are then sold on to third party specialist firms for cash, so generating big profits for the company which has a turnover of more than £25million a year. The calls cause real annoyance to millions, while there is evidence that some elderly people feel bullied and harassed. Mr Wilshire’s companies went further and pestered people who had registered with an official watchdog to block marketing calls. We Claim You Gain (WCYG) has been fined £100,000, which is the first time a company has been given a penalty for nuisance calls related to PPI. The fine for Nationwide Energy Services(NES), whose name has been heard many times on the BBC programme, was a higher £125,000. The calls cause annoyance to millions, while there is evidence that some elderly people feel bullied . Mr Wilshire's companies pestered people who had registered with a watchdog to block marketing calls . Staff are sometimes seen dancing their way through calls and wearing fancy dress . The fines were handed down by the Information Commissioners Office(ICO) as part of a wider crackdown by a number of watchdogs on cold call rogues. ICO director of operations, Simon Entwisle, said: ‘The public have told us that they are fed up with the constant bombardment of nuisance calls. ‘While the activities of Nev and his call centre employees have provided entertainment for many, they hide a bigger problem within the cold calling industry. ‘People have the legal right not to receive marketing calls and these companies have paid the price for failing to respect people’s wishes.’ The ICO is calling on the Government to give it greater powers to crack down on the rogues responsible for calls and texts to landlines and mobile phones. ‘We’d like to see it made easier for us to issue penalties to companies who are breaking the rules,’ said Mr Entwisle. Millions have become so-fed up with nuisance marketing calls for these and other services that they have registered with the Telephone Preference Service(TPS), which should block them. However,  Mr Wilshire and his staff failed to check targets before making calls. Some 2,700 complaints were made, which is likely to be only a fraction of the people who were wrongly called. The firm had a record turnover of £25 million last year and was named . the second best place to work in the UK on The Sunday Times list . The BBC Three series presents life . inside the calls centre as something of a comic soap opera. The . difficulties of staff, whether it is the inability to get a date, . psychological problems or the struggle to make it through a call without . being abused are presented as entertainment. At the same time ‘Big Nev’ is portrayed as an eccentric father figure who sweeps up waifs and strays, giving them a chance of a career. He has been turned into a TV celebrity and given star billing on The One Show and BBC Breakfast. Publicity material describes him as ‘a very hands on boss who makes it his business to know the ins and outs of the call centre workers’ professional and private lives.’ It adds: ‘Nev is a big fan of John Wayne, who was one of the good guys as he puts it.’ At the same time, Mr Wilshire, aged 53, has taken full advantage of the free publicity. The firm’s website boasts: ‘Nev may have once being Swansea’s best kept secret but the man with a glide in his stride and a song to sing is now a familiar face to TV viewers around the UK.’ The company claims its work helps struggling consumers save money. Its 700 staff telephone 15,000 people a week and another 500 in the field call another 10,000 homes. The firm had a record turnover of £25 million last year, while it was named the second best place to work in the UK on The Sunday Times list. 'Big Nev' is portrayed as an eccentric father figure who sweeps up waifs and strays, giving them a chance of a career . The free publicity offered by the BBC will help the firm, which has been named the 26th fastest growing company in the UK on The Sunday Times Virgin Fast Track 100, to win new customers. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Thousands of people have told us they are sick and tired of being bombarded with nuisance calls and texts, so it’s good to see the ICO doing more to punish companies who are breaking the rules. ‘Given the scale of this problem, it’s time for the Government and telecoms providers to step in too, with new laws and new technology to tackle this scourge on people’s everyday lives.’ Mr Wilshire was unusually publicity shy yesterday. The firm said: ‘Neither NES nor WCUG accept that issuing monetary penalty notices is the appropriate course of action. Both have made the necessary representations to the ICO and will be issuing a formal appeal shortly. ‘While this process is on-going it would be inappropriate for both companies to comment further. We remain committed to the best interests of our customers at all time.’ The BBC defended the series saying: ‘The Call Centre, like all BBC programmes, went through robust editorial processes and compliance and we are confident that the programme is a balanced and fair representation of life in that place of work.’","The BBC Three series presents life inside the call centre as something of a comic soap opera .

He is to draw on the experiences he had with his own father and will describe the family unit as the backbone of a successful society. According to the Daily Telegraph, he will add that the family should be a place where people can expect to be valued as more than 'an anonymous digit by an over-bureaucratic state, a ""unit of economic production"", or just another consumer or voter'. He will say: 'Committed, faithful fathers are good for their children - for their educational achievement, psychological well-being and their social behaviour.'

Iain Duncan Smith had planned a new . ‘temperature test’ but the move has been blocked by Downing Street, . partly because of concerns that some pensioners would lose out in a mild . winter. The move means an extra 120,000 expat . pensioners living in Europe are now likely to get the payments, which . were restricted to those who had moved abroad after retiring in Britain. Clegg said: ‘We need to have a debate about . welfare for the wealthy. That is being blocked at the moment because the . Conservatives don’t want to have that debate, and that’s why we can’t . move forward with the wider reforms to our welfare system.’ The Liberal Democrat leader also . hinted he had not abandoned hopes of getting a deal in the tense . negotiations surrounding the Comprehensive Spending Review for 2015-6. 'I think the fact we are asking people on low incomes to pay through their taxes to basically pay the fuel bills of people who don't need to heat their homes because they are living in sunny parts of Europe and maybe didn't even work here, I think that lifts the lid on a wider problem in our welfare system,' Mr Clegg told the BBC One Andrew Marr programme. 'Yes, we need welfare reform. We have already made, with my full support, significant savings to welfare. Warning: Mr Clegg, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, said that handouts to the elderly should therefore not automatically be exempt from cuts . 'But if you're going to make further welfare savings, which I am prepared to look at, then you've got to start at the top, you've got to start with welfare for the wealthy, benefits paid to the rich and the retired.' The Labour Party announced earlier this month it would strip the wealthiest pensioners of the winter fuel allowance if it wins the 2015 General Election. And speaking last weekend, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he planned to include pension spending inside Labour's proposal for a welfare cap - adding later that the party was committed to the coalition's 'triple lock' pension increase reforms. David Cameron has pledged benefits . for older pensioners will not be cut before the election, and Tory . sources last night confirmed that included the period of the new . spending review. ‘This is non-negotiable,’ a source said. ‘The Prime . Minister made a pledge and we will stick to it.’ Labour opposed Coalition measures to bring down the welfare bill, including a £26,000 cap on households and below inflation benefit increases. Last week, in an attempt to regain credibility on the economy, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the party was prepared to back the Government’s idea of a cap on so-called ‘structural’ welfare spending for three years from 2015-16.","Clegg questioned whether all over 75s people should get free TV licences .

It is claimed that Brockhouse, who worked at Swaleside prison in Kent, received £1,750 from The Sun for information about prison life and inmates, and £900 from the People. He is facing the conspiracy charge, and one count of misconduct in public office between February 2009 and June 2011.

'It is alleged that information provided by Lee Brockhouse included that relating to the movement of prisoners, prison procedures and methods used by prisoners to smuggle items into prison.' Prosecutors also decided that no further action will be taken against deputy news editor of the Sun John Sturgis after he came under investigation. Parker and Brockhouse will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on July 18 .

A sheep farmer who emigrated from the UK to Spain as a teenager has become the first British-born elected mayor in the country. Carmen McPhee won a vote to lead the farming village of Villaquejida in the province of León, in north west Spain last week. But Ms McPhee will have her work cut out leading the 950-strong community which has faced swingeing government spending cuts as a result of the country's well-documented economic crisis. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'We need to review the whole of the water system and there are many roads here that are still mud tracks. Born in London and brought up in Luton, Bedfordshire, Ms McPhee is only the second reported British mayor to have taken office in Spain. She was elected to the region's council as part of the Union of the People of León party in 2011 and went on to become the town's mayor as part of a power-sharing deal with coalition partners last week. Ms McPhee had a bilingual upbringing as her mother was originally from Villafer in Spain. She spent her summers in the village, which is located in the municipality of Villaquejida, and eventually moved to begin a new life in Spain as a 19-year-old. The 45-year-old met her husband Mario Fernandez in Spain and the pair have two daughters, aged 22 and 23. As well as her political career, Ms McPhee helps the family run a farm of around 800 sheep, whose milk is used to make tangy León cheese. She is the only British ex-pat in her community and is known to locals as 'Carmen la inglesa' or Carmen the Englishwoman, mainly she says because no one knows how to pronounce her surname.

This picture shows the moment two carers were apparently found asleep after allegedly unplugging the alarms of elderly patients so that they would not be disturbed. Titilayo Ajala and Henretta Offae are accused of falling asleep during their 9pm to 7am night-shift at Westlands care home in Olney, near Milton Keynes. Aylesbury Crown Court was told that care home manager Salina Ballard and a colleague took the picture during an unannounced 3am check. Ajala, 56, from Milton Keynes, and Offae, 41, from Derby, deny 19 counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks . capacity, between January 1, 2011 and August 19, 2011. Shocking: A jury was shown this picture of two care home assistants Titilayo Ajala and Henretta Offae apparently asleep on the night-shift after allegedly unplugging the alarms of the elderly and infirm people . The prosecution alleges the defendants left their patients - aged from 75 . years to 100 years - unable to call for help. The prosecution told the jury the pair . disabled alarms and put extra incontinence pads on the residents, so . they could sleep and would not have to change their soiled garments. No paperwork was filled out, which they were required to do in a night log, the jury was told. The care home assistants were allegedly discovered fast asleep in lounge armchairs on August 19 with a fan heater running by their care home manager Salina Ballard. The home, run by St Andrews Care Home Ltd, charges £580 pounds per . week per patient. Mr Moore told the hearing that mats were placed at the side of the residents' beds which would set off an alarm if they fell. However, . the prosecution says 11 of the mats had been disabled so if the . residents had fallen in the night, no alarm would have sounded. Prosecutor Neil Moore told the jury: 'The prosecution case, in a nutshell, is that when they worked together during [their shifts] they would disable alarm systems, which would otherwise alert them if one of these elderly residents fell out of their beds. Henretta Offae, pictured left, and Titilayo Ajala, pictured, right, both deny 19 charges - one for every resident . affected - of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks a capacity, . between January 1 and August 19, 2011 . 'They would pad the residents up with . extra incontinence pads or place waterproof sheets on the bed so they . didn't need to be changed. 'Basically, . the two defendants would then tuck themselves up in warm clothing in . front of a television in one of the lounges and have a night's sleep. 'Therefore, the prosecution says, putting the welfare of the elderly residents at risk.' The 17th Century building caters for high risk elderly people who suffer from dementia or are unable to look after themselves. The trial heard today that the carers were allowed a 45-minute break, but not at the same time. Mr Moore said it was considered 'gross misconduct' if they slept. Offae, who was known by the name Mapel Mensah, of St Chad's Road, Derby, worked at the home from October 24, 2010, and Ajala, of Fishermead, Milton Keynes, joined on August 9, 2009. Mr Moore said after Mrs Ballard and Ms May arrived at the home, they took it in turns to check on the residents, before taking a picture of the two defendants half an hour later. The prosecutor told the court that when Ms Ajala woke up she said 'My God Salina, what are you doing here?' He added: 'Mrs . Ballard replied by telling her she had been watching her sleep for half . an hour and informed her some of the fall pads had been unplugged. The defendants were working at Westlands Care Home in Olney at the time of the alleged incident . Care home manager Salina Ballard claims she found the two defendants asleep when she carried out an unannounced 3am check . 'Mrs Ajala said: ""Salina, Barbara, you have to forgive me."" 'Ms Offae said: ""I hold my hands up, you caught me. What we have done is inexcusable"". They had been caught red-handed and Mrs Offae at that time accepted it.' Both were dismissed from their jobs that day and were later arrested by police. Both women denied the allegations when they were quizzed by detectives. Mr . Moore said: 'They neglected each and every resident. They went to . sleep, 11 pressure mat alarms had been disabled so if any of these had . fallen in the night they wouldn't have been found until the defendants . decided to wake up. 'None . of the residents had the more absorbent night pads on, they hadn't been . changed since the afternoon shift and not at midnight when they should . have been. 'Some of . residents were fitted with two incontinence pads which should never have . been the case. Some had pads shoved underneath them. 'Pads were soaked with urine and in one case faeces.' Giving evidence Mrs Ballard said sleeping on the job was 'absolutely forbidden.' She said: 'It amounts to gross misconduct. We're responsible for our residents' well-being. They (the defendants) were there to do a job to protect them (the residents).' Mrs Ballard refuted suggestions by the defence barristers that the defendants were not asleep and were dozing or 'resting their eyes' during a break. 'They were asleep,' she said. 'I was standing there for half an hour and I took a photo. I stood watching them sleeping.' The four-day trial before Judge Francis Sheridan continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:58 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:27 EST, 18 June 2013 . Legal action: Caroline Mathiesen is suing her former lawyer over claims that mistakes cost her a much larger divorce payout . A wealthy mother who claims her multi-million-pound divorce settlement was far smaller than it should have been because her solicitor was negligent is suing for up to £15million. Caroline Mathiesen, 51, told the High Court that the solicitor failed to stop her ex-husband taking up to £2million a year from the family firm and lavishing it on children from another marriage and a mistress. Company director Per Mathiesen, an 82-year-old father of seven, should have been restricted to an income of £250,000, with small annual increases, under an agreement drawn up in 2003 with the advice of her solicitor, she said. But lawyers representing her at the High Court said that, because of the way it was worded, Mr Mathiesen was able to take huge annual sums from the company, leaving her massively out of pocket when they divorced. Her barrister, Roger Stewart QC, claimed: 'Per Mathiesen was having an extra-marital affair. He had been hiding money from Caroline Mathiesen and was, without her consent, diverting away significant part of the family's joint wealth to his older children and possibly to his mistress.' The couple, who had three children, married in 1993 when Mrs Mathiesen was 32 and Mr Mathiesen was 62. They enjoyed a jetset lifestyle, with a £4.5million Grade-II home in Britain and another luxurious home in France. Mr Mathiesen once bought his wife a £230,000 horse as a gift. But Mrs Mathiesen, of Exton, Hampshire, claimed she did not know how great her husband's earnings really were until 2002, when a friend on the school run told her he was on the Sunday Times Rich List. 'I was so shocked, I was flabbergasted,' she told Mrs Justice Asplin, adding that by then she had formed a 'deep distrust' of her husband, whom she suspected of having an affair. She said she went to John Seigal, of the law firm Clintons, telling him she wanted an agreement with 'full protection' to stop her husband taking large sums out of the family's thriving shower business, Matki, for his own use. 'I told him that there were severe problems in the marriage and I had very good reason not to trust Per and that I couldn't go on like this,' she told the court. Mrs Mathiesen said she believed the agreement drawn up by Clintons limited her husband's salary to £250,000, with a 5-per-cent annual increase. Dividends and bonuses from the company would go into a joint account to pay for the family's living expenses. But the agreement did not prevent Mr Mathiesen from being paid huge sums because it linked his pay rises to the company's burgeoning profits. She told the court: 'What I was so in the dark about was how he was able to take so much more than I thought he was supposed to be taking.' Mr Stewart said Mr Seigal knew what Mrs Mathiesen had wanted to achieve in the 2003 agreement and failed to secure it, resulting in 'uncontrolled withdrawals of funds' from Matki by her husband. Claim: Caroline Mathiesen said she went to John Seigal, of law firm Clintons (pictured), and told him she wanted an agreement with 'full protection' to stop her husband taking large sums out of the family's thriving shower business . Compensation claim: The divorcee is suing in the High Court for £15million and alleges negligence . 'Had she been properly advised, she . would never have assented to the shareholders' agreement in the form in . which it was executed,' he added. Mrs Mathiesen received 45 per cent of . the matrimonial assets in a divorce judgment last year, but says her . slice should have been worth far more. Denying all the claims, Clintons' barrister, Michael Soole QC, insisted the £250,000-a-year figure had . never been mentioned and Mrs Mathiesen had not been in a position to . make demands, but only to negotiate. The agreement limited her husband's . withdrawals from the firm to those which would allow Matki to 'grow and . prosper in the future with sufficient retained funds', he said. He added that there was no evidence . that the amounts her husband took compromised that aim and told the . court Mr Mathiesen's salary had only increased so quickly because it was . linked to soaring profits. The hearing continues.","Caroline Mathiesen, 51, said the lawyer should have made sure her husband only paid himself £250,000-a-year from the family business .

He is accused of beating jews with his bare hands and a dog whip . A 98-year-old former police officer has been charged today by Hungarian prosecutors for abusing thousands of Jews and sending them to Nazi death camps during World War II. Prosecutors say Laszlo Csatary was the chief of an internment camp for Jews at a brick factory in Kosice - a Slovak city then part of Hungary - in May 1944. He is alleged to have overseen the deportation of 15,700 Jewish detainees to concentration camps. The pensioner is also accused of beating them with his bare hands and a dog whip. He also allegedly refused to allow ventilation holes to be cut into the walls of a railcar crammed with 80 Jews being deported. Csatary 'willfully assisted in the unlawful execution and torture of the Jews deported from (Kosice) to concentration camps in territories occupied by the Germans,' prosecutors said in a statement. Csatary, who has denied the charges, was first detained by Hungarian authorities in July 2012 after his case was made public by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish organization active in hunting down Nazis who have yet to be brought to justice. Budapest Investigative Prosecutors' Office spokesman Bettina Bagoly said that since Csatary has been charged with war crimes, the case is considered to be of special importance and the first session of the trial must be held within three months. Bagoly also said that the prosecution has asked the court to tighten the conditions of Csatary's house arrest, which were loosened by a judge in April. Csatary lived for decades in Canada and worked as an art dealer before leaving in 1997 just before he was due to appear at a deportation hearing. His Canadian citizenship was later revoked. Though Csatary is currently expected to go on trial in Hungary, it is also possible that he could be extradited to Slovakia, where he was convicted in absentia in 1948. In January, a court in Kosice changed the sentence in that case from death to life in prison, since the death penalty is banned in the European Union. That could open the way for his extradition. Bagoly said prosecutors, who requested information in the case from Slovakia, Canada and Israel, had not yet received an extradition request from Slovakia. Accused: The 98-year-old is alleged to have been the chief of an internment camp for 12,000 Jews . Case: Csatary was a senior police officer at the time he is accused of committing the crimes . Efraim Zuroff, head of the Wiesenthal . Center's Jerusalem office, who brought Csatary to the attention of . Hungarian officials, said he planned to attend the trial. 'We welcome the indictment and call . upon authorities to expedite the trial in light of the defendant's . advanced age,' Zuroff said by telephone from Israel. 'This is a very . strong reminder of the importance of achieving justice even many years . after the crimes were committed' Csatary was placed under house arrest in Hungary after it was revealed he was secretly living in Budapest.

The mother of Stephen Lawrence yesterday thanked the pop stars who have agreed to perform at a special tribute concert to mark the 20th anniversary of her son’s murder. Doreen Lawrence said Stephen’s love of music had encouraged her to organise a one-off concert featuring performances from artists including Plan B, Tinie Tempah, Jessie J and Emeli Sandé. Proceeds from the event, which will take place at London’s O2 Arena on September 29, will go to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust. Stephen’s mother, who has campaigned for justice since her son’s death in 1993, said she was delighted to have so many artists involved, and that it would be ‘very emotional’ to see them on stage. ‘Having so many young artists supporting the Trust in this way is getting the message across that we, as a society, need to make a difference,’ she said. ‘I want young people to feel inspired, be confident and have hope in their own future. ‘We work every day to empower youth and we’re so proud that the music industry is joining us in reaching out to change the lives of young people.’ Unity: a concert for Stephen Lawrence, is part of the SL20 campaign to mark the anniversary of Stephen’s murder. It aims to highlight the legacy of the 18-year-old aspiring architect and the work undertaken by the charity in his name. ‘I would like Stephen to be remembered as a young man who had a future,’ added Mrs Lawrence. ‘Had he been given the chance to survive maybe he would have been the one to bridge the gap between black and white. He didn’t distinguish - he saw people as people. 'The main aim of the concert is to raise funds for the Trust. The other side of it is getting people to support it and let them know what it is doing, supporting young people.’ Joining in: Mrs Lawrence (centre) is pictured with Kesi Dryden and Piers Aggett (far left) of Rudimental, Emeli Sandé (centre left), Harley and Jordan from Rizzle Kicks (centre right) and Leon Rolle of Rudimental (right) Making a difference: Scottish singer Sandé, pictured with Mrs Lawrence, said she was honoured to be involved .

A prolific ex-convict who has committed almost 500 offences was today jailed for 10 years for breaking his cellmate out of prison in a terrifying gunpoint hold up. Dangerous Garry Cowan, 44, held a replica handgun to a female prison officer's head as she accompanied Andrew Farndon to hospital in January last year and threatened to shoot her if he was not released. The pair, who had shared a cell at Highpoint jail in Stradishall, Suffolk, had hatched a plot to free Farndon, 27, before Cowan was released two weeks earlier. On January 25 last year Farndon was working out in the prison gym when he inflicted a 24cm cut across his shoulder and told guards he had been attacked in a toilet. It was all part of a plan to get him sent to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds where portly Cowan - who has a history of carrying out knifepoint raids - would be waiting. Farndon, who was serving an indefinite jail term for smashing a motorist's head with a claw hammer and baseball bat, was escorted by prison officers Kim Lockwood and Chris Matson. The offender - who later went on the run and threatened two policemen at gunpoint - was flanked by the duo who took him to hospital in a security approved taxi from A1 Cars in Bury St Edmunds. They arrived at the hospital at 6.51pm with Ms Lockwood handcuffed to Farndon with Mr Matson carrying the keys. As they got out of the car Cowan, who is originally from St Andrews in Scotland, jumped into action with the firearm. 'He pointed it at her right temple,' said Gregory Perrins, prosecuting, at the Old Bailey. 'Let him go, take the handcuffs off',' the barrister said Cowan demanded. The pair, who had shared a cell at Highpoint jail in Stradishall, Suffolk, had hatched a plot to free Farndon . Cowan told Ms Lockwood: 'You've got 30 seconds to get it off or I will shoot you.' Ms Lockwood told the court she thought she was going to die. The offenders fled towards a Ford Escort in a nearby car park and Cowan shouted back warnings not to follow or he would open fire. Police searched the area and found a homemade balaclava with Cowan's DNA on it. That evening traffic cameras picked them up driving through Cambridgeshire and they were tracked going to Scotland. Cowan, who began offending in 1983, was arrested in the home of another ex-convict at 2am on January 28 in New Cumnock, East Ayrshire. He gave a false name and address. Police discovered a 'blueprint' for the raid with a list of items needed. Farndon has nine convictions for 18 offences including setting fire to his mother's home, burglary, assault and criminal damage . Cowan denied assisting an offender and possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence but was convicted by a jury. Farndon pleaded guilty to escaping from custody. After going on the run Farndon, whose indefinite sentence was handed down in 2007 after ramming another vehicle and launching the hammer attack, went on the run. The car he was travelling in crashed and two plain clothed police officers went to help but he turned a gun on them - the same one Cowan used to free him. He pointed the firearm at one officer and demanded their car but one of the officers struggled with him and managed to knock the gun from his grip. He was arrested and in May this year jailed in Glasgow for six years. The earliest he would have been able to apply for parole would have been May 2017, the Old Bailey heard. Cowan and Farndon were convicted over the escape last December but their sentencing was delayed by a series of doctors' reports into Farndon's sanity. He is awaiting the assessment of doctors from high security Ashworth Hospital near Liverpool. His legal team are waiting to see if Ashworth - where Moors Murderer Ian Brady resides - can accommodate him. He has however been diagnosed as having two severe personality disorders. Cowan and Farndon, guarded by six dock officers today, have extensive criminal pasts. Former heroin addict Cowan has 41 convictions for 481 offences committed under 10 aliases. They stretch from minor dishonesty matters to terrifying shop raids. In July 2002 he was jailed for armed robbery. He entered a shop brandishing a meat cleaver and with tights over his head. In June 2003 he was back before the courts for burglary and two robberies. In one, wearing stockings over his head, he held a knife to a cashier's throat. In the other robbery he threatened two young shopworkers with knives. Farndon has nine convictions for 18 offences including setting fire to his mother's home, burglary, assault and criminal damage. He said his motivation for the jail break was to give his sick mother his kidney as she needs a transplant. He will be sentenced on July 2. Sentencing Cowan to successive sentences of three years for possession of the firearm and seven years for assisting an offender, Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC, said the break-out took considerable planning. 'You remained in contact with Farndon by means of the illicit mobile telephone which he had in custody,' he told Cowan. 'This wasn't to be an escape from the building but more serious through the threat of force.' The judge commended both prison officers for their professionalism.","Garry Cowan, 44, held a replica handgun to a female prison officer's head as she accompanied Andrew Farndon to hospital .

Lord Steel, who introduced the 1967 Bill which legalised the practice, said it was 'thoroughly undesirable' that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least abortion . The father of the Abortion Act has spoken out to warn of the growing ‘problem’ of women having repeat terminations as an alternative to contraception. Lord Steel, who introduced the 1967 Bill which legalised the practice, said it was ‘thoroughly undesirable’ that 36 per cent of terminations are now to those who have already had at least one abortion. In a dramatic intervention, he said it was ‘never the purpose’ of his historic reform that tens of thousands of women would use abortion as a ‘form of contraception’. The indication that the former Liberal leader, who brought forward his Bill when he was a young backbencher, now believes his legislation has gone too far seems set to reignite the debate over abortion. Latest figures show that in 2011, there were 189,931 abortions, of which no fewer than 68,105 were on women who had already had a foetus terminated - a proportion of 36 per cent. This compares to 64,303 repeat terminations the year before - a proportion of 34 per cent. Repeat abortions cost the cash-strapped NHS almost £1million every single week. Lord Steel made his comments in the Lords last week during a question-and-answer session on abortion with health minister Earl Howe. He asked the minister: ‘Will he confirm that there has been a welcome drop in the total number of abortions recently, but that there is still a problem of what are called repeat abortions, where women present who are clearly using abortion as a form of contraception, which is thoroughly undesirable?’ Earl Howe replied: ‘The abortion rate across England and Wales has been static since 2009. The good news is that the abortion rate for women under 18 has gone down. There was a 9.6 per cent decrease in the rate between 2010 and 2011. ‘On repeat abortions, the news is not so good. The proportion of repeat abortions for women who had abortions in 2011 was 36 per cent. The figure was higher than it had been the previous year, which is a matter for concern.’ Latest figures show that in 2011, there were 189,931 abortions, of which no fewer than 68,105 were on women who had already had a foetus terminated - a proportion of 36 per cent . The 2011 figures on repeat abortions show that many women are going back time and time again for terminations - a sign, according to Lord Steel, that they are being used as a form of contraception. Some 17,241 women were on at least their third abortion; 434 were on at least their sixth and - astoundingly - 76 were on at least their eighth. Speaking later to the Daily Mail, Lord Steel said: ‘It is odd that so many women present for repeat abortions, some more than twice, which does suggest they are treating abortion as contraception.‘This was never the purpose of the 1967 reform.’ Josephine Quintavalle, of the Pro-Life Alliance, said: ‘David Steel needs to face the reality of the provision of abortion in this country, that it is not just being provided for women in dramatic need but is available on demand. ‘It was verging on the ingenuous of him to imagine when he brought forward his legislation in 1967 that abortion wouldn’t end up being available on demand. The 2011 figures on repeat abortions show that many women are going back time and time again for terminations - a sign, according to Lord Steel, that they are being used as a form of contraception . ‘The trouble is that many people think there is nothing wrong with repeat abortions. They say: abortion is either right or wrong, so if you can have one you should be able to have as many as you can ask for.’ Ann Furedi, chief executive of abortion provider BPAS, said: ‘It is unfair to women and wrong for politicians to assume that women can live a modern life and not have the option of accessing abortion services. ‘Too many politicians - particularly as they get older- forget that abortion is a part of life. ‘ . She said repeat terminations happen because ‘Women in their teens and their 20s are often very fertile and find it difficult to manage their fertility by contraception alone’. ‘Women are not using abortion simply as another method of birth control,’ she said. ‘What is happening is that contraception fails, or sometimes we fail to use it properly. ‘When abortion is legal and easily available, it is not surprising if women use it - and that is not a bad thing.’","36% of abortions are to those who have already had one procedure .

Disgraced: Sir Fred Goodwin, chairman of the Princes Trust Scotland at a charity clay pigeon shoot event near Dundee, 2003 . The bosses of failed banks should face jail or lose the right to claim bonuses for up to ten years for 'reckless misconduct', a report recommends today. The new criminal offence would make sure that top executives paid for their 'shocking and widespread malpractice', the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards said. Not a single British banker has been sent to prison since the financial crash began in 2007, but the proposed legislation would make sure they would be 'on the hook' in future, it added. As well as prison terms, errant . bankers would face heavy fines and bans from the financial services . industry, as well as curbs on bonuses and the threat of pensions being . cancelled. Commission chairman Andrew Tyrie MP . said: 'Under our recommendations, senior bankers who seriously damage . their banks or put taxpayers' money at risk can expect to be fined, . banned from the industry, or, in the worst cases, go to jail. That has . not been the case up to now. 'This deals with some of the senior people who many feel got off lightly last time and for whose mistakes we are still paying.' In its 527-page report, the commission . found that 'deep lapses in standards have been commonplace'. 'It is not . just bankers that need to change. The actions of regulators and . governments have contributed to the decline in standards,' said Tory MP . Mr Tyrie. The commission of MPs and peers calls . for a sweeping overhaul of top pay, with City regulators given new . powers to cancel pension rights and payoffs for the bosses of bailed-out . banks. It also wants watchdogs to be able to . force banks to defer bonus payments for up to a decade, in order to . prevent bosses reaping large rewards for risky, short-term strategies . that subsequently lead to losses. 'The rewards for fleeting, often . illusory success have been huge, while the penalties for failure have . been much smaller, or non-existent,' Mr Tyrie said. However, John Cridland, director . general of the CBI, said: 'There are tough criminal sanctions in the UK . for those who engage in fraudulent behaviour. Enforcing those must come . before the introduction of new sanctions.' The findings of the commission, set up . last summer in the wake of the Libor scandal, are not binding, but the . Government is being urged to implement its recommendations 'in full'. The proposals will now be handed to ministers. The reforms will aim to . prevent a repeat of the bailouts and scandals such as Libor . rate-rigging, where bosses have walked away with large payoffs and . pensions. But bankers will not be targeted . retrospectively. Fred Goodwin, who left RBS in ruins but is still . receiving a pension of £342,000 a year for life, will be unaffected. Nor will any legislation ensnare . former HBOS boss James Crosby, who will collect £406,000 of his . £580,000-a-year retirement deal. Under current rules, senior bankers . have been able to evade punishment by claiming they were not personally . responsible for collapses and that they had not committed deliberate . fraud, with the onus  on financial authorities to prove wrongdoing. But in the new proposed regime, top . managers would be held individually accountable and would have to show . they took 'all reasonable steps' to avoid a failure. 'A . lack of personal responsibility has been commonplace throughout the . industry,' Mr Tyrie added. 'Senior figures have continued to shelter . behind an accountability firewall.' The . commission also wants a new licensing system to stop traders involved . in setting Libor rates and prevent area managers who oversee the sale of . financial products from slipping through the net. They will have to abide by a new set of conduct rules or lose their licence. The . report also recommends that City watchdogs should be able to force . badly-behaved banks to sign a formal agreement to improve their culture . and standards. The . commission – whose members include the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin . Welby and former Chancellor Lord Lawson – also demands the dismantling . of UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body that is supposed to manage . taxpayers' holdings in RBS and Lloyds at arms' length from ministers. It said the Government, which denies . forcing the resignation of RBS boss Stephen Hester, has interfered in . the running of the two banks and that UKFI is seen as a 'fig leaf' for . 'the reality of direct government control'. Ministers must also make an immediate . commitment to analyse whether RBS should be split up into a 'good bank', . that could lend more to small firms and personal customers, and a 'bad . bank' to dump its toxic assets, the commission said. A . study of high street lenders by competition watchdogs and an . independent panel of experts to look at measures to help bank customers . were also part of the recommendations. Lord . Oakeshott, a former LibDem Treasury spokesman, said: 'Why are there no . banged-up bankers? That is what most people want to know after the last . five years of scandals and shame and moral and financial bankruptcy.' He . added: 'We must stop the subterfuge of UKFI and put the Treasury on the . spot to make the banks we own lend. 'RBS, our biggest business bank, has . failed the nation that rescued it at £1,500 for every taxpayer. It must . be broken up with new management and tough net lending targets for the . good bank so small business can grow again.'","New criminal offence to tackle 'shocking and widespread malpractice'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 06:31 EST, 29 January 2012 . For those enjoying the unseasonably warm weather, the blast of freezing Arctic cold sweeping across Britain is in unwelcome reminder of what winter's normally like. But anyone with an eye for a stunning photograph is sure to welcome the dusting of snow which helps create a picturesque winter scene. The scene below was the view earlier today across Carr Shields in Northumberland, as a icy weather front swept south across the country from Siberia. Winter arrives: The unseasonably mild winter gave way to cold and snow which turned Carr Shields, Northumberland, pictured, into a picturesque snowy scene . Freezing: Weather forecasters saying the cold weather could last into February as homes in Allendale, Northumberland, stoke up their fires to keep warm . Forecasters expect temperatures are set to drop as low as -2C overnight. The . Department of Health issued a . 'Level 2' cold-weather alert running for the next two to three days, . which is triggered when low temperatures give rise to significant health . risks. It warned that low temperatures can especially be dangerous for the young and the elderly or those with chronic disease. Meanwhile, the Met Office put much of . Britain on a 'yellow alert' for people to 'be aware' of the adverse . weather conditions. It said: 'Icy stretches are expected to form on untreated surfaces, especially in places affected by showers. 'The . showers will fall as snow above about 250 metres, but there may be . temporary slush deposits to lower levels. The public should be aware of . possible travel disruption.' Forecasters say snow is likely to fall . on Monday across northern England, Wales and parts of the south-west. There will also be snow showers in East Anglia and the south-east on . Tuesday. Dan Williams, of the Met Office, . said: ‘This is certainly the longest run of colder weather we will have . seen so far this winter. 'There’s . cold air pushing in from the east, and it’s looking very wintry over . the next few days and might last for the first half of February.’ The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Snow fun: Youngster Amy Eager, five, has fun on a sledge in Bowes, County Durham, as heavy snow arrives in Britain this weekend. Cold snap: A cyclist braves the cold on the Pennine hill tops near Skipton, in the Yorkshire Dales . Chill: A man walks his dog through the snow at Kilhope, County Durham, as the country braced itself for a spell of cooler weather that has brought snow to some regions . Britain has seen very little wintry weather so far this season – but nothing is ever straightforward with our weather. After three consecutive harsh winters we have reverted to what is seen as more typical winter weather. Perhaps this year we have felt cheated by above-average temperatures and just a few frosty mornings. Now the snowdrops have appeared in the garden it seems that spring is not too far away. Prior to the winter of 2008-09 there had been only one truly harsh winter in the previous 17 years – and that began late in the season. Cold winds first reached us from Siberia in thefinal week of January 1995, leading to heavy snow showers. So could there be a sting in the tail this year?History says it can happen, even after one of the mildest winters on record. As recently as last Wednesday the temperature peaked at 12.1C at Hawarden in Flintshire, but a band of heavy rain sweeping into the North Sea by Thursday brought cold winds and snow showers to higher ground. The prospects for the coming week are for the coldest weather so far, with hard frosts overnight, snow flurries and perhaps just the higher ground seeing any heavy snow. Latest forecasts say tonight will . remain mainly dry overnight, with light winds and clear spells allowing a . widespread frost and some patches of freezing fog to form. Far northern . and western areas will be cloudier and a little milder however, with . spells of mostly light rain. Sunday is expected to be cloudy with . some rain in western parts, with snow over hills in Wales and . southwestern England later. Otherwise mainly fine after any fog clears, . although showery in the far east. On Monday a slow-moving band of rain . with hill snow in western parts will continue on Monday, before cold, . and bright conditions with isolated showers push westwards towards . midweek. Over the next couple of weeks, the . weather is forecast to be mostly settled and cold leading up to the . first weekend, especially towards the southeast of England, with . widespread overnight frost and some wintry coastal showers towards the . east. However, northwestern parts will soon . become cloudier, more unsettled, but milder with spells of rain and . some snow, the snow mainly on hills. Although there is considerable . uncertainty, the bright, cold conditions will probably continue for a . time into the second week in the east. The unsettled but milder conditions . in the west will probably spread erratically further east with time, . introducing spells of rain and some snow, again mainly on hills. This . progression may be coupled with strong winds and possibly gales in . northwestern parts. The cold spell breaks what has so far been one of the warmest winters on record. The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Forecasters said it was becoming . increasingly likely that the freezing temperatures would stick around . and even last through the whole of February. George . Goodfellow of the Met Office said: ‘It seems like we are edging toward a . scenario where lower temperatures last for the next four weeks. It is . going to be a contrast to the weather we have had this winter. Widespread frosts and snow could affect large areas.’ He said the wintry weather was a result of ‘a cold air mass moving across from Siberia’. There are fears that the sudden onset could bring travel chaos and catch many drivers off guard. AA . spokesman Luke Bodett said: ‘We have had a very mild winter so far and . motorists need to get into their winter mindset from today. It is going . to be important not to charge around in the way they may have been used . to and be prepared for the unexpected.’ The Met Office has briefed government . departments and local councils about the cold period so that extreme . weather plans can be put on standby.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:20 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:31 EST, 19 June 2013 . The leader of one of Labour’s biggest union backers sparked fury last night after likening Kate Middleton to ‘young women having babies to get state handouts’. Unison boss Dave Prentis took aim at the heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in a speech attacking government cuts to welfare. Labour leader Ed Miliband was urged to distance himself from the ‘outrageous’ attack just weeks before she is due to give birth. Outrageous: Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, likened the Duchess of Cambridge to a benefit scrounger . Mr Prentis used a speech to delegates at a Unison rally to urge delegates to ‘fight’ government cuts. He condemned the coalition’s ‘scorched earth policy’ on welfare payments, adding: ‘If we stopped the poll tax, we can stop the bedroom tax.’ Mr Prentis went on: ‘In the tabloid press, so much is written about benefits abuses - young women having babies to get state hand-outs. ‘But conference, that’s enough on Kate Middleton.’ The slur comes just days after the Duchess made her last solo public appearance prior to the birth of her first child next month. She launched the Royal Princess cruise . ship with a £1,250 Nebuchednezzar of Moet et Chandon champagne in . Southampton on Thursday. And on Sunday she attended the Trooping of the Colour where brother-in-law Prince Harry made her laugh with a tickling gesture. In 2010 Unison backed Mr Miliband's leadership campaign against his brother David. Since Mr Miliband became leader, Unison has donated almost £4 million to Labour Party coffers. Naming: In her last solo public engagement last week, the Duchess of Cambridge watched as a bottle of champagne broke against a cruise ship during a naming ceremony in Southampton . Speculation: The royal baby is due in July, but with weeks to go it has not been announced whether the couple are expecting a boy or a girl . Mr Prentis’ decision to publicly criticise the Duchess risks backfiring against the union baron. Tory MP Henry Smith said: ‘This is an outrageous personal attack on the Duchess of Cambridge. ‘Ed Miliband should distance himself . from these spiteful remarks. 'If he does not, it will be clear that he is . a weak leader who stands for the union barons' interests, not the . interests of hardworking people.’ Labour last night declined to comment on Mr Prentis's remarks. Cash: Ed Miliband has accepted £4million from Unison in donations to Labour since he became leader . Mr Prentis, who enjoyed a pay and perks package worth more than £120,000 last year, used his speech to set out a long list of left wing demands for MMr Miliband if he becomes Prime Minister in 2015. He said: ‘For too long we're built the careers of Labour politicians, only to be let down when we needed them most. ‘I don't want to hear Labour apologising for past mistakes, I want to see a clear agenda from Labour for the future. ‘We must not support a Labour Government that does not: put an end to privatisation and market madness or restore our NHS- invest in our public services, restore the facility time taken away from our activists, restore workers rights and remove the shackles on trade unions.’ The Duchess of Cambridge has faced repeated criticism since marrying Prince William two years ago. Author Hilary Mantel’s described her as a ‘shop-window mannequin’ with a ‘plastic smile’. And newspaper columnist Joan Smith dismissed the Duchess as ‘unambitious and bland’ and Britain’s ‘Queen Wag.’ Mr Prentis's jibe was dropped from an official transcript of his speech posted on the union's website. Mr Prentis also hit out at the cost of Baroness Thatcher's funeral, saying the Tories had spent £10 million to 'assuage their guilt' at having toppled her and describing it as a 'waste of public money'. In fact the cost to the taxpayer of the funeral was £3.6 million. And he described UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage as a 'conman extraordinaire', likening him to Enoch Powell. Mr Prentis accused the Government of launching 'the most vicious assault on the welfare states' which had led to the 'cruellest attacks yet on the weak and vulnerable'.","Unison leader Dave Prentis took aim at the Duchess of Cambridge during a speech attacking welfare cuts .

A woman 'kettled' by police, before being filmed and told to hand over personal details during a 2011 trade union rally was treated unlawfully, the High Court said today. The Metropolitan Police argued they were legally entitled to obtain, and retain, the information for crime prevention purposes before allowing Susannah Mengesha to leave. But Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Wyn Williams, sitting in London, ruled they had acted outside their powers. Scotland Yard will now have to delete any records of Miss Mengesha taken at the demo, including on film and camera. Case: Susannah Mengesha was observing demonstrators attending an anti-cuts rally in London in 2011 when she was kettled and not allowed to leave until giving her personal details . 'The absence of any statutory power to obtain identification in the circumstances in this case establishes conclusively the unlawfulness of the police action in requiring (Ms Mengesha) to be filmed and give her name and address and date of birth before she was released from containment,' Justice Moses said. Conclusion: Mr Justice Moses found: 'It was not lawful to require identification to be given and submission to filming as the price for release' Ms Mengesha, a law graduate and caseworker at the Bar Pro Bono Unit, was corralled in a crowd of protesters for two hours on November 30 2011 at a trade union march against public sector pension cuts. She was acting as a legal observer. The march, which started at Lincoln's Inn Fields in central London, proceeded to Piccadilly Circus in the West End. Some of the crowd, including Ms Mengesha, were blocked in at nearby Panton Street. Police said the containment was 'necessitated by a reasonably apprehended imminent breach of the peace'. While the judges agreed that containment was necessary, they declared being filmed and having to give the police personal details as 'the price of release' a step too far. Their ruling will be welcomed as important backing for the freedom to protest without the 'chilling' effect of being forced to hand over particulars. The judge declared: 'It was not lawful for the police to maintain the containment for the purposes of obtaining identification, whether by questioning or filming. 'It follows that it was not lawful to require identification to be given and submission to filming as the price for release.' Ms Mengesha, who is now training to be solicitor, was allowed out of the kettle some two hours later at 5.52pm. The filming and taking of personal details occurred when the police assessed that containment was no longer necessary. Ms Mengesha said some 100 detainees were searched for 'offensive weapons or dangerous instruments' before their release - but were also told they had to give their personal details to obtain their freedom. Proceedings: Ms Mengesha was forced to take the case to the High Court because the police refused to accept they acted illegally . She was 'tagged' - filmed close up under bright lights - for identification purposes by a civilian employee of the police and gave her name, address and date of birth to a police officer. Demonstrators were filmed 'individually in close-up, from front and back' and the images linked with their personal details. In those circumstances, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects private and family life, became engaged, said the judge. While the Met Police had a published policy of overt filming and photography, 'there is no such published policy on the retention of images and personal details'. So the interference with the claimant's rights enshrined in Article 8 was not 'in accordance with the law'. A Metropolitan Police Service spokesman said later: 'We are aware of the judgment today and will now give it our full consideration and take forward any learning.' James Welch, legal director for campaign group Liberty, said: 'It shouldn't have needed a court to tell the police they can't require personal details and compulsory filming before releasing people from a kettle. Any law student could have worked that out. The courts have been clear that kettling is a last resort - it should never be abused as a tool for bullying demonstrators.'","Susannah Mengesha was a legal observer at a 2011 trade union rally .

The Barclays investment banker, who always wears his signature trilby while racing, cashed in £9.7million of shares bonuses last year, earned £44million . of pay and perks in 2010 and is set to pocket up to £6million in deferred shares bonuses this year. Labour have accused the 49-year-old of being 'out of touch' with the plight of ordinary, hardworking people after choosing such an insensitive name. Ricci with his horse Champagne Fever after winning at Cheltenham in 2012. He has reared 30 horses with his wife and trainer Willie Mullins . Labour MP John Mann said: ‘It's an insult to every taxpayer and small business in the country. And it shows just how out of touch these bankers are.’ The name might be a reference to a revealing article in The Independent in 2011 about Ricci titled ‘Who’s the fat cat in the hat? The rich world of Rich Ricci.’ Ricci, from Nebraska, USA, rose through the ranks of the . operations and technology departments at Barclays, spending several . years as the group's chief operating officer before taking the top job.

Despite never accepting a government bailout, Barclays have seen a string of scandals with their bosses receiving millions of pounds in bonuses. The bank was fined £290million after it admitted manipulating submissions used to calculate interest rates. The controversial bank boss received £44million in pay and perks in 2010 and cashed another £9.7million in share bonuses last year . Former chief executive was then awarded £17million from the bank despite being forced to resign amidst the interest rate scandal. New chief executive Antony Jenkins has announced a major restructuring of the bank to help repair its damaged image. Barclay's capital, the investment banking side of the company, will be forced to scale back their operations in Europe and Asia.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:18 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:22 EST, 19 June 2013 . Historian: Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt faced charges of hypocrisy after taking lessons himself while campaigning against unqualified teachers . A Labour education spokesman who has condemned government plans to allow more unqualified teachers into the classroom has boasted of taking lessons himself. Former TV historian Tristram Hunt revealed he ‘teaches in schools’ including delivering a lesson on the Spanish Armada to primary-age pupils. But he faced charges of hypocrisy because the Labour party policy is for only qualified teachers to be allowed into the classroom. Mr Hunt, a respected academic who has presented history programmes for the BBC, used a newspaper interview to reveal he regularly takes charge of classes. ‘I teach in schools in Stoke when they allow me, to make sure I know what's going on,’ he told The Guardian. ‘I do a class at the FE college about Cape Town as a city of empire. And I do an industrial revolution class at the sixth form. ‘And I taught a class on the Spanish Armada to a primary school.’ But the comments from the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central appear to be at odds with the official Labour party line. Just yesterday his boss, shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg, condemned Michael Gove’s plans to allow more unqualified teachers into schools as the ‘wrong approach’. Under Michael Gove’s policy, increasing numbers of schools are able to employ unqualified teachers. When we know the key to standards is the quality of teaching, this is the wrong approach. Mr Twigg added: ‘It will be one where we insist on high standards for our children, with qualified teachers in every classroom.’ A source close to Mr Gove said: ‘Hunt's hypocritical attitude is – “don't do as I do but do as I say”. ‘Yesterday, Hunt was saying that great teachers should be fired from state schools if they don't have a particular teaching license that Unions like. ‘Today, it turns out that Hunt himself teaches in state schools without that license. ‘Instead of media posing, Hunt should encourage more great teachers from private schools into state schools without the bureaucracy that he wants to swerve himself. It's typical hypocrisy on schools from rich Labour MPs.' Reforms: Education Secretary Michael Gove has said he wants more unqualified teachers in academies, giving them the same freedoms as free schools and the independent sector (file picture) Last year Mr Gove announced academies would be able to employ no formal teaching qualifications, in line with freedoms enjoyed by free schools and the independent sector. The Department for Education said the flexibility would more schools to hire ‘great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before’. Today Mr Hunt, who has a doctorate from Cambridge, insisted he was not acting as a teacher, but simply taking lessons. He told MailOnline: ‘When I’m invited I go and give talks in schools and I am delighted to do so. ‘I don’t teach a course or anything like that. I don’t mark, I just give them some history. ‘It is actually part of the broader issue that schools and schoolchildren should be exposed to as many outside speakers and ideas as possible. ‘Our party’s policy is that fully operational teachers should be qualified, so if you are running a class or course or marking… . ‘I definitely think you need qualifications and training about different ways to teach about different school kids.’ Questions were also raised about David Miliband - brother of Labour leader Ed - who taught politics to local students before quitting as an MP for a job in America. Tory MP Craig Whittaker, a member of the education select committee, said: 'We believe heads and governors are best placed to decide who are the best teachers, not bureaucrats. 'It's a mistake to confuse being properly qualified and state controlled licenses, and it would be wrong to stop brilliant teachers who want to be able to switch from private to state schools from doing so. 'I'm sure Tristram Hunt and David Miliband are great teachers - but so are many others who, just like them, teach without a state controlled licence.'","Education spokesman Tristram Hunt reveals he regularly teaches pupils .

"By . Paul Milligan . PUBLISHED: . 10:17 EST, 17 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:13 EST, 17 June 2013 . Turkish unions and opponents of prime minister Recep Erdogan have rallied by the thousands across the country, hoping to turn weeks of small-scale protests into wider discontent. Two major unions urged their members to hold a one-day strike and join demonstrations in response to a police crackdown against activists who led a wave of protest that have centred on Istanbul's Taksim Square and Gezi Park in recent weeks. It comes as Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said that Turkey could deploy 'elements of the armed forces' to help quell anti-government protests if needed. Demonstrators on the Bosphorus bridge as they march from the Anatolian side to the European side to Taksim square in Istanbul . The show of force follows a weekend in which police purged activists from an 18-day sit-in at the park that has come to symbolise defiance against the government, while Mr Ergodan's conservative political base held huge rallies in both Istanbul and Ankara. The rallies went on despite a warning from the interior minister that participants in unlawful demonstrations would 'bear the legal consequences.' In Ankara thousands of demonstrators waving union flags converged at central Kizilay Square in an uneasy face-off about 50 yards away from riot police and a line of trucks. After about three hours, the protesters left peacefully. Behind the strikes were the KESK confederation of public sector workers and DISK, a confederation of unions from industries including transport, construction, health care and media. Trade Unions becoming involved in the rallies is significant as it shows the small-scale protests are turning into wider discontent . Together they say they represent 330,000 workers. Small unions that group professionals like dentists, doctors and engineers also joined in. Unionists in Istanbul hoped to reach Taksim Square but police have maintained a lockdown on it after unrest continued in pockets of the country overnight. The standoff between police and protesters began as an environmentalists' rally. But a police crackdown has morphed the movement into a protest against Mr Erdogan's government. His opponents have grown increasingly suspicious about what they consider a gradual erosion of freedoms and secular Turkish values under his Islamic-rooted party's government. It has passed new curbs on alcohol and tried, but later abandoned its plans, to limit women's access to abortion. Five people, including a policeman, have died and more than 5,000 have been injured, according to a Turkish rights group. The rallies so far have met with a fierce police presence, which is fuelling more unrest . Mr Erdogan has been praised for shepherding Turkey to strong economic growth as many other world economies lagged. But his government's handling of the protests has dented his international reputation. He has blamed the protests on a nebulous plot to destabilise his government and repeatedly lashed out at reports in foreign media and chatter in social media about the situation. The strike call was the second since the protests began. Another took place on June 5. 'The first one, we said it's a warning for the government, to listen the streets, to listen the message from the demonstrators, and we asked them to stop this police violence,' said Kivanc Eli Acik, a labour leader. 'But after that day, rather than stopping the violence, the excessive police violence and intervention is going much, much bigger. So this is the second warning, the second strong message to the government,' he added.","Deputy PM said Turkey could deploy the military to help quell protests .

Sitting in the public gallery at Bristol Crown Court, civil servant Ruth Edwards grasped her sister's hand and collapsed in tears as her father David was jailed for killing her mother. Yet, the 28-year-old, who works at the Ministry of Defence, was not just grieving for her 44-year-old mother Michaela, who had been strangled to death with her own dressing gown cord. She was mourning the fact that her father, who also worked at the MoD, would spend the next 11 years behind bars. In a remarkable act of forgiveness, Ruth and her younger sister Sara, 25, even sent a letter to the court begging for their dad's freedom. They described their parents as 'a couple who couldn't be apart but shouldn't have been together'. 'They had an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other,' they added. Heartbreaking: David Edwards was jailed for strangling his wife Michaela to death. His daughters Ruth and Sara, are still close to their dad. Ruth, centre, is pictured with Sara, left, and their father, right, when they were younger . Now, speaking for the first time since that day four years ago, Ruth said: 'A lot of people will struggle to understand how we could forgive dad. 'But I've never blamed him for mum's death because it was not his fault. He's like two different people to me. The person who killed my Mum wasn't my dad. He was someone different, who wasn't in control of what he was doing. 'My dad is a really gentle man and it must have taken a lot to push him to do something so awful. He lost his rag and saw red. That's how I deal with it in my head. I separate the person who killed mum from the person who is my dad.' Ruth's story is told in the Cutting Edge documentary Lifers, which is screened on Channel 4 tonight. Filmmakers were granted unprecedented access to Leicester's Gartree Prison, home to 600 men sentenced to life in jail. David Edwards, now 51, who worked for the MoD in Bristol, has been at the prison since he was sentenced to life on November 12, 2008. He had strangled his wife at their home in Bradley Stoke, near Bristol after she had taunted him about her new lover. Edwards, who is now doing a degree in art history, told the programme: 'I feel I had all the advantages life had to offer me. That makes me feel my crime is in some way worse than everybody else's. When you kill the person you love, it's almost like a double grief. You grieve for the loss and you grieve for the fact you've caused that loss.' Tragic: David and Michaela on their wedding day. David strangled his wife at their home in Bradley Stoke, near Bristol after she had taunted him about her new lover . It had all seemed so different when they got married at the Catholic Church in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, in the summer of 1983. Ruth was born on Valentine's Day the following year and Sara came along two years later. But in 1996 - when Ruth was 12 and Sara ten - the couple, who both worked for the MoD, were forced to relocate to Bristol. 'We were definitely aware they had problems,' recalled Ruth. 'They had lots of fights over money and the stress it was causing. I think moving to Bristol made things worse because Mum was away from her family and lost her support network and missed her parents. 'But I have lots of good memories from childhood – going out for day trips to London Zoo and on family holidays. When they weren't fighting there was a lot of love between them and things were really good.' The couple's relationship teetered on until their daughters had left school but in 2005 they separated for a year. Edwards moved out to live in a flat in Bath while his wife stayed in the family home with Ruth. Sara was in her first year at Hull University. 'Mum and Dad weren't talking at the time,' said Ruth. 'I remember her finding a receipt for some furniture he was buying. He had rented a flat and had the delivery details on it with his new address. Mum read it and said: “Oh. He must be moving out.” Difficult: Ruth and Sara visiting a zoo with their mother Michaela. The sisters said their parents had 'an intense and destructive relationship that brought out the worst in each other' 'I was quite relieved at the time because I wanted them both to be happy – and if they weren't happy together I'd rather they were happy apart. The tension was so high – they would fight, not talk for a couple of months and then get back together and then the cycle would start again. 'But at the same time it's so hard when your parents split up. You feel awful and you are torn in two directions. You don't want to take sides. Dad was in a serious bout of depression and wouldn't talk to anyone while Mum saw it as a new start.' However, about a year later, Edwards returned home. 'He wrote to Mum saying he was ill and would like to meet up and talk about it,' said Ruth. 'She went for a drink with him and he came back with her and sat down in the front room. It was all a bit confusing. They didn't explain anything to us. They just went on as if nothing had changed. Sadly they didn't have marriage counselling.' Close: Ruth and Sara with their father on bonfire night. The two sisters sent a letter to Bristol Crown Court begging for their dad's freedom before he was sentenced for killing their mother . Within a year Ruth had moved out, exhausted by her parents on-off relationship. She barely spoke to her mother again. 'It became unbearable living there,' explained Ruth. 'That's why I moved out. We never had any big blow-ups but she would give me the cold shoulder and silent treatment and act like I wasn't there.' Ruth did not talk to her mother again until her father had a heart attack in March 2008. Even then her mum got a friend to call her. By then her parents were separated - although they lived in the same house, ate together, travelled to work together and went on trips together. Edwards still did the washing, his wife's ironing and paid the major bills. When he was in hospital, his wife visited him every day. 'I went out of my way to drive her to the hospital,' recalled Ruth. 'But she treated me like a taxi driver. She was so rude. She was very short and abrupt and couldn't bear to say thank you to me.' Happy: Ruth, Sara and their father are pictured on holiday in Bulgaria. David was sentenced to 11 years behind bars for killing their mother . But towards the end of the year, Michaela began dating someone else and Edwards emailed both his daughters asking to stay the night. 'It was the first time I had seen him since his heart attack,' said Ruth. 'He was very down. There was definitely something wrong. But he didn't specify what it was and I didn't push him. Perhaps I should have? Hindsight is a brilliant thing.' Ruth spent Christmas with her sister and the pair had lunch with Ruth's now ex-boyfriend Roy, a warehouse worker, on December 27. When they returned home, two policemen knocked at the door and told them their mother was in hospital. The detectives said that their father was in a police cell, having called 999 and confessed to strangling her. 'I remember thinking there must be a mistake,' she said. 'I couldn't believe Dad had done anything to her. I was in complete shock. I remember saying: “Are you sure it was him?” But they said: “Yes. He confessed straight away.”' The girls immediately went to visit their mother in Frenchay Hospital, where she was in intensive care.  But four days later, on New Year's Eve, they decided to switch their mother's life support machine off. 'I had mixed feelings seeing her at the hospital,' said Ruth, who had not spoken to her mother for ten months.  She looked very tiny and vulnerable. A wave of emotion hit me because it was so sad. But we knew she was not going to wake up from the coma.' Happier times: David and Michaela with Sara in London. The couple's daughters said they couldn't be apart but shouldn't have been together . The funeral was held at Westbury-on-Trym crematorium and the whole family attended apart from Edwards who was in custody. The next time the girls saw their father was in court when he pleaded guilty to their mother's murder. 'We had been hoping that he would not plead guilty,' revealed Ruth. 'But Dad didn't want a trial or to see Mum's name dragged through the mud. Even now he still cherishes her above all else. There's no doubt he's still in love with her.' Since their father was jailed, both Ruth and Sara have travelled a 250-mile round trip to visit him each month. 'It was such a lovely feeling to be able to see him after everything we had all gone through,' explained Ruth. We just wanted to say to him: “It's OK. We're not angry with you. We understand.” Although he was in total shock – his eyes were barely focusing – you could see that he felt relieved. 'What is surprising is that my sister and I have discovered that we are both a lot stronger than we thought we would be. 'Neither Sara nor I have had counselling. We talked about it a bit but felt we didn't need it. To some people it might seem strange. But the bond between Dad, Sara and me is stronger than ever.'

Strict policy: The store imposed the the dress code last week claiming scantily clad customers were a potential health and safety risk . A branch of Tesco has banned 'half naked' customers because they are an 'embarrassment' and a 'health and safety risk'. Scores of scantily-clad women and shirtless men flocked to the store during a recent hot spell - to stock up on alcohol and barbecue supplies. But other customers were appalled at the beer bellies and bare feet and filed complaints against the supermarket, in Tiverton, Devon. Bosses at the shop say the amount of flesh on show has left other shoppers 'embarrassed' and have since imposed a strict dress code. They have also ruled the bare torsos could be a breach of health and safety laws - because the shirtless punters might drip sweat onto fresh produce. The ban was imposed last week and also bars customers from wandering the superstore in bare feet. A Tesco spokesman said the latest clampdown followed a string of complaints to managers about scantily-clad shoppers. He said: 'As we see glimpses of the summer weather, we've decided that it's sensible to ask customers to wear t-shirts and footwear in store. 'We don't want them to tread on anything sharp and we want all of our customers to feel comfortable. Our store managers use their common sense.

'This kind of decision is made on a . store-by-store basis and at the manager's discretion as a result of a . customer raising the issue with the team. 'So it is often in response to issues that have been brought to us and the store has decided in this case to address them.' Customers have been told of the new rules in a sign posted in the shop's windows. Belies and bare feet have both been barred from the Tesco branch after the exposed flesh caused others 'embarrassment' It says: 'To avoid causing offence or embarrassment to others, as well as for health and safety reasons, we ask that customers are appropriately dressed when visiting our stores. Shirts, tops and shoes must be worn at all times.' Customers visiting the 40,000 square foot superstore and adjacent petrol station today welcomed the ban. One said: 'I was more concerned about topless and sweaty people leaning over the fresh fruit, salad or bread. It just doesn't bare thinking about.'

Rachel D’Avino, 29, was to be engaged to her longtime boyfriend on Christmas Eve. She was gunned down by Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman who murdered 27 people  - including 20 first grade students - before taking his own life at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday. Rachel D'Avino, 29, died just two days after her boyfriend asked her parents for her hand in marriage . Miss D’Avino was said to have tried to draw the shooter away from children at the school, and was killed in the process. The Bethlehem, Connecticut, native only started teaching at the elementary school this past fall. Her friend Lissa Lovetere, who is also handling her funeral arrangements, said teaching special needs children was a calling for Miss D’Avino. ‘She had that gift, that maternal instinct. She cared for people,’ Ms Lovetere told MailOnline on Sunday. ‘Working with special needs children was her forte,' Lovetere added. D’Avino worked in special education and had been a therapist for autistic children. One of her college friends told the LA Times . that: 'She was one of the funniest, loudest, happiest people ever,' said the friend, who asked that she remained anonymous out of respect . for the family. 'She was willing to do absolutely anything for the kids she worked with.' D’Avino's friend said that she was well-known for dressing up and singing songs to the children during activities. Rachel D'Avino was a recent arrival at Sandy Hook Elementary School who was described by a friend as one of the 'funniest, loudest, happiest people ever' Tragic: Mourners embrace in front of a U.S. flag flying at half mast near a memorial in front of the St. Rose of Lima Catholic church in Newtown . 'She was an amazing person. We worked together for years, and lived down . the street from each other for longer,' the friend continued. 'She devoted her life . to children.' The LA Times also reported on a Facebook post by Dr John Molteni, director of the Institute for Autism and Behavioral . Studies at Saint Joseph College. D’Avino had been a student in the graduate certificate program at Saint Joseph. Dr Molteni said: 'She was a paraprofessional working with a student with special needs, . something she had dedicated her life to doing.' 'She had . just completed her coursework to sit for her certification exam . on Wednesday.'

Robbie Parker, who lost his six-year-old daughter Emilie in the massacre yesterday said: 'I’d live to offer our deepest condolences to all the families who were directly affected. It’s a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to them. 'This includes the family of the shooter, and I want you to know that our love and support go out to you as well.’ Speaking live on CNN Saturday evening, Mr Parker, 30, was barely maintaining his composure as he spoke of his slain daughter, saying that he was ‘so blessed’ to be her dad. The 30-year-old physician’s assistant said he wanted to get his message out to the greatest amount of people possible, saying that the medium of television was probably the best way to alert friends and family as to how he and his wife are coping. ‘I’ve been contacted by so many people wanting to know how we’re doing that this might be the best way to share those feelings,’ he said, saying that he extended his condolences to all of the other parents and family members who lost a child in the ‘horrible tragedy.’ Heart-wrenching: Robbie Parker fought back tears during a press conference about the death of his six-year-old daughter .

The father then began to tearfully speak of his blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter. ‘My daughter Emilie would be one of the first ones giving her love and support to all of the victims, because that’s the kind of person she is,’ he said, pausing a moment to take a steadying breath. ‘As the deep pain begins to settle in our hearts, we find comfort in the incredible person Emilie was and how many people she was able to touch in her short time on Earth.’ Mr Parker spoke of Emilie’s incredible artistic talent, and how she could often be found carrying crayons, markers, and paper to make colorful cards for those having a dark day.","Boyfriend of Rachel D’Avino, 29, had asked her parents for permission to marry her four days ago .

Hiding: Julian Assange and Ecuador's foreign minister Ricardo Patino greeted crowds from the embassy window last night . Britain could be stuck with WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange for another nine years – at a cost of £40million – William Hague warned last night. The Foreign Secretary said Assange could stay in his Ecuadorian Embassy bolt-hole until 2022 – when the statute of limitations on his extradition request expires. The grim prediction means the suspected rapist could run up a £40million policing bill as a team of officers guard the embassy day and night. The cost of keeping watch on him cast a shadow over talks between Mr Hague and his Ecuadorian counterpart Ricardo Pantino yesterday. The two country's governments agreed to set up a working group of officials to discuss the case, but Whitehall officials said there was no sign of an end to the deadlock. Diplomats said Ecuador will not step back from its position that Assange should be granted free passage to South America. This is unacceptable to Britain because the law dictates he must be sent to Sweden to answer rape charges. One senior source said officials were frustrated that Ecuador will not budge from what the UK sees as an unjustifiable position. He said: 'Assange is saying that he is prepared to stay for five years. 'But the statute of limitations for an extradition request is ten years, so they will be stuck with him in their embassy for nine more years. 'We had a routine exchange of views. They didn't bring anything new to the table. Ecuador has not changed its position one bit since the day Assange fled to them.' Mr Patino said he had talked with Assange until 4am yesterday and he was in 'good spirits'. He added: 'I hope Mr Assange will not grow old and die in our embassy – but we are defending human rights.' Assange, whose supporters fear he will be sent to the US to be charged over leaking diplomatic cables, entered the embassy in London on June 19 last year. A police team has been posted outside the embassy at a cost of £11,000 a day in case he tries to escape, but Assange shows no sign of walking out. Insiders say he is up all night on the internet 'guzzling Coke'. A recent visitor said: 'He looks very thin and gaunt. It looks like he burns the candle at both ends. His skin almost appears bleached, almost transparent. 'It is obvious he has not seen any sunlight for a long time. If you ask him why he is still there, he will just mumble something back at you about “freedom” and his “principles”.' Support: A crowd gathered outside the embassy in London as the Ecuadorian foreign minister visited Mr Assange nearly a year after he first went into hiding in the building . Security: The police operation to guard the embassy and prevent Mr Assange from escaping has already cost more than £3million . Wanted: Mr Assange faces questioning in Sweden over alleged sex offences but fears he will be extradited from there to the US over WikiLeaks . Asylum: Mr Assange is currently being protected within the Ecuadorian Embassy in London but will be arrested and deported if he steps outside . Last night the . Australian, who is thought to have a personal fortune of £1million, was . pictured smiling as he shook hands with Mr Patino before their meeting. He said: 'My situation here has been . physically difficult but the staff at the embassy have been really kind . and supportive despite the occasional entertainment outside, whether . they are people chanting or policeman coming down on ropes.' After the meeting, he went on: 'The minister emphasised his government's continued commitment to support and protect me. 'He set out how he and the Ecuadorian government are actively seeking a solution to my present situation. 'I . remain immensely grateful to the support Ricardo, President (Rafael) Correa and the people of Ecuador have shown me over the last year.' Mr . Patino added: 'I have just finished meeting with Julian Assange who is . in good spirits despite the limitations of his accommodation. 'I was able to say face to face to him, . for the first time, that the government of Ecuador remains firmly . committed to protecting his human rights and that we continue to seek . cast iron assurances to avoid any onward extradition to a third state. 'Good spirits': Mr Patino said Mr Assange was doing well, as supporters marked the first anniversary of his stay at the embassy with balloons . 'During the meeting we were able to . speak about the increasing threats against the freedom of people to . communicate and to know the truth, threats which come from certain . states that have put all of humanity under suspicion.' It . is believed at least three Metropolitan Police officers are on guard at . the embassy, which is on the second floor of a building near Harrods in . Knightsbridge, 24 hours a day. Usually one officer stands on the steps outside, while one waits by the lifts in the communal foyer in case Mr Assange attempts to access the roof and escape by helicopter. Another stands on an exterior staircase from where they can see the single bed where he sleeps. It is believed there are always other officers on standby near the embassy in case of any escape attempt.","William Hague and his Ecuadorian counterpart failed to reach agreement on Assange's future as he marks first anniversary of stay at embassy this week .

President Barack Obama last night insisted that the NSA's top secret monitoring of Americans' phone and internet data 'is transparent' as he sought to defuse fears following the revelations of leaker Edward Snowden. Nonetheless, in the sit down with Charlie Rose on PBS, the president said he will meet soon with a privacy and civil . liberties oversight board to discuss ways to balance the need for U.S. surveillance while respecting people's right to privacy. ‘It is transparent,’ Obama said. ‘That's why we set up the . FISA court,’ he added, referring to the secret court set up by the Foreign . Intelligence Surveillance Act that authorizes two recently disclosed programs: . one that gathers U.S. phone records and another that is designed to track the . use of U.S.-based Internet servers by foreigners with possible links to . terrorism. Scroll down for video . Coming clean? Charlie Rose sat with President Obama in a 45-minute interview that aired Monday...and aired the dirty laundry concerning the NSA leaks . The location of FISA courts is secret. The sessions are . closed. The orders that result from hearings in which only government lawyers . are present are classified. Obama told the PBS anchor that he has asked the intelligence . community to see if there is more that can be revealed about it to reassure . people. ‘What I've asked the intelligence community to do is see how . much of this we can declassify without further compromising the program. ... And they are in that process of doing so now,’ he said. Obama has come under fire for the scope of surveillance by . the National Security Agency revealed by former government contractor Edward . Snowden. Within the law? The president emphasized that the information leaked by Snowden revealed nothing illegal . ‘The way I view it, my job is both to protect the American . people and to protect the American way of life, which includes our privacy,’ he . said. The president said the government must find a way to clarify . in peoples’ minds that intelligence activity is in their interest more than it . is not. ‘We're going to have to find ways where the public has an . assurance that there are checks and balances in place ... that their phone . calls aren't being listened into; their text messages aren't being monitored, . their emails are not being read by some big brother somewhere,’ Obama said. The president stressed that nothing has changed about the government's ability to listen in on Americans' communications since, 'the same way it's always been.' 'What I can say unequivocally is that if you are a U.S. person, the NSA cannot listen to your telephone calls, and the NSA cannot target your emails … and have not,' he said. 'They cannot and have not, by law and by rule, and unless they...go to a court, and obtain a warrant, and seek probable cause,' he went on. Obama also told Rose he wanted to encourage a national . debate on the balance between privacy and national security. Don't fear the government: Now at the G8 conference, Obama taped an interview with Charlie Rose before he left wherein he assured everyday Americans their phones aren't tapped and their emails aren't being read . Timing? Obama's interview came soon after outrage over NSA reports leaked by Edward Snowden painted the administration as far from transparent . And what I want to do is to set up and structure a national . conversation, not only about these two programs, but also the general problem . of data, big data sets, because this is not going to be restricted to . government entities,’ he said. Despite the heavy topics of the night, the president was able to inject at least a little bit of humor: . 'Some people say, ""Well, you know, Obama was this raving liberal before. Now he’s, you know, Dick Cheney."" Dick Cheney sometimes says, ‘Yeah, you know? He took all lock, stock and barrel.” My concern has always been not that we shouldn’t do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism, but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances.' Obama is in Northern Ireland for a meeting of leaders of . allied countries. As Obama arrived, the latest series of Guardian articles . drawing on the leaks claims that British eavesdropping agency GCHQ repeatedly . hacked into foreign diplomats' phones and emails with U.S. help, in an effort . to get an edge in such high-stakes negotiations. Obama's announcement follows an online chat Monday by Edward . Snowden, the man who leaked documents revealing the scope of the two programs . to The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers. He accused members of . Congress and administration officials of exaggerating their claims about the . success of the data gathering programs, including pointing to the arrest of . would-be New York subway bomber Najibullah Zazi in 2009. Lame duck? Obama may also have an even more personal reason to want Americans to cool down over the NSA leaks. Recent poll numbers show his popularity has plummeted since the Snowden leaks to 45 percent apporval . Charlie Rose's 45-minute interview with Obama also covered such topics as the Iranian election, the civil war in Syria, Guantanamo, drone policy, among other issues. Obama's approval rating among Americans has dropped eight . percentage points over the past month, down to 45 percent, according to a . CNN/ORC International poll. The fallout over the surveillance programs was . cited as a reason. 'I think the American public can accept the fact if you tell them that every time you pick up the phone it's going to be recorded and goes to the government,' said the police commissioner at a recent event. 'I think the public can understand that. I see no reason why that program was placed in the secret category.' Kelly also disagrees with Attorney General Eric Holder's stance that Edward Snowden's leak seriously damages national security and the fight against terrorism. His comments also seem to distrust, at least mildly, President Obama's assertions in Monday night's Charlie Rose interview where the president continually maintained that, if you're Average Joe American, the NSA is not listening to your phone calls as part of the program uncovered by Snowden. 'I think if you listen to Snowden,' said Kelly, 'he indicates that there’s some sort of malfeasance, people . . . sitting around and watching the data. So I think the question is: What sort of oversight is there inside the NSA to prevent that abuse, if it’s taking place?' According to Obama, any wiretapping or surveillance must go through several layers of bureaucracy in order to be implemented. Obama has also said, and reiterated in Monday's interview, that there is a balance struck between ensuring privacy and keeping Americans safe. Kelly, however, disagrees. 'I think we can raise people’s comfort level if in fact information comes out as to that we have these controls and these protections inside the NSA,' he said. Kelly believes the public doesn't know enough about the supposed checks and balances to be comforted by them. Kelly went on to use Snowden's claims as evidence that the checks and balances don't even exist. 'He tried to give the impression, it seems to me, that these system administrators had carte blanche to do what they wanted to do,' Kelly said. 'I think it’s a problem if that’s in fact what’s happening.'","'If you’re a U.S. person, then NSA is not listening to your phone calls and it’s not targeting your emails': The president emphasized that everyday Americans are not monitored by the NSA .

Honest: In a TV interview with ABC's Nightline, Rogers spoke about going to visit his tight-knit, conservative, Catholic family for the first time since coming out in February . In the interview with Nightline that will air on Monday, Rogers said he hid his homosexuality so he could fit in with the soccer environment. 'Because it's sports. It's the stereotype that you're supposed to be this manly guy that is making tackles. It's beating up on other guys,' Rogers explained. Rogers rose to prominence at . Columbus Crew in MLS, scoring 13 goals in over 100 appearances and . earning international colors in the process. He then moved to Leeds United, a team . in the second tier of English football, on the advice of USA coach . Juergen Klinsmann. Rogers struggled with injuries and, after making only . nine appearances in five . months on loan at Stevenage, he decided to call it a day and came out in a heartfelt blog entry. Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. But Rogers explained: 'I think the same things that made it difficult for me to come out also gave me the strength. I was raised to be a voice, to be myself, to be unique, not to follow a pack.' While Rogers ponders a future return to soccer in the U.S. he visited his family in Huntington Beach, California, for the first time in person since the announcement and recalled his upbringing. 'You grow up learning that who you are isn't natural, or is a sin,' Rogers said. 'It does have an impact - it scares you, it really scares you.' Star: Rogers rose to prominence at Columbus Crew in MLS, scoring 13 goals in over 100 appearances and earning international colors in the process . But Rogers is content with his . decisions. 'Gay athletes are athletes,' he declared. 'If I go back to . soccer, I want to go back as Robbie. I just want it to be as simple as . that.' The Southern California native currently based in London, made his announcement in a heartfelt blog entry. The winger revealed how he would feared he would suffer discrimination if he revealed his sexuality. In a blog entitled ‘The Next Chapter’, . Rogers wrote: ‘Things are never what they seem. My whole life I have . felt different. To overcome your fears you must be strong and have faith . in your purpose. ‘For the past 25 years I have been . afraid to show who I really was because of fear that judgment and . rejection would hold me back from my dreams and aspirations.' Only a handful of footballers have ever announced they are gay as many still fear coming out will damage their careers. Footballer Justin Fashanu was the first and only English player to publicly announce he was homosexual. The Norwich City and Nottingham Forest player committed suicide eight years later in 1998. Rogers, who represented his country 18 times, including at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, also told how he kept his sexuality a secret even from his friends and family. He wrote: 'Fear that . my loved ones would be farthest from me if they knew my secret. ‘Life is only complete when your loved . ones know you. When they know your true feelings, when they know who . and how you love. Life is simple when your secret is gone. Gone is the . pain that lurks in the stomach at work, the pain from avoiding . questions, and at last the pain from hiding such a deep secret.

Football was my escape, my purpose, my identity. Football hid my . secret, gave me more joy than I could have ever imagined… I will always . be thankful for my career.’ Rogers, who has more than 75,000 followers  finishes his blog with: ‘I will . remember Beijing, The MLS Cup, and most of all my teammates. I will . never forget the friends I have made along the way and the friends that . supported me once they knew my secret. A host of MLS players and international teammates have voiced their encouragement about Rogers' decision.

Chivas USA keeper Dan Kennedy offered 'ur the man Robbie we support u bro,' while teammate Juan Agudelo tweeted: 'Respect man. Proud of you bro.' LA Galaxy and USA center back Omar Gonzalez wrote, 'Congrats, Robbie! Really happy for you.' Gonzalez's fellow LA defender A.J. DeLaGarza tweeted, 'good for you man! All the best! Terps.' FC Dallas goalkeeper Chris Seitz praised Rogers' courage saying, 'really want to give a huge shout out to a great friend for being one of the bravest men I know' D.C. United's Chris Pontius wrote, 'Much respect. Nothing but support for you.' Vancouver Whitecaps defender Jordan Harvey chimed in with: 'Congrats brotha. Wish you the best.' ‘Now is my time to step away. It’s . time to discover myself away from football.  It’s 1 A.M. in London as I . write this and I could not be happier with my decision. 'Life is so full of amazing things. I realized I could only truly enjoy my life once I was honest. 'Honesty is a bitch but makes life so . simple and clear.

He featured in all three of the team's games at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad. Ruth Hunt, director of public affairs . for UK-based lesbian, gay and bisexual charity Stonewall, said: 'It's . great that Robbie now feels able to be open about his sexuality but it . remains a shame that no professional player feels able to be out during . their career. 'Homophobia remains rife in football and we must work together to stop it for the sake of the game.' Gordon . Taylor, chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in the . U.K., told the Press Association: 'I'm pleased that he's come out for his . own sake. We do have players who've said that, while they are gay, they . don't feel comfortable enough to come out. 'It's . not dissimilar to many black players, and we need to create a safe . environment for them on and off the field. If there is abuse, that needs . to be dealt with by all the football family. 'It's no bad thing that he's . been brave enough to come out. We know of players who are playing who . are gay who've not had that confidence as yet. But, as the rest of the . world becomes more civilized, hopefully that will come.' Another American player, David Testo, . came out after retiring from football in 2011. He also played for .

A mother whose son was taken to hospital after having his chest stamped on by bullies has been hit with an electronic tag and curfew for removing him from the school. Yasmin Dad, 46, says her son Rahim, 13, experienced a series of violent attacks at the hands of his tormentors over more than a year at the school in Bristol. On one occasion the police had to be called in and she claims the teenager was subjected to racist abuse and threatening text messages. She says that another time she found her son cowering in an alleyway after being set upon. But after Mrs Dad removed Rahim from school to protect him from the bullies, she was hauled before the courts for allowing him to be truant. 'Protective': Yasmin Dad with her son Rahim, 13. She has been tagged and hit with a curfew after keeping him home from school because he was being bullied . She was warned she could go to jail . and has been given a three months deferred sentence, forced to wear a . tag and must not go out after 7pm. Mrs Dad now says she has been 'unfairly punished' for being a 'good parent'. She said: 'The way I have been punished for protecting my own child is appalling. 'However the tagged curfew doesn’t . just punish me, it also punishes my kids because I can’t take them out . without being worried that I must be back by 7pm. 'I don’t know why they are punishing . me for raising the issue of bullying. By punishing me they have solved . nothing. I did the right thing by protecting my son. 'It was not that I did not know where he was or that he was going out committing crime. Traumatic: Henbury school in Bristol, where Rahim was a pupil before his mother withdrew him after he endured bullying . Tormentors: Yasmin Dad claims her son was repeatedly bullied while he attended school, and was attacked on four different occasions (file picture posed by models) 'I should not have been punished for being a good mother.' Mrs Dad repeatedly took Rahim out of . Henbury School where she had claimed he was subjected to a catalogue of . physical and verbal attacks. In . May, Yasmin told a court that over 15 months . Rahim was attacked four times - once so badly he was left in hospital . and on another occasion so badly that the school’s police officer was . called in. He was also sent threatening text messages, which included racial abuse against Pakistanis. At the time Henbury School’s head . teacher Clare Bradford acknowledged there had been issues with Rahim but . that strenuous efforts had been made to work with his family to both . resolve those issues and his poor attendance. Since June 11 Rahim has been at Oasis . Academy Brightstowe in Shirehampton where she says he has had no . problems with bullies and has a 100 per cent attendance record. Treatment: Mrs Dad said that Rahim was taken to hospital after bullies stamped on his chest in an attack at Blaise Castle in Bristol . At the case earlier this year, Bristol Magistrates’ Court . heard that Mrs Dad had repeatedly failed to ensure Rahim went to school, and . that he only attended on 42 out of 224 occasions between October 13, . 2010 and December 9, 2011. Prosecuting, Ashley Clark told the court stringent measures were in place to prevent further bullying. She said attempts had been made to . contact Ms Dad to get Rahim into a different school, but she hadn’t . responded and failed to attend meetings. Defending, Ruth Tily said Rahim was . removed from the school in October 2010 after his chest was stamped on, . leaving him in hospital. In April 2011 he was removed for six months . when his mother found him cowering in an alleyway in tears after he was . attacked by bullies at Blaise Castle. Punishment: An electronic police tag similar to the one Mrs Day has had to wear for keeping her bullied son from school . Mrs Dad was warned in December about . his attendance, so sent him back to school in January, but took him out . again after he was beaten up twice in just a week. The mother pleaded guilty to failing to ensure his attendance at school for a total period of 360 days. Her sentence was deferred for three months. Mrs Dad was sentenced earlier this month, and after being warned she could have gone to jail, was handed an eight-week tagged curfew from 7pm to 6am and must pay £85 court costs. Yasmin said she now hopes to set up a group where other parents who feel they have been wrongly punished by the courts over truancy can share their experiences. She said: 'I have a conviction for protecting my child and I am sure I’m not the only one. 'I am sure many parents are punished for doing exactly the same thing and trying to ensure their child is safe and gets a decent education. 'There are thousands of children who are still not attending school so how are these prosecutions even working? 'People who are being bullied are told not to suffer in silence but when I decided to do something about it I found myself facing a prison sentence and now have a conviction. 'I think the council prosecute and pat themselves on the back instead of actually addressing the underlying problems. The law treats me and many other parents like we don’t care about our children. Cases should be considered on merit.'","Yasmin Dad, 46, says she found her son Rahim cowering in an alleyway after being set upon by tormentors .

'People aren't afraid to come out and celebrate it, the way they used to be,' said 52-year-old Charles Bade of Denver. Bade carried a tie-dyed flag with a . big cannabis leaf and wore a garland of fake marijuana leaves around his . neck.

Group . smoke-outs are also planned Saturday from New York to San Francisco. The origins of the number '420' as a code for pot are murky, but the . drug's users have for decades marked the date 4/20 as a day to use pot . together. Denver's celebration this year also features the nation's first open-to-all Cannabis Cup, a marijuana competition patterned after one held in Amsterdam. Similar to a beer or wine festival, pot growers compete for awards for taste, appearance and potency of their weed. Denver's event, sponsored by High Times magazine, has sold out more than 5,000 tickets. Snoop Lion, the new reggae- and marijuana-loving persona for the rapper better known as Snoop Dogg, received a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' from High Times.

Colorado and Washington are still waiting for a federal response to the votes and are working on setting up commercial pot sales, which are still limited to people with certain medical conditions. In the meantime, pot users are free to share and use the drug in small amounts. A citizen advocacy group that opposes marijuana legalization, Smart Colorado, warned in a statement that public 4/20 celebrations 'send a clear message to the rest of the nation and the world about what Colorado looks like.' 'Does the behavior of the participants in these events reflect well on our state?' asked the head of Smart Colorado, Henny Lasley. The organizer of Denver's 4/20 rally, Miguel Lopez, said the holiday is more than an excuse to get high — it's also a political statement by people who want to see the end of marijuana prohibition. 'You don't have to smoke weed to go to 4/20 rallies. You don't have to be gay to go to a Pride festival. You don't have to be Mexican to celebrate Cinco de Mayo,' Lopez said. 'That's what this is. It's a celebration, it's a statement about justice and freedom and this movement.'

Two-thirds of GPs would support industrial action – including a strike – if the Government ordered them to work out-of-hours, a survey has found. And a similar proportion say they would refuse to look after patients in the evening and at weekends even if they were offered a hefty pay rise. One doctor said it was an ‘over my dead body issue’ while another threatened to charge patients £50 for an appointment. In most areas, care at evenings and weekends is provided by private firms. Critics claim they are seemingly more concerned about their profits than patients . Ministers are considering making GPs take back responsibility for their patients at evenings and weekends amid growing concerns over the standards of care during this time. Family doctors were allowed to give-up working out-of-hours under a contract negotiated by Labour in 2004 in return for a small pay cut. In most areas, care at evenings and weekends is provided by private firms, whom critics claim are seemingly more concerned about their profits than patients. There is concern that deteriorating standards of out-of-hours cover is partly to blame for the ongoing crisis on accident and emergency wards. The Mail has repeatedly highlighted concerns about the state of out-of-hours care and we recently revealed how the largest firm, Harmoni, was using nurses, who are cheaper, to cover doctors’ shifts. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the GP contract would be rewritten to ensure they are responsible for patients out-of-hours. Ministers are considering making GPs take back responsibility for their patients at evenings and weekends amid growing concerns over the standards of out-of-hours care . The exact details will be thrashed out over the coming months but it is unlikely that doctors will have to be on-call personally at evenings and weekends. Instead, it is more probable they will be made to be directly responsible for the firms providing care out-of-hours and take the blame if anything goes wrong. But a survey of 400 GPs by Pulse magazine found that 69 per cent would not take back responsibility ‘at any price’. A quarter said they would do it if given £20,000 pay-rise – their average annual salaries are now £104,100. And 62 per cent said they would . support some form of industrial action if Mr Hunt made them take back . responsibility for out-of-hours care. Eighty-nine per cent said they would refuse to be responsible out-of-hours for the most vulnerable patients including the elderly or terminally ill . Forty-nine per cent said they would not take back responsibility even if they did not have to be on-call themselves. Eighty-nine . per cent said they would refuse to be responsible out-of-hours for the . most vulnerable 5 per cent of their patients – including the elderly or . terminally ill. The Royal . College of General Practitioners recently suggested family doctors . should consider looking after such patients. One GP, Dr Mary Church, . from Blantyre, south Lanarkshire, said: ‘This is an over my dead body . issue.’ Another anonymous . doctor said: ‘The only option is resignation – we will still see . patients but for a fee, say £50 for 15 minutes. Those that don’t want to . pay can go to see those wonderful A&E doctors.’ Dr . Thomas Bloch, who practises in Broadway, Worcestershire, said: ‘This . would be a recipe for disaster. We would get the blame for any . shortcomings. This is the only reason the Government wants to be shot of . it.’ Although GPs’ pay was . cut under the 2004 contract if they opted-out of evening and weekend . work, most saw their pay increase by an average of 50 per cent because . of a new bonus scheme that enabled them to earn cash for treating . certain illnesses. Joyce Robins, of campaign group Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s a disgrace the way GPs work at the moment. 'There is some form of out-of-hours care but it’s usually by doctors you don’t know, including many from abroad, and they get it wrong. ‘GPs should be made to at least take it in turns to do the occasional out of hours shift.’ Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, which represents GPs, said: ‘If the Government is mad enough to go down that road, industrial action would be the least of their worries. GPs would vote with their feet and leave the profession and then you’d have a crisis in in-hours care as well.’ A separate survey by the Royal College of General Practitioners found that half of family doctors felt so overworked they were unable to guarantee safe patient care. Many are worried about making mistakes or missing crucial symptoms because they are exhausted.","Two-thirds of GPs said they would refuse to look after patients in the evening and at weekends .

"By . David Richards . UPDATED: . 09:22 EST, 6 January 2012 . It has emerged that even the Duchess of Cambridge underwent a check by the Criminal Records Bureau before becoming a volunteer for the Scouts . Her wedding to Prince William was watched by two billion across the globe making her one of the most recognisable faces on the planet. Yet it has emerged that even the Duchess of Cambridge underwent a check by the Criminal Records Bureau before becoming a volunteer for the Scouts. It was announced yesterday that she is to help out at her local scout group on Anglesey as part of a new package of royal patronages. This will see her lend a hand at meetings close to the rented farmhouse she shares with Prince William. Confirming the CRB check had been carried out, a Scout Association spokesman added: ‘The Duchess does not need to be CRB checked to undertake this occasional volunteering role but she has chosen to take it so that in future she might form part of the team for camps and for sleep-overs.’ He added that decisions on whether the organisation asks volunteers to undergo a check depends on their duties and will take into account such factors as whether that person is working with other adults and has supervised access to young people. By having the CRB check, the Duchess will be able to expand on the types of activities that she undertakes within the organisation. St James’s Palace added: ‘The Duchess was happy to comply, submitted her forms and is very much looking forward to starting as soon as possible.’ But the fact that even the woman who might one day become the Queen had to undergo such a check has raised questions about the blanket need for vetting. Josie Appleton, director of the . Manifesto Club, a civil liberties group, said: ‘This shows the height of . CRB hysteria, and the fact that nobody is above suspicion. 'Even royals are considered . potentially risky until they have their “safe adult card”. We are . trusting too much to bureaucracy - and not enough to common sense or . people’s reputations. ‘The . chance of the Duchess of Cambridge being a paedophile is precisely zero . - likewise for the thousands of grandmothers and mothers who must do . CRB checks before they can volunteer to listen to children read, or . teach them to cook.’ Ministers have said they want the CRB checks, introduced in 2006 after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, to be reduced to 'common sense' levels . Among those affected by the legislation were a group of cathedral flower arrangers who last year staged a rebellion against demands they undergo the intrusive checks. Twenty women from Gloucester Cathedral Flower Guild, including head flower arranger 64-year-old Annabel Hayter (pictured) refused to have their pasts examined. 'Even royals are considered potentially risky until they have their “safe adult card”. We are trusting too much to bureaucracy - and not enough to common sense or people’s reputations. ‘The chance of the Duchess of Cambridge being a paedophile is precisely zero - likewise for the thousands of grandmothers and mothers who must do CRB checks before they can volunteer to listen to children read, or teach them to cook.’ Most royals hold honorary roles in organisations which means they need not have the checks. The Queen is patron of the Scout Association and the Duke of Kent is its president. Neither has had a CRB check. Founded by Robert Baden-Powell in 1907 to help young people with their ‘physical, mental and spiritual development’, the Scouting movement requires members to be loyal, friendly, courageous and considerate – as well as keeping to the famous motto to ‘Be Prepared’. At the age of eight, Kate enrolled as a Brownie with the 1st St Andrew’s pack in Pangbourne, Berkshire, so has some experience of the movement. Concerns that extensive use of the checks are deterring volunteers and putting vital community services at risk were raised last year despite Coalition pledges to scale them back. It was estimated that almost a million checks were made in the previous 12 months, a six-fold increase since the CRB was launched in 2002. The figures were obtained by the Manifesto Club under the Freedom of Information Act. The Club, which campaigns against over-regulation, claims that many local authorities are still demanding ‘blanket’ vetting of volunteers. Last year the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey criticised ‘unnecessary’ criminal record checks after disclosing he had undergone five just to conduct a service or preach a sermon. Lord Carey said that after he retired from his role in 2002, he had been asked by some dioceses to help out as an assistant bishop. He said that every time he agreed to a new role he was required to have a CRB check – to vet those working with children or the vulnerable – even if he would not be working with children. ‘I had five sometimes,’ he said. ‘It’s crazy.’ Ministers have said they want the checks, introduced in 2006 after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, to be reduced to ‘common sense’ levels. The vetting scheme, which requires everyone working with ‘vulnerable’ groups to register, has been fiercely criticised for requiring checks on a staggering nine million adults, many of them volunteers. Among those affected by the legislation were a group of cathedral flower arrangers who last year staged a rebellion against demands they undergo the intrusive checks. Twenty women from Gloucester Cathedral Flower Guild, including head flower arranger Annabel Hayter, 64, refused to have their pasts examined. Miss Hayter, who was forced to resign because she refused to have the check, said at the time: ‘It is insulting. They are all lovely ladies who would not hurt a fly. They are not paedophiles. When I can rise above the sadness of it all it is laughable, pathetic.'","‘This shows the height of CRB hysteria, and the fact that nobody is above suspicion'"

Double trouble: Twins (from front) Jack and Joshua Davis, Charlotte and Emily Kaur, Adam and Jack Richards, Jake and James Murphy, Catherine and Elizabeth Ormian are all in the same year at school . Teachers and pupils are seeing double at a school which has a record-breaking 20 sets of twins. De Aston School in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, has beaten the British record, with 12 sets more than previous record holder, and is now applying to Guinness World Records to confirm if it has smashed international records. Incredibly, six sets of identical twins started at the school in September with the newest intake of year seven pupils. Teachers at the 907-pupil school are staggered by the phenomenon and said there must be ‘something in the water’ in town. The chances of 20 sets of twins attending the same school are 400,000 to one and having six in the same year group is 175,000 to one. Elizabeth Humphrey, English teacher and year seven tutor, said: ‘I have two sets of identical twins in my tutor group alone and when I first found out, I thought it was ridiculous. ‘The number of twins we have in the school is surprising. ‘A couple of the girls wear their hair differently but other than that it's really tricky to tell them apart.’ Victoria Davies, head of year seven, said: ‘We are looking to get little name badges for their blazer lapels so we can tell who is who. ‘In my 12 years at the school I have never known any more than one set of twins in a year group. ‘I have managed to tell the difference between four of the six but I'm still working on the other two.’ Headteacher Ellenor Beighton said: ‘All of our twins are delightful young people who we treat as individuals and we're very happy to have them here. ‘There's something in the water around Market Rasen, that's for sure.’ The twins have also found it confusing, with their classmates and teachers having troubles telling them apart. Confusing classmates: De Aston School in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire has broken the record for the most sets of twins at one school, with 20 sets at their school, eight more than the next biggest . Charlotte and Laura Wilson, 17, are both studying maths and physics at the sixth form. Charlotte said: ‘The teachers can usually tell us apart but other people get it wrong all the time so after sixth form we want to try and be separate so we're looking at different universities.’ The previous record holder for the most twins at one school was Netherthorpe School, near Chesterfield in Derbyshire, who had eight sets in the same year group. 400,000 to one: Teachers cannot believe how many twins are in attendance, with one saying there must be 'something in the water.' The odds of 20 sets attending the same school is 400,000 to one . According to the Guinness World Records website, the most sets of twins in the same academic year at one school are 16 sets. The record is held by three schools, grade nine at Valley Southwoods Freshman High School in Iowa, the graduating class at the Maine South High School in Illinois and grade 10 at Staples High School in Connecticut. Maine South High School also had three sets of triplets in the graduating class.

Ryanair told a pensioner to abandon his wife while she was recovering from a heart attack and go on holiday with someone else, it is claimed. Former-Lord Mayor of Liverpool Roger Johnston, 74, planned to fly to France next month with his wife Marie, 73. They had booked seats with Ryanir when ex-nurse Marie suffered a heart attack that required surgery, leaving her unable to travel for three months. 'Insulted': Roger Johnston shows off the doctor's sick note confirming his wife had suffered a heart attack. He claims Ryanair told him to go on holiday with someone else instead . But when ex-Lib Dem councillor Roger contacted Ryanair to request a refund he says he was told to change the name on his wife’s ticket and take the flight with 'someone else'. Retired architect Roger, of Woolton, Liverpool, is demanding a refund of the £146-a-head cost of the tickets for both flights from East Midlands Airport to Dinard, France. But he claims that when he explained he was not ill - only his wife - the Ryanair operator suggested he should travel without her. Roger said: 'I was absolutely appalled that they would even insinuate that I should abandon my wife at a time when she needs me the most. It’s morally insulting. 'I want a personal apology from Michael O’Leary. It’s just disgraceful that I would be treated like that when my wife was lying ill in hospital. 'I would never consider leaving my wife in such a situation. We’ve been married to for 40 years and she needs me to help look after her. Journey: Mr Johnston had been due to travel with the Irish airline from East Midlands Airport, pictured, to Dinard, France, with his wife . Rules: Ryanair clauses state that refunds can be issued if a doctor's note is provided confirming the illness, but that the letter must be faxed over to them . 'To make matters worse Ryanir say they can only accept her doctor’s note by fax. 'I believe that this is just obstructive and designed to put people off. 'They do everything else online or by email and they should accept a doctor’s note by email too.' Acknowledgement: Mr Johnston is demanding an apology from Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, pictured . There is a clause in the airline’s Conditions of Travel offering customers a refund in the event that illness prevents them from travelling. It states that a doctor's note must be required to prove that the passenger is unwell. Roger added: 'I asked the woman at Ryanair ''Would you go off on holiday when your husband had suffered a heart attack and had been told he cannot travel?'' 'There was a deafening silence before she told me to fax over with a doctor’s note.' Ryanair said they had listened to a recording of the call and they said he asked is the seats could be used by someone else, at which point the operator told him they could be. They said they offered Mr Johnston a full refund on the condition that they received a doctor's note confirming his wife was sick. Ryanair’s Stephen McNamara told Mail Online: 'Ryanair confirmed to Mr Johnston that a full refund would issue on receipt of a medical letter from his wife’s doctor. 'The passenger called back to advise of a delay in obtaining the required letter (as the doctor was going on holiday) and it was confirmed to him that a refund would issue even if the required medical letter was received after the date of flight. 'Ryanair made all of the passenger’s options clear to him and at all times clearly advised him that a refund would issue. 'At no point did Ryanair suggest he travel without his wife and Ryanair wishes Mrs Johnston a speedy recovery and hopes to welcome the couple onto another Ryanair flight in the near future.'","Roger Johnston, 74, had tickets booked to France .

Vote: William Hague will tell MPs tomorrow the UK is willing to vote for Palestinian UN non-member status . Britain is preparing to recognise Palestine as a state in its own right, senior officials have revealed. Foreign Secretary William Hague will tell MPs tomorrow that the UK is willing to vote in favour of Palestinians having non-member status at the United Nations if their leaders agree to re-enter peace talks with Israel. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas has decided to push ahead with the vote on Thursday despite fears that it will stoke further tensions with Israel after violence erupted in Gaza earlier this month. British diplomats have urged Mr Abbas . not to push for the vote. But Mr Hague is expected to use a statement to . Parliament tomorrow to offer qualified backing for the Palestinians. In a major strategic shift in British . foreign policy, the Foreign Secretary will say Britain would vote Yes if . Mr Abbas agrees to re-enter talks with Israel without preconditions. The UK is also calling on the . Palestinians to ditch calls for the jurisdiction of the International . Criminal Court to include Israel, which is opposed by the Israeli . government. Failure to tweak their motion would lead to Britain abstaining in Thursday’s landmark vote. But Mr Hague is prepared to offer British backing after France today announced that it would support the Palestinians. ‘This Thursday or Friday, when the . question is asked, France will vote yes,’ Foreign Minister Laurent . Fabius announced in the French National Assembly. A Yes vote by the UN General Assembly, . which includes all 193 nations in the UN, would not grant Palestine full . statehood – that would require a motion to be passed in the Security . Council – but it would be a major step towards that goal. The . Palestinians are expected to win the General Assembly vote easily if it . goes ahead and the UK does not want to stand in its way. Mr . Hague will make clear that British support would not necessarily extend . to backing full statehood in a Security Council vote, which would . almost certainly be vetoed by the USA. The United States say Palestinian . statehood must be achieved by negotiation and has called on Abbas to . return to peace talks that collapsed in 2010 over Israeli settlement . construction in the occupied West Bank. Support: Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, right, has decided to push ahead with the vote, which the French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, left, has said France will support . But the suggestion that the UK is prepared to give the Palestinians observer status is a major sea change in British diplomacy which has focused for years on balancing friendships with both Israel and the Palestinians. A senior government source said: ‘We . are talking to the Palestinians and suggesting they could make some . changes to the resolution which would minimise the negative effects on . the peace process. In that case we would be minded to vote Yes. ‘There . are concerns about the jurisdiction of the International Criminal . Court. We’ve made clear there’s no automatic connection between what . happens in the General Assembly and the Security Council.

Former N-Dubz star Dappy has had his trial for affray put back to the New Year so he can go on a £1m music tour. His record label wanted a delay after investing in the series of concerts for his debut solo album, the court heard. The star appeared wearing an Olympic-themed hoodie for his latest hearing into claims he was involved in a row over two girls. The No Regrets singer, along with co-defendants Kieran Patrick Vassell, Kalonji David Stewart, and Alfred James Miller, were accused of brawling on a petrol station forecourt. Relaxed: Former N-Dubz star Dappy smiles outside court today where he appeared alongside three other men accused of affray. Under his grey hoodie he was wearing a suit and tie . The quartet today denied they used or threatened unlawful violence towards another person causing them to fear for their safety. It was alleged that 25-year-old Dappy - real name Dino Costas Contostavlos - had a clash with two girls he had just met after they refused to get into a car with his friends. A confrontation ensued with a group of men and a fight allegedly broke out. It reportedly ended with three men suffering suspected facial injuries. The incident - captured on CCTV cameras from various angles - was said to have happened at a Shell garage, in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey, at 3.30am on February 28. Jimmy Vakil, defending Dappy, said today that the artist and his management would prefer it if the trial could begin early next year. Dates of October 29 and December 10 were initially made available for the jury trial, but Mr Vakil sought a longer adjournment. Dappy hides his face as he arrives at Guildford Crown Court today. He is the cousin of X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, who was also in the band N-Dubz with him . 'My client is in the music industry . and he has a number of commitments,' Mr Vakil said during the plea and . case management hearing at Guildford Crown Court.

When asked by Judge Christopher Critchlow what the defence position was, Mr Vakil said his client denied all the alleged acts. All four defence counsel barristers, each representing a different defendant, asked prosecutor Wendy Cottee of the Crown Prosecution Service, for the CCTV images of the incident to be enhanced to improve the picture quality. That police work was expected to take a number of weeks, the hearing was told. The incident, captured on CCTV cameras from various angles, was said to have happened at a Shell garage (above), in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey on February 28 . Dappy from Royal College Street, Camden, North West London was formerly in trio N-Dubz with his X Factor judge cousin Tulisa Contostavlos and Richard ‘Fazer’ Rawson. The tattooed performer was spotted wearing a grey hoodie with Pink Dolphin and the Olympic rings emblazoned on the back, dark trousers and trainers outside court today. Once inside the building, the dark-haired musician took the sweatshirt off and appeared in the courtroom dock wearing a smart black suit and while shirt.

Joselyn Martinez, 36, conducted an online manhunt to find Justo Santos, 43, who was suspected of killing José 'George' Martinez in 1986. Santos was arrested in Miami last week and appeared in court on Monday to face a charge of murder. Miss Martinez watched from the public gallery as he pleaded not guilty. She said after the court appearance in New York she felt 'satisfaction.' Joselyn Martinez, 36,  was just nine when her father was killed in front of her mother in Manhattan . 'Knowing the person my father was, I couldn’t live with myself if (Santos) stayed free,' Miss Martinez said before the court appearance. Ms Martinez from New York was just nine when her father was killed in front of his wife in Inwood, Manhattan, according to the New York Post. Santos, then 16, and two of his companions were thrown out of Mr Martinez’s restaurant, Dominican Express, after they allegedly started harassing his wife and making sexual comments. On the sidewalk witnesses reportedly told police that Santos pulled a pistol and shot the restaurateur.

The Russian government will not aid businesses that have lost money in Cyprus, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said. Underlining Moscow’s resolve to clamp down on the flight of capital to offshore financial centres. Major account holders, many of them Russian, will lose up to 60 percent of their deposits over £85,000 at Cyprus’s largest bank under a European Union bailout to save the Mediterranean island from bankruptcy. No action: Russian officials said they will not help their citizens with money in Cyprus as the country sinks further into debt . Hard line: Igor Shuvalov, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, said that he might possibly help larger companies but not small businesses or individuals . If Russians lose money ‘it’s a terrible shame, but the Russian government will not take any action in such a situation’, Shuvalov said. But if a large company, in which the Russian state was a shareholder, sustained serious losses then this could be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, Shuvalov added. 'If there is some kind of concrete situation, we would be willing to examine it - publicly, transparently, here in Russia, but for this it would not be necessary to assist Cyprus,' he said. Cyprus is a staging post for large-scale capital flows in and out of Russia - including around a quarter of foreign direct investment flows and foreign lending, according to investment bank Morgan Stanley. Much of that money is taking advantage of favourable tax treatment, but some is seeking to evade the Russian tax authorities, Shuvalov said. Russians were believed to account for most of the almost £19billion of non-EU, non-bank money held in Cypriot banks in January, according to the island’s central bank.","Russian account holders will not receive any help for the Cyprus crisis .

The architect of David Cameron’s policy on gay marriage is leaving Downing Street after losing a power battle with the Prime Minister’s new Election supremo. Andrew Cooper, Mr Cameron’s personal polling guru and a key modernising figure at No 10, is returning to his private business after being usurped by outspoken Australian ‘fixer’ Lynton Crosby. Mr Cooper, who became Director of Government Strategy two years ago, is a former member of the now defunct Social Democratic Party and lobbied Mr Cameron to ditch traditional Right-wing Tory values and policies on Europe, tax and crime in a bid to ‘detoxify’ the Conservatives’ ‘Nasty Party’ image. In contrast, Mr Crosby, who took charge of the Tory campaign machine in January on a £200,000-a-year deal, specialises in ‘dog whistle’ tactics – subtle appeals to voters’ underlying prejudices over issues such as immigration – which are designed to appeal to core Conservative voters. Defiant Mr Crosby denies using ‘dog-whistle’ tactics to send surreptitious messages, saying: ‘It was more like a foghorn.’ He is understood to have been critical of Mr Cameron’s policy on gay marriage for alienating grassroots supporters. Mr Cooper, co-founder of the Populus polling company, helped persuade Mr Cameron that while gay marriage would lose votes among older party supporters in safe seats, more importantly it would attract votes in marginal constituencies. When Mr Crosby’s appointment was announced, Mr Cooper denied threatening to resign. However, he is to leave his Downing Street post to return to Populus, though he is expected to do some part-time work for Tory HQ. Last night, a Tory source said: ‘There was never going to be room for both Andrew and Lynton. Andrew is a fully paid-up Conservative moderniser and believes that the party will never win a governing majority again unless it distances itself from its Thatcherite past. Lynton is an old-fashioned Thatcherite who thinks traditional values and policies are more important than modern fads.’ Success: Lynton Crosby was formerly campaign chief for London Mayor Boris Johnson . Mr Cooper’s critics claim he places too much reliance on New Labour-style focus groups. His supporters say the same techniques helped Tony Blair win three elections and insist it is ‘totally unfair’ to blame him for the so-called ‘omnishambles’ – the series of U-turns – which followed last year’s chaotic Budget. Electoral dynamite: Lynton Crosby helped John Howard in Australia win four elections . Mr Cooper warned Mr Cameron that it would be ‘toxic’ to cut the top rate of income tax from 50p to 40p, following focus group findings that the Prime Minister and his Chancellor were seen as ‘posh’ and ‘out of touch’ characters from TV period drama Downton Abbey. In the end, the Government compromised by cutting it to 45p. Mr Crosby was dubbed The Wizard of Oz after winning four terms for former Australian PM John Howard and is billed as one of the most brilliant, though provocative, strategists of his generation. In one notorious campaign ploy in 2001, he seized on the news that a refugee ship, packed with Afghan asylum seekers, had entered Australian waters. Mr Howard, on Mr Crosby’s advice, refused the passengers entry amid claims that they were trying to blackmail their way in by throwing children overboard. The allegations turned out to be false but the controversy boosted Mr Howard’s ratings and he gained more credit when, shortly afterwards, Islamic extremists attacked America on 9/11. Four years later, Mr Crosby had moved to Britain to advise Michael Howard, whose 2005 General Election campaign was noted for highlighting immigration. Although Mr Howard was beaten by Mr Blair, Mr Crosby was credited for avoiding a third landslide defeat. He went on to mastermind Boris Johnson’s two victories in the London mayoral elections and Mr Johnson urged Mr Cameron to do ‘whatever it takes’ to hire Mr Crosby to run the Tories’ 2015 Election campaign. ‘Push the boat out, break the piggy bank, kill the fatted calf,’ said the Mayor. However, not all of Mr Johnson’s advisers were so impressed. The Mail on Sunday revealed last year how some were shocked when Mr Crosby said Mr Johnson should stop focusing on ‘f***ing Muslims’. Shift: Lynton Crosby wants David Cameron, left, to focus on traditional values like Margaret Thatcher, right . Admirers have hailed his appointment to Mr Cameron’s team for bringing ‘discipline, clarity, toughness and populism’ to Conservative HQ. However, the party’s former Deputy Chairman Lord Ashcroft, a long-standing political and business rival of the Australian, said Mr Cameron had made a mistake and called Mr Crosby ‘a distracting influence’. A No 10 source played down Mr Cooper’s resignation and said: ‘Andrew always planned to return to his business around this time and will carry on doing some work for the Conservative Party.’","Andrew Cooper, a key modernising figure for David Cameron had quit No10 .

Jeremy Hunt is due to reveal how numbers at A&E departments have shot up by four million a year since the last government agreed a controversial GPs' contract . Labour’s ‘disastrous’  decision to allow family  doctors to give up responsibility for out-of-hours care has forced A&E departments to deal with millions more patients, the Health Secretary will warn today. Jeremy Hunt will reveal how numbers have shot up by four million a year since the last government agreed a controversial GPs’ contract – which allowed them to shirk their obligations to work in the evenings and at weekends. Mr Hunt and NHS England are now conducting a fundamental review of out-of-hours care, and are expected to report at the end of next month. In a speech in London, he will say the NHS is guilty of a ‘fundamental failure’ to provide decent care for people with long-term conditions, who should be able to access better support round the clock, rather than having to go to hospital. Citing pressure on A&E as the ‘biggest operational challenge facing the NHS’, the Health Secretary will say: ‘When I have been visiting A&Es in recent weeks, hard-working staff talk about the same issues: lack of beds to admit people, poor out-of-hours GP services, inaccessible primary care and a lack of co-ordination across the health system. ‘The decline in out-of-hours care follows the last government’s disastrous changes to the GP contract, since when we have seen four million more people using A&E every year. ‘We must address these system failures, and I am determined we will.’ Labour allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends as part of a botched contract which came into force in 2004. Since then, private companies have taken over and in many cases have been forced to employ foreign doctors, often with little grasp of English. The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted the deterioration in the service since the contract was changed. A Harris poll for this newspaper showed that 60 per cent of people believe out-of-hours care has got worse. The number of attendances at A&E has increased from 17.8 million before the new GPs’ contract to 21.7 million last year. Official reports claim lives may have been put at risk since responsibility for out-of-hours care was transferred from GPs to primary care trusts (file picture shows hospital accident and emergency entrance) Official reports claim lives may have been put at risk since responsibility for out-of-hours care was transferred from GPs to primary care trusts.

He had snatched just a few hours of sleep after flying in to work for a private out-of-hours firm. Errors by German surgeon Werner Kolb cost the life of Ena Dickinson, 94, who lost massive amounts of blood during what was meant to be a routine hip operation at Grantham Hospital, Lincolnshire.

But Mr Cameron said waiting times were either ‘stable or down’ since the last election, and that ministers had ‘virtually abolished’ mixed-sex wards and dramatically reduced superbug infections.","Jeremy Hunt and NHS England conducting review of out-of-hours care .

Chick lit author Louise Mensch says she can no longer represent Corby in Northamptonshire because she cannot juggle her political and family lives. Mrs Mensch, who had been touted as a future minister, will instead move to New York with her three children to live with her second husband Peter, who is manager of rock supergroup Metallica. They secretly married in America last year. 'I am completely devastated. It’s been unbelievably difficult to manage family life,' she told the Northamptonshire Telegraph. 'We have been trying to find a way forward with the Prime Minister’s office but I just can’t spend as much time with my children as I want to.' Mrs Mensch will announce her resignation later this morning and a by-election will take place on November 15. It is understood she was going to quit in 2015 but couldn't carry on any longer. She has three children, aged four, seven and eight, from her first marriage to property developer Anthony LoCicero. 'I love Corby and East Northamptonshire but my family has to come first,' she said. 'When I took the post I was in a different position but sometimes life throws you a curve ball that you didn’t expect. 'We are now going to be moving out to New York as a family.

Leaving: Tory MP Louise Mensch, pictured with her band manager husband Peter Mensch in her Corby constituency, will be living together in New York for good . And her resignation in a tight marginal seat will prove a major test for David Cameron’s Tories. Mrs Mensch - then Louise Bagshawe before . her marriage last year - won by only 1,951 votes in the 2010 general . election. Labour had previously held the constituency since 1997. Her resignation sparked rumors that Boris Johnson would be jettisoned in to fight for the vacant seat.

But the Mayor of London said this . morning: 'I'm sure Corby is a lovely town but I have a fantastic job . running the best big city on the planet.' In her resignation letter to the Prime Minister, the mother-of-three said: 'As you know, I have been struggling for some time to find the best outcome for my family life, and have decided, in order to keep us together, to move to New York. Mrs Mensch told Mr Cameron that letting her to work from her constituency on Thursdays and Fridays had allowed her to spend more time with her children. 'Unfortunately, it has not proved to be enough. I am very sorry that, despite my best efforts, I have been unable to make the balancing act work for our family,' she said. The Prime Minister replied that he was aware it had been 'a particularly difficult period for you and your family. 'With that in mind, it is with enormous regret that I accept your resignation as the Member of Parliament for Corby and East Northamptonshire, a seat that had been Labour for 13 years before you,' he said. 'I do so only because I wish to support you in acting in the best interests of your family, which must come first.' Mr Cameron said Mrs Mensch had been an 'inspiring' MP and hinted that she had been in line for a role in the Government. 'It goes without saying that I had wished to see you serve for longer and at a more senior level,' he said. 'But you have made a tremendous contribution in the short period you have served in the House of Commons, and have much to be very proud of.' The Tory MP managed to shock viewers of BBC's Question Time last night with an emotional . account of how doing Class A drugs in her youth had ‘messed with her . head’. Mensch clashed . with punk star Johnny Rotten – real name John Lydon – on the topic of the . legalisation of drugs, appearing close to tears as she claimed her . experiences had left her with ‘long-term mental health effects’. Party lifestyle: Louise Mensch, pictured in her 20s, admitted to taking Class A drugs on live TV last month . Mrs Mensch, 41, refused to reveal what she had taken, as she said she did not want to ‘glorify’ the use of any particular drug. ‘It’s something that I regret incredibly in my youth, that I messed with my brain. I have said we all do stupid things when we are young. It’s had long-term mental health effects on me,' she said. ‘It’s caused me to be more anxious than I need to be... I did serious drugs and it messed with my head and it’s a terrible thing.’ Mrs Mensch, whose novels are published under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe, had previously admitted she took drugs in her 20s, when she worked in the music industry.

It comes after a High Court judge threw out an application for the infamous 'Meriden Gypsies' to stay on the site on Eaves Green Lane in Meriden, Warwickshire,  last month. The field on Eaves Green Lane is cleared by a gypsy following a High Court judge order last month . Local residents have staged a three-year campaign to remove the illegal gypsy camp from the site, pictured . The gypsies set a caravan on fire, pictured, in a final show of defiance as they prepared to leave the site . Up to 200 local residents, many in their 70s, have kept a round-the-clock human barricade on the green belt land since the travellers arrived in May 2010 to the camp. The campaign group, known as Residents Against Inappropriate Development, maintained the vigil in all weather conditions to prevent more travellers from gaining access. The protest lasted a whopping 1,086 days. Head of RAID David McGrath said that they were 'relieved' the gypsies had finally left - but that the battle was still far from over. He explained: 'I think there is a great sense of relief that they are leaving. But that is just the end of this part of the campaign.

'They still need to return the camp to the way it was the day before they moved in, exactly the way it was. 'That means not just leaving but removing all the sewerage and water pipes under the ground that they installed and reseeding the ground. 'We will keep up with targeted protests until that is done. There has already been a for sale sign put up on the land. 'We won't pay a kings ransom for the land. The long legal battle has proven it is not for residential purposes, it is an agricultural field. 'There was only one caravan actually left habitable, we saw them burning another one only a couple of nights ago. 'But now we need to make sure they don't just bulldoze everything, they must return it to exactly how it was before they came. 'We have stayed until they have, but we know that the council have taken legal action against both sides - so we won't be off the site until Monday.

'Their legacy goes beyond the battle of Eaves Green Lane.' The fire brigade and police were called to the camp, pictured, after the gypsies caused disruption . The field on Eaves Green Lane, pictured, is almost empty except for one occupied caravan as the gypsies leave . The local campaign group, known as Residents Against Inappropriate Development, kept a vigil in all weather conditions to prevent more travellers from gaining access to the field . The judge has given the travellers a further month to restore the site, pictured, to its former green belt state . The camp was set up after the travellers bought the land from a local businessman for £100,000 and moved in over a bank holiday weekend. But angry residents wanted to preserve the green belt which separates the village from Coventry and Solihull. They formed a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of rubble to the site later that evening fearing it would ruin their tranquility. Ever since then, local residents have worked on a rota basis, with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight. The judge gave the gypsies until April 21 to move and a further month to restore the site to its former green belt state. The departure of the gypsies is a victory for local residents, pictured, who campaigned tirelessly . Landowner Noah Burton, 48, a spokesman for the travellers said that there were 'no winners'. He said: 'We have been left homeless and the residents have been left with the stigma of the gypsy site having been there. 'The head of RAID's house is still barely worth £5,000 even when we have gone, the history of us being there is all over the place. 'This was never about green belt land, it was only about not wanting gypsies on their doorsteps, they told me that many times. 'Now the people who lived on the site have had to leave their jobs, the only reason there is still a family there is because she had to work her notice. 'She has made herself redundant from her job because we have to leave and she won't be able to go. 'I can't tell you where the families have gone because many of them are forced to stop at the roadside now and the police have moved them on a few times already. 'We will still be around, you just won't be able to see us any more on the land. 'The council could have helped us, found a new site and moved us in straight away. Then everyone would have been happy. 'Once the last families have moved out, the work will begin to return the land to its former state.' Spring 2009: Noah Burton buys land off Eaves Green Lane, Meriden. April 2010: Gipsies move on to the land and apply for planning permission. May 2010: Solihull Council applies for, and wins, injunction to prevent travellers building until planning application has been considered.

Paul Kingston managed to capture comet C/2011 L4 PanSTARRS in almost clear skies above the Irish Sea as it graced the western horizon trailing a blaze of fire. The pictures were taken over from near Whitehaven, Cumbria, and at St Bridget's Church in the nearby seaside village of Lowca. Scroll down for video . It's here! Comet C/2011 L4 PanSTARRS is seen in almost clear skies over the coast of Cumbria last night . PanSTARRS is pictured in the sky above St Bridget's Church, Lowca, Cumbria: Photographer Paul Kingston said he has been looking forward to seeing the comet in our skies for months . Mr Kingston, 31, of Teesdale, said: . 'It was an amazing sight to see the comet which I've been looking . forward to seeing for some months now. 'It's . one of the first glimpses we've had in the UK due to cloud cover but . there was a fantastic sunset and beautiful clear skies. 'It . was really difficult to spot at first, with it being in the same part . of the sky as the setting Sun, but once darkness set in, it was there in . all its glory, beneath the crescent moon. 'It's . very difficult to see with the naked eye, but with binoculars or a DSLR . camera you shouldn't have a problem and it's due to be in the western . skies for the next few weeks.' PanSTARRS has already been visible to observers in the southern hemisphere for some weeks, but appeared in northern skies for the first time in the past few days. Yesterday MailOnline published pictures of the comet blazing a trail through the skies over Las Vegas and southern California and, in coming weeks, observers at ever higher latitudes will have a chance to see it. Currently a mere 93million miles away, it is now heading away from our solar system and is not expect to return for another 100,000 years. However, it will be visible in the northern hemisphere for the next few weeks, just after sunset in the west. Just dropping by: Currently a mere 93million miles away, the comet is now heading away from our solar system and is not expect to return for another 100,000 years . To find PanSTARRS in UK skies, stargazers will need a clear sky, ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon, according to the Royal Astronomical Society. After sunset the comet will appear as a misty patch not far from the crescent Moon, low down in the western sky. Searching for PanSTARRS through binoculars is recommended, and it will help to see the tails which should be pointing upwards from the horizon. It will be visible for the next couple of weeks, but as the nights pass the comet will move away from the Sun and fade and light from the Moon will interfere more. PanSTARRS' name is an acronym for the . Hawaiian telescope used to spot it two years ago - the Panoramic Survey . Telescope and Rapid Response System. The . volcano-top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and . comets that might be headed our way. - and in recent months there have . been several. Like other . comets of its type, PanSTARRS is thought to have originated in the Oort . Cloud, a vast region containing millions of comets located more than two . light years from the Sun. PanSTARRS . travelled in towards the inner Solar system for millions of years, . dormant for most of this time as a small nucleus made up of rock and . ices. When comets approach . the Sun, these ices heat up, eventually turning to gases that jet out . into space together with dusty material to form a head or coma around . the cometary nucleus. Particles . from the Sun (the so-called solar wind) blow the gases back in a . straight tail, whilst sunlight exerts a pressure on the dust particles . to create a curved tail.

'As the days pass, the comet will move away from the Sun and fade and light from the Moon will interfere more. 'At the same time however, PANSTARRS will be higher up, will be visible later in the night and so be seen in a darker sky. 'After . its brief period of visibility, the comet will travel back out towards . the depths of space where it will be only be detected by large . telescopes.'

The comet PanSTARRS, above and to the right, passes over the Stratosphere Casino Hotel, Las Vegas: Observers in southern U.S. states have already been able to see it for several days . Comet PanSTARRS is the first of two comets which will appear in the night sky this year in the UK. Later this year, in November and December, Comet ISON is expected to be one of the brightest comets ever seen and experts believe it will be brighter than the moon in the night sky. And next year astronomers are anticipating potential cosmic fireworks after they identified a comet hurtling into our solar system that could hit Mars with potentially catastrophic force. According to current calculations, comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the Red Planet. But the unpredictable nature of comet orbits, which can change as jet-like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the Sun, means it could pass further away, or veer into a direct collision course.","Comet PanSTARRS seen over the Irish Sea from the Cumbrian coast .

David Cameron has been urged to drop his plans to regulate the Press because they ‘run counter to bedrock principles of a democracy’. Some of America’s leading journalists have written to the Prime Minister saying he will encourage dictators around the world to suppress their newspapers unless he takes a ‘step back’ from creating a new watchdog backed up by statute. Their letter warns that Britain will lose its ‘moral authority’ to criticise authoritarianism elsewhere if it brings in a statutory response to the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards. Under fire: An association of some of the top journalists in the US has written to David Cameron, pictured, to urge him to rethink Press reform plans . The Tories signed up to a deal thrashed out at 2.30am last month which will see a Royal Charter, underpinned by law, used to establish a new watchdog to police the Press regulator. Controversially, the deal was drawn up in the office of Labour leader Ed Miliband in the presence of four members of pressure group Hacked Off. Media organisations in the UK have warned that the plans, which will see papers that refuse to sign up threatened with punitive damages in court, are likely to be in breach of European law. Mr Cameron backs the plans but the Committee to Protect Journalists compares them to draconian rules in place in Eastern Europe. The letter, signed by the committee’s executive director, Joel Simon, says: ‘Those news organisations that opt out of the mechanism face the prospect of “exemplary damages”, a concept that reminds us of Hungary’s unpalatable media law in its potential to foster self-censorship and chill investigative journalism.’ It says statutory under-pinning does ‘run counter to bedrock principles of a democracy’. Powerful members: Arianna Huffington, left, founder of news website the Huffington Post and former CBS anchor Dan Rather, right, are on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists . It adds: 'It is the job of journalists to hold governments to account and thus ensure the full participation of citizens. 'A natural antagonism therefore exists between the press and those in power--but in some instances, governments seek to pass legislation to restrict the media and even criminalize investigative reporting. 'It would be highly regrettable if such leaders could point to the British parliament as precedent for introducing statutory media controls or regulations.' The committee, based in New York, is an independent, non-profit organisation that promotes Press freedom worldwide. Its directors include senior figures from: the three main US television news networks ABC, NBC and CBS; The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune; The New Yorker and The Nation magazines. Dan Rather, one of America’s best known former news anchors and Arianna Huffington, founder of the Huffington Post, the American news website, sit on its board. Their letter warns that the ‘hasty’ way the deal was thrashed out sends the ‘wrong message’ to the rest of the world where dictators want to ‘rein in irksome reporters’. It says: ‘Prime Minister, we urge you to take a step back from the current proposals, which do not take into account the implications for Press freedom beyond Fleet Street. Deal: Plans to reform regulation of the Press were thrashed out after Lord Leveson published his report into newspaper practice . 'Online journalists and bloggers and those outside the London-based, national newspaper establishment need to have their voices heard too. 'The haste with which this deal has been put together leaves too many unanswered questions. ‘Journalists, especially those working under authoritarian regimes, are watching and hoping that their colleagues in Britain can find a better solution than regulation anchored in law. ‘Mr Cameron, we think that in the interests of global Press freedom, you should allow them the opportunity to do so. 'Many responsible journalists in Britain acknowledge the sins of Fleet Street, but most argue that these can be addressed through existing legislation. 'Use the criminal law to prosecute criminal behavior; make the civil law more accessible to the victims of unscrupulous newspapers; and do not try to impose standards of fairness and accuracy in newsrooms through statute.' Last month the Daily Mail highlighted how the world’s media has reacted with astonishment to the plans to shackle newspapers with state regulation. Even the Russians and Iranians scorned the plans. Newspapers in Moscow accused the UK of censorship while a state-owned Iranian TV channel announced: ‘The measure puts in danger freedom of expression and democracy.’","America's leading journalist have warned that Britain will lose 'moral authority'

Infighting and horse-trading overshadow the other global superpower picking a new leader this week. China’s Communists leaders will gather amid tight security in Beijing tomorrow to begin a week-long, tightly choreographed display of power and unity - at the end of which they will unveil the mysterious men tasked to lead the world’s second largest economy for the next ten years. In stark contrast to the nail-biting US election, just who will govern the world’s most populous country has been decided in advance and behind closed doors by the authoritarian regime. New leader: Vice President Xi Jinping is set to take over the leadership of the Communist Party and become the new President . It is almost certain that vice-president Xi Jinping, 59, one of the select group of 'princelings' descended from former party grandees, will be appointed Party Secretary and replace current president Hu Jintao. The other members chosen to serve on the all powerful Politburo Standing Committee remain unknown, though it has been indicated that no women will be among them. They grip the reins of power facing a slew of challenges - including a slowing economy, rampant corruption, environmental degradation, growing public dissent and the ever restive Tibet and Muslim-populated Xinjiang. Many observers believe sweeping political reform is vital to keep China stable and prevent an economic meltdown sending the world economy into another tailspin. Power retiring: Hu Jintao is stepping down after ten years leading China, during which time the country has grown into one of the world's economic superpowers . 'What they do economically is of vital significance to the world,' said Jonathan Fenby, the head of China analyst firm Trusted Resources and the author of several books on China. 'China's rise has made it the global game changer with the second biggest economy, foreign reserves of more than £2.5 trillion and investments ranging from Thames Water and Heathrow airport to huge holdings in raw materials producers around the planet,' he added. But fears are growing the murky power play and jockeying among two cliques has seen hard-lined conservatives smack down liberal reformers. Scandal: The conviction of Gu Kailai, wife of former senior party member Bo Xilai, over the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood, shook the party . The toxic run in to the once-in-a-decade power transition has been played out against China’s worst political scandals since the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy massacre. Disgraced senior party member Bo Xilai, whose wife Gu Kailai was convicted of murdering of British businessman Neil Heywood, has been expelled from the party and awaits trial on a raft of charges, including covering up the murder of the Briton. Earlier this week it was claimed the Chinese government believed Heywood – who had close links with the Bos– was an MI6 informant.","The leader of China is elected every ten years by senior party members .

Executed: Manuel Pardo was a decorated Florida police officer before turning to a shocking life of crime and murdering nine people . A former police officer who murdered nine people during a 1986 crime spree was executed Tuesday after his attorneys' last-minute appeals were rejected. Manuel Pardo, 56, was pronounced dead at Florida State Prison at 7:47 p.m., about 16 minutes after the lethal injection process began. His attorneys had tried to block the execution by arguing that he was mentally ill, but federal courts declined to intercede. Reporters could not hear his final statement because of an apparent malfunction in the death chamber's sound system. A white sheet had been pulled up to his chin and IV lines ran into his left arm. He blinked several times, his eyes moved back and forth and he took several deep breaths. Over the next several minutes the color drained from his face before he was pronounced dead. Prison officials said his final words were, 'Airborne forever. I love you, Michi baby,' referring to his daughter. Pardo also wrote a final statement in which he claimed that he never killed any women, but 'accepted full responsibility for killing six men. 'I never harmed those 3 women or any female,' he wrote on December 11, hours before his execution. 'I don't want this hanging over my head, especially these last few minutes of life, because my war was against men who were trafficing (sic) in narcotics and no one else!' Most of Pardo's victims were involved . with drugs, officials said, and Pardo contended that he was doing the . world a favor by killing them. 'I . am a soldier, I accomplished my mission and I humbly ask you to give me . the glory of ending my life and not send me to spend the rest of my . days in state prison,' the then-31-year-old Pardo told jurors at his . 1988 trial. Over a 92-day period in early 1986, Pardo committed a series of robberies and killings. He took photos of the victims and . recounted some details in his diary, which was found along with . newspaper clippings about the murders. Pardo was linked to the killings after using credit cards stolen from the victims. He had become fascinated with Adolf Hitler, collecting Nazi memorabilia. His dog, a Doberman pinscher, had a swastika tattoo. Frank Judd, the nephew of victim Fara Quintero read a statement following the execution, which was witnessed by fewer than 10 family members of the victims. Judd thanked the state of Florida for bringing closure to his family and said the pain he and his relatives feel about the murder of Quintero 'continues to this day.' 'Personally, I don't feel that what happened today was enough justice,' he said, adding that Pardo was a 'disturbed soul.' Pardo's final letter apologized to his family for the 'pain and grief' he caused. 'You all are so loving and wonderful, not deserving of this nightmare,' he wrote. He asked his family to please not suffer and to 'be strong.' Convicted: Pardo, pictured in a 1988 court appearance, was 31 when he went on the three-month killing spree in Florida. He killed six men and three women . Pardo also touched on his love of sports, devoting one of three paragraphs in his letter to baseball, soccer and bullfighting. He ate a last meal of rice, red beans, roasted pork, plantains, avocado, tomatoes and olive oil. For dessert, he ate pumpkin pie and drank egg nog and Cuban Coffee. Pardo was a decorated Florida policeman before he was fired for lying and turned to life as a vigilante. His . attorneys tried to block his execution, arguing in federal appeals that . he is mentally ill, something his trial attorney believed more than two . decades ago. 'I think that anyone who would get up and ask a jury sentence him to death is insane,' lawyer Ronald Guralnick said recently. Indicted: Pardo was first charged of first-degree murder in 1986 . Pardo, a former Boy Scout and Navy . veteran, began his law enforcement career in the 1970s with the Florida . Highway Patrol, graduating at the top of his class at the academy. But he was fired from that agency in . 1979 for falsifying traffic tickets. He was soon hired by the police . department in Sweetwater, a small city in Miami-Dade County. In 1981, Pardo was one of four Sweetwater officers charged with brutality, but the cases were dismissed. In 1982, The Miami Herald reported that Pardo saved a 2-month-old boy's life by reviving him with CPR. Another story, written by famed South Florida columnist and novelist Carl Hiassen, noted that Pardo arrested a man for stealing valuable parrots and cockatoos to use as live sacrifices for a Santeria ritual. He was fired four years later after he flew to the Bahamas to testify at the trial of a Sweetwater colleague who was accused of drug smuggling. Pardo lied, telling the court they were international undercover agents. Odd hobby: After he was fired from the police department, Pardo, left, became obsessed with Adolf Hitler . 'He was very cold,' retired prosecutor David Waksman told the Herald recently. 'He was doing robberies and went home and slept like a baby. He was proud of what he did.' One victim was a confidential informant who sold Pardo guns. Others, like Musa's sister, were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Guralnick thought Pardo was insane and tried to use that as a defense, arguing he couldn't tell right from wrong. Over Guralnick's objections, Pardo insisted on testifying at his trial, telling jurors that he enjoyed killing people and wished he could have murdered more. 'They're parasites and they're leeches, and they have no right to be alive,' he said in court. 'Somebody had to kill these people.' Guralnick said his client was not only a rigid, military-loving man, but also a product of the lawless, cocaine cowboys-fueled zeitgeist of 1980s Miami. 'I'm not admitting that he did any of that, but let's say he did,' said Guralnick. 'He was a victim of the time. The people he was dealing with were trash.' In a news conference following his conviction, Pardo said that instead of choosing to model himself after Hitler, he could have idolized Martin Luther King Jr. or John F. Kennedy. 'But they were pacifists,' he said. 'I'm an activist.' While on death row, Pardo placed ads in tabloid newspapers, looking for pen pals. He eventually corresponded with dozens of women and convinced many to send him money through the mail, collecting $3,500. Pardo was dubbed the 'Death Row Romeo.' Guralnick said that Pardo was a 'guy's guy' and that as an officer, he did some commendable things. 'You can do something wrong and do a lot of right things, too,' said Guralnick.","Manuel Pardo was a decorated officer before turning to a life of crime .

The ongoing row over John Sweeney’s undercover documentary on North Korea has been blown out of all proportion. I was one of the students who travelled to Pyongyang with the BBC Panorama reporter and I was fully aware of the risks. Did the BBC exploit us as students? I don’t think so. The ramifications of what Mr Sweeney was doing and what might happen to us were outlined to me – and I believe to us as a group – as soon as we signed up to the trip. I was aware that a journalist was coming, and I was aware our organiser worked for the BBC. We knew the dangers – potential detention, arrest, or deportation and blacklisting. And I believe that I, as a 21-year-old student in international relations, am in a position to give my informed consent, even though the London School of Economics (LSE) says otherwise. Backing: LSE student Mila Akimova says the BBC was right to infiltrate the trip to North Korea and insists students knew undercover reporter John Sweeney was with them . In truth, the trip was organised neither by the LSE, nor by the student society that advertised it. The LSE was merely a medium through which a group was formed. It was not involved in any other way. The college must have had its reasons for intervening, but in allowing the issue to become a nationwide media sensation, it has attracted unwanted attention to the matter. The trip to North Korea was an invaluable experience for me. When we read about the country in our university library, there was a temptation to remain sceptical, perhaps to think that critical analysis is coloured by Western ideas that equate simple lifestyles with suffering. But there is a huge difference between reading and first-hand experience. When you land in Pyongyang, you take those doubts with you. You notice the barren landscape and think many countries have similar geography and remember that it’s still the end of winter. Then you meet your minders, and they seem perfectly normal people. They even let me keep my phone. And then things go steadily downhill. Everywhere you see the faces of the Kims, the world’s only communist dynasty. You note the fact that the country is ruled by its dead president, asleep in a spotless mausoleum, celebrated with millions of pounds’ worth of gifts, while the rest of the country starves and shivers. You see empty universities, hospitals, barren farms and factories long out of use; barbed wire surrounding what was meant to be a spa resort. A people stunted by malnutrition and living in fear, and yet still managing to seem jovial and good-humoured, waving and smiling to us from the streets. It is harrowing to realise that you could easily have been in their place – they, too, have families, hopes and dreams, their jobs and everyday lives, and yet they do not have so many things that we take for granted. It is true that we were not attacked, shot at or threatened; and yet, even my grandmother’s accounts of the Stalinist regime she grew up with in Russia did not lessen the impact of being within that prison state. As tourists, we stayed in luxury hotels – by North Korean standards. We were driven around in a bus and yet you feel the isolation. You feel restricted. Then, as the days roll by, you begin to feel patronised. Suffocated. Imprisoned. When we finally escaped the country and our Air Koryo plane landed in Beijing, we felt liberated, even though China is hardly a beacon of human rights. In queuing up to attack the BBC, Mr Sweeney’s critics have served only to portray journalistic endeavour in an entirely negative light. They have forgotten about the big picture: that the Panorama film aimed to expose the reality of life under the North Korean regime. The film raised a very important point, that the country is seen as a communist state and yet, despite its initial alliance with the USSR and Mao’s China, it has evolved to be a far-Right state much closer to Hitler’s Germany, complete with genocide against its own people, who are slowly starving to death. Called the ‘hermit kingdom’, it lives up to its name. There is no mobile network. No internet. No news from outside its heavily guarded borders. When one enters, one enters a social tundra. The doctrine of self-reliance and making one’s own destiny, Juche – the North Koreans’ brand of communism – has been twisted and distorted by the totalitarian government, turning the country’s borders into prison bars and the ideology into a sordid farce that upholds its regime. The critics, too, belittle the benefits to the students of witnessing the work of an undercover journalist, the difficulties they face and the difficult choices they have to make. I believe it was a priceless contribution to my education. The North Korean authorities would certainly not have welcomed a journalist aiming to disclose the dark secrets of their rogue state. I hope that as the temperature cools, more focus will be placed on the film and less on the ill-informed sideshow about the so-called ‘exploitation’ of me and my fellow students.","LSE student Mila Akimova says BBC did NOT exploit her and fellow undergraduates .

Scientists have unlocked the mystery of how a man with uncrossed optic nerves is still able to see thanks to the incredible adaptability of the human brain. In most people the optic nerves have a crossroads - known as an optic chiasm - which diverts sense data so that each half of their brains processes information from either side of their visual field. But the 28-year-old subject, known only as GB, was born without this crossover, meaning each half of his brain is forced to process information from his whole visual field. Uncrossed: These fMRI scans of GB and a . control show how he lacks the optic chiasm which normally diverts sense data so that each half of the brain only processes information . from one side of the visual field . The condition, called achiasma, means . all the signals from his left eye end up in his left visual cortex and . all the signals from his right eye end up in his right visual cortex. Given the disorder, Canadian neurologist Jodie Davies-Thompson, of the University of British Columbia, and colleagues wondered how his brain made sense of it. Normally the left visual cortex deals only with the left side of visual space, while the right visual cortex deals with the right side, explained Discover magazine's Neuroskeptic blog. But in GB's brain each half must cope with the entire visual field, twice as much space. In a paper published in the journal Neuropsychologia, Dr Thompson and her colleagues reported that GB's brain has adapted by overlapping the two halves of space in GB's visual cortex. In the fMRI scans of GB's brain published in their study, four colours are used to represent the four quarters of his visual field and the parts of his brain that light up in response to them. The bottom and top of his visual field remain separately represented, as they would be in a normal person's brain. But there is a complete overlap between areas responding to bottom-left and bottom-right, as well as top-left and top-right. The adaptable brain: to deal with the information there is a complete overlap between areas of GB's brain responding to bottom-left and bottom-right of his visual field, as well as top-left and top-right . The incredible adaptability of the human brain is further revealed by GB's 20/80 score in an eye test - one quarter as good as a typical person, despite his congenital disorder. Neuroskeptic remarks on the study: 'This is a fascinating case report, and vision neuroscientists will find much to ponder here. 'Still, what I’d love to know is how does it feel to have overlapping representations of the two sides of space? 'Does everything seem to be mirrored vertically? Does GB find it easier to tell objects apart when they’re above and below the other, compared to side-to-side?'","Patient known only as GB was born with no crossover in his optic nerves, a rare congenital condition known as achiasma .

The homeless older brother of billionaire pop star Madonna required nine stitches to his forehead after he resisted arrest in a public bathroom in northern Michigan, police revealed Tuesday. Law enforcement officials were called in Sunday night when 56-year-old Anthony Ciccone refused to leave the bathroom at the Grand Traverse County Civic Center. Police say a female officer attempted to arrest Ciccone on an outstanding warrant for trespass, but he showed resistance. Down on his luck: Anthony Ciccone, 56, Madonna's older brother, had to get nine stitches after being slammed to the floor by an officer during an arrest on an outstanding trespass warrant . In response, the responding police officer brought the unruly 56-year-old man to the ground. As a result, Ciccone's face hit the bathroom floor. He was taken to Munson Medical Center, where he received several stitches. Police say at the time of his arrest, Ciccone's blood-alcohol level was 0.40, which is five times the legal limit in Michigan. No attorney is listed for Ciccone, who was arraigned on the warrant and jailed. Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, declined to comment. Madonna is a Michigan native. Police received a 911 call at around 11pm Sunday reporting that a man was refusing to leave a detached bathroom and challenged a cleaning crew at the Grand Traverse County Civic Center on West Civic Center Drive. Different paths: Anthony Ciccone (left) has been homeless for the past three years, struggling to survive on the snowy streets of Michigan, while his sister Madonna (right), recently reached $1billion in net worth . Traverse City Police Capt Brian Heffner told the Traverse City Record-Eagle that Madonna’s 56-year-old sibling confronted the responding officer in an aggressive manner when she attempted to restrain and arrest him on an outstanding trespassing warrant. 'She turned him around and brought him to the ground, which is when he struck his face on the bathroom floor,' Heffner said. According to authorities, the warrant stemmed from a March incident when Ciccone was reclining in front of a fireplace at Horizon Books and refused to leave. Ciccone was arraigned Monday on the trespassing warrant and ordered held without bond in the Grand Traverse County Jail. Anthony, the oldest of the seven living Ciccone siblings, has been living on the streets for the past three years, during which time he had several run-ins with the law. He recently spent a month in jail after being arrested drunk in a church and swearing in front of children. A family divided: Madonna (centre) with her siblings (from left-to-right): Anthony (now homeless in Michigan), Jennifer, Paula, Christopher, Mario, Melanie and Marty pictured in 1986 . Recently, the 56-year-old homeless man suffering from an alcohol addicito9n told MailOnline that his glamorous 54-year-old sister, whose net worth stands at $1billion, does not care if he is dead or alive. 'I never loved her in the first place, she never loved me. We never loved each other,' her told MailOnline in an interview last week. Anthony Ciccone lost his job at the family vineyard owned by his father, Tony, and his stepmother, Joan, after being found sprawled on his back drinking wine straight from the vats. 'My father would be very happy if I died of hypothermia and then he would not have to worry about it anymore. He’s old school, he grew up in the depression,' the 56-year-old said. However, a family friend who works at the Ciccone vineyard claims that Anthony's parents are terrified that he might die any day, but refuse to take him back until he cleans up his act and quits drinking. Legal woes: Mr Ciccone recently spent a month in jail after being arrested intoxicated in a church and swearing in front of children . Giving his version of why he was sacked, he said:  'I planted grapes, I picked grapes, worked my hands in the earth.

"By . David Richards . UPDATED: . 11:24 EST, 5 January 2012 . The Attorney General is today reviewing whether the jail terms handed out to Stephen Lawrence's killers are 'unduly lenient'. The surprise move by Britain's top legal officer came after the trial judge suggested he would have doubled the minimum sentence of Gary Dobson and David Norris if the law had allowed. A member of the public, unconnected to the Lawrence family, applied for the review within hours of the killers being jailed at the Old Bailey. It is the only referral made so far. Stephen's mother Doreen had yesterday described the 15- and 14-year sentences as 'quite low' but acknowledged: 'The judge's hands were tied.' The judge was restricted by defunct legislation when he imposed the stiffest sentences allowable for offenders who were juveniles back in 1993. Flashpoint: Neil Acourt (number 1) his brother Jamie (2) and Luke Knight (3) are among the gang who came out fighting after the public inquiry in 1998 . Attorney General Dominic Grieve will examine the sentences to see if they are unduly lenient. Once a request is made, he has no choice but to review the sentence as part of his public interest function. Mrs Lawrence added: 'They took my son's life, so I feel they should be given life with a minimum of 20 years. 'Their age had nothing to do with it. They had the same mindset at 16 and 17 that they probably still have . now. I would have liked longer sentences but the law is the law.' Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, . said he was 'satisfied' with the outcome - after being told the . convicted men would be made to serve their full minimum term. He added . that he hoped the pair would 'give up the rest of the people' involved. Once a request is made to the . Attorney General he has no choice but to review the sentence as part of . his public interest function. The development came after it emerged . that police are assessing new information as part of efforts to hunt . down other suspects in the 1993 racist murder. Scotland Yard has denied claims the . investigation was being scaled down, with Commissioner Bernard . Hogan-Howe saying other suspects will not be allowed to 'rest easily in . their beds'. Dobson, 36, who is already serving a five-year sentence for drug-dealing, was sentenced to at least 15 years and two months. Norris, 35, was given a minimum of 14 . years and three months for the murder, which the judge said was a . 'terrible and evil crime'. Mr Justice Treacy urged police not to . 'close the file' on catching the rest of his killers after the court . heard that a gang of five or six white youths set upon the A-level . student in Eltham, South-East London. Flashpoint: David Norris, (left to right) Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight, (Gary Dobson obscured) and Neil Acourt leave the Stephen Lawrence public inquiry . Stephen in his favourite T-shirt when he was about 16 years old . Police are following up new information they have received from five phone calls since Tuesday's guilty verdicts. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'We . can confirm that we have received a number of telephone calls in light . of the verdicts and today's sentencing. This information will be . evaluated.' Detective Chief Inspector Clive . Driscoll, who has been the senior officer in the case for a number of . years, has said officers would be visiting Dobson and Norris in prison . to see whether they would be willing to assist the inquiry and said he . remained 'optimistic' about further progress being made in the case. Mr Justice Treacy said the murder was committed 'for no other reason than racial hatred'. Referring to the length of sentence, . he said: 'In short, the law dictates that I must sentence you by . reference to your age and maturity at the time of the crime. I cannot . sentence you as the mature men you now are. 'In addition I must sentence you in . accordance with the practice in force before the coming into force of . Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which now governs . sentencing for more modern murders ... 'It may be, therefore, that the . resultant sentences are lower than some might expect, but the law as . laid down by Parliament must be applied and I am constrained by it.' The one glimmer of hope that . modern-day justice may yet prevail even if the Attorney General decides . the sentences are not 'unduly lenient' is that Dobson and Norris were . both detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure. The judge explained: 'There is no . guarantee of release once the term is served. An offender will only be . released if, on the basis of a stringent assesment by the Parole Board . at that time, he is deemed no longer to pose a risk to the public. The group run as they are pelted with eggs after leaving the public inquiry. Luke Knight (2nd left), Neil Acourt (far left), David Norris (centre), Jamie Acourt (right, with white shirt), had to run the gauntlet of an angry crowd after they had given evidence . 'Otherwise he will remain in prison. After release, whenever that is, an offender is not free of his . sentence. He will remain subject to licence for the rest of his life and . may be recalled to prison at any time.' The trio of men long suspected of . joining Dobson and Norris in the ‘racist and thuggish’ South London . attack in April 1993 are brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight. Their names were handed to police . within days of Stephen’s murder and all five were named by the Daily . Mail as killers in 1997 and challenged to sue if the newspaper was . wrong. They never did. Neil Acourt and his girlfriend Claire Vose: He . has repeatedly been in trouble with the law. She is expecting their . first child this month . The new phase of the marathon . Lawrence investigation is expected to focus on the Acourt brothers and . Knight, who were in hiding last night after apparently fleeing their . homes. It is also likely to include a renewed attempt to identify a . possible sixth member of the gang. In an interview with the Daily Mail, . Mr Lawrence's mother Doreen - referring to the rest of the killers - told the newspaper: 'I'm hoping that, eventually, Dobson and Norris . will give up the others; that they won't take the whole guilty vote for . themselves. 'I want to get the others, but I also want a life.' Mr Lawrence's father Neville told . reporters outside court that he hoped the pair would 'give up the rest . of the people' involved. Guilty: Dobson, left, and Norris went . on trial for the murder of Stephen Lawrence six weeks ago. Both men . denied the charge . It is understood that a decision will . be made on whether to keep the men at Belmarsh prison, South-East . London, where Norris has previously been beaten up. Wherever they end up the pair are expected to be given extra protection in prison amid fears of revenge attacks. It is likely they will serve their . sentences in segregated wings alongside other 'vulnerable' prisoners . such as paedophiles who are also thought to be at risk of attack. A legal expert told Mail Online: . 'There is a general duty of care to ensure their safety; how it is . fulfilled is a matter for the prison governor. 'But Rule 45 is likely to come into play, under which they could be put in solitary confinement for their own protection.' Rule 45 (formerly Rule 43), is the . rule that allows the isolation of vulnerable prisoners in the interests . of their own personal safety. In court, Mr Justice Treacy called . forward Mr Driscoll, and said that the public inquiry into the . circumstances surrounding Mr Lawrence's death had 'shamed and humbled' the Met, but praised the hard work done in recent years. The judge went on: 'At least a . measure of justice has been achieved at last. However, the convictions . of Gary Dobson and David Norris will not, I hope, close the file on this . murder. On the evidence before the court, there are still three or four . other killers of Stephen Lawrence at large. 'Just as advances in science have . brought two people to justice, I hope the Metropolitan Police will be . alert to future lines of inquiry, not only based on developments in . science but perhaps also information from those who have been silent so . far, wherever they may be.' Earlier, he had sentenced Dobson and Norris in a packed but silent courtroom. He called the killing 'a terrible and . evil crime', and quoted the Lord Chief Justice who called it a 'murder . which scarred the conscience of the nation'. Mr Justice Treacy told the pair: 'A . totally innocent 18-year-old youth on the threshold of a promising life . was brutally cut down in the street in front of eyewitnesses by a . racist, thuggish gang. 'You were both members of that gang. I have no doubt at all that you fully subscribed to its views and attitudes.' He said the murder was committed 'for no other reason than racial hatred'. The evidence in the trial could not . prove who wielded the knife, but he said that whoever used it had done . so with Dobson and Norris' 'knowledge and approval'. Neither of them had shown ""the slightest regret or remorse"" since the murder and they had both lied to the court. When it was over, Dobson left speedily, stepping over Norris who had bent down to pick up his papers. Norris then kissed his hand and offered it up to the public gallery in a thumbs-up sign before he too was led from the court. As the judge rose to leave, a few people began clapping in the public gallery. Dobson's father, Stephen, called down to the court: 'Shame on all of you.' Jamie Acourt and his girlfriend Terri Dean, . mother of his two children: On Facebook she says she is in a 'serious . relationship' but strangely omits to mention his name .

Sean Collier, 27, died from multiple gunshot wounds in the early morning hours of Friday as he responded to a noise complaint. The motivation for that murder was at first unclear, but police now believe that the suspects shot him in order to steal his gun. CBS News reported that Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were armed with just one gun and a pellet gun, and may have been looking to broaden their arsenal. The network reported that the brothers' efforts to take Collier's gun were unsuccessful because he had a locking system in his holster. Less than an hour later, police caught up with the suspects, engaging them in a wild shootout in which Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed. His brother Dzhokhar managed to escape, but was caught on Friday evening as he hid in a boat in a Watertown backyard. The revelation came as the young police officer was laid to rest in an emotional scene at a church in Stoneham, Massachusetts.

The crowd of 12,000 who had come for the memorial service to Joe Paterno, the legendary football coach of Penn State who died on Sunday of lung cancer, gave Nike founder and chairman Phil Knight a standing ovation for defending the coach's memory. Mr Knight said at the public memorial service: ‘If there is a villain in this tragedy, it lies in that investigation, and not in Joe Paterno’s response.’ Paterno’s widow Sue and former defensive coordinator Tom Bradley were among those who stood after the defence eulogy. Mr Knight’s comment seemed to refer to Paterno’s failure to alert anyone beyond his superiors at the school when he was told of a sex abuse allegation against former assistant Jerry Sandusky, a major reason he was fired by university trustees on November 9, less than three months before his death at age 85. Defence eulogy: Nike co-founder Phil Knight hinted that Joe Paterno was a scapegoat in the child sex abuse allegations against his former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky . Standing ovation: Students and supporters applaud during Phil Knight's eulogy. Among those to rise were Paterno's widow Sue and former defensive coordinator Tom Bradley . The service - at the end of three days . of mourning on the university campus - took place in the Penn State . basketball arena and saw tribute after tribute paid to the man called . 'JoePa'. His remarkable achievements during . his 46-year career as a coach saw him rack up more wins - 409 - than any . other major-college football coach. He also led his team to two . national championships and preached 'success with honour' while . insisting his athletes focus on academics. His son Jay told the crowd how he leaned over his dying father, gave him a kiss, and whispered in his ear. 'Dad, you won,' he said. 'You did all you could do. You've done enough. We all love you. We won. You can go home now.' The service was primarily a glowing . tribute to Paterno, who died at age 85, and his accomplishments but also an opportunity to . defend his legacy against criticism that he failed to do more when told . about an alleged sexual assault on a child involving one of his former . assistants.

Though the campus and surrounding . community have been torn with anger over the Sandusky scandal and . Paterno's summary dismissal by the board of trustees two months before . his death, Jay Paterno said his father didn't hold a grudge. He said: 'Despite all that had happened to . him, he never wavered in his belief, in his dream, of Penn State.

Among the speakers were Michael . Robinson, who played for Paterno from 2002 to 2005 and flew in from . Hawaii, where he was practising for his first Pro Bowl; star quarterback . Todd Blackledge from the 1980s; and Jimmy Cefalo, a star in the 1970s. Like Robinson, Blackledge and Cefalo went on to play in the NFL.

Former NFL player Charles V Pittman, speaking for players from the 1960s, called Paterno a lifelong influence and inspiration. He said Paterno challenged his . young players, once bringing Pittman to tears in his sophomore year. He . said he realised later that the coach was moulding him into the man he . would become. 'What I now know is that Joe wasn't . trying to build perfection. That doesn't exist and he knew it. He was, . bit by bit, building a habit of excellence,' said Pittman. Paterno was fired on November 9 after he was . criticised for not going to police in 2002 when he was told that . Sandusky had been seen sexually assaulting a boy in the showers. Sandusky was arrested in November and is awaiting trial on charges that . he molested 10 boys over a 15-year span. As the scandal erupted, . Pennsylvania's state police commissioner said Paterno may have met his . legal duty but not his moral one. Penn State president Graham Spanier . was also fired in the fall-out. Nike CEO Knight, appearing about midway through the memorial, became the first speaker explicitly to address the scandal .

He won a thunderous standing ovation when he defended Paterno's handling of the 2002 allegations against former colleague Jerry Sandusky . Mourners wipe away their tears as they listen to the tributes being paid to the university's former coach . He said the coach 'gave full . disclosure to his superiors, information that went up the chains to the . head of the campus police and the president of the school. The matter . was in the hands of a world-class university, and by a president with an . outstanding national reputation'. Lanny J. Davis, an attorney for the . board, replied after the service, saying: 'All the reasons for the . board's difficult and anguished decision - made unanimously, including . former football players and everyone who still loves Coach Paterno and . his memory - reached a decision which was heartfelt. All 32. 'The facts speak for themselves' and include the grand jury testimony, he said. Chris Marrone, another former player . who eulogised Paterno, said Knight was his 'new hero' for expressing the 'pent-up frustration' of Paterno's supporters. 'I think the response that he got is indicative of how folks feel,' Marrone said. Only one member of the university . administration - the dean of the college of liberal arts - spoke at the memorial which was arranged . primarily by the Paterno family. No one . from the board of trustees made a speech. People said it felt good to remember and celebrate the good times. Tennessee Titans coach Mike Munchak, who played for Paterno, said he attended the service 'because I'm a part of his legacy'. 'It was not only about football,"" Munchak said. 'It was about life and how he affected all of us as men.' Phil Knight, former CEO and co-founder of  Nike, becomes emotional as he speaks during the service.

At 2:15pm today a tornado warning was issued at Denver International airport as a tunnel cloud swept over the eastern runways. Nine flights were diverted to other airports and thousands of passengers sheltered in bathrooms and stairwells. The warning remained for 40 minutes before normal services resumed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ominous: Onlookers reported seeing yellow and brown clouds gathering before the tornado hit . A 97 mph wind gust was measured at the airport before communication with instruments there was briefly knocked out, said National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin. Chris Polk, a construction foreman, was working on a renovation project just outside the airport's main concourse when he got the tornado warning at 2:15pm, looked up and saw a funnel cloud. He and his crew ran inside and took shelter with some 100 people, including luggage-toting passengers, inside a basement break room as tornado sirens sounded. 'It got pretty crazy around here,' Polk said. Asked whether he was nervous when he spotted the funnel cloud, he shrugged. 'No, I'm from Missouri,' he said. Everyone inside the break room was calm, Polk added. Strange beauty: These Twitter images show the center of the swirling mass of cloud as it hovered over Denver International Airport . It wasn't clear how many people were at the airport when a public announcement went out about the tornado warning, but the airport averages about 145,000 passengers over the course of a day, Coale said. Television coverage 2343709showed the airport's normally busy terminal empty during the warning. Access to a bridge to concourse A was blocked, since the bridge is surrounded by large glass windows. Scott Morlan said he had dropped his daughter off at airport and was heading out when he saw an ominous cloud. Inclement weather: Storm clouds are seen over Denver International Airport on Tuesday June 18 before the tornado struck . 'It was just turning. You knew it was thinking about coming down,' he said. He watched the tip of funnel cloud touch the ground and cross Pena Boulevard, which leads to the airport, before lifting into the sky. On Monday, a tornado touched down briefly in La Junta on Colorado's southeastern plains. Power poles were knocked down in an industrial park, but no injuries were reported, said weather service spokeswoman Nezette Rydell.

Thousands of A-level students who hoped to secure university places last year could have been given the wrong marks, a whistleblower has claimed. Senior exam board supervisor David Leitch found that 10 per cent of pupils should have received a higher grade when he checked papers where schools had queried their results. Another 10 per cent should have been given a lower grade because final scores were added up wrongly by examiners, Mr Leitch said. Cheated? Senior exam board supervisor said 10 per cent of pupils should have received a higher grade when he checked papers queried by schools . The claims are the latest in a long line of controversies relating to Britain's chaotic exams system, which have raised grave concerns about standards. Mr Leitch said that, following requests from schools in August 2011 for re-marking, he and his team spotted basic clerical errors in 100 papers. This led them to carry out extended checks on other papers marked by the same examiners and found a further 200 errors. Mr Leitch said he emailed 30 schools to alert them to the problem affecting A-Level and GCSE papers after he was dissatisfied with a review ordered by the exam watchdog Ofqual. He has been suspended by exam board OCR. Mr Leitch claimed that, when he spotted the mistakes, he was told by OCR to stop the checks. 'We were amazed, he told Channel 4 News. 'We wanted the candidates to receive the correct results and if these checks were not brought to light they wouldn't get the correct results.' 'It's so bizarre, it should be of paramount significance to all of us who work within an awarding body that we issue correct results to our candidates. 'It's the number one priority that we have. To tell people that have uncovered mistakes that you must discontinue these checks is outrageous.' OCR say their assessors checked the scripts of over 1,100 examiners and in only a few cases did this affect the overall grade that had been awarded. Whistleblower: David Leitch claims he was told to stop checking exam papers after he spotted mistakes . But that view is disputed by Mr Leitch, who claims that he has uncovered an additional 50 to 100 papers with marking errors in the last few weeks. He said: 'We checked 50,000 scripts and found 700 errors. 'I believe there would have been thousands. Not thousands of incorrect grades, but thousands of incorrect results issued.' A spokesman for OCR said: 'OCR's top priority at this time is to reassure those taking exams now that our systems have been significantly improved.' The exam board has introduced new stages into the checking of manually marked scripts, which it says 'will ensure a high level of clerical accuracy'. It said it was processing the disputed exam papers and would make grade changes, if required. The spokesman added: 'We confirm that a supervisor has been suspended pending investigation. 'To say anything more would prejudice the investigation. 'We support Ofqual's planned review of examination marking and will be glad to share any lessons learnt from last year's mistakes.' An Ofqual spokesman said: 'Mr Leitch is now making two serious allegations about last summer's exam series: that OCR did not properly do the checks that it claimed to have done, and also that it misled the regulator. 'We need to establish as a matter of urgency whether these allegations are true. 'We have written to OCR seeking an urgent explanation. 'We would ask that Mr Leitch also shares all the documents he has with us. 'We will not comment further on this case until we have seen OCR's full response. 'If we find OCR has acted improperly we will take the matter further and if appropriate use our enforcement powers.' In a statement, the Department of Education  said: 'The level of error here is simply unacceptable. 'We have been crystal clear that exam boards must produce papers that are error-free, and award the correct grades to students. Revision: OCR has changed the way it checks papers to ensure a high level of clerical accuracy' 'It is exactly these kinds of issues that have led us to strengthen Ofqual's regulatory powers and introduce a new power to allow them to fine exam boards in the future. 'We are continuing to look at whether even stronger powers are needed.' Mr Leitch's claims were revealed less than 48 hours after the head of the UK's largest exam board cast doubt over A-level and GCSE standards. Rod Bristow, president of Pearson UK, which owns Edexcel, said that boards should be ‘worried’ about the pattern of ever improving results. He stopped short of agreeing there had been grade inflation but admitted it was 'indisputable' that grades in A-levels and GCSEs had improved. Exam board officials have previously defended standards, insisting that year-on-year grade improvements were due to students’ hard work. A newspaper investigation last December revealed how seminars were giving teachers vital information about papers. It also exposed one of the chief examiners at Edexcel boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with Ofqual. Steph Warren, a senior official at Edexcel, told an undercover reporter, posing as a geography teacher considering using the firm’s GCSE exams, that ‘you don’t have to teach a lot’. Another Edexcel English official boasted about how, thanks to easy coursework, ‘weak kids’ could get through ‘on anything really’. Ofqual later announced it was banning thousands of exam seminars, which posed ‘unacceptable risks’ to the integrity of the system. Some teachers expected to receive ‘privileged information’ about exams, it claimed.","Senior exam board supervisor found that 10 per cent of pupils should have received higher grade .

The former housekeeper of the Waffle House chairman violated his privacy by secretly recording sex tapes so she could use them to accuse him of demanding sex acts from her in order to keep her job, a judge ruled. CEO of Waffle House restaurant chain Joe Rogers Jr, from Georgia, Atlanta, admitted to having an affair with his housekeeper last year but denied any wrongdoing. The judge took custody of the DVDs recorded in secret, which included a video and about 15 audio recordings, and viewed them in a closed court hearing. But he ruled last week that the housekeeper was a willing participant in the sexual encounter and was not a 'victim of sexual battery'. Scroll down for video . Mistakes: Waffle House CEO Joe Rogers Jr (left) has the support of his wife (right) and though admitted the affair said he did not do anything legally wrong . Cobb County Court Judge Robert Leonard II wrote in the order: 'The defendant's arguments that she was a victim of the crime of sexual . battery and was permitted to record plaintiff's actions to gather . evidence of a crime is extremely unpersuasive to the court. 'The video recording makes it clear . that defendant was a willing participant in the sexual encounter and is . not the victim of sexual battery.' For the first time, details of how the woman recorded the sexual encounter were revealed, ABC reports. The court document states that the . woman's attorneys met with her in a private investigator's office where . she was ordered a 'spy camera' disguised as a cellphone. The lawsuit stems from accusations made by Rogers' former employee, who cannot be identified, who says she was forced into sex. The former employee filed a police report saying Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts to keep her job. Rogers said they had a consensual sexual relationship and that the woman is attempting extortion . The 43-year-old woman told Atlanta . police last September that Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts in . exchange for keeping her job and that he also tried to force her to have . sex with him despite her repeated protests. Accusations: Rogers' housekeeper, who cannot be identified, worked for the businessman for almost a decade before handing in her notice in June . She said that he touched . her breasts, tried to remove her clothes, made lewd comments, appeared . naked before her and insisted she perform sex acts on him at least once . or twice a month. She said this occurred for nearly a decade, from 2003 through June of this year until she handed in her resignation. Rogers identified the woman as his former housekeeper, and said she is not telling the truth. He released a statement at the time saying: 'Over an . almost eight-year period when I was separated, single and re-married, I . had a series of infrequent, consensual sexual encounters with my . housekeeper.' He said the woman worked for 15 hours . a week from 2003 until she was let go in 2008. He said she later was . rehired as his house manager and quit her job in June. 'Shortly . thereafter, on July 16, 2012, I received a letter from her attorney . containing false allegations and strong threats,' Rogers said. 'According to her attorneys, she now wants millions of dollars from me.' Rogers said he shared the letter from . the woman's attorney with his wife and they hired lawyers to look into . the situation. Rogers and the woman sued each other, but documents in . those cases were sealed. Rogers' attorney, Robert Ingram, said a Cobb County judge lifted a gag order in . Rogers' lawsuit Tuesday 'so Joe could get his version of the story . out'. Claims: The 43-year-old housekeeper told Atlanta police last month that the Waffle House CEO demanded she perform sexual acts in exchange for keeping her job . 'They were tapes that [she] recorded, which is a crime in the state of Georgia to record somebody when that person had an expectation of privacy and doesn't consent to the recording,' Ingram said. David Cohen, the woman's attorney, said: 'We understand he's obviously trying to spin his wrongful actions in some positive light. 'We believe attempting to attack the victim will only make matters worse and that the parties just need to let a jury decide the issues. Our position and facts as they have evolved thus far are stated in our verified counterclaim filed in the courthouse, which is part of the record unsealed by the court today.' In the police report, the woman identified herself as a single mother. She said she stayed in the job and submitted to Rogers because she couldn't find other employment with comparable pay. She said she gave Rogers a letter of resignation in June after her son secured a full college scholarship. Rogers said he was wrong to have sex with the woman during a period when he was separated and later remarried. 'That was wrong of me and I am very sorry for the pain and embarrassment I've caused my wife and family. There is no excuse for what I have done,' he said. He added, 'As personally embarrassing as this situation is for me, I am committed to the legal and law enforcement process to expose the motives of my former housekeeper and her attorneys.' Rogers' opened his first waffle house in Atlanta in 1955, growing the company into a major chain of 1,500 restaurants throughout the South.","Joe Rogers Jr says he was a 'dumb***' over affair with housekeeper but denies assault charges .

Apple may have confirmed much of the speculation surrounding its upcoming products its recent annual developer conference, but that hasn't stopped the rumour mill from turning. The latest claims are that the California-based company is set to launch a low-cost version of its iPhone 5 handset as early as September. Dubbed the iPhone Mini, the new handset could be made of plastic to keep costs down and may be sold in a range of colours including white, black, pink and blue. Accessory manufacturer Tactus published a picture of a cheap, plastic iPhone model earlier this year. The design is rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and 5MP camera and could cost as little as £63 ($99). Industry analyst Brian White fueled these rumours further when he made reference to a cheap iPhone Mini during a note to investors. The low-cost handset is expected to come in a range of colours and go on sale in September . Rumours fueled by an investor note, writeen by industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets claims Apple is working on a low-cost handset. Dubbed 'iPhone Mini' the new handset could come in a range of colours, be made of plastic, have a 3.5inch screen and a 5MP camera. Prices being quoted range from £63 ($99) to £260 ($400). Apple is also believed to working on large-screen device for its iPhone 6 model. The iPhone 6 could have a 4.7inch screen. There may also be a 5.7inch screen iPhone model due next year. These current rumours originated in a note to investors written by industry analyst Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets. According to CNET, White cited research suggesting that the iPhone Mini would come in five colours, be made of plastic and could cost as little as £63 ($99). Other prices put it much higher at £260 ($400). The current iPhone 5 is made of glass and anodised aluminium - the same material that is used to make Apple laptops. This design makes it feel sturdy but pushes the price of construction up. The iPhone Mini could follow Samsung's lead and have a glass front with a plastic case. Apple traditionally unveils new handsets at an annual event in September and White believes this year's event will be dominated by the rumoured iPhone 5S. White claims that the iPhone Mini could be announced before this event so not to distract from the 5S launch, but Apple will likely show off both handsets together. The Telegraph also reported that accessory manufacturer Tactus had published a picture of a cheap, plastic iPhone model, rumoured to have a 3.5inch screen and 5MP camera. This mock-up shows what Apple's larger iPhone 6 handset could look like. It was designed by French technology site NowhereElse. The iPhone 6 is due to be released in 2014 and is expected to have a 4.7inch screen. Rumours claim that Apple could also be working on a 5.7inch 'phablet-style' handset . Mr White added the iPhone Mini might 'have a curved back casing made of coloured plastic and will be thicker than the iPhone 5.' Other rumours to have generated from White's note include that the iPhone 6 - expected in 2014 - will have a much larger screen than the current 4inch iPhone 5 model. Apple could launch a 4.7inch model - which would put it in close competition with Samsung's 4.8inch Galaxy SIII - as well as a 5.7inch 'phablet-style' device. These rumours are said to have come from sources within the phone maker's supply chain in Asia. According to Reuters, these suppliers have been approached with plans for the larger screens, but noted it is still unclear whether Apple will actually launch its flagship product in the larger sizes. 'They constantly change product specifications almost to the final moment, so you're not really sure whether this is the final prototype,' said one person said to have 'direct knowledge of the matter.' Speaking at last month's AllThingsD industry conference on why Apple hasn't launched different sized iPhones, CEO Tim Cook, pictured, said: 'We haven't so far. That doesn't shut off the future.' Cook noted a larger screen comes with trade-offs on features such as battery life, resolution and brightness . Apple's possible shift to offer what is often referred to as 'phablets' - chunkier smartphones not quite big enough to qualify as tablets - comes as the long-time consumer and investor faces pressure to deliver more than one new handset model a year. Critics say its pace of innovation has slowed since the death of legendary co-founder Steve Jobs - a reference Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, made during the keynote speech at Apple's developer conference in San Francisco this week when he said: 'Can't innovate any more, my ass.' The iPhone 5, launched last September, was the first model to veer away from the Apple phone's 3.5-inch screen, which Jobs famously deemed 'the perfect size for consumers' and had been used in every iPhone since the iconic device was unveiled in 2007. The current iPhone 5 has one of the smaller screens among the best-selling smartphones in the mobile market. Samsung's Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 2 have 5-inch and 5.5-inch screens, respectively. Apple launched its 4inch iPhone 5 handset at an annual event in San Francisco, in September last year. It is made of aluminium and glass, which makes it feel sturdy, but this pushes up production costs. The cheaper iPhone Mini is expected to have the plastic casing as seen on Samsung Galaxy models . For this year, Apple is expected to launch two new models, widely referred to as the iPhone 5S, with new fingerprint technology, and the cheaper version in plastic casing. Apple plans to dress up the cheaper phone in a range of five or six colours to differentiate it from the more expensive model that has traditionally come only in black and white. Analysts say the company needs a cheaper gadget to push on in growth markets in China and India, and to counter Samsung's edge in having phones priced up and down the spectrum. China, the world's biggest smartphone market, is set to grow 48 percent this year, outpacing the global increase of 31 percent, according to industry forecasts. While Apple only offers a single phone model across all markets, it has successfully marketed the iPod music player and its iPad in different sizes and at varying prices. If the new iPhone Mini launches as expected, it will more than likely run Apple's latest mobile software - iOS 7. This software was unveiled this week at Apple's developer conference and will be available as a free upgrade in the Autumn . Asked at last month's AllThingsD industry conference why Apple hasn't launched different sized iPhones, CEO Tim Cook said: 'We haven't so far. That doesn't shut off the future.' He explained that the range of iPods serve different audiences and needs. 'On the phone, that's the question. Are we now at a point to serve enough people that we need to do that?' Cook noted a larger screen comes with trade-offs on features such as battery life, resolution and brightness. Test production for both the standard and cheaper iPhone models aims to start next month, with mass production ramping up in August to meet a September launch target, two people said. 'Trial production was originally planned to start in June, but the mixing of colours is taking longer than expected as Apple has very high and idealistic standards,' said one source in Asia, adding 20 million plastic iPhones are expected to ship in the October-December quarter. Japan's Sharp Corp and Japan Display and South Korea's LG Display will supply the panels for the aluminium iPhone 5S and the plastic iPhone, while Hon Hai Precision Industry is said to be assembling the higher-end phone and Pegatron will put together the cheaper model. The new iOS 7 software will be available as a free upgrade in the Autumn is the first software to be designed by London-born Sir Jonathan Ive following an alleged power struggle with previous design chief Scott Fortsall.

Where we live - specifically, how high up we live - may have a far bigger impact on how languages are formed than previously thought. Languages containing 'ejective' consonants - guttural bursts of sound not found in English - mainly exist among communities at high altitudes. Lead scientist Dr Caleb Everett from the University of Miami believes that the reason might be that it takes less effort to produce ejectives in thinner mountain air. Scroll down for video . On this partial world map, dark circles represent the areas where languages where ejectives occur. Clear circles represent areas where the ejective isn't part of the language. Scientists found a correlation between ejective languages and high altitude. Until recently most linguists believed environment mainly had an influence on vocabulary rather than sound. Researchers in the US found that 87 per cent of the languages with ejectives studied were located within 500 kilometres of a region of high elevation on all continents. More...

As the height of the land increased, so did the likelihood of there being languages with ejectives. 'This is really strong evidence that geography does influence phonology - the sound system of languages,' said lead scientist Dr Caleb Everett, from the University of Miami. An area of high elevation is defined as having an altitude higher than 1,500 metres above sea level. Inhabitants of Peru, like this family on Lake Titcaca, have a ejective-heavy language .

The results showed a strong correlation between elevation and ejective languages on, or near, five of the six major inhabited high altitude regions on Earth. 'Ejectives are produced by creating a pocket of air in the pharynx then compressing it,' said Dr Everett. 'Since air pressure decreases with altitude and it takes less effort to compress less dense air, I speculate that it's easier to produce these sounds at high altitude.' The only high altitude region where ejective languages were absent was the large Tibetan plateau and adjacent areas. This could be because people living in this region are uniquely adapted to high altitude conditions, the scientists believe. Studies have shown that Tibetan people breath at a faster rate than other high altitude populations, which reduces the effects of reduced oxygen.","Scientists found that languages with 'ejectives' - guttural bursts of sound not found in English - exist only at high altitudes .
Sound is produced at high elevations where air pressure is less dense .
One reason might be that it takes less effort to produce ejectives in thinner mountain air ."

Excited members of an expedition in Michigan believe they may have found the underwater grave of the Griffin, the first European ship to traverse the upper Great Lakes before disappearing mysteriously 334 years ago. Divers this weekend opened a pit at the base of a wooden beam that juts nearly 11 feet from the bottom of Lake Michigan, believing it could be a section of the vessel, the rest presumably entombed in mud. They picked up the pace Monday with more powerful equipment after a weekend of probing showed that whatever is buried is deeper than sonar readings indicated. U.S. and French experts insist it is too early to say whether there's a shipwreck - let alone the Griffin. But anticipation is building at the prospect of solving a maritime puzzle that's more than three centuries old. Scroll down for video . Expedition: French underwater archaeologist Olivia Hulot jots notes while inspecting a timber jutting from the bottom of northern Lake Michigan that experts believe could be part of the long-lost ship the Griffin . Lost: The disappearance of the Griffin (or 'le Griffin') in 1679 when it traversed the upper Great lakes has been one of the great maritime mysteries . Built on orders of legendary French explorer Rene Robert Cavelier de la Salle, the ship ventured from Niagara Falls to Lake Michigan's Green Bay but disappeared during its return in 1679. 'After we get done for the day, everybody calls or comes to the house and they're like, ""What did you find? What did you see? Can you tell me anything?""' said local commercial fisherman Larry Barbeau in an interview Sunday aboard his ship, the Viking, which holds crucial expedition equipment, including 'umbilical' cables that supply oxygen to divers. 'People are really interested and they're excited to see what it is.' His neighbors aren't the only curious ones. The roughly 40-member expedition team consists of archaeologists, historians, boat pilots, divers, an underwater salvage crew and assorted helpers. When not on the water, they stay in cottages and tents by the lake in the unincorporated village of Fairport, in one of the most remote corners of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Some are relatives or longtime friends of mission chief Steve Libert, who has sought the ship for three decades. While researching the Griffin long ago, Libert ran across Mike Behrens, a Milwaukee sheet-metal worker whose grandfather had searched the lake for chests of gold that legend says smugglers lost during the Civil War. 'I came up here one year to witness what Steve was doing, and I asked if I could dive with him,' said Behrens, 54. 'Been doing it ever since. ... I've never met anyone as good at research as him, and he's a very ethical guy. If he says it's the Griffin, I absolutely believe him.' Others have come aboard more recently, including three archaeologists from France who arrived over the weekend. Explorer: The Griffin was built on orders of legendary French explorer Rene Robert Cavelier de la Salle, who was not on board when the ship disappeared . Wreck: Crews are digging a pit at the base of a beam in Lake Michigan to see if it's attached to a buried ship . The hands-on excavation work is being handled by a three-man crew from Great Lakes Diving and Salvage, a Michigan company that ordinarily deals with mundane tasks: repairing pumps or scraping zebra mussels off intake pipes. 'We're basically underwater janitors,' said Tom Gouin, vice president of operations. The Griffin, he said, is 'like a play job for us. We're loving it.' The team has had to adjust its strategy, as the excavation is proving to be a bigger-than-expected challenge. Sonar scans in years past had suggested that an object similar to the Griffin's reputed size rested about 2 feet beneath the lake floor. But commercial divers on Friday found the bottom caked with a thick layer of invasive, fingernail-size quagga mussel shells. After tunneling through mussels, the divers began sucking away gravel and sediments, never hitting anything solid. By Sunday night, the hole reached about 8 feet below the lake bed and it wasn't clear how far down the wooden beam extended or what it might be attached to, said Ken Vrana, the project manager. But as more is exposed, the post . appears increasingly likely to be part of a ship, said Michel L'Hour, . director of France's Department of Underwater Archaeological Research. 'We . never saw a timber standing like this one,' he said. 'So it's . impossible to imagine it otherwise, so one can expect that there is a . hull.' Play: Excited actors who in 1976 re-enacted la Salle's journey across the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River, reunited in Fairport, Mich., near the Griffin's potential shipwreck . Archaeologists Rob Reedy, of Morehead City, N.C., and Misty Jackson, of Leslie, Mich., sit on the Viking and sift through material that was found in the sediment, watching for artifacts, from bronze cannons to axes or knives - 'anything man-made' that would help identify a ship, Reedy said. Thus far, the only candidate has been a slab of blackened wood about 15 inches long with characteristics suggesting it might have been fashioned by human hands. Its origin remains unknown. Visitors inspired by the long-lost ship have drifted into the area during the search, including a 9-year-old who wrote a school paper about the Griffin and men in period costumes and handmade canoes who in 1976 re-enacted la Salle's journey across the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River. Carl Behrend, a folk singer and self-described 'pretty-soon major movie star' who lives 90 minutes north on Lake Superior, performed an impromptu concert outside the food tent Sunday night. He said he's composing a song about the Griffin. 'It's rattling around in my head,' he said.","Divers are exploring the area around a wooden beam at the lake's bottom .

The fashion world tripped over its platform shoes this week at the news that Mulberry's creative director Emma Hill had abandoned ship. Apparently, the one-woman whirlwind from Surrey had major 'disagreements' with the company's new CEO, Frenchman Bruno Guillon. Mulberry's share price dipped 8 per cent at the terse announcement. Given that Hill is the transformative designer who turned Mulberry into a fashion player and a magnet for celebrities from Emma Watson to the Duchess of Cambridge, it was rather like watching the leading lady storm off in the first act. Indeed, Mulberry has had more blood on its floor than a Jacobean drama. Only last week Hill picked up a Glamour Award for Best Accessories Designer. Vogue's May issue profiled her as 'one of the most successful names in British fashion,' and called her a 'visionary'. Last summer she became a CBE. Even Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, who designed the royal wedding dress, was only made an MBE. Hill was Mulberry, Mulberry was Hill. Together, they had become a British institution. Who would have thought that they could have ever been parted? But it seems selling lots of handbags in Britain isn't enough any more. Mulberry has had some hits and seen an underlying rise in its rollercoaster share price, but is altogether a much patchier story than that of its home-grown rival Burberry, which has spread its trademark check over the lucrative Chinese market, and everywhere else. Much to the chagrin of Mulberry's elusive Singaporean owner, Christina Ong, who wrestled the company from founder Roger Saul in a nasty boardroom coup ten years ago, it doesn't seem to have the global clout she desired. There was a time, of course, when it seemed Mulberry could do no wrong. Take the strappy Alexa bag, named after Alexa Chung and based on a man's satchel. Emma Hill called the Alexa 'the anti-It bag that became an It bag', so popular that it once had a waiting list that ran into thousands and accounted for a staggering third of Mulberry's sales. Combined with the classic Bayswater, by 2011 Mulberry was the fastest growing luxury brand on the planet; sales in its 86 stores soared. Then came the schism. Last year, Christina Ong hired a French luxury goods executive to take Mulberry from fashionable British bag maker to high-end international brand. And so Mulberry poached Bruno Guillon from Hermes, the snootiest of all the French luxury brands. To Hermes, Vuitton are mere parvenus, Dior attention-seekers. As you might imagine, French luxury goods executives are not noted for their sense of humour. So heaven knows what Monsieur Guillon made of Mulberry using giant gnomes as show props and poodles on the catwalk - or, more to the point, what he thought of the exuberant Ms Hill. UK success: Hill with her CBE . Cue 'a culture clash of titanic proportions', as one British magazine editor described it to me. Hill, who joined Mulberry in 2008 and had worked at Marc Jacobs and Gap, grew the brand by courting cool young things and promoting the brand at festivals. As well as Alexa Chung, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Kristen Stewart, Kate Hudson, Florence Welch and Kirsten Dunst were all photographed at the brand's parties, pouting and sporting their Mulberry bags. Hill saw Mulberry as 'iconic and irreverent, warm and fuzzy'. The label was known for parties: its London Fashion Week show at Claridge's had edgy young things spinning the decks. But occasionally their exuberance misfired. As Vogue later recounted, the company's 40th birthday party in New York was such mayhem that the fashion press couldn't get in and the police shut it down. It was youthful, jolly and a little wild. When Guillon arrived, he was confronted with Hill and her 'Mulbs', as her colleagues were known. 'Luxury with a laugh' did not appeal to the man from Hermes. He didn't appear to be in on the joke - or the business model Hill had created. For Guillon didn't want Mulberry to be thought of as the bag that middle-income Brits would buy as a present to themselves. He wanted a new, expensive tier to attract a new, more expensive customer. And he didn't want a celebrity-studded front row at their shows at all, fearing that the presence of Chung - let alone a Geldof girl - might alienate as many customers as it brought in. He has a point. Celebrities can kill brands as quickly as they boost them. Just ask Burberry, which took years to recover from exposure by its low-rent celeb fans. Berry good: Princess Beatrice (here clutching a Mulberry bag) has helped to make the brand a British institution . Guillon told Vogue that 60 per cent of Mulberry's business was in Britain. As 'the UK is only 4 per cent of the luxury market worldwide', he believed that this left the brand vulnerable. 'Sometimes in your own market you can do things you can't do internationally. Here they love you, you are iconic, but in Paris you are  just one of many brands.' An Italian fashion editor told me that while the British all know Mulberry, it has barely any profile in France or Italy. 'Italian women don't crave Mulberry bags.' Intense, quirky Britishness could make the label seem provincial abroad. And coming from extremely expensive, deliberately exclusive Hermes, where the product - not the designer, let alone the customer - is the star, Guillon was unlikely to embrace Mulberry's ambassadors pottering round Glastonbury. Guillon wanted Mulberry to compete with Dior, Prada and Vuitton. Put simply, he and Ong wanted to make more money. So the prices went up. But bags that were a hit at under £700 - silly money, of course, but a price many British women would save up for - stopped selling when they went over £1,000. A series of profit warnings followed. As one fashion editor said: 'Funnily enough, women who buy Mulberry don't want to be thought of as women who spend crazy amounts on bags. So even those who could afford them were put off by the snootier pricing.' The City has taken a dim view of Hill's departure. The response of Luca Solca, managing director of luxury at investment company Exane BNP Paribas, is typical: 'Mulberry is trying to reposition itself to the high end . . . Mulberry in my view should be cheaper than Burberry and Gucci. 'There is little choice for handbags between £250 and £600. Market results indicate that Mulberry's upmarket ambitions are facing hurdles.' In other words, Mulberry's price inflation is greed rather than good sense. No one thinks of it in the Prada or Hermes league - its appeal is something else altogether - and many think it unlikely that it ever will. Mulberry's results today are forecast to see it report a 28 per cent drop in profits. And the share price that once reached £25 now stands at £9.40. 'Warm and fuzzy' are no longer the buzzwords at Mulberry. Let's hope a Parisian snob hasn't killed off the bags of fun.","Mulberry's creative director Emma Hill has resigned .

Mark Vevers has been jailed for luring a female loan company worker to his home and robbing her at gunpoint . A one-legged thug who robbed a woman after pulling a gun from under his wheelchair has been jailed. Amputee Mark Vevers, 50, who has tattoos across his face and head, lured a debt collector to his house where he held her at gunpoint. He told the woman, who has not been named, to wait in his bathroom where she feared she would be killed and evidence washed away. Vevers stole her bank card and demanded her pin number before going to a nearby cash point and withdrawing £300 from her account. Northampton Crown Court heard Vevers also took £485 in cash from the woman, who had previously visited his home to collect repayments for online firm 'LoansAtHome4U'. He had been repaying a £300 loan to the company at £20 per week, and invited his victim there on the pretence that a friend who wanted to borrow some money was coming round. The court heard Vevers' victim begged ‘200 times’ to be released from her hour-and-a-half gunpoint ordeal. Once he finally let her go, Vevers was arrested by armed police at a friend's house shortly after the incident on January 25 this year. The gun turned out to be an airgun, which Vevers told officers he kept for shooting rats. He told them he had needed the money from the woman so he could pay off a drugs debt. Judge Richard Bray sentenced Vevers to six and a half years in prison after he pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, possessing a firearm, robbery and theft. Passing sentence, he said: ‘You lured the victim into your home, when she was there you produced a gun, you threatened to kill her with it, you demanded that she go into you bathroom. ‘The victim must have been absolutely terrified and in fear of immediate death. Mark Vevers's victim believed this imitation firearm was a real gun and pleaded to be let go 200 times while being held for 90 minutes . ‘You were quite prepared to use this woman as a pawn in dealing with your own financial problems.’ The judge refused to sentence Vevers at an earlier hearing and ordered psychiatric reports to be prepared. He quipped: ‘This is so bizarre and so absurd there could be some kind of mental illness. ‘He was bound to get caught, the phrase 'nowhere to run' is particularly poignant in this case.’ Vevers, from Northampton, has a number of previous convictions, including attacking an ex-girlfriend with a Stanley knife. Detective Constable Cathy O'Connor said after the case: ‘I am delighted with the sentence that has been handed down. ‘Although the gun was an imitation firearm, the victim did not know this and she believed that Vevers would kill her during the course of this crime. ‘I would like to thank the victim for her bravery in assisting with the investigation.’","Mark Vevers, 50, set up bogus appointment to lure loan worker to his home .

I was barely 12 when my daydreams began to sharpen into a single focused ambition – and I certainly wouldn’t need to know quadratic equations to achieve it. It was the end of the Sixties and everywhere you looked you saw a model called Twiggy. From the moment I saw that girl with Bambi eyes in Jackie magazine, I knew I wanted to be her. Hey, Jo, I thought, you could do this, too! When my class was asked to write an essay on ‘My Future Career’,  I wrote about how I was going to be a top model and live in Knightsbridge. There was only one small thing standing between me and model superstardom: I’d been an angelic-looking little girl, but almost overnight I’d become a big-toothed, geeky-haired, skinny-legged kid. The next day in class I found a group of girls reading my essay aloud in fits of laughter. I was determined to prove them wrong, and the idea of becoming  a model occupied my every waking hour. It wasn’t the money or fame that appealed: I just wanted to wear fabulous clothes and be in beautiful pictures. So, in the summer of my 14th year, my parents sent me to the London Academy of Modelling  on Old Bond Street. The tutors were former models who taught us  etiquette, make-up skills and how to walk with stacks of books on our heads. In those days it was all about deportment and nothing like the slouchy strut of today’s models. My blossoming looks and confidence fortunately coincided with the realisation that boys were rather interesting. As well as the school builders, my friend Dympna and I had an ongoing flirtation with a cute lad called Andrew. That ended abruptly after he showed us his willy. I was totally cool because I had two brothers, but for the rest of the day I’d catch Dympna shuddering: ‘Oh, it was horrible . . . horrible.’ Then there was the vicar’s son, Michael. The vicarage overlooked our house and whenever he saw me come into my bedroom he’d hold up a sign saying, ‘I LOVE YOU JO.’ I would smile and wave, just to be polite, but then one day I saw him at the window with a telescope trained on my room. . . I was 15 when, with trembling hands, I flicked through the Daily Mirror and found what I was looking for: a photo of a young girl wearing a simple white dress and holding a daisy, her blonde hair falling about her shoulders, captioned: ‘Jo Karslake, from Benfleet in Essex’. My dream had come true. I was a model. My big break had come courtesy of an amateur photographer called Robert Hallmann, who had heard about my modelling ambition. Not long after, a letter arrived addressed to ‘Jo Karslake, Benfleet, Essex’. Dad was instantly suspicious and whipped it away, but Mum told me later it was from a bloke saying he wanted to take me into the hop fields and ‘show you what real life is about’. As you can imagine, Dad freaked. So I changed my name to Jo Howard, after Dad’s middle name. He was a bit happier then. I was next whisked off to a posh dentist to fix the gap between my two front teeth (a gap that, ironically, is the height of fashion these days) and I was soon armed with my new model card, featuring Richard’s shots and the following blurb: ‘Jo Howard. Height 5’ 6, bust 33, waist 23, hips 35, inside leg 31, outside 40. Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue.’ Big dreams: Jo Wood with siblings Vinnie, Lize and Paul aged 14, at the height of her Twiggy obsession, and determined to become a model . I started working for all the teen magazines, especially Jackie, for the fun, playful shoots: roller- skating, jumping off walls – that sort of thing. I did a job with three other models for a German magazine in which we had to have a food fight. At the studio there was a table covered with cream cakes, buns and jellies. The other girls were a bit timid, but I really got stuck in. My life became a dizzying succession of pinch-me moments. I was sent to Paris for the pret-a-porter shows and remember setting off with dreams of the Chanel catwalk, but the reality turned out to be altogether less glamorous. I stayed in a grotty little flat that reeked of drains and didn’t get a single job. Things looked up when one of the other models promised me a fabulous night out, but when I arrived at the restaurant, I found her sitting with two much older men, all sweaty palms and leering eyes. Even at 16, it didn’t take me long to work out that I’d been invited as dessert. After one clammy grope too many, I made my excuses and fled. But things soon picked up professionally: it was as if someone had stamped on the accelerator. I embarked on some crazy years as a single girl about town, meeting pretty much everyone in London including, of course, my future husband Ronnie Wood. It was the start of an extra-ordinary 30-year adventure. Last days: Jo and Ronnie at daughter Leah's wedding in 2008 shortly before they split . After Ronnie left in 2008, I couldn’t face leaving the house. I would wander from room to room, looking at all the mementoes of our life together. I felt utterly lost. For most of my adult life I had been defined by my relationship with Ronnie and The Rolling Stones. I had been part of them and protected by them. Now, not only was I losing my husband, I was losing my identity. It is only with hindsight, that I realise there was nothing to be afraid of outside the golden prison. I am now in control of my life. I get respect for my own achievements. I’m not going to lie – I do miss being absolutely spoilt. That is wonderful! But if you’re constantly treated like a cossetted child, you can sometimes start to behave like one. In that respect, stepping outside The Rolling Stones was a huge growing-up process for me – and I have now grown into  the person I was meant to be all along. And while I might not fly first-class every time,  I’ll take freedom and independence over a bit of extra leg-room any day. © Jo Wood 2013.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:03 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:22 EST, 24 October 2012 . The taxpayer is paying child benefit . to 40,000 children who do not live in Britain at a cost of up to . £36million a year, MailOnline can reveal. The . astonishing bill run up by almost 24,000 families emerged as George . Osborne presses ahead with a scheme to cut child benefit for higher . earners in the UK. The . reforms are expected to save £1.5billion a year, but Tory MPs are . demanding the Chancellor end the payment to families overseas or risk an . angry backlash from voters. George Osborne's plan to cut child benefit for higher rate taxpayers was already in trouble before today's revelation that millions are being paid to families who do not live in the UK . Under EU rules, the benefit has to be . paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying . National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad. According to figures unveiled in . Parliament yesterday, there were 23,855 families claiming for 40,251 . children at the end of  last month. Two-thirds of the children (25,623) are based in Poland. Payments were also made for 2,529 children in . Ireland, 2,146 in France, 1,953 in Slovenia and 1,291 in Spain. Child . benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for . every other child, regardless of parental income. But from January, parents who earn . £50,000 or more will see their benefit cut. Any family where one parent . earns more than £60,000 will lose child benefit all together. Yet households where two parents are . working and earn just under £50,000 each will keep their child benefits – . even though their combined income will be higher. The reforms have triggered fury from . Tory backbenchers who say they penalise families with stay-at-home . parents. Cutting benefits for middle-class earners is expected to save . £1.5billion a year. The Treasury has refused to say how . much international child benefits totalled, but Tory MP Priti Patel, who . uncovered the figures through parliamentary questions, estimated it was . £36.6million. Mrs Patel said: ‘Hard-pressed . taxpayers will be appalled to see their pockets being pillaged to pay . out millions of pounds in child benefit payments for children living in . other parts of Europe. ‘This is deeply unfair and . demonstrates yet again that some European immigrants are using crazy EU . laws to get away with abusing our benefits system. ‘The Government must get these loopholes closed to protect hard-pressed families.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The . payments can only be made while the parents are working in the UK and . paying UK national insurance. 'Less than 0.5 per cent of child benefits . payments are of this kind.’ Families were due to receive letters . setting out the changes to higher earners, but HM Revenue and Customs . could not find a simple way to explain them, so the letters have not . been sent. Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s shadow . Treasury minister, said: ‘With just a few weeks until hundreds of . thousands of parents lose every penny of their child benefit, it’s . becoming ever clearer that David Cameron and George Osborne simply . haven’t thought this policy through. ‘And the chaotic way it is being implemented looks set to be yet another example of this Government’s incompetence.’ A HMRC spokesman said: ‘It is wrong . to suggest we are behind with letting people know about the child . benefit changes. Our plans are firmly on course to contact affected . taxpayers from next week. ‘The letters set out the options clearly so that an informed choice can be made in time for the January 7 rule change.’ Tory MP Priti Patel said the payment of child benefit to families overseas was 'deeply unfair' The proportion of people deemed too sick or disabled to work has almost trebled after changes to controversial Government tests. Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions yesterday reveal that 26 per cent of those tested for eligibility for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) in the first quarter of this year were considered to be too sick to work again. When the testing process was introduced at the end of 2008, just 9 per cent were signed off as long-term sick. The testing process has been hugely controversial with disability campaigners, who claim it is biased against the sick. The DWP has changed the tests after losing thousands of appeals. The latest figures will be seen as vindication for those campaigning for reform of the tests. But they will also raise doubts about the Government’s ability to curb the huge bill for out-of-work benefits. Of the 191,000 people who applied for ESA, 65,000 abandoned their claims before being tested and 44,000 are being assessed. Some 44,000 were deemed fit to work, with 21,000 signed off as long-term sick, and 17,000 offered training to help get back to work.","Millions of pounds sent to families who do not live in Britain .

Millions of savers have been left thousands of pounds out of pocket thanks to rock-bottom interest rates and the rising cost of living, experts have warned. If you put £10,000 in the bank five years ago and received average interest and paid basic rate tax, it would today be worth just £8,852 in real terms, according to financial information firm Moneyfacts. The research was published as the Office for National Statistics revealed that the rate of inflation rose to 2.7 per cent in May, up from 2.4 per cent in April. In contrast, workers are receiving average pay awards of just 0.9 per cent. Misery: The record rise in air fares from April to May will add to the squeeze on family incomes . Fares: Air travel costs rose by 22%, much higher than other big risers like fruit, newspapers and utility bills . The staggering rises in flight costs drove half of the increase in the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation, the Office for National Statistics said. Stubbornly high inflation was worse than City expectations for a 2.6 per cent rise in prices, and is expected to peak around 3 per cent over the next few months to ensure a summer of pain for households. Air fares rose by 22 per cent month-on-month this year - the highest increase for this time of year - compared with a much more modest rise of 1.4 per cent in the same period in 2012, the ONS added. Prices rose across European, long-haul and domestic flights, the ONS said, adding that higher air fares were not necessarily linked to the early timing of the Easter holidays. Overall transport prices rose by 0.4 per cent between April and May, the ONS said. The price of clothing and footwear also rose 1.2 per cent month on month to tighten the squeeze on households, as the cost of women's outdoor clothing increased during a colder-than-normal month. But food and drink prices helped hold back inflation, with price falls for meat, vegetables, fruit, sugar, sweets and jams. Inflation is expected to surge even higher above the Bank of England's 2 per cent target in the coming months as higher gas, electricity and water bills, plus rising tuition fees, send it to a summer peak. Rises: Record increases in travel costs helped drive the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation ton 2.7 per cent, higher than expected and raising fears it will hit 3 per cent this summer . The figures come ahead of minutes due . this week from the Bank's June interest rates meeting - outgoing . governor Sir Mervyn King's last meeting - which will reveal the level of . support for more economic stimulus. The . Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to hold its quantitative easing . (QE) programme steady at £375 billion this month, also holding rates at . 0.5 per cent, amid signs of improvement in the economy. The Bank is expected to hold off more QE until the arrival of new governor Mark Carney next month. Today's . figures also showed Retail Prices Index inflation, which includes . housing costs, rose to 3.1 per cent in May, from 2.9 per cent in April. Ratings agency Moody's said: ‘Ongoing price pressures combined with austerity will squeeze household finances through 2013.’ Costs: Incomes have been squeezed because price have risen more sharply than wages for months . Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, said that while higher than expected, inflation's peak is ‘hopefully not too far away now’. She said: ‘Inflation will probably get above 3 per cent in the next month or two - meaning that one of Mr Carney's first jobs will be to write an explanatory letter to the Chancellor.’ The Treasury said inflation is down by almost a half from its peak of 5.2 per cent in 2011. A spokeswoman said: ‘To help families with the cost of living, the Government has increased the tax-free personal allowance to £10,000, which will take 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether and save a typical taxpayer over £700. ‘(It has) frozen fuel duty which has kept petrol prices 13p per litre lower than they would otherwise have been.’ But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said Britain is set for a ‘joyless’ recovery. She said: ‘Britain's great wage squeeze shows no sign of abating. ‘Forty consecutive months of real wage falls means people have less to spend on the high street, and are why economic green shoots are not being felt across the country.’","Consumer Prices Index rises to 2.7%, up from 2.4% in a month .

Leftover roast dinners and the unwanted remains of Chinese takeaways are the items most commonly scraped into the bin. Parents who over-estimate family meal . quantities and fussy children who turn their nose up at dinner time also . contribute to the high figure. Food waste: The typical family throws out 6.5kg of food waste each week - or a third of a ton a year, a new survey has found . The average home throws out 745lbs or 338kgs of leftover meals each year - or 6.5kg each week. Six in ten families regularly fail to finish everything on their plates, so end up scraping the left-overs into the food bin, the survey of 2,000 households found. Pasta bake, curry and rice, fish and chips and spaghetti bolognaise were among the most thrown out meals. A spokesman for food waste disposal firm InSinkErator, which commissioned the research, said: 'Throwing away the odd bit of food from each meal might not seem like a lot, but when you add that up over a week or year, it's a staggering amount. 'Not only is it horrible to see how . much food gets wasted, but if you think of how much you spend buying . that food in the first place, it can be quite unsettling. 'But . it's interesting to see that Chinese takeaway is one of the main meals . we throw away. Many people order too much and end up struggling to eat . it all. 'If you or members of your family find it difficult to clear their plate and your food waste bin is bulging, cooking less will not only mean you end up saving yourself money but you won't have to deal with messy job of throwing the food waste away.' Out of all the food we throw away, almost one fifth is made up of leftovers and cooked meals that have gone uneaten - the equivalent of around three full plates each week. Sixty per cent of Brits admitted they do not always eat everything that is put in front of them. Separately, 70 per cent said they usually have to scrape uneaten food off their children's plates as well. Discarded: Roast dinners and Chinese takeaways are the most frequently thrown out meals . Almost one in three said they leave food because they have simply put too much on their plate while another 19 per cent don't like the taste of what is put in front of them. And when it comes to children, 41 per cent leave something because they are too fussy to eat it. The study also found that 46 per cent of Brits admitted they worry about the amount of food they throw away with another 56 per cent concerned about the cost. It also emerged 62 per cent of Brits think dealing with food waste is one of the most unhygienic and disliked jobs in the kitchen. A spokesman for InSinkErator added: 'It is incredible how much we leave on our plates, and how it all adds up. 'As they say as soon as you start to measure it, then you can start to do something about it; so many of us have no idea of the amount of left over food we throw away. 'Unsurprisingly, most of hate the messy business of binning left overs. It is disgusting, dirty, an inconvenience and very unhygienic.'","Average home throws out 6.5kg of unwanted food each week - or 338kg per year .

IBM's Sequoia computer, which is 1.55 times faster than Japan's previous record-breaker, the Fujitsu K Computer, was installed and switched on at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Throwing evidence behind Moore's Law - which dictates that computers get twice as powerful and twice as small every 18 months - the new super-computer is a powerful machine. It can perform - in less than a second - calculations which would take the super computers of 1993 three days to solve. In fact, the IBM team say it is 273,930 times more powerful than the 1993 machine - called the CM-5/1024 and created by American firm Thinking Machines. The Sequoia: This grey slab is just part the most powerful computer on the planet, and will be used in nuclear power research, with perhaps a game or two of chess on the side . The BBC reports that Sequoia is capable of calculating, in one hour, 'what otherwise would take 6.7 billion people using hand calculators 320 years.' The computer will be used carry out simulations to help extend the life of nuclear weapons, in a bid to avoid real-world underground tests . Sequoia and uses over 1.5 million processors - to put that in perspective, your brand-new, luxurious £1,500 desktop PC will like be a quad-core, e.g. with four processors. Gamers and computer enthusiasts all over the world will be very tempted to install some modern computer games like the first-person shooter Crysis onto Sequoia to watch the hardware destroy all previous hardware benchmarks. National Nuclear Security Administration administrator Thomas D'Agostino said: 'While Sequoia may be the fastest, the underlying computing capabilities it provides give us increased confidence in the nation's nuclear deterrent. Japan's 'No 2' computer is certainly nothing to be sneered at. It packs 88,128 2.0 GHz 8-core processors (spread over 864 separate cabinets). To put that in perspective, this is nearly 90,000 very-high-end home computers, all strung up together to work in sync. That creates around 705,000 processors in total, less than half of Sequoia's 1.5million, but still a mighty beast in its own right. It runs on Linux, the open-source and free alternative to Windows which means, if nothing else, Fujitsu got to save some money on the software side. 'Sequoia also represents continued American leadership in high performance computing.' It is also the machine with relatively outstanding economy power-wise, consuming 7.9 megawatts compared to the K computer, which consumes12.6 megawatts. Other countries with supercomputers include China and Japan, with two apiece, and and Germany, France and Italy each have one. IBM has built five out of the top 10 computers. David Turek, vice president of deep computing at the firm, told the BBC: 'Substantial planning went into this. We knew the day would come.' Not everyone was left excited by the new machine: ZDNet’s Zack Whittaker said: 'The U.S. may claim home to some the world’s top scientists, just as China has for two non-consecutive years claimed the world’s fastest computer. ... At the end of the day: supercomputers are just tools.' However, in  reply, another ZNET writer, Dan Kusnetzky, said: 'On the other hand, IBM or any other supplier’s ability to create such a complex, powerful computing research is of extreme importance. 'The thought, the tools and the procedures needed to build and operate such a huge system are directly applicable to other types of computing.'","IBM's 'Sequoia' beats Japan's 'K machine', running 1.55 times faster while being 15 per cent more energy efficient .

Irish debtors must give up foreign holidays, satellite television and feed themselves on eight euros (about £6.80) a day under new monthly spending rules introduced by the government to tackle the country's debt problems. Ireland's Insolvency Service will allow a debtor to spend 57 euros a month on heating bills and 126 euros on socialising, while they must remove their children from private schools, give up any private health insurance and only use a car if there is no public transport alternative. High unemployment - at 14 per cent - and wage cuts since the country's economy collapsed in 2008 mean that 120,000 - about one in eight - homeowners have fallen into arrears and are more than 90 days behind on repayments, reports the Financial Times. The Irish government has introduced monthly spending limits for people in debt as it tries to tackle the country's mortgage crisis . The monthly spending rules are part of Ireland's plan to tackle the problem of one in eight mortgage holders being in arrears on repayments . Another 100,000 mortgages have been restructured with short-term loans. Anyone who does not agree to a debt agreement under the new rules could have their home repossessed, as Ireland attempts to overhaul its dated bankruptcy laws and tackle the problem of an estimated 400,000 homeowners being in negative equity. 'A reasonable standard of living does not mean a person should live at luxury level,' said Lorcan O'Connor, the Insolvency Service's. 'But nor does it mean that people should be punished and live only at subsistence level.' The guidelines will also be used by banks to restructure mortgage debt with homeowners. Ireland's justice minister Alan Shatter warned banks that their losses could be heavier if they do not agree deals with debtors - suggesting that homeowners may opt for bankruptcy, reports the FT. Irish mortgage holders cannot get out of debt by handing over their property. Banks who sell the houses on at a loss are free to go after homeowners for the difference if the property sells for a loss.","Ireland's Insolvency Service will allow only eight euros a day for food .

Or do you hate Chardonnay, but love a glass of Chablis? If so, you join the one in seven Britons who bluff when it comes to wine, often leading to embarrassing faux pas. As any wine connoisseur already knows, Champagne is named after the region of France it comes from and Chablis is made from the Chardonnay grape. Other awkward moments revealed by the survey of wine drinkers included drinkers claiming to enjoy the Merlin grape – it is in fact Merlot. Another diner who requested wine in a smart restaurant was told by the waiter the sommelier would come to his table. When he arrived, the diner promptly told him not to worry about the wine because ‘the waiter is already getting me a bottle of some mellyeh.’ Younger drinkers were most likely to bluff, with one in four 18 to 24 year olds pretending to know more than they do about wine, the YouGov survey for online wine retailer WineTrust100 found. It revealed that 42 per cent of males wanted advice on making a better choice of wine to bring home or to order when eating out. However women are more likely to play it safe when buying wine, with 52 per cent saying they stick to just one or two brands or types with which they are familiar, rather than experiment with new wine. John Hoskins, taster from WineTrust100 which stocks100 of the world’s best wines for their price,  said people often felt the need to bluff because they are unnecessarily embarrassed about admitting they need some guidance on wine. He said many common mistakes were perfectly understandable, notably that most wine drinkers believing that red wine should be served at room temperature. In fact this advice dates from Victorian times, when room temperature was around 4C lower than the average heat in modern homes. Younger drinkers were most likely to . bluff, with one in four 18 to 24 year olds pretending to know more than . they do about wine, the YouGov survey for online wine retailer . WineTrust100 found . He said; ‘Of course the softness of a wine served at 22C may feel lovely and warming on a cold winter’s day, but above about 19C and the aromas and flavours that the winemaker has tried so hard to encapsulate will be lost. ‘Similarly with white wine, but in the other direction. The better the white, the more it will benefit from a little warmth to show you all its charms. ‘Good quality whites are best served around 10C and you can watch them improve further as they sit in the glass.’ Mr Hoskins added: ‘People are often very conservative when it comes to buying wine. ‘Even regular consumers will find one type that they like and don’t venture beyond it for fear of buying something that is not good or they don’t like. ‘The retail experience they’ve had until now hasn’t helped.","One in seven Britons bluff when it comes to wine .

Several of the store's best-selling savouries, including steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas have shrunk in size. But the bakery giant has defended the shrinking size of its food, saying it is better on the waistline. Greggs have shrank a number of their popular products, including pasties and breakfast bacon roll, while still pushing its prices up (file picture) The worst hit is the breakfast bacon roll, which has shrunk by 18 per cent, from 152g to 124g since last May. Pasties . and pizzas have gone down by five per cent, while chicken subs . sandwiches have become six per cent smaller and cheese and bacon wraps . have shrunk by seven per cent. Even Greggs' famous steak bake, relaunched in March with 'even more delicious prime steak', has shrunk its protein content by 15 per cent. In addition, Yum-Yum doughnuts and triple chocolate muffins have slimmed down by seven per cent and lemon drizzle doughnuts are eight per cent smaller.

The popular steak bake (left) has shrunk by 15 per cent, while ham and cheese wraps (right) have slimmed down by seven per cent . An investigation by trade magazine The Grocer found Greggs, which has 1,671 stores around the UK, has shrunk the treats at the same time as pushing up its prices. The bakery giant had admitted to 'reluctantly' putting up the prices but said that where there have been changes, it is the result of improvements, such as the reduction in fat, salt and or sugar. A spokeswoman for Greggs refused to confirm exactly which products had gone up in price but on its website Greggs admitted that it had 'reluctantly changed the price of some of our food with very minor increases.' She said: 'A small . number of product recipes have changed driven by customer feedback and . nutritional guidelines, which has reduced these product weights. 'These changes have been made over a . long period of time, and our prices always remain at the great value our . customers expect from us.' She added: 'Greggs leads the bakery . industry by being transparent about our food and providing detailed . nutritional information about our products. 'We . are constantly reviewing our products and making changes and . improvements to them, and we update the product information and . nutritional content for our customers on our website and our in-shop . information leaflet. Yum-Yum doughnuts (pictured) and triple chocolate muffins have reduced by seven per cent . Pizzas are now five per cent smaller at Greggs and lemon drizzle doughnuts have shrunk by eight per cent . 'Where changes in weight do occur, this is normally the result of improvements to specification such as reducing fat, salt and/or sugar.' Former Greggs chief executive Ken . McMeikan warned in January that 'significant' price hikes on commodities . including flour, pork, poultry and beef could mean price increases in . 2013. 'Food inflation will have an impact, along with other cost rises like energy', he said. 'We will try and protect our customers but sadly there will be rises in commodities we have to pass on.' The move comes after the bakery giant forced Chancellor George Osbourne to back down in the controversial 'Pasty Tax' storm last year. And it follows criticism from consumer watchdog Which? that the size reductions can be an underhand way of hiking prices. Which? Magazine executive director Richard Lloyd told The Grocer that reducing the size of products was not fair on consumers. He said: 'Shrinking products can be a way of raising prices, because pack sizes shrink but prices don't.' Greggs has defended the shrinking size of its pasties, saying they are . better on the waistline . The worst hit is the breakfast bacon roll, which has shrunk by 18 per cent. Pasties and pizzas have gone down by five per cent, while chicken subs sandwiches have become six per cent smaller . The hidden price hike strategy . started with popular chocolate bars and sweets but quickly spread to a . wide range of foods and everyday household products. James . Hutchings, a commodity specialist at analysts Mintec told the magazine . that shrinking products had become a 'common tool' used by a 'range of . food sectors, from confectionery and snack foods to soft drinks to . mitigate the volatility of commodity prices.' He also predicted that the trend would continue for the foreseeable future. Only last month Which? reported that big name brands are shrinking products by up to a quarter, but the prices aren't dropping. And in some cases, they've even increased. The consumer magazine says it had uncovered a selection of everyday products that now offer poorer value for money than before . The magazine said: 'We found a pack of Birds Eye beef burgers had four fewer burgers in it - now 12 instead of 16. 'We also discovered Pledge furniture polish had shrunk by 17 per cent. But the prices had stayed the same or risen. 'In fact, anything from bags of crisps to packs of dishwasher tablets are getting smaller. 'We asked the makers of these products why they had shrunk them, and were generally told that, in the face of rising costs they chose to shrink products rather than increase prices.' A survey of Which? members found that 58 per cent say they would rather prices rose than packs got smaller. A further 37 per cent would rather the pack shrank, but only if you were told. Only three per cent said it was fine for the pack size to shrink and not be told about it.

Profits at Tesco slumped by 51 per cent last year as  it wrote off £1.2billion on a failed attempt to conquer the United States. The fall in pretax profits – down by £2billion to £1.96billion – was its first in 20 years. It is to close or sell its Fresh & Easy convenience store chain in the US in what is an ignominious failure for Britain’s biggest retailer. Worrying: Profits at Tesco slumped by 51 per cent last year as it wrote off £1.2billion on a failed attempt to conquer the United States . The supermarket giant is also scrapping more than 100 store developments in the UK as customers switch to shopping online. That move saw the value of its vast land bank, much of it bought during the property boom, written down by £804million. It will now sell many sites that it had earmarked for large hypermarkets for less than it previously believed the land was worth. The figures were outlined yesterday by chief executive Philip Clarke, who is leading a £1billion plan to revamp its stores, improve food lines, hire extra staff and improve customer service. This is part of a shift to concentrate on . building sales through existing UK stores and through its website with . home deliveries and its click and collect service. Tesco is also trying to escape its . reputation as a faceless giant by buying the family friendly restaurant . chain Giraffe, and investments in the coffee shop chain  Harris + Hoole . and the bakery business Euphorium. It seems outlets under these banners will be opened in some of its large Extra hypermarkets to make a visit more of a day out than a chore. The exit from the US and the decision to scale back store building suggests Mr Clarke is effectively burning much of the legacy of his predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, who left in March 2011. Leaving aside the special one-off costs, underlying profits relating to day to day sales still fell by 14.5 per cent to £3.55billion, according to the latest annual accounts published yesterday. The decision to pull out of the US is not the only failure on the international front, for Tesco also revealed problems with trading and expansion in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Fresh & Easy opened its first outlet in Hemet, California, on November 1, 2007. It was to be the first of 1,000  convenience stores that would bring British supermarket shopping to  US consumers. Just as Wal-Mart of the US had bought the Asda chain in the UK, so Tesco . would now challenge the American giant in its own backyard. Three booming states – California, Arizona and Nevada – were picked for . the launch. But within two years, they had become among the worst hit by . the sub-prime mortgage crisis, which led to the financial crash. Tesco hit: The group confirmed plans to pull its Fresh & Easy business in the U.S. and reported its first fall in full-year group profits for two decades . Tesco poured £1billion into the venture, but it has never turned a . profit during more than five years of trading. Only 199 stores were . opened. Americans were put off by the stark aisles, plastic wrapped fruit and . veg, ready meals and self-service check-outs in a country where bagging . up groceries for struggling shoppers is a customer service essential. At . the same time, it was unclear whether the chain was presenting itself . as a budget option or a place for aspiring shoppers to buy high quality . food and drink. In the UK, a growing number of shoppers buy their groceries online or . via smartphone, but in the US very few families shop in this way. Fresh & Easy, which employs some 5,000 people, was the brainchild of . former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, who sent his most senior . lieutenant, Tim Mason, to run it. Despite Mr Mason’s expertise, the venture failed to take off and he quit . the US business last December with a pay-off reported to be . £5.7million. Now, Tesco has appointed a US firm to try to find a buyer for the whole . business or some of the stores. US rival Trader Joe’s is expected to buy . all the stores in California and Nevada. Phil Dorrell, director of retail consultants Retail Remedy, said: ‘This grim set of numbers shows that even Tesco is mortal. ‘From day one, Fresh & Easy was an . unmitigated disaster for Tesco. Boss: Tesco's Chief Executive Philip Clarke spoke of 'natural consequences of strategic changes' It is retreating from the States with . its tail firmly between its legs. ‘Even without the Fresh & Easy . debacle the supermarket would probably still have seen its profits fall . for the first time in 20 years. Tesco took its eye off the ball in . spectacular fashion and, in its goal to be a world-beater, forgot to . take care of the basics.’ Tesco . said the investment in improving stores and customer service in this . country is already bearing fruit. But the business was among the big . losers from the horse meat scandal after it was forced to remove many . contaminated products from sale. Chief . executive Mr Clarke said: ‘The announcements made today are natural . consequences of the strategic changes we began over a year ago and which . conclude today. ‘Tesco already looks, feels and acts like a different and better business.’","Tesco group reports first fall in full-year group profits for two decades .

"By . Nick Enoch . UPDATED: . 09:58 EST, 27 February 2012 . Everyone knows the name of Kermit's glamorous admirer. It's Miss Piggy. But did you know her name was originally Miss Piggy Lee... and her character was actually based on 1940s' American jazz diva Peggy Lee? When the porcine Muppet and her co-stars became more famous, the 'Lee' was dropped to avoid upsetting the 'Fever' singer. This is one of 350 amazing revelations in a new book - The Godfather Was A Girl - by Eamon Evans, which claims to reveal the real-life inspirations for famous characters of book and screen. Did you know Muppet legend Miss Piggy was originally called Miss Piggy Lee... and her character was actually based on 1940s American jazz diva Peggy Lee (right)? Walter 'Wally' Saunders (right), the man who . built Roald Dahl's writing shed, is said to have inspired the author's creation, . the Big Friendly Giant - according to The Godfather Was A Girl author Eamon Evans . The title comes from the claim that Mario Puzo, author of The Godfather, used his mother as inspiration for the main character of the classic Mafia tale. An Italian immigrant, she raised her 12 children by herself in a New York slum. According to 34-year-old Evans, Puzo said his mother was a 'wonderful, handsome woman... but a fairly ruthless person', the Daily Telegraph reported today. 'Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth, in my mind I heard the voice of my mother,' he is said to have exclaimed. And then there's the Big Friendly Giant - one of Roald Dahl's well-loved creations. When the muse took hold, Dahl would retreat to his shed, which was built by a man called Walter 'Wally' Saunders, who had hands like a 'bunch of bananas', an 'enormous' nose and ears, 'spoke with a strange accent' and 'got his words wrong'. A description of the BFG himself. Evans claims that Wally, 'a huge, sweet-natured Norfolk builder with a long, pale, wrinkly face', was the inspiration for the character. Evans claims Wizard Of Oz author, L Frank Baum, based the Wicked Witch of the West (played by Margaret Hamilton, left, in the 1939 film) on radical 19th century feminist Matilda Gage (right) Did you know that Crocodile Dundee (played on screen by Paul Hogan, left) was said to be based on real-life buffalo hunter Rod Ansell? Saunders died in 2004, aged 91. When . Dahl set up home in Buckinghamshire in 1954, he carried out various . building jobs on the author's estate. His assertion was reinforced by Michael Brittin, 75, the nephew of Mr Saunders. 'He knew that Roald Dahl had written the book and based . it on him and the characteristics of the two are very similar,' Mr Brittin told the newspaper. 'He was a well-built man and had pretty big hands. He had very broad shoulders and was very muscular and strong.' He said his uncle could . even bend pipework over his knee. Mr Evans also has revelations about another British author. Mr Toad from The Wind In The Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, is claimed to have been inspired by the author's son, Alistair . Mr Toad from Wind In The Willows, by Kenneth Grahame, is claimed to have been inspired by the author's son, Alistair. Like his fictional counterpart, he is said to have been quite a reckless chap. Apparently, Alistair liked kicking little girls and hurling himself in front of cars. Mr Evans also claims that the Wizard Of Oz author, L Frank Baum, based the Wicked Witch of the West on a radical feminist of the time, Matilda Gage, who lived from 1826 to 1898. And perhaps Baum was trying to make a point.. because she also happened to be his mother-in-law. His book calls her a 'courageous pioneer of women's rights' but also a 'man-hating testicle eater'. And how about Aussie Outback hero Crocodile Dundee... Did you know he was based on real-life buffalo hunter Rod Ansell? Eamon Evans's inspiration for writing the book in the first place? He had been looking for inspiration for a novel . Or that free-spirited 80s rebel Ferris Bueller was probably based on Edward McNally, a former senior counsel to George W Bush? He grew up on the same Chicago street as Ferris creator John Hughes and went to the same high school. And, like Ferris, it's said he didn't attend very often. Evans also namechecks one of Britain's best-loved comedy series Fawlty Towers. Basil Fawlty, the angry hotel owner created by John Cleese, was based . on real-life guesthouse owner Donald Sinclair, who lived from 1909 to . 1981. According to Evans, the Monty Python team observed the 'snobby, bonkers and bad-tempered' hotelier for themselves when they . stayed at his Torquay establishment in 1970. In a Mail Online article in 2005, Cleese described Mr Sinclair as 'the most wonderfully rude man I . have ever met'. Mr Sinclair is said to have thrown Eric . Idle's suitcase out of the window 'in case it contained a bomb' and . complained about Terry Gilliam's table manners. There was also Draper Daniels, a famous ad man in the 1950s - said to be the . inspiration for Don Draper in the TV show Mad Men. Like his fictional counterpart, he enjoyed a 'martini lunch', . smoking and attracted 'women like flies to flypaper'. And Evans's inspiration for writing the book in the first place? He had been looking for inspiration for a novel. The Godfather Was A Girl is published by Hardie Grant books and due out on . Thursday.","Author claims to have found basis for over 350 famous creations .

A former Playboy Playmate has admitted to helping her Canadian boyfriend after he illegally entered the United States in northern New York last summer. Colleen Shannon pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to a felony charge and faces a sentence ranging from no jail time to 10 months. Federal agents say the 35-year-old Los Angeles resident and her paramour, Robert Skojo, were arrested after he illegally crossed the border and rendezvoused with her in Fort Covington. Officials say Skojo has a criminal record in Canada. Guilty: Former Playboy Playmate Colleen Shannon (left), pictured exiting the federal courthouse in Syracuse, N.Y. with her lawyer, John Conrad (right), pleaded guilty to helping her Canadian boyfriend sneak into the U.S. The statuesque blonde was the centerfold for Playboy's 50th anniversary edition in 2004. Shannon currently works as a disc jockey and calls herself the world's sexiest DJ. She declined to comment after her guilty plea. For her court appearance Tuesday, Shannon picked a conservative ensemble consisting of a white blouse paired with a black jacket, matching tight pants and spiky leather boots. The demure getup was accessorized with two large Louis Vuitton bags slung over the ex-playmate’s shoulders. Shannon's boyfriend told authorities he knew his criminal record would bar his U.S. entry. He's jailed and faces deportation. If the 35-year-old woman gets credit for accepting responsibility for her role in the case, Shannon will face anywhere between no jail time and six months behind bars. Without the credit, she would face a sentence between four and 10 months when she learns her fate October 22, the Post-Standard of Syracuse reported. New lawyer: A federal judge in Syracuse allowed Colleen Shannon,  pictured left and right, to drop her lawyer, Mark Sacco, and hire a new one in January . Shannon and Skojo were arrested in August 2012 in Fort Covington, New York, after federal agents said he entered the U.S. illegally by boat through the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reservation, which straddles the border. Skojo was convicted in Canada in 1990 of 'procuring sexual services' and 'living on the avails of prostitution,' the Post-Standard of Syracuse quotes court papers as saying. He was also convicted of drug charges in 1996 and 1999. Shannon's attorney, John Conrad, said that Skojo's drug convictions got him barred from legally immigrating to the U.S. According to the lawyer, his client was not aware of her boyfriend's prostitution charges. Skojo had applied for a waiver that would have made him eligible to enter the country, and he and Shannnon assumed that it would eventually be granted, according to Conrad. Skojo was sentenced in November to six months in jail for entering the U.S. illegally and he now faces deportation. Skojo began dating Shannon in 2011 after she DJ'd a party he hosted, according to the Post-Standard. Bunny: Shannon, pictured right with Hugh Hefner, was the centerfold for Playboy's 50th anniversary edition in 2004 . Smuggling: Shannon, pictured left and right, and her boyfriend, Robert Skojo, were arrested in August in Fort Covington, New York . The 2004 playmate, who now works as a disc jockey, was taken into custody after being charged with violating a federal statute prohibiting 'bringing in and harboring aliens'. U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped Shannon on August 15 at the Massena point of entry, where she'd driven alone in Skojo's 2005 Bentley, court documents said. The two planned to live together in Los Angeles. Poser: Shannon even posed in her mug shot, pictured, taken in August . The newspaper reported that Shannon . declared that she had $9,800 in cash with her, which she said was from . her job as a DJ, but she couldn't prove Skojo had given permission to . drive his car. Shannon told the agents she was an actress and that she was driving to New York City to meet her agent. Border Patrol let her go, then notified agents with Homeland Security Investigations. Agents watched her drive to a hotel in Fort Covington hotel and Skojo met her there that night, the papers said. The couple were arrested the next morning. Shannon had previously claimed she shouldn't be charged with alien smuggling because she didn't drive Skojo across the border. 'Instead, according to Shannon, she was simply picking up her boyfriend,' the prosecutor's court papers said. The former playmate faces 10 years in prison if convicted. In her 2004 Playboy profile, Shannon, who is from Alaska, said she was turned-on by 'positivity and supportiveness' while turn-offs included negativity and being a bad kisser. She said: 'Everyone is put here to do something. Your subconscious tells you the things that you love to do, but a lot of people put those things aside. 'I think if you stick to things you love, nine times out of ten, circumstances are going to go your way and you will live a happy life.'","Former Playboy centerfold .

The prosecution had demanded the man be sent away for 18 years but female Chief Judge Sabarulina Ginting, sitting in the East Jakarta District Court, decided on just 15 years. In addition to the lenient jail sentence, Sunoto was fined just £25. The court heard that Sunoto was named a suspect not long after his daughter, identified only by the initial R, died at Persahabatan Hospital in East Jakarta on January 6 following two weeks of intense medical attention. The Jakarta Post reported that her doctors said she had suffered from brain inflammation and sustained injuries from a blunt object being inserted into her. The doctors also said she had been infected with a sexually transmitted disease. Horrific: The father, from Jakarta, Indonesia, pictured, was ordered to serve just 15 years in prison for the brutal rape of his daughter which lead to her dying from her injuries . Police told the court that Sunoto admitted raping R in October of last year at their house in East Jakarta. But the father managed to tell reporters after the verdict that he had never raped his daughter, insisting he confessed his guilt to police only in order to protect his family. 'I never did that,' he said. 'I made the confession just so that this can be over quickly and so that police would no longer summon my family,' he said. Just 24 hours earlier it emerged from the neighbouring country of Papua New Guinea that an 18-year-old girl who had been raped by her father killed him by chopping off his head with a bush knife. Police said yesterday they were determined to question the girl, even though villagers said they had formed a protective ring around her because she had 'done the right thing' by killing her 'evil' father.","The 54-year-old father, named only as Sunoto, raped his daughter, aged nine .

Alaska may be better known for its glaciers and forests than for its beaches, but this week residents of the icy state have been soaking up the sun during a freak heatwave. Anchorage, the state's biggest city, has seen record temperatures of 81F (27C), while other parts of Alaska are believed to have climbed as high as 98F. However, while many are delighted by the unusual warmth, others are sweltering in homes and offices which lack air-conditioning and are not designed to tackle heat. Scroll down for video .

Crowds: Residents of the state have seized the rare opportunity to indulge in summery activities . Residents have been sunbathing and swimming at lakes throughout the state, welcoming the heatwave which comes just a month after the last snows of the winter. 18-year-old Jordan Rollison, who joined hundreds relaxing on the shore of Goose Lake, commented: 'I love it - I've never seen a summer like this, ever.' But others were less positive - Anchorage resident Lorraine Roehl said, 'It's almost unbearable to me. I don't like being hot.' State officials took the unusual step of warning people that they should wear sunscreen if they go outside.

'This is the hottest heat wave in Alaska since 1969,' said meteorolist Jeff Masters. 'You're way, way from normal.'

The journalist who won fame as the man who caused the downfall of General Stanley McChrystal died Tuesday in an horrific early morning car crash. Michael Hastings was known as a no-nonsense reporter. His candid Rolling Stone interview with the Afghanistan general in 2010 was only one of many of the 33-year-old’s accomplishments. Hastings most recently worked for BuzzFeed, where Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith called the late reporter ‘a great, fearless journalist with an incredible instinct for the story, and a gift for finding ways to make his readers care about anything he covered from wars to politicians.’ He is survived by his wife Elise Jordan.

Hastings was pronounced dead at the scene of Tuesday morning's fiery crash . For more videos, please go to LoudLabs News . Hastings rocketed to fame after the article 'The Runaway General' ran in Rolling Stone magazine in June 2010. Hastings' intimate access to top Afghanistan commander McChrystal and his day to day comings and goings gave the reporter a look into the mind of a top level war general. Where most reporters would have taken the generals' irreverent mockery--of President Obama, Joe Biden, and other non-military commanders--with a grain of salt, Hastings saw it as the stuff of great news reporting. Friends and colleagues mourn Michael Hastings on Twitter... Though convention dictated that he . repay the general and his associates for his access with a glossed-over, . reverential piece, Hastings produced a raw account of what the actual . General McChrystal looked like as he stood at the helm of the war in . Afghanistan. And he didn't look good. The . decorated soldier came off as crude and remarks about higher-ups like, . 'Vice President Biden...Who's that?' spelled his doom. Mere . hours after Hastings' article appeared in Rolling Stone, McChrystal was . summoned from the war to Washington, where he offered his resignation. Big fall: Hastings published Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's behind the scenes comments about civilian commanders and the general later stepped down . No stranger to tragedy: Hastings chronicled his time in Baghdad, where his then fiance Andi Parhamovich (left) was killed in an attack, in a bestselling memoir (right) The Vermont native was also the author of two books about America’s most recent wars. Michael Hastings was well placed as journalist within the tight circle around Afghanistan top commander McChrystal, but the 'hard-charging' journalist was not interested in painting a rosy picture of the war chief's unseemly conduct in this Rolling Stone piece The Runaway General in 2010. Hastings' intimate access to McChrystal and his close allies was unusual and showed him an often immature side of the man in charge of all NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, beginning with a loose-lipped night of drinking in Paris. 'In private,' writes Hastings in The Runaway General, 'Team McChrystal likes to talk sh** about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side.' Loose lips like that would have gone un-noted by some journalists, a sort of traditional thank you for access granted, but not by Hastings. The general seemed to have a particular dislike for Vice President Joe Biden. 'Are you asking about Vice President Biden,' McChrystal jokes at one point.""Who's that?""' Many comments like that made it into the final, published article and within hours of its publishing, McChrystal had been summoned to Washington, all the way from the war theater, where he would offer his resignation. In . the Operators, Hastings writes a more detailed, long form account of what the war in Afghanistan looked like from the point of view of the commanders on the ground. His other book, I Lost My Love . in Baghdad, is also a chronicle of war, but with added personal tragedy. Hastings went to Iraq to cover the war at the age of 25. Soon after, his girlfriend Andi Parhamovich followed. The . two met in New York in 2005. When he left to cover the war, she took a . job with the National Democratic Institute, a group dedicated to . spreading democratic practices around the world. While on a mission for her employer, Parhamovich was killed in a Baghdad carbombing. The two were set to marry. She was 28. A long, dark period for Hastings followed and I Lost My Love in Baghdad became the bestselling result of his grieving process. He would later find love . with writer Elise Jordan, a writer and former speechwriter for . Condoleezza Rice and National Security Council communications strategist . who frequently appears as a commentator on political news programs. The Baghdad incident, however, would not be the first . senseless tragedy to befall Hastings. Early Tuesday morning, around 4:15am, . a car plowed into a tree in Hollywood, California and burst into . flames. The body was too badly burned to be immediately identified, . reports KTLA. But by Tuesday evening, both Buzzfeed and Rolling Stone had identified Hastings as the victim of the horrific crash. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Now, Hastings’ wife, Elise, must carry the same weight her husband once did after Parhamovich’s death in Iraq. Wife: Hastings found love despite his tragic past in writer/commentator Elise Jordan. Now she must bear the same burden of tragedy her late husband once did . Tragic life: Hastings also wrote a book detailing his time as a 25-year-old war reporter and the fiance he lost in a Baghdad ambush . Hastings is also survived by his beloved corgi Bobby Sneakers. Rolling Stone wrote an obituary for the brash, hard-hitting star reporter with appropriate honesty: . ‘Hard-charging, . unabashedly opinionated, Hastings was original and at times abrasive. He had little patience for flacks and spinmeisters and will be . remembered for his enthusiastic breaches of the conventions of access . journalism.’ Bittersweet legacy: Hastings is survived by his wife Elise and his beloved corgi Bobby Sneakers . Last year, Hastings contributed to Reddit's Politics section with a list of suggestions, advice really, for up-and-coming and wannabe young journalists that showcased his trademark single-minded dedication. 'I am Michael Hastings,' it begins, 'a reporter for BuzzFeed and a writer for Rolling Stone' Okay, here's my advice to you (and young journalists in general): . 1. You basically have to be willing to devote your life to journalism if you want to break in. Treat it like it's medical school or law school. 2. When interviewing for a job, tell the editor how you love to report. How your passion is gathering information. Do not mention how you want to be a writer, use the word ""prose,"" or that deep down you have a sinking suspicion you are the next Norman Mailer. 3. Be prepared to do a lot of things for free. This sucks, and it's unfair, and it gives rich kids an edge. But it's also the reality. 4. When writing for a mass audience, put a fact in every sentence. 5. Also, keep the stories simple and to the point, at least at first. 6. You should have a blog and be following journalists you like on Twitter. 7. If there's a publication you want to work for or write for, cold call the editors and/or email them. This can work. 8. By the second sentence of a pitch, the entirety of the story should be explained. (In other words, if you can't come up with a rough headline for your story idea, it's going to be a challenge to get it published.) 9. Mainly you really have to love writing and reporting. Like it's more important to you than anything else in your life--family, friends, social life, whatever. 10. Learn to embrace rejection as part of the gig. Keep writing/pitching/reading.","Hastings' 2010 interview with the top military commander in Afghanistan won the reporter fame and awards and cost the general his job .

Veteran cricketer Cecil Wright is still racing in to bowl at the age of 79, after bagging an amazing 7,000 wickets in an illustrious 65-year career. Fast bowler Cecil Wright may be one of the oldest players in Britain but he is refusing to be sent back to the pavilion by old age, proved by the six wickets he grabbed for his club side just last week. Known as 'Cec' to his friends, he moved to Oldham in Greater Manchester in the 1950s to play league cricket and also represented Jamaica, but he still remains the scourge of batsmen. Still racing in: Cecil Wright, who turns 80 in December, remains the scourge of batsmen, taking 7,000 wickets in 65 years . Icons: Cec, as he is known to his friends, played alongside greats of the game including legend Viv Richards . In his last four games for his local league side he has taken 15 wickets, including six in one game, and said that even though his opening bowl is not as fast as it once was he is still a force to be reckoned with on the pitch. In his heyday he played alongside legends of the game including West Indies cricket legends Sir Viv Richards, Sir Frank Worrell, Sir Garfield Sobers and Joel Garner plus England stalwart Denis Compton. And he said that despite being old enough to be most of his opponents' grandfather he can still teach them a thing or two about the game. Cecil who has a son and two grandchildren and who lives in Royton, near Oldham, said: 'I've been playing since I was a young boy and I was a professional for over 50 years so I don't want to finish yet. 'I've been lucky with injuries and I have always kept fit so I will keep playing. 'Some of the lads I play against might not expect much from an opponent who is approaching 80 but I'm still good enough to get anyone out, even if my fast bowl is a bit of a medium bowl nowadays.' Top player: Cecils pulls the ball in a match vs Rochdale in 1962, having come to Britain to be a professional . Still got it: More than 50 years later Mr Wright celebrates taking another wicket this season . He is set to play up to 40 games this season including matches in the Saddleworth and District Cricket League in Oldham, Greater Manchester, for his side Uppermill. Last week 'Cec' took six wickets in a match against Friarmere, bowling 10 overs in helping Uppermill's second XI to a 16-run win. Instead of putting his feet up he then played again the next day, this time taking three wickets. Cec first arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1959 after signing as the Crompton professional in the Central Lancashire League. He had already made a First Class appearance for Jamaica. After three summers playing in the Lancashire leagues he decided to stay in the UK. During one spell he took 538 wickets in five seasons, averaging one every 27 balls in the days of the eight-ball over. Action man: Cecil Wright is believed to be one of the oldest cricketers in Britain, and is sure to be the most successful of that age . Celebrated Cecil: The 79 year old with his trophies and awards, he was even painted for a portrait by artist Mark Whyatt, given to him when he retired . He met Enid, who he has now been married to for 50 years. As well as playing cricket he also worked in a cotton mill, before starting work for Mars in a distribution warehouse in Manchester for 29 years. He said the secret of his long playing career is his love of Lancashire food including hot pot and pie and peas as well as his favourite fruit and vegetables from the West Indies including yams, sweet potatoes and green bananas. He has even taken up Crown Green Bowls and has had to get used to bowling underarm and keeps fit by playing cricket with his two young grandchildren. One of the boys: Cec (centre) with his Uppermill CC teammates. he continues to take wickets for them . Winner: Cecil part of a championship winning squad in 1981, where his bowling drove the side on to victory . More trophies: Cec in the Lancashire over 50s team in the 1990s, after yet another win . He said: 'To be honest I eat anything that's going but I don't drink much, just the odd beer. And I keep fit, although these days I use my age as an excuse to miss training. 'I find keeping active helps to ease aches and pains. I don't like to sit still and watch TV, I would rather have a walk or potter about in the garage. 'If I have a bruised finger or a sore leg I don't worry about it, I just keep going and don't complain. 'I've thought about retiring but I can't. I've no idea how many games I have played now in my career - probably about two million. 'As long as I feel okay and I'm selected I'll continue to turn out.' A spokesman for the 'cricket bible' Wisden said although some amateur cricketers had played into their late 80s Cec's effort was 'pretty good going'.","Fast bowler Cecil Wright played for Jamaica during 65-year career .

Samantha Torres had taken her daughter Nadia to see Beauty and the Beast at the Providence Performing Arts Center in Providence, Rhode Island on June 2 for the girl's first trip to the theater. Once the show began, Nadia, who has a chromosome abnormality and is unable to speak, started laughing and giggling, in a sign she was enjoying the show, her mother said. Complaint: Samantha Torres says she was asked to leave a theater after her developmentally disabled daughter Nadia, pictured, started laughing and humming during a show - a sign that she was happy . Although no one around them was put off by the sounds, staff made her leave, Torres told South Coast Today. 'They did not ask me to leave; they told me I had to leave,' she said. Scene: Staff at the theater, pictured, said the mother and daughter were offered other seats . But staff at the theater insisted they acted properly and offered the family different seats, rather than telling them to leave. Marketing Director P.J. Prokop said the theater has a responsibility to ensure everyone can hear the show, but audience members 'were turning around, they were looking, they were also kind of gesturing', she said.

The Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of public accommodation, as well as exclusion, segregation and unequal treatment. Learning lesson: She says she wants ushers at the theater to be given sensitivity training . Griffin said the law allows the staff to act only if Nadia was distracting other audience members.

Freda Owens was rushed into hospital from The Croft House Rest Home, in Freckleton, Lancashire,   with scalds to her lower back. But after contracting pneumonia she died weeks later. Following an inquest, the home is now the subject of a police investigation into how Mrs Owens suffered her injuries. Probe: A coroner has ordered the police to investigate a care home after a 93-year-old Freda Owens suffered serious scalding. She later died at the Royal Preston Hospital . Police confirmed that investigation is at its 'early stages' but said they would be speaking to a 'number of people' as they bid to establish the circumstances surrounding the pensioner's tragic death. The home had already been told by the Care Quality Commission that it must make improvements, including making sure patients were 'protected from abuse or the risk of abuse'. Mrs Owens was first admitted to Royal Preston Hospital from the home with scalds on November 22 and died there on January 3 after contracting pneumonia. During an inquest hearing, PC Helen Leeson, . coroner's officer, said: 'Mrs Owens had some scalds to her sacrum and . deteriorated over a time in hospital. She died on January 3 . 'A post-mortem examination was carried . out on January 10 and the cause of death was bronchial pneumonia due to . necrotic, chronic pressure ulcer to the left hip and burns or scalds to . the buttock.' The inquest into Mrs Owens' death was opened and adjourned by Blackpool coroner Anne Hind. Mrs Hind said: 'We reported it to the police. They would not have known otherwise.' Investigation: Following an inquest, the home is the subject of a police investigation into how Mrs Owens suffered her injuries. This shows a Lancashire Constabulary building . An inspection by the Care Quality Commission last July revealed the home needed to make improvements in key areas, and the commission said an unannounced follow-up inspection will take place to establish whether those improvements have been made. The areas where standards were not being met included ensuring people got 'safe and appropriate care which meets their needs and supports their rights', people were 'protected from abuse, or the risk of abuse and their human rights are respected and upheld', and given necessary medicines and cared for in 'safe and accessible surroundings'. The report said a lack of staff knowledge meant residents were not 'fully protected from the risk of unlawful or excessive control'.

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 19:50 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:24 EST, 20 March 2013 . Families have been ripped off for decades by annual increases in bills linked to inaccurate inflation figures, experts warned yesterday. The Office for National Statistics admitted its retail prices index (RPI) measure was inadequate and had been replaced. This has profound implications for millions of Britons because RPI dictates how much household bills go up each year. Implications: The RPI, which dictates how much household bills go up for millions of Britons each year, was 'inadequate' and has been replaced, said the ONS . Yesterday the ONS said the measure had been swapped for the ‘improved’ RPIJ. The ONS calculates inflation  by looking the changing price of  a representative sample – or  ‘basket’ – of around 700 goods  and services. RPIJ will be based on the same basket, but uses a different formula to calculate a final inflation figure – which turns out be significantly lower. The ONS yesterday revealed the huge gap between the measures. In February, RPI was 3.2 per cent, but RPIJ – published for the first time yesterday – was 2.6 per cent. Over the past decade, prices  have increased by 31.9 per cent according to RPIJ, but 38.1 per cent using RPI. Since RPI was launched in 1947, the ONS has worked out average prices using the ‘Carli’ method. But RPIJ uses the alternative  ‘Jevons’ method. Other countries that used the Carli method, such as America, Canada and Sweden, have axed it. Britain is the last to do so. Ripped off: The RPI, which impacts on the cost of living for families across the country, has been swapped for the 'improved' RPIJ . Controversially, however, RPI is still being used to work out annual increases in many essential household costs, such as water bills and rail fares. An analysis by the Campaign for Better Transport revealed how train fares would be lower this  year if RPIJ had been used instead of RPI. Each January, train fares are increased in line with the previous July’s RPI plus one percentage point. For example, a season ticket from Milton Keynes to London was £4,408 in 2012. This year, the same ticket costs £4,620. But it would have risen to only £4,562 under RPIJ, a saving of £58. Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ‘There are two main problems with the way Government calculates rail fares. ‘One is the policy of above inflation hikes, which needs to end, the other is the use of RPI, which now looks untenable. ‘Many regular train users would find themselves paying hundreds of pounds less each year if the more accurate RPIJ measure were adopted.’ The impact on water bills is similar. Like train fares, they are increased by a complex formula each year based on RPI. The average water bill increased by £13 this year to £388, but it would have risen by £11 if RPIJ had been used. This difference would be hugely significant if applied over a period of many years. A spokesman for Ofwat, the water regulator, said: ‘We have committed to using RPI as the measure of inflation up until 2020.’ Meanwhile, consumer prices index inflation (CPI) – which, unlike RPIJ, does not take mortgage payments or council tax into account – rose to 2.8 per cent in February, its highest level since May 2012. The Government’s target is 2 per cent, which has not been met since November 2009.","ONS admitted its Retail Prices Index measure was 'inadequate'

Taliban in several years in Doha in the next couple of days. ‘I would expect that to be followed up . within days by a meeting between the Taliban and the High Peace Council, . which is the structure that President Karzai has set up for talks of . this nature.’ Insiders said the first meeting with the . Taliban would simply be an ‘exchange of agendas’ in which both sides . laid out what issues they wanted to address. But US officials said . prisoner exchanges would be one topic for discussion. Senior security sources say Mr Cameron . and Foreign Secretary William Hague gave permission for MI6 officers to . begin talking to the Taliban more than two years ago. A well-placed source said last night: . ‘These things do happen. There have been contacts on and off for two . years. There are different levels and natures of engagement. ‘Afghans talking to Afghans is something we have encouraged. This could lead to a positive outcome.’ Afghan President Hamid Karzai speaking today following a security handover ceremony at a military academy outside Kabul . Mr Cameron acknowledged that talks would . be ‘difficult’ for some to stomach, but he said: ‘I have long argued . that we need to match the security response in Afghanistan with a . political process to try and make sure that as many people as possible . give up violence and give up armed struggle and join the political . process. ‘That is exactly what I hope can happen with elements of the Taliban. That is the point of the Taliban office in Qatar. ‘We have been fully engaged and involved . in this process right from the start, indeed from the moment I became . Prime Minister. I think this is the right thing to do.’ He added that ‘we can be very proud of . what our Armed Forces have done’ because the proportion of terror plots . against Britain emanating from Afghanistan has ‘radically reduced’ since . 2001. Could newly-announced U.S. talks with the Taliban end the conflict in Afghanistan after 12 years? The Afghan Army has swelled in size since 2007, and now numbers more than 350,000 . But Tory MP Bob Stewart, who commanded . British forces in Bosnia, warned that the Taliban holds the ‘whip hand’ and negotiators need to ‘get the talks right’ or British forces would . have ‘died in vain’. He said: ‘The Taliban are staying, we . are going to get out of the game. Guess who has the whip hand? We’ve got . to get this right, otherwise we will have lost all those wonderful men . and women in vain.’ General Khodaidad of Afghanistan, the . former counter-narcotics minister, said the country’s armed forces would . not be able to prevent the return of Taliban control in the south, . including Helmand province where British troops have been fighting. Asked if the south will ‘fall to the . Taliban’, he said: ‘The Afghan National Army cannot control Afghanistan . for the long term. Some parts of Afghanistan will fall into the hands of . the Taliban.’ Former defence minister Sir Gerald . Howarth said: ‘The military have always been clear that there needs to . be a political solution, but it is very important that the country is . not just handed back to the Taliban.’ Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai (left) shakes hands with NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen (right) during the handover ceremony .

Social networking site Facebook has announced plans to introduce clickable hashtags for users. The tool is already widely used on Twitter, as well as photo-sharing app Instagram, as a way for users to find out what others are discussing and following certain discussions. Facebook users have already begun adding hashtags to comments and status updates, yet they weren't previously able to use them as a search tool. Facebook has announced plans to introduce clickable hashtags for users. An example of how the hashtags will look is shown on the NBA Facebook page, pictured. People who want to follow news of the NBA Finals can click the tag and see all related posts that have also included the same hashtag . Facebook has now made this possible. When a Facebook user now adds a hashtagged word or phrase to a post, other users will be able to click it and use it as a search term. Hashtag phrases include multiple words stringed together. They will be presented with a list of other users across the site that are also currently using that word or phrase and discussing the same things. For example, when Facebook users watch a popular TV show such as The Apprentice, they can add '#theapprentice' to the end of their posts. Other users who are also watching the show, or who aren't watching it but are interested in following what's happening, can click the hashtag. The results will be shown as a list that users can scroll through and watch the discussion develop at a glance. The hashtag tool is already widely used on Twitter, as well as photo-sharing app Instagram, as a way for users to find out what others are discussing and following certain discussions . If the tool works in a similar way to how Twitter uses hashtags, the results will update in real-time. Around 20 per cent of users will get the hashtags feature in the initial roll-out, with a full worldwide roll-out expected in the 'coming weeks.' Hashtags are just one several new features that will be introduced to highlight discussions about events on Facebook. In a post for the company, Facebook’s Greg Lindley said: 'To date, there has not been a simple way to see the larger view of what’s happening or what people are talking about. 'To bring these conversations more to the forefront, we will be rolling out a series of features that surface some of the interesting discussions people are having about public events, people, and topics. Around 20 per cent of Facebook users will be given the #hashtag feature in the initial roll-out. The tool will then be rolled-out to all other users worldwide in 'the coming weeks' 1.

Be polite #thanks . 7. Use it for searching #wiki . 8. Search your # before you use it (if you think it might have other meanings) #ambivalent . 'As a first step, we are beginning to roll out hashtags on Facebook. 'Hashtags are just the first step to help people more easily discover what others are saying about a specific topic and participate in public conversations. 'We’ll continue to roll out more features in the coming weeks and months, including trending hashtags and deeper insights, that help people discover more of the world’s conversations.' Hashtags already feature prominently in popular music, with artists incorporating the punctuation into song and album titles, while the video for current number one single 'Blurred Lines' by U.S. RnB singer Robin Thicke features the artist’s surname and a hashtag flashing on screen throughout. The BBC then used his song, and similar on-screen hashtags, during the opening sequence of the recent F1 Canadian Qualifying coverage. Researchers from The Open University recently called Twitter's grip on hashtags a 'semantic goldmine'. Analysts believe that the adoption of hashtags on Facebook will loosen this grip and make it possible for the site to target users with even more personalised advertising. The music video for Blurred Lines by singer Robin Thicke features his surname and a hashtag flashing on screen throughout . Commenting on the announcement, digital advertising company RadiumOne said: The omnipresence of the hashtag continues to grow and Facebook’s savvy decision to adopt and adapt the feature demonstrates the brands need to remain current and drive innovation, it’s only surprising that it didn’t jump on this sooner. We have been offering hashtag targeting tools to marketers since the beginning of this year and this has provided extremely positive results for our clients so far. The addition of hashtag recognition to Facebook will further bolster our offering and provide even more insight to brands. By targeting consumers based on their genuine real-time interests, highly relevant advertising can be delivered within milliseconds – helping to boost conversions and, ultimately, the effectiveness of online advertising as a whole.

An independent review is set to be carried out into the Food Standards Agency's response to the horse meat scandal.

The move follows criticism of the FSA's handling of the horse meat scandal with Labour's shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh branding the FSA  'unfit for purpose'. Shadow Environment Secretary Mary Creagh branded the Food Safety Authority 'unfit for purpose' following the scandal . The project will feed into a larger Government review of the scandal which forced supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Waitrose to clear their shelves. The news comes just days after Dutch . authorities announced they would recall 50,000 tons of meat sold as beef . across Europe that may contain horse meat. The FSA later confirmed that the meat did come to factories supplying supermarkets in the UK. It is believed that the much of the suspected horse meat originated in countries such as Romania before being packaged elsewhere in Europe and sold on as ready meals in the UK. Industry experts claim that the suspect meat came from Abattoirs in countries such as Romania . Ms Creagh said: 'The Government's fragmentation of the FSA in 2010 has left our food regulatory system unfit for purpose. 'The FSA knew that the Irish were . testing for horse meat last November, yet did nothing until positive . results came back.

Two cruel parents convicted of a decade long campaign of abuse against their six children were jailed for seven years each today. The Nigerian couple, who claimed their kids were possessed by evil spirits, were found guilty after Coronation Street star Michelle Collins gave evidence against them. They beat their children with brooms, hoovers and wires and even gave their baby a morphine overdose just days after her first birthday. The plight of the children was so bad that Coronation Street actress Michelle Collins, who met them at a church lunch, took them to the cinema 'because she felt sorry for them' Five of the children were finally rescued after their eldest daughter threw a heart-wrenching SOS note out of a window. But it wasn't until their one-year-old baby was given a morphine overdose over a year later that police reopened the case which led to their prosecution. The plight of the children was so bad that Miss Collins, who met them at a church lunch, took them to the cinema 'because she felt sorry for them'. She gave evidence as a prosecution witness during the trial of the parents, both 40, who cannot be named to protect their six children. But the parents claimed they were victims of a conspiracy - and even alleged Miss Collins was involved in a witch hunt against them and wanted to ‘steal’ their children. One of the youngsters, a baby at the time, had been allowed to stay in the home despite the fact the five other children had to be rescued. Sentencing them to seven years behind . bars each, Judge James Patrick described it as 'shocking mistreatment' that they had tried to cover up with a 'web of deception'. Judge Patrick said: 'No-one who sat through this trial could help but be moved by the fact that these intelligent, charming, fun, lovable children continue to love you despite what you put them through.' The married couple denied the allegations claiming they were victims of a racist witch-hunt but were found guilty of cruelty to a person under 16. They argued the children had been 'brainwashed' into making the allegations by the police, the council and Miss Collins who they said 'wanted to steal' them, Wood Green Crown Court heard. But Judge Patrick noted: 'You alleged a conspiracy involving a well-known actress, who had done nothing but show your family generosity and kindness, a member of a housing charity, social workers and foster carers. 'Those who had taken the trouble to support you were repeatedly accused of dishonesty, lying, and conspiracy to rob you of your children when the reality was that both of you were lying - in fact they ware simply seeking to give your children stability.' Baby P, a British 17-month old boy who died after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period . The abuse came to the attention of police in April 2010 when their nine-year-old wrote an SOS note and threw it out of her bedroom window. The heart-breaking plea read: 'My mum is the worst mum ever because she can’t cope with five of us, her broken hand and being pregnant. She always leaves me out so I always starve and I am forced to work. 'If I don’t get enough house work done, I am beaten without mercy with the wooden end of a broom. I have scars all over me to prove it. I can’t stay here. I would like a new mum.' It was found by a neighbour who called the police, and when officers attended the address they found the children living in messy conditions with 'dirty' and 'dishevelled' clothing. Revealing scars the eldest said her mother had hit her with a cable, a broom, and a hoover and her father had dangled her by her feet down the stairwell of the house, tied her hands behind her back and her legs together 'to get the devilish spirits out', prosecutor Emma Smith said. Her sister, who was seven at the time, had a stick shaped bruise of her thigh and after a few months in care, she drew a series of pictures showing her dad beating her and her being left home alone and including a speech bubble saying ‘I’m hungry.’ Victoria Climbie, 8, died in a London hospital in 2000, having suffered months of horrific cruelty at the hands of her great-aunt . The children were left home alone for hours, sometimes days on end, with the elder kids forced to look after the others. They had even been forced to lie to a charity and social services that they were living alone with their mother in one room and had no idea who their dad was so they could scam benefits. Even during the trial the eldest feared she had torn her family apart with her 'devastating cry from the heart in the form of a letter which she threw from the window', the judge noted. There was an investigation but no further action, and the five children remained in care until the parents once again came to police attention on 28 June last year, when they gave their baby an overdose. 'But for the events of June 28 you would have gotten away with your crimes because of a merciful decision not to prosecute you', Judge Patrick noted. The couple's sixth child, a baby girl, was also initially taken into care but then returned to her parents. They took her to St Thomas’s Hospital just days after her first birthday last year. Without treatment she could have died but doctors managed to save the youngster, who it is believed was given morphine orally that morning. Jurors rejected the parents conspiracy theories. When they are released the face deportation back to Nigeria - despite pleas from their legal team that they have been 'punished enough' by having their children taken into care. As they left the court they wailed: 'We are innocent, this is a miscarriage of justice.'","Couple beat their children with brooms, hoovers and wires, claiming they were possessed by evil spirits .

But Paralympic rower Captain Nick Beighton, who competed at the London Olympics after losing both his legs in a blast while on a foot patrol in Afghanistan in 2009, praised the programme. The 31-year-old Royal Engineer, now with the Royal School of Military Engineering, said: 'To have the opportunity to try it and to use it and get the latest technology is fabulous for us because it just gives us that freedom to get out and do more things and have greater functionality and more independence, essentially.' Speaking at the military rehabilitation centre at Headley Court in Surrey, the officer who had his right leg blown off through the knee and his left leg above the knee, said: 'As you build your strength up and build you independence up, you obviously want to functionally be at a higher level, and that's what this leg offers.' The 'bionic' leg - made famous by the British Paralympic discus thrower Derek Derenalagi last summer - will be fitted to servicemen and women where clinical conditions indicate is appropriate. Surgeon General Air Marshal Paul Evans said: 'This is a fantastic prosthetic development and has been seen to have proven benefits for certain amputees.

Ben Emmerson QC said: ‘This has all the hallmarks of a situation which is shaping up to be a stain on British justice, with the British government deliberately covering up evidence.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague, who oversees the work of MI6, has signed a public interest immunity (PII) certificate to censor certain details of the case. Coroner Sir Robert Owen must now decide on whether to hold part of the inquest in secret. Mr Litvinenko, said to have been a triple agent on the payroll of MI6 and the Spanish secret service, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair in 2006. He died in a London hospital three weeks later. His widow says he was assassinated on the orders of the Kremlin, and the prime suspects are former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun. They both deny involvement. The Crown Prosecution Service wants to charge Lugovoy, but Russia refuses to extradite him. At yesterday’s hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Hague’s lawyer said he had no choice but to suppress information in the case as disclosure ‘would pose a real risk of serious harm to the public interest’. The nature of the ‘sensitive’ evidence has not been revealed. But Mr Emmerson said the secrecy bid risked the accusation of a cover-up ‘orchestrated by the Kremlin’ in cahoots with Whitehall. Mr Litvinenko, an ex-Russian security service officer, was poisoned by radioactive polonium in London in 2006 . William Hague has tried to exclude sensitive details relating to former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko's ties to MI6, because they could pose a 'risk of serious harm to the public' ‘It is absolutely crucial that the . outcome of this hearing is to scotch once and for all any suggestion . that it is because David Cameron is trying to promote trade with Russia . that he is trying to close down this inquest,’ he said. ‘If the material shows the Russian . state murdered Mr Litvinenko, then obviously that’s not going to be very . helpful in terms of relations with Russia. ‘The British government, like the . Russian government, is conspiring to get this inquest closed down in . exchange for substantial trade interests which we know Mr Cameron is . pursuing.’ Referring to the Prime Minister . putting his arm on the shoulder of Russian President Vladimir Putin . during the London 2012 Olympics, he said: ‘One has to ask what is going . on.’ Likening the situation to a folk . dance, he added: ‘We cannot allow Her Majesty’s Government, by misusing . the PII system, to use this inquest to dance to the Russian tarantella.’ Mr Emmerson called on the Government . to provide more detail on the information it wanted to withhold, to . avoid the ‘frightening prospect’ of proceedings being ‘suborned to the . Russian Federation’. Mr Litvinenko’s death in November 2006 plunged Anglo-Russian diplomatic relations into deep freeze. A fugitive from the Putin regime, the . 43-year-old had for several years been ‘in the employ’ of MI6, with the . Spanish secret service also bankrolling his espionage activities at . MI6’s behest, the court heard. His widow believes the Government failed . to protect her husband. The inquest was due to begin on May 1, but is . likely to be delayed because of the arguments over secrecy. ‘The British government’s position is . untenable,’ Mr Emmerson said. ‘They have no right to say to an . independent judiciary, “You may not investigate these issues”. That . happens in Russia, for sure.’ He warned the coroner that he should not . allow the process to be ‘bogged down by the Government’s attempts to . keep a lid on the truth’. Mrs Litvinenko, who listened intently . throughout proceedings, was ‘extremely disappointed’ by the possible . setback, Mr Emmerson said. He painted a ‘disastrous’ scenario in . which the coroner might be shown the ‘sensitive’ evidence in the case, . and find that although it established the guilt of the Russian state in . the murder, he would be unable to use it in his conclusion of how Mr . Litvinenko died because of the secrecy orders. Alex Bailin QC, for the media, called . Mr Hague’s PII claim ‘extraordinarily broad’. The Government has . ‘neither confirmed nor denied’ that Mr Litvinenko was an MI6 spy. Sir Robert is expected to announce . today whether the Government must shed light on the nature of the . evidence it aims to conceal.","Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by radioactive polonium in 2006 .

A schoolboy dubbed 'the Titch-hiker' after he hitched a lift home from school by riding on the tailbar of a 40-tonne lorry has been named, shamed and turned over to police - by his own parents. Sonny Wilson, 12, said he 'scared himself' when he jumped on the back of the truck and clung on as the . driver then set off unaware of his stowaway passenger. Sonny, from Blackburn, Lancashire, said he didn't expect the vehicle to drive off when he climbed on. The prankster said he tried to jump off when fear set in but the lorry had picked up speed. 'I couldn't get off because it was going so fast,' he said. Today he faced a police grilling after his father David Wilson and mother Karen Brian, both 48, saw the footage on Facebook and called the police. Scroll down for video . Disappointed: Father David Gordon was horrified by the video clip. He didn't finish watching it, but called the police instead . Dangerous: Sonny Wilson rides on the tailbar of the lorry in a terrifying stunt which was filmed and posted on Facebook . Terrifying: Sonny Wilson didn't expect the lorry to drive off when he jumped on the back . Mr Gordon said: 'When I saw the footage I . thought it was a practical joke. I didn't even let it go all the way . through before I was on the phone to the police.' Mrs Brian said she didn't realise the boy in the video was her son. The mother-of-six said: 'Somebody tagged me . into the video on Facebook and as I was watching it I thought what a . stupid thing to do. 'It wasn't until a friend of mine asked if it was Sonny that I put two and two together. 'In that moment I just felt sick to my stomach. 'I made the difficult decision to report it to the police as I just can't stop thinking about what could have happened. 'I want them to take him to the police station and instill the fear of god in him.' Sonny said it was not the first time he had 'lorry surfed' but he is remorseful after his antics turned dangerous. 'I thought it was a laugh and a prank. I just wasn't thinking about the consequences. Named and shamed: Sonny Wilson, 12, was reported to the police by his worried parents. They say they wanted to 'put the fear of God' in him . Danger: As the vehicle climbs uphill on the main road through Blackburn, the boy continues to cling to the back . The youngster, who wore his school uniform during the prank, has been suspended by Our Lady and St John's School for two days. He said: 'I had no idea school would . suspend me, but they said it was because I was representing the school . in my uniform when it happened. 'I did try and contact the people who filmed and posted the video on Facebook and asked them to take it down but they didn't.' Sonny- who nonchalantly gave the thumbs up after . leaping off the back of the truck - was condemned by road safety . officials for the prank which was caught on camera. Footage of the incident was captured by a . front seat passenger in a car travelling behind and the 52-second clip was posted on Facebook. The lorry driver negotiated a major road junction before travelling up hill along a busy road for around half a mile as the boy sat on the tailgate seemingly admiring the view. Eventually . when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy . jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind a cheeky thumbs up . before walking off down the street. The . road which has small shops and terrace houses is one of Blackburn's . busiest approaches, leading towards the M65 and towns including . Accrington and Burnley. Risk: The lorry makes its way past parked cars with other vehicles and a bus passing in the opposite direction . Horror: A bus passes in the opposite direction, left, and the boy then shortly afterwards jumps off, right . Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: 'This is a dangerous and foolish act which could easily result in serious injury or death. 'We urge teenagers not to give into peer pressure or to encourage others to copy this behaviour.' The group who filmed the video can be heard shouting: 'What's he doing the crazy little f*****?' They then add: 'Are you filming it? He must be s****** himself. Look at him. What the f*** is he doing?' The lorry passes a bus, as well as rows of parked cars as he travels at up to 30mph on the street. The . clip with the title 'Only in Blackburn ya find a little kid like this . couldn't believe it funny as f***' has now been shared thousands of . times on the social media website. Suzanne Sourbutts said: 'Silly boy, if that wagon had to brake suddenly God knows what might have happened.' Pauline Emmerson added: 'What if he'd fallen, not so funny if he'd landed underneath a car.' Andrew Tony posted a message saying: 'Saved himself 40p bus fare there..... Bit crazy tho...' Calm: The boy wanders off after jumping off the lorry as if nothing untoward had happened . He added: 'I also hope other young people across Blackburn are not thinking of doing anything so stupid.' A police spokesman said: ""I can confirm we have received calls from the parents of the young boy involved in the lorry surfing footage. ""Their details have been passed to the neighbourhood policing who will be dealing with it from there."" A TNT Express spokesman said: 'TNT .

The father of murdered schoolgirl Tia Sharp is expecting a new child with his partner later this year, he revealed today. Steven Carter's girlfriend Melissa Potter is around 14 weeks pregnant and is due to give birth in mid-December. The 31-year-old said he was told he was going to become a father again a week before his daughter's killer Stuart Hazell went on trial. New start: Tia's father Steven Carter (left) revealed today that he is expecting a baby with his partner Melissa Potter in December. The couple already have a nine-year-old son . Mr Carter, who called for Hazell to hang after he was jailed for life, said that he saw the baby as 'a blessing from Tia'. He told MailOnline: 'We found out we were expecting another baby just before the trial but kept it under wraps because we just wanted to get justice for Tia. Victim: Tia Sharp, 12, who was murdered by Stuart Hazell . 'My family and a few close friends knew before the case got to court - but we wanted to keep it quiet. 'We feel the baby is a blessing from Tia, I know that will sound strange to some people, but it is something for us to look forward to now. 'We will never forget her but I don't think Tia would be happy with us just moping around and this is a chance to move on. 'At the end of this month we have got her birthday and then in August it is the first anniversary, so it is hard.' Mr Carter moved to Moulton, Northamptonshire, from New Addington, south London, after splitting up with Tia's mother Natalie Sharp when she was a baby. He already has an nine-year-old son called Thomas with his long-term partner Melissa and was delighted to learn that she is expecting again. The family have just returned from a short break in Majorca 'to get away from it all' after their harrowing courtroom experience last month. Mr Carter said that later this year he will face the difficult task of redecorating Tia's bedroom for the new baby, although they don't yet know the sex. And the father said that his son gave him a father's day card at the weekend signed from 'Thomas and Tia'. Mr Carter added: 'The card said love from Thomas and Tia. He said he knew Tia couldn't write it herself so he had to write it for her. 'He asks a lot of questions about Tia and I have hundreds of pictures of them together, so it is very hard.' Justice: Tia's father Steven Carter (right) reacts outside court after Stuart Hazell (left) was jailed for life . Mr Carter was in the public gallery for the first week of Hazell's trial at the Old Bailey in May before the killer dramatically changed his plea to guilty. Hazell, the 37-year-old cannabis-smoking boyfriend of Tia’s grandmother Christine Bicknell, had insisted for nine months that Tia’s death was a ‘tragic accident’. The father-of-one claimed she slipped and broke her neck while he was babysitting her at the home he shared with Miss Bicknell. He said he panicked, wrapped the body in sheets and hid it in the loft where it was discovered by police during their fourth search. Anguish: Tia's father Steven looks at flowers left for his daughter near her home in south London after she was murdered last summer . Steven Carter broke down in tears when Hazell finally confessed to the murder. In an impassioned statement outside the court, he called for the killer to face the death penalty. ‘The . four days of trial here were very hard to deal with, hearing the vile . things Hazell did to Tia,' he said. 'He should serve his time and then be hung. I do not see today’s events as justice for Tia, merely a legal conviction.’ Mr Carter said he is furious that Hazell is planning to appeal against his 38-year prison sentence. 'I go out to work and pay my taxes for Hazell to sit in his prison cell where he is protected. The whole situation is unbelievable,' he added.","Tia's father told days before killer went on trial that he would be a dad again .

Retail guru Mary Portas has demanded showdown talks with Prime Minister David Cameron after accusing the Government of merely 'paying lip service' to the idea of saving Britain's ailing high streets. Self-styled Queen of Shops Ms Portas has demanded a meeting with Mr Cameron after she was left 'utterly deflated' by the decision to allow a new Tesco superstore to be built in Margate, Kent, which was one of her 12 'Portas Pilot' towns. Ms Portas, who was hired by David . Cameron in 2011 to find ways to rescue dying town centres like Margate, . described the decision to allow the Tesco to be built as ‘a very sad . day’.

Ms Portas hit out at Mr Pickles who she claims didn't even respond to her opposition to the new store in the seaside town.

Angelina Jolie's stunt double is suing Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation for allegedly hacking into her voicemail and deleting messages, it emerged today. Eunice Huthart is the first alleged victim of hacking to launch a legal claim against the Murdoch empire in the U.S. The British 46-year-old, who won the first series of TV game show Gladiators, claims The Sun and the News of the World hacked her phone in an attempt to gather gossip about Ms Jolie. Claim: Eunice Huthart, left, who was the stunt double for Angeline Jolie, right, is suing News Corporation . News International, the British arm of News Corp, has already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to celebrities and other public figures who were hacked by the News of the World. However, Ms Huthart is the first person to have sought justice through the American courts, which could cause major difficulties for Mr Murdoch ahead of a planned break-up of News Corp into entertainment and publishing divisions. The stuntwoman claims that News International papers used information found on her voicemail to uncover Ms Jolie's relationship with co-star Brad Pitt during the filming of 2005 hit Mr & Mrs Smith. Ms Huthart's complaint against News Corp is detailed in court papers filed in Los Angeles on Friday. The claims dates back to 2004 and 2005, when she was apparently living with Ms Jolie - she says the pair were close friends who 'travelled and socialised together' as well as being colleagues on film sets. Working together: Ms Huthart and Ms Jolie together on the set of 2010 spy thriller Salt . Ms Huthart worked as the actress' stunt double on Tomb Raider 2 and Beyond Borders as well as Mr & Mrs Smith. Around the time covered by the complaint, the Sun and the News of the World, which closed down in 2011 after revelations of widespread hacking at the title came to light, ran a number of stories on the burgeoning romance between Ms Jolie and Mr Pitt. The stuntwoman claims that the source of many of the stories was her voicemail, as 'no one except Brad Pitt's bodyguard, Ms Jolie's bodyguard, their respective personal assistants and Plaintiff knew that Brad Pitt and Ms Jolie were now an ""item""'. The court papers also allege that Ms Huthart missed a number of deleted messages from colleagues and family members, leading to inconvenience and emotional distress. Among the messages from Ms Jolie which Ms Huthart never received were apparently 'hotel arrangements where she was staying, code names for hotels and individuals, dinner reservations, meet-up times and, on occasion, when she sought the help of Plaintiff during times of need'. Troubles: The claim is the first hacking case Rupert Murdoch's media empire has faced in the U.S. Ms Huthart, from Liverpool, rose to prominence in the UK when she won the first series of Gladiators. She later joined the cast of the show under the pseudonym 'Blaze'. As well as doubling for Ms Jolie, she has appeared in blockbusters such as Titanic and GoldenEye. News Corp has so far refused to comment on the allegations. The company has repeatedly denied that hacking took place at the Sun. The phone-hacking scandal came to light in 2001, when it was emerged that the News of the World had hacked into the voicemail of murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler. The Sunday newspaper was closed down by Mr Murdoch, and the company has since paid out more than £200million in compensation and legal expenses related to the victims of hacking. A number of former News International executives are currently facing trial for hacking-related offences. News Corp is set to be divided into its profitable film and television division, to be named 20th Century Fox, and the struggling print business, which will keep the News Corporation name.

Met Office experts who got together to discuss recent unusual weather patterns predicted yesterday that Britain faces a decade of wet summers.

However, all is not lost as while these influence the odds of wet summers, it doesn’t rule out the possibility of bouts of sunshine and fine weather over the next few years  - starting with tomorrow, when Britain is expected to bask in its hottest day of the year.

Professor Stephen Belcher, Head of the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of the meeting, said: 'Ultimately what we’ve seen in each of these seasons is shifts in the position of the jet stream which impact our weather in certain ways at different times of year. 'The key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way? There is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain states of the jet stream, but this loading may be further amplified by climate change.' Brendan Jones, senior forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, . said tomorrow's warm weather was being carried by warm air coming up from the . Continent, with Germany, France and the Low Countries seeing . temperatures soar past 30C (86F) in the past few days. 'It does look as if today and tomorrow are going to be very warm,' he said.

Weather and climate experts from across the UK went to the Met Office’s HQ in Exeter today for a workshop to discuss the recent run of unusual seasons in Europe. A total of 25 delegates attended including representatives from the Universities of Exeter, Leeds, Oxford, Reading and Imperial College London, as well as the Met Office. Workshops of this kind are held on a regular basis on a great deal of issues across weather and climate science. Today’s included sessions which looked at the strange weather patterns and their potential causes in three recent seasons – the cold winter of 2010/11, the wet summer of 2012, and this year’s cold spring. Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of the meeting, said: 'Ultimately what we’ve seen in each of these seasons is shifts in the position of the jet stream which impact our weather in certain ways at different times of year. 'The key question is what is causing the jet stream to shift in this way? 'There is some research to say some parts of the natural system load the dice to influence certain the jet stream, but this loading may be further amplified by climate change.' There are a number of possible factors which could be ‘loading the dice’, including declining Arctic sea ice, solar variability and long-term ocean cycles. The workshop focused on the latest research looking at how these drivers can influence weather patterns and discussed future research can be targeted to push forward understanding in this area. There are a wide range of factors that could be causing the cold winters such as changes in the Arctic climate. Dr James Screen, from the University of Exeter, said: 'There has been a lot of talk about declining Arctic sea ice playing a role in our weather patterns, but really that’s just one aspect of changes in the Arctic climate – which has seen rapid warming compared to other parts of the world. 'Those changes mean there is less of a difference in temperature between the Arctic and tropics, which could impact the position of the jet stream.' Another driver of colder winter weather has already been identified and is known as Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs). Recent research in this area has meant the Met Office was able to give good advice up to a month ahead on cold spells in recent seasons when they have been driven by this phenomenon. Professor Belcher said: 'This workshop has looked at some really cutting edge research and helped us identify key areas for future work to improve our understanding of potential drivers of some of the unusual seasons we have seen. 'This work will help us continue our work to push forward understanding in this area so we can give better forecasts and advice on longer timescales in the future.'Source: Met Office .","Six out of the last seven UK summers have seen above average rainfall .

A farm field overlooking the York River in Tidewater, Virginia, is believed to be where Pocahontas interceded with her powerful father Powhatan to rescue Captain John Smith from death. The story goes that just as the great chief lifted his war club to carry out the execution, his young daughter laid her head on the English explorer's to protect him. But that's a fanciful footnote for many Virginia Indians, historians and archaeologists, who say the real story is that this land was the centre of a complex, sprawling empire ruled by Powhatan long before the first permanent English settlement on American soil was founded in 1607. It was called Werowocomoco, which roughly translates to a 'place of chiefs.' Pocahontas Saving the Life of Captain John Smith: This image provided by the Library of Congress illustrates the tale of the Native American princess. Archaeologists say they have found the capital of her father's empire . 'This is like our Washington,' said Kevin Brown, chief of the Pamunkey tribe. 'History didn't begin in 1607 and there are a lot of people who overlook that.' On loan to archaeologists for more than a decade, these 57 privately owned acres will be preserved forever under an agreement years in the making and to be officially announced on Friday. The deal is important for Native . Americans because they believe their story has been overshadowed for . centuries by the narrative of Captain Smith and his fellow Europeans. In a departure from past digs . involving native sites, archaeologists sought the counsel of Indian . leaders before and during the exploration, honouring their wishes that . burial grounds not be disturbed and helping interpret what was . discovered. Legendary figure: A portrait of Pocahontas, who converted to Christianity after she was captured by the English and married a settler . For Ashley Atkins, a College of William & Mary doctoral candidate who has worked at the site since 2005, 'recovering things out of the ground' was secondary to working with her fellow Pamunkey. 'Unfortunately, native people in the past have had no involvement at all in the way that their history has been investigated, uncovered and presented to the public,' said Ms Atkins, who is 28. 'Most people would think, ""They wouldn't be involved in uncovering your own history?"" But the reality is that has not been the common practice.' Jeff Brown, a Pamunkey and Kevin . Brown's brother, worked at the site for years. He recalled Indians . visiting the sweeping expanse overlooking the York River and being . overcome. 'It gets emotional,' he said. 'And when you're digging you can really feel it.' Martin Gallivan, a William & Mary anthropologist, said the involvement of native people 'enhanced the project immensely.' Only . a fraction of Werewocomoco has been explored, perhaps just 2 per cent. After decades of research, archaeologists used the writings of Captain . Smith and others, ancient maps and their own detective work to conclude . with near-certainty that this was Powhatan's seat of power. It was just 15 miles from Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement established in the New World. Powhatan's . powerful  chiefdom covered 30 political divisions and a population of 15,000 to . 20,000 people, while nearby Jamestown settlers struggled to survive in their new environment. Excavations have yielded the outline . of the largest longhouse ever found in Virginia and a system of ditches . that may have separated sacred and secular areas. 'Emotional': Pamunkey Indian Jeff Brown, left, with Randolph Turner, retired state archaeologist, centre, and Martin Gallivan, College of William professor, right, who have all worked on the excavation of the site . Randolph Turner, a retired state archaeologist whose hunt for Werewocomoco dates to the Seventies, said Powhatan's empire was 'one of the most complex political entities in all of eastern North America.' The leader 'had the power of life and death' and expanded his empire through warfare or the threat of warfare. 'He's one of the most interesting political and military figures that I've ever read about,' Mr Turner said. 'And we're just getting hints in the historical records of all he accomplished in his lifetime.' Spiritual: Mr Brown, whose brother is chief of the Pamunkey tribe, helped with the excavations. In a departure from past digs at native sites, archaeologists sought the counsel of Indian leaders . Retelling an untold story: Professor Gallivan gestures as he walks the site, which was discovered by chance by the landowner when she found arrowheads and fragments of pipes while out walking her dog . 'One of the most complex political entities in all of eastern North America': Mr Turner, centre, said Powhatan is one of the most interesting political and military figures that he has ever read about . The discovery of Werewocomoco can be credited to a pure-bred dog belonging to the land's owners, Lynn and Robert Ripley. Lynn . Ripley used to walk around their land with her Chesapeake Bay . Retriever, an American Kennel Club competitor named Mobjack Rhett Master . Hunter. She would remove debris that could cut her dog's paws, and . found arrowheads, spear tips, pipe stems and pottery shards. 'I . just seemed to have an eye for it,' she said. 'That's how it all began, . so our dog wouldn't cut his feet. It's like we were meant to be there . and I was meant to find these things.' The clincher was the discovery of copper, which was valued by the Indians as gold is today. 'I am absolutely convinced this is Werewocomoco,' Mr Turner said. 'It makes no sense for it to be anywhere else.' That conclusion is supported by the U.S. Park Service, William & Mary, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources and the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities. Virginia Indians hope work at the site will continue to build on what is known about Powhatan and the centuries before him, dispelling myths about what the first European settlers found when they arrived. 'I want people to understand there was a real civilisation, a complex cultural community that existed prior to European colonisation,' Ms Atkins said. 'Europeans didn't bring civilisation. They brought a lot of other things, some good, some bad.' Kathleen Kilpatrick, executive director of the state's historic resources agency, said the site 'certainly tells an aspect of a story that often goes untold. In tangible ways, it is their Jamestown.' Digging up the hidden past: This June 26, 2003 photo provided by the . Werowocomoco Research Group shows students hard at work excavating the . site, where among other things they discovered the outline of the . largest longhouse ever found in Virginia and a system of ditches that . may have separated sacred and secular areas . The preservation will be commemorated on Friday at a ceremony with Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and Indian leaders. An easement will ensure the site remains undeveloped and open to future exploration. It is part of more than 250 acres owned by the Ripleys, who have lived there for nearly 17 years. When Ms Kilpatrick approached them with the idea of preserving the site, 'We decided it really is the best thing,' Robert Ripley said. 'If we do nothing else for Virginia Indians, we've done the very best because we have preserved it for all time with an entity that has the power to enforce its easement: the state of Virginia,' he said. Mrs Ripley said, 'It's their heritage, their history. We felt a huge responsibility to protect it.' She hopes her collection of artifacts can be displayed someday in a museum on the site. Centuries after Powhatan ruled, she added, this place still resonates with what it once was. 'It's definitely a sacred place,' she said. 'It's serene, it's spiritual, it's beautiful. I feel very good about what we've done.'","Excavation was the first to be carried out with the counsel of Indian leaders .

Skills: Some 97 per cent of university admissions officers said they prized candidates capable of producing good written English above those who show a passion for their course or evidence they can work independently . The ability to spell correctly and string sentences together is the most important quality students need to get into university after exam results, a survey reveals. Some 97 per cent of university admissions officers said they prized candidates capable of producing good written English above those who show a passion for their course or evidence they can think and work independently. Nearly half said having a reasonable grasp of maths was a key factor in offering them a place. Neither English nor maths featured when the survey was first carried out in 2007. The . findings follow a dramatic slump in the standard of both subjects among . undergraduates that has led to complaints by academics. Six . in ten academics are now providing remedial classes for first year . students because they arrive so poorly prepared for the demands of . higher education. Most involve basic lessons in writing skills to improve spelling and grammar and teach essay structure. More . than two-fifths of employers have also reported having to teach . school-leavers and college graduates English, maths and IT to bring them . up to the standard required to function in the workplace. Former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy described school standards as 'woeful' in 2009 - the same year that Sir Stuart Rose, then chief of Marks & Spencer, said many school leavers were not 'fit for work'. Spending on education doubled from £35.8 billion to £71 billion between 2000 and 2011, during which Britain plummeted down world rankings according to the respected Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The UK slipped from 8th to 28th in maths, seventh to 25th in reading and fourth to 16th in science, leaving it behind relatively poor nations like Estonia and Slovakia. Below par: Both former Tesco chief Sir Terry Leahy, left, and ex-M&S boss Sir Stuart Rose, right, criticised school standards in 2009 . Education Secretary Michael Gove is . introducing a new National Curriculum with tougher exams in an attempt . to drive up standards after years of grade inflation caused by exam . boards offering increasingly easy qualifications that flattered schools' achievements. The survey of . university admissions officers found 88 per cent looked for students . who show a passion for their chosen course, 83 per cent liked to see a . positive attitude towards study and 72 per cent valued an ability to . work independently. Just 35 . per cent were concerned about evidence of overcoming a difficult . background - suggesting a resistance to social engineering which has . seen universities being told to accept more disadvantaged students. Less . than a third expressed a particular interest in teenagers who had held . positions of responsibility or undertaken work experience. Excellence in sport or involvement in community or voluntary services did not make the top ten of desirable attributes. New measures: Education Secretary Michael Gove is introducing a new National Curriculum with tougher exams in an attempt to drive up standards after years of grade inflation . Jeremy Lewis of ACS International Schools, which spoke to 80 admissions officers in the UK and 20 in the U.S. for the study, said: 'Students spend an age crafting their personal statements, so it's useful to see exactly which attributes really hit the mark with admissions teams. 'Much seems to boil down to an ability to communicate their passion and a drive to work hard, though it's interesting to see the very strong emphasis placed on good written English, suggesting perhaps this is not always a given.' Two thirds of admissions officers also said the International Baccalaureate Diploma was best for preparing people for university, compared to 25 per cent for A-levels - indicating the gold standard exam has lost its lustre. Meanwhile, another survey found children are familiar with IT jargon that is 'completely alien' to most adults. Nine in ten children aged seven to 14 knew HTML stands for 'HyperText Markup Language' and three-quarters correctly said URL stands for 'Uniform Resource Locator', according to research by exam revision service Education Quizzes. Yet half couldn't say who invaded England in 1066 and 44 per cent didn't know which century the Second World War took place in.","A survey of admissions officers found they prize good written English .

When Jeremy and Kathryn Medlen got a call from a local shelter saying their beloved dog, Avery, was found safe, they were overjoyed. The dog had run off from their Fort Worth, Texas property a few days earlier during a thunderstorm in 2009. But when Mr Medlen went to the pound with their two young children, they received the heartbreaking news - Avery had been mistakenly euthanized. Best friend: Avery was a beloved member of the Medlen family before being accidentally euthanized . One of the family: Jeremy Medlen and wife Kathryn share a hug with Avery . 'They were told they accidentally killed him the day before,"" Medlen's attorney, Randy Turner, told ABC News. The shelter, Forth Worth Animal Control, had properly labeled Avery's cage as 'Hold for owner' but a worker there still put the mixed-breed dog down. 'She went through and picked the dogs that needed to be euthanized and accidentally picked Avery,' said Turner. That's when the family decided to bring its lawsuit, charging negligence against the shelter and the worker, Carla Strickland. Texas state law includes a 1963 rule that allows people to sue for the sentimental value of property even if there is no monetary value on the open market. The rule has previously been applied to irreplaceable photographs or family heirlooms, but never to  a family pet. Ms Strickland's lawyer, John Cayce, said she instantly felt terrible after learning about her tragic mistake. ""Ms. Strickland, from day one, has been devastated by the unfortunate accident that occurred that led to Avery's death,"" Cayce said. During Thursday's argument before the Texas Supreme Court, a lawyer representing the shelter said it was impossible to assign value to a pet. ""My dog may be worth $1 million to me — should that much money go to an owner for pain and suffering?"" asked Elizabeth Choate, the general counsel of the Texas Veterinary Medical Association, according to the Wall Street Journal. A decision in the case is not expected for several weeks.","Shelter called Texas family to say their runaway dog, Avery, had been found safely and was waiting for them .

Britain's internet giants have agreed to put extra money into the fight against sickening child abuse images – but are refusing to install automatic filters that would force users to ‘opt in’ to online pornography. At a Westminster summit, the top four internet service providers pledged an additional £1million over four years to the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity which works to remove indecent images from the web. Firms including BT, TalkTalk, Facebook and Google signed a ‘zero tolerance’ agreement on child abuse images at the summit, hailed by Culture Secretary Maria Miller as a triumph. Web firms have come under scrutiny after recent high profile murders. Stuart Hazell had visited child abuse sites before the attack on Tia Sharp . But critics said the agreement was toothless, and the summit had taken no real action on protecting children from stumbling across pornographic images. Attendees at the summit – which despite apparently being a Number 10 priority was held while David Cameron was at the G8 summit – agreed to meet again in the autumn to discuss progress. Web firms have come under scrutiny in recent months following the convictions of Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell for the murders of five-year-old April Jones and 12-year- old Tia Sharp. Both men had visited child abuse sites before the attacks. Last night the parents of both children called for more action to tackle child porn. The Daily Mail has campaigned for opt-in filters which would force computer users to indicate they wish to have access  to pornography. April’s mother, Coral Jones, said: ‘I just want it stopped and I think the Government should put more pressure and get it done now.’ Tia’s father, Steven Carter, said: ‘You’re fuelling the beast and it needs to be stopped – it should have been stopped a long time ago when these people were setting up companies.’ The companies which attended the summit in the Houses of Parliament were Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, BT, BSkyB, Virgin Media, TalkTalk, Vodafone, O2, EE and Three. The internet service providers (ISPs) signed up to a new approach, which will involve working more closely with the police to seek out and block images of child abuse. The £1million funding – on top of £1million pledged by Google last week – will allow the foundation to seek out images of child abuse rather than just responding when they receive a complaint. The money will also help  intensify its work with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), which prosecutes abusers. In addition, the ISPs agreed to introduce ‘splash’ pages by the end of the month. This will mean that if someone seeks to access a page of illegal images that has been blocked, a warning message will tell the user they have tried to access indecent or illegal content. The internet service providers (ISPs) signed up to a new approach, which will involve working more closely with the police to seek out and block images of child abuse . Mrs Miller said: ‘The abuse of children is absolutely abhorrent – and that child is further violated every single time an image is circulated and viewed. The IWF and CEOP already do important and valuable work. ‘This agreement will mean these organisations will no longer be limited to reacting to reports received.’  Labour media spokesman Helen Goodman said: ‘I would describe this as a total damp squib. They seem to have agreed an expansion of the IWF and an extra £1million. They have not even begun to get to grips with our call for action on web filters to protect children. I feel disappointed and frustrated.’ A statement released by the four largest ISPs – BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media – said the extra £1million would be spread out over four years. ‘This additional funding will supplement the existing zero-tolerance approach to child abuse material online,’ they said.Scott Rubin, director of public affairs at Google, said: ‘We have a zero tolerance attitude to child sexual abuse imagery online. ‘The fight to remove these images from the internet is a global one, and we hope these measures will help in that important battle.’","The internet providers signed up to an approach which will involve working more closely with the police to seek out and block images of child abuse .

He allegedly did become violent when . police quizzed him over links to Tamerlan Tsarnaev and an unsolved 2011 . triple homicide but he did not have a knife as previously claimed. 'Today I want justice. I want an investigation, so that these people (the FBI) are sued under US laws,' he said. 'These are not FBI agents. These are bandits and they must appear in court.'

It is known Tamerlan Tsarnaev was close friends with one of the victims and the FBI have been looking into whether he was involved. Law enforcement sources told NBC that Todashev and Tsarnaev carried out the 2011 killings when a drug deal that turned violent. The suspects didn't want the three victims to be able to identify them, so they slit their throats, according to the network.

A judge described a graffiti gang who caused £150,000 worth of damage in planned attacks on trains as 'talented artists', as he locked them up for a combined total of almost four years. Keiron Cummings, 21, Alex Rowe, 22, and Billy McColl, 17, targeted train and tube carriages across London in a three-year campaign described as vandalism on 'an industrial scale'. The trio, who called themselves 'SMT', caused huge disruption to train services by spraying their tag onto carriages under cover of darkness. But Judge Henry Blacksell said the defendants had 'got talent', and that he would pass the 'least possible' sentence. Keiron Cummings, 21, of Ruislip . Billy McColl, 17, of South Ruislip . Alex Rowe, 22, of Milton Keynes . After vandalising trains the gang members would brag about the damage they had caused by posting pictures and videos of their handiwork online, Blackfriars Crown Court was told. Prosecutor Jacques Howell said Cummings even had a map of the capital's rail network in his bedroom pin-pointing the raids, with the words 'you need all this and more' written above it. 'This was a planned and prolonged campaign of damage to property of an almost industrial scale, and caused considerable cost and disruption to London Underground and national rail services,' he said. 'It's not simply tagging with marker pens. The scale we are talking about is the entire carriage being daubed. 'The aim is obviously to get kudos amongst the graffiti community,' Mr Howell added. The trio were caught after British Transport Police officers launched an investigation to try and stop a huge increase in graffiti with the SMT tag. They were caught three times carrying paint, face masks and gloves between January and June at stations in Northwood, Watford and Ealing before they were remanded in custody. Examining a dossier of Rowe's work, Judge Henry Blacksell said that, while he understood public frustration at the damage caused by the vandals, he did not want to jail them. He said: 'I will pass the least possible sentence. These are young men and people care about them. Judge Henry Blacksell: The judge said that while he did not condone the defendants' actions, he understood the 'adrenaline rush' it gave them . 'I don't endorse it but I understand the adrenaline rush and the feeling it gives them and they may be isolated in their families. 'I don't want to be doing this and I will by as lenient as I can be. They've got talent and some of Mr Rowe's portfolio you would be proud of. 'Clearly they are talented artists,' the judge added. But Judge Blacksell said the least possible sentence would still mean prison for the trio, who all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit criminal damage. He said: 'This is a course of conduct which is all too prevalent in our society as well as abroad and is dealt with by people who no doubt have talent. 'Sadly it's often young men who in other areas of their lives feel isolated or inadequate. 'Taking trains out of service affects people who are trying to live their ordinary lives, disrupting them in ways you probably don't understand. 'It's often said by those who carry it out that this is a victimless crime but it is not. 'It's all very unfortunate because you are young men and it's a waste of your lives.'

Knifeman: Sammie Lamont Wallace was shot dead after taking a two-year-old girl hostage in Walmart . A desperate knife-wielding man was shot and killed by police after he grabbed a stranger's two-year-old daughter from a Walmart shopping cart in Midwest City, Oklahoma. For a tense half hour police tried to reason with the man, but as he started a countdown to killing the child while holding a knife to her, police shot him. Sammie Lamont Wallace, who was demanding to be able to see his own children, was still clutching the child when police took him out at the Oklahoma store on Monday. The terrifying ordeal started when Wallace, 37, grabbed the child at random from a shopping cart at about 3pm, when the store was full of shoppers. As he held a knife to the child, he yelled that he wanted the mother to call his attorney so he could see his children. Donita Owens, who was shopping one aisle away when the child was grabbed, said: 'I heard a lady start screaming, ""please help me, he's got my baby, he's got my baby, please help me"".' 'He's basically saying things like, he wants to see his kids, he wants his kids too.  He just wants to go home to see his family, he has nothing to live for, nothing to lose,' she told News9.

Concerned: Mr Milburn, the Government¿s independent reviewer on social mobility, accused medicine and other professions of failing to attract disadvantaged students . Youngsters from poorer backgrounds should be given plum jobs in the professions over those who went to private schools, the Government’s social mobility tsar said yesterday. Former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn also suggested that companies recruiting for such roles should be made to publish audits of where their employees went to school. This would shame them into offering the jobs to those who went to state schools. Mr Milburn said the professions were still a ‘closed shop’ dominated by the elite classes. ‘Kids from disadvantaged backgrounds... with no family history in a profession, should get a fair crack of the whip,’ he said. ‘If you have been a child from a really good school in a disadvantaged area, from a family with no history of university education, [who] managed to get two As and a B, you have worked pretty hard for it. I am not saying if you have gone to Eton and you get three A*s you have not had to work hard, but there is a difference.’ However, senior Tory MP David Davis said the decline in social mobility and employment prospects for poorer youngsters was at least partly due to the widening gulf between the quality of education at state and independent schools. He said the last Labour government, of which Mr Milburn was a leading member, had a ‘lot to answer for’ with respect to that division. Must try harder: Mr Milburn says the medical . profession has failed to make any great galvanising effort to open up . doors to disadvantaged students . Mr Davis added: ‘There is a strong link between the demolition of grammar schools and the decline in social mobility. Only one in five children regardless of their background were able to go to grammar schools but that is better than nothing.’ With an extra 1.2million white collar roles expected to be created in the next decade, Mr Milburn insisted no one should be ‘thrown out of a job’ to accommodate disadvantaged candidates. But he added that those from privileged backgrounds had to remember ‘there are no guarantees in life’. He said social background audits could work because ‘rather like a race and gender issue, when you find a spotlight in that way and you have the data available, people will be pretty horrified by what they see’. David Davis said the decline was due to the widening gap between state and social mobility . Managers would ask their staff what sort of school they went to, what their parents’ background was and whether they received benefits or free school meals. Mr Milburn warned in a report, Fair Access to Professional Careers, that the next generation of young professionals was becoming a ‘mirror image’ of the privileged elite that had gone before. The report showed that 41 per cent of law undergraduates, 57 per cent of medical students and 49 per cent of journalism students came from ‘the highest socio-economic groups’. Mr Milburn said: ‘This is social engineering on a grand scale. The senior ranks of our professions are a closed shop. If social mobility is to become anything other than a pipe dream, they will have to open up.’ The report also found that children who attend the best schools were overwhelmingly most likely to get into top universities, which puts them at the front of the queue for plum jobs. Mr Milburn, the independent reviewer on social mobility, said some middle-class graduates were also locked out of the job market and internships because their families did not have ‘the right connections’. He dismissed suggestions that the decline of grammar schools under his government had made social mobility worse, saying that they only helped ‘a few’ pupils.",Alan Milburn says firms would be shamed into giving roles to those from state schools .

The latest FBI attempt to find Jimmy Hoffa has ended in yet another dead end. Authorities announced today that they are calling off the excavation of a field in Oakland Township, Michigan, that was once owned by a reputed Michigan mob boss. An aging former mob boss told federal agents that Hoffa was buried in a shallow grave under a concrete slab in the field after he was murdered in 1975. The agents found the slab, but not Hoffa's remains. The government has followed up on some 15 credible leads as to the whereabouts of the once-powerful union leader, but his final resting place remains a mystery. CNN estimates the search has cost taxpayers $3million in the last four decades. 'We did not uncover any evidence relevant to the investigation on James Hoffa,' said Robert Foley, head of the FBI in Detroit. Scroll down for video . g . Law enforcement officials help search the area in Oakland Township, Michigan on Tuesday where they believe the remains of Teamsters union president Jimmy Hoffa might be buried . Agents uncovered concrete slabs from a field where they have been digging. They believe the slabs may belong to the foundation of a barn that once stood on the property, under which Hoffa may have been buried . 'I am very confident of our result . here after two-days-plus of diligent effort. As of this point, we'll be . closing down the excavation operation.' Previous searches have included the . suburban Detroit home a former mob enforcer and an eastern Michigan . horse farm and a backyard swimming pool. It has also been claimed . Hoffa's remains are entombed beneath the former Giants Stadium in New . Jersey and beneath the headquarters of General Motors. All investigations into Hoffa's whereabouts have turned out to be both costly and fruitless. The feds had high hopes for this dig. The source of the tip was Tony Zerilli, an 85-year-old former mobster who said he was told the location of Hoffa's body by a hitman who claimed to have killed him. 'The bureau had a short list of . people they wanted to talk to about that and I can’t think of anybody on . that list who was more highly placed then Anthony Zerilli,' former U.S. Attorney Keith Corbett told WDIV-TV in January. 'This is certainly the . most interesting and attractive lead that has come up since I’ve been . involved with this - and I think the bureau would react the same way.' But, officials came up short again. Full-scale: FBI agents have set up shop in a field that was once owned by a top mafia figure. They believe Jimmy Hoffa could be buried in a shallow grave here . Search: Federal agents can be seen cutting down the tall grass in the field where they were told Hoffa's remains are buried . Full force: Dozens of cars line the grassy field where FBI agents began searching for Hoffa's body . 'Certainly, we're disappointed,' FBI head Foley told reporters Wednesday. He said about 40 agents were involved . in an operation that covered about an acre. The FBI has not put a cost . on the search, but Foley said it's more important to solve a case. 'With any investigation we consider . cost-benefits analysis,' he said. 'The FBI and its partners are no . corporations. We do not have a profit margin as a bottom line.' CNN estimates that search for Hoffa has cost taxpayers $3million over the years. Hoffa's rise in the Teamsters, his . 1964 conviction for jury tampering and his presumed murder are Detroit's . link to a time when organized crime, public corruption and mob hits . held the nation's attention. Over the years, authorities have received . various tips, leading the FBI to possible burial sites near and far. In 2003, a backyard swimming pool was . dug up 90 miles northwest of Detroit. Seven years ago, a tip from an . ailing federal inmate led to a two-week search and excavation at a horse . farm in the same region. Last year, soil samples were taken from under . the concrete floor of a backyard shed north of the city. And detectives . even pulled up floorboards at a Detroit house in 2004. Hunt for Hoffa: The field where FBI agents are searching is 20 miles north of the suburban Detroit restaurant where he was last seen in 1975 . Other theories have suggested he was . entombed in concrete at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, ground up and . thrown in a Florida swamp or obliterated in a mob-owned fat-rendering . plant. The excavation site was 20 miles north of the restaurant where Hoffa was last seen in July 1975. Zerilli, 85, has said Hoffa was murdered by mobsters who dumped his body in a shallow grave. The property was owned in 1975 by . Jack Tocco, Zerilli's cousin, who reportedly became head of the Detroit . mafia after Hoffa vanished. A house and barn used to stand on the land, though both building were later torn down. Zerilli . says Hoffa was taken to the property after meeting with two organized . crime figures at the Macus Red Fox Restaurant in Bloomfield Hills, . Michigan. The mob insider said he was told by a mob enforcer that Hoffa, 62, was executed on the property and then buried. Mob royalty: Tony Zerilli, 85, was the second in command of the Detroit mafia before he was indicted and sent to prison. Now, he says, he's 'dead broke' Turncoat? Zerilli, seen here in his federal prison photo, has told the FBI to look on property once owned by his cousin, who was the head of the Detroit mafia . The mafia initially planned to move the body to a hunting lodge upstate, but police pressure became so intense after Hoffa's disappearance that 'once he was buried here he was buried and they let it go,' Zerilli told WDIV in an interview in January. Zerilli and his cousin Tocco, led the organized crime families in Detroit until 1996, when both were indicted on racketeering charges. He was sent to prison in 2002 and released in 2008. 'Clearly . when he returned [from prison] he would’ve been a person, based on his position in . the hierarchy, who would have been able to learn the facts and . circumstances surrounding the disappearance of James Earl Hoffa,' said . Corbett. Despite being mob royalty, Zerilli says he is now 'dead broke.' When he went to Tocco and asked for money, he said, Tocco refused. Now, Zerilli is writing a book about the Detroit Partnership - the Motor City's mafia. Fanning out: Federal agents spread out across the property. There is no telling how much of the field they will have to excavate . It's unknown how long the FBI will have to search the property to determine whether or not Hoffa is buried there .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Ian Drury . PUBLISHED: . 05:13 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:07 EST, 18 June 2013 . Thousands of soldiers – including some recently back from action in Afghanistan – were axed yesterday. As almost 4,500 service personnel received redundancy letters, the head of the Army admitted the biggest round of defence cuts yet was straining morale. Only troops recuperating from a serious injury or preparing for, serving on or recovering from operations were exempt from the cuts. Cuts: A total of 4,480 soldiers have been told their job is being axed under deep cuts to the army . But soldiers who were serving on the battlefield as recently as last month could find themselves booted out of the military. But the government was accused of a . 'failed strategy' as it launched a recruitment drive to find 10,000 . extra troops, many as reservists. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond yesterday insisted there will be no further reductions in manpower in the next round of spending cuts for 2015-16. The latest tranche of 4,480 job cuts was lower than the 5,300 soldiers expected, as Mr Hammond sought to blame the last Labour government for the reductions. He said: ‘It is with great regret that we have had to make redundancies to deliver the reduction in the size of the armed forces, but unfortunately they were unavoidable due to the size of the defence deficit that this Government inherited. Cuts: By 2018 there will be 82,000 regulars and 30,000 reservists in the Army, under government plans . ‘Although smaller, our armed forces will be more flexible and agile to reflect the challenges of the future with the protection and equipment they need. ‘They will continue to be the bedrock of our society and provide extremely rewarding and exciting careers for future recruits.’ The MoD said personnel selected for redundancy would be told face to face by their commanding officer. It said it had done everything to avoid ‘non-applicant’ redundancies, and 84% of those losing their jobs in the latest tranche had applied for redundancy. Those who applied for voluntary redundancy will leave on or before December 17 this year, and those who did not will leave on or before June 17 2014. Soldiers who did not apply and are currently serving, preparing for or recovering from operations where they receive an operational allowance, such as Afghanistan, are exempt, as are those recovering from serious injuries sustained on operations. The MoD said the Army will need to make further reductions to reach its final target of 82,000, likely to involve a further tranche for Army personnel, and a small number of medical and dental personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Chief of the General Staff General Sir Peter Wall said: ‘This redundancy scheme is a difficult but essential step towards our A2020 structure. We owe our sincere gratitude to those leaving the Army for their service over such a demanding period of operations. ‘We will support them and their families as best we can on their path to civilian life. Meanwhile we continue to need plenty of young and talented recruits to ensure the Army is fit to meet the challenges of the future.’ Today’s losses are the third instalment of job cuts arising from the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and confined to the Army. Last week, David Cameron was forced to respond to fears raised by military top brass over defence cuts, after General Sir Peter Wall said any gap between military resources and planned capabilities caused by spending cuts ‘could become quite dangerous, quite quickly’. But Mr Cameron insisted that Britain’s forces are among the best-funded in the world , saying that ‘difficult decisions’ were being taken under the coalition’s austerity programme and no department is immune from making savings. The latest round of cuts come after the Army launched a recruitment drive last month to help find 10,000 personnel, with a television campaign and Army jobs advertised in job centres. Reservists: Labour accused the government of pursuing a 'failed strategy' which failed to replace sacked regulars with enough reservists to ensure Britain's military capabilities . Ahead of today’s announcement, shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said the redundancy notices issued today ‘represent not just broken promises but a failing strategy’ to reform the British Army. He said: ‘The Government has a flawed plan for reforming the British Army. There is a huge effort going into sacking soldiers but nowhere near as much is being done to plug the gap by recruiting new reservists. ‘These redundancies represent not just broken promises but a failing strategy, and the level of voluntary applicants will be a signal of morale.’ Seizing on Sir Peter’s comments, Mr Murphy said: ‘Senior Army figures are right to warn that ministers’ decisions could lead to a mismatch between capability and ambition. ‘Labour knows that difficult decisions need to be made, and accepts this means smaller services than in 2010. Far from having balanced the defence budget, however, ministers’ failed economic plan means long-term decisions in defence will be required. ‘Despite their claims, ministers have failed to put defence on a stable footing.’ Answering questions in the Commons yesterday, Mr Hammond said savings demanded of his department in this month’s spending review would not require further cuts to the size of the armed forces. Mr Hammond said the MoD would meet its share of the £11.5 billion in cuts across Government demanded by Chancellor George Osborne through efficiency savings. The Defence Secretary told the Commons the MoD was ‘not looking at changes that will reduce military manpower’.","Ministry of Defence issues redundancy notices to 4,480 troops .
