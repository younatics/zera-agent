A mother-of-two who disappeared on a vacation with her ex-boyfriend had told family and friends that she was 'hesitant' about taking the trip with her former partner because he had been violent in the past. Lynn Jackenheimer, 33, from Ashland, Ohio, . was last seen around ten days ago on Hatteras Island in North Carolina with her two children and former boyfriend Nathan Summerfield. They are no longer a couple but have a three-year-old son together. Police have named Summerfield, who has since fled, as a 'person of interest' in their search for the missing woman. Search: Lynn Jackenheimer, left, went on vacation with her two children and ex-boyfriend Nate Summerfield, right. But he returned without her and told a relative he had strangled her before fleeing . Alex Taylor, a friend of Miss Jackenheimer, told Fox: 'I do know at one point she told Nate she was thinking about not going. 'If I really thought she was in danger, we wouldn’t have let her go.' Summerfield, 27, returned to Ohio last Sunday to drop off Miss Jackenheimer's 13-year-old daughter and the young boy to their grandparents' homes before fleeing in his car. His brother Jake immediately called 911 to report 'a possible murder'. 'My brother was in North Carolina with . his ex-girlfriend and he came back and said he strangled her. He dropped . his kid off and left,' Jake Summerfield told a dispatcher. Loved: The two children were left with relatives and are crying for their mother, their grandfather said . He added that he did not know where his brother was going when he sped away in his grey 2009 Honda Civic. Police were hunting Summerfield using his cell phone signal and when his ATM card was used. Police had searched the homes of Miss Jackenheimer and Summerfield for clues. Teams were also scouring the beaches in North Carolina but as one officer pointed out:'Some of these beaches are perfect spots to dump something you don't want somebody to find.' Miss Jackenheimer had been staying in . a vacation rental home on the island with Summerfield and her children, . but authorities have found no clues as to her whereabouts at the home. 'We found nothing to date that they sent us to look for,' Dare County Sheriff's Department Chief Deputy Steve Hoggard. The children remain with relatives in . Ohio. Both had been questioned by police but could offer little clues . about what had happened to their mother. Missing: Jackenheimer, who has a three-year-old son with Summerfield and a 13-year-old daughter, has not been seen or heard from in a week . Person of interest: Summerfield, left, posted a picture on Facebook of him with the children on vacation . Lynn's stepfather, Raymond Johnson, told WOIO that Miss Jackenheimer's 13-year-old daughter, who has special needs, was left at his home in Dorchester, Ohio. 'She was all by herself when we found her,' Johnson said. 'He left her in the house took the little boy to his parents' house. 'They mainly cry for their mom, that's what they are doing. We are hoping for the best that's all.'

The App Center will feature apps that designed for PCs as well as for mobile devices such as Apple iPhones and Android smartphones. If a mobile app requires installation for the mobile device, Facebook said it will direct users to Apple's App Store or Google Inc's Play store to download the app . If Apple and Google can do it, so can social network Facebook - the site is to launch an 'app store' to showcase the games and apps that earn the site much of its revenue. The app store will also allow developers to sell apps direct to consumers for the first time via the network. It's the latest in a series of moves to 'spruce up' the number one social network in advance of a flotation on the stock market expected to take place later this month - and to convince investors it CAN earn more money. Apps such as games - particularly Zynga's titles such as Cityville - are a major source of Facebook's revenue, a fact the network is keen to hammer home. The App Center will, for the first time, allow software developers to sell apps to consumers directly on Facebook. 'Many developers have been successful . with in-app purchases, but to support more types of apps on . Facebook.com, we will give developers the option to offer paid apps. This is a simple-to-implement payment feature that lets people pay a . flat fee to use an app on Facebook.com,' says Facebook's Developer blog. 'For the over 900 million people that use Facebook, the App Center will become the new, central place to find great apps like Draw Something, Pinterest, Spotify, Battle Pirates, Viddy, and Bubble Witch Saga,' said the site's developer blog. The apps will be 'rated' by users, as they are on Google's Play and Apple's iTunes - which should help weed out apps that exist only to spam people via the site. The new App Center, which Facebook said will launch in the next few weeks, comes as the company is preparing an initial public offering that would value the company between $77 billion and $96 billion. A key concern for investors is Facebook's slowing revenue growth, due in part to the widening trend of consumers accessing its service on smartphones, where Facebook provides limited ads. In an amended prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Facebook said the popularity of mobile devices has caused its number of daily users to grow faster than the number of ads it is delivering. Facebook makes the vast majority of its revenue from online ads, although it also collects fees when consumers purchase goods from within social apps, such as Zynga's Farmville. If Apple and Google can do it, so can social network Facebook - the site is to launch an 'app store' to showcase the games and apps that earn the site much of its revenue . Consumers will need to use Facebook Credits, the company's payment system, to purchase the apps and Facebook will take a 30 percent cut of the revenue as it does with in-app purchases, said Facebook spokeswoman Malorie Lucich. Facebook is introducing the app service to give software developers additional options, but the company expects in-app purchases to remain more prevalent on the social network, said Lucich. Apps, ranging from social games to music services, are popular activities on Facebook, the world's No.1 online social network with roughly 900 million users. According to the company, 200 of the apps that are available on Facebook have more than 1 million users. The App Center will feature apps that designed for PCs as well as for mobile devices such as Apple iPhones and Android smartphones. If a mobile app requires installation for the mobile device, Facebook said it will direct users to Apple's App Store or Google's Play store to download the app. Apps such as Marvel Avenger's Alliance already allow users to buy in-game items using 'Facebook Credits' - linked to a credit card . Earnings: With the IPO, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will place him in the top 30 richest people in the world while retaining stock valued at $17.6 billion . Mark Zuckerberg will become one of the worlds' richest people, worth $17.6 billion (£10.8 billion) when Facebook floats on the stock market on May 18. Zuckerberg, . 27, will be worth more than technology rivals such as Microsoft's fiery . CEO Steve Ballmer, who at 56 is twice Zuckerberg's age, according to . official documents filed by Facebook yesterday with US financial . regulators. He will . also be richer than Michael Dell, 47, and Russian steel billionaire . Vladimir Lisin, who at 55 is also twice Zuckerberg's age. The CEO will also maintain about 58% of the company's voting power. Facebook has set a price range of $28 . to $35 for its initial public offering of stock - potentially valuing . Facebook at $79.3 billion, by far the biggest IPO in Silicon Valley . history. The IPO could raise as much as $11.8 billion in Silicon Valley's largest IPO ever. Investors are expected to . flock to the highly anticipated IPO, though some have voiced concerns . about the social network's longer-term growth. Last week, Facebook reported its first . quarter-to-quarter revenue slide in at least two years. Investors took it as a sign that the . social network's sizzling growth may be cooling as it prepares to go . public in the biggest ever Internet IPO. 'It was a faster slowdown than we would have guessed,’ said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. ‘No . matter how you slice it, for a company that is perceived as growing so . rapidly, to slow so much on whatever basis - sequentially or annually - . it will be somewhat concerning to investors if faced with a lofty . valuation,’ Wieser said. Zuckerberg, 27, will be worth more than technology rivals such as Microsoft's fiery CEO Steve Ballmer, who at 56 is twice Zuckerberg's age . He will also be richer than Michael Dell, 47, and Russian steel billionaire Vladimir Lisin (pictured), who at 55 is also twice Zuckerberg's age . Facebook's IPO . has been highly anticipated, not just because of how much money it will . raise but because Facebook itself is so popular. The world's largest . online social network has more than 900 million users worldwide. If . the underwriters sell the extra stock reserved for overallotments, the . IPO will value Facebook at $79.3 billion at the high end of the price . range. That's much . higher than any other Internet IPO in the past, even Google Inc. in . 2004, which raised $1.9 billion. The range came in a regulatory filing . Thursday. After that, Facebook will go on an . 'IPO roadshow,' where executives talk to potential investors about why . they should invest in the stock. If all goes well, Facebook's stock is expected to price on May 17 and make its public debut on May 18. The indicative price range, which is lower than first expected, can be . adjusted depending on Wall Street's response. Priced: Facebook will set its price range between $28 to $35 for its initial public offering of stock, potentially valuing the company at $79.3 billion . Ticker: Listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker 'FB,' the IPO expects to raise as much as $11.8 billion after its public debut on May 18 . CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who turns 28 . this month, has emerged as a wunderkind leader who's led Facebook . through unprecedented growth from its scrappy start as a hangout for . Harvard students. Zuckerberg will keep tight control over the company even after the IPO. He . will control about 58 percent of the company's voting power, through . stocks he owns or because other shareholders have promised to vote his . way through shares that they own. This means he will have final say over the biggest decisions facing the company even after it goes public.

This weekend sees the switch to British Summer Time and, appropriately, it has been met with the first surprise heatwave of the year. Far from the usual case of it being summer time in name only, Britain will today bask in temperatures up to 10C higher than the seasonal average, forecasters said.

And in London the weather was so warm it spurred an air quality . alert, with pollution measuring at nine on the ten-point scale. The warm weather is being caused by a . high pressure system in the North Sea which is sucking warm air from in . from France and northern Continental Europe. For the next few days London is . expected to be warmer than typically sun-soaked capitals much further . south like Madrid, Rome and even Athens. But . although the temperatures are unseasonal, they won’t make the record . books. The hottest March day was 25.6c (78f) at Mepal in Cambridgeshire . on March 29, 1968.

They have discovered what are believed to be some of the country’s earliest cold  storage larders - precursors to the fridge - at a Bronze Age site. The larders were uncovered by a team investigating six roundhouses found at a housing development site at Dunstaffnage, near Oban, Argyll - an early form of refrigeration used to keep milk and meat from going off. The larders were uncovered by a team investigating six roundhouses in Dunstaffnage, near Oban, Argyll - an early form of refrigeration used to keep milk, meat and fish from going off . They are the first north of the Border to have ring ditches inside. Dr Clare Ellis, of Argyll Archaeology, who led an evaluation at the site, believes the ditches are cellars for keeping food cool. She said: ‘This is a new design, not recognised or seen before in Scotland. The general consensus was that ring ditches occur outside the roof supports of roundhouses, but still within the roundhouse structure, and were erosional features where animals were kept. ‘But these are inside the roof support area and the theory is that they are low cellars that would have had wooden floors over them. We think they are an early form of cellar, an early larder storage system. ‘In the Iron Age they had banana-shaped cellars and this would appear to be the precursor to that. They are on the coolest side of the house. It’s like an early form of refrigeration, where they would keep cheeses, milk, dried meat, salted fish and grain.’ While archaeologists have discovered older areas for the storage of food on Orkney, dating back to Neolithic times, the Dunstaffnage finds are the earliest roundhouse stores of their kind to be uncovered. Dunstaffnage Bay: While archaeologists have discovered older areas for the storage of food on Orkney, dating back to Neolithic times, the Dunstaffnage finds are the earliest roundhouse stores of their kind to be uncovered . Dr Ellis said another important find was the discovery of air vents coming out of the ring ditches and the hearths. She added: ‘These channels coming out are wood-lined vents to let air through and to allow the washing out of some of the ring ditches occasionally. This is a new design that’s not really been recognised or seen in Scotland before.’ The team has also uncovered ancient burial pits. Other finds include pottery and a pock-marked hammerstone, dating back 3,000-4,000 years, which would have been used for mashing up vegetable matter.The finds all come from the Bronze Age and radio carbon dating will be used to place the settlement to within 40 years. Dr Ellis said: ‘It’s unusual to get so many roundhouses surviving together in this way. They are not particularly huge so they were probably just ordinary people living here, but I think, in relative terms, it could have been quite a populated landscape.’ Affordable housing is to be built at the site by West Highland Housing Association. Lesley McInnes, the association’s chief executive, said: ‘It’s really important that people have the opportunity to understand what went on before. ‘Whilst we are looking to develop the site we are going to look at having something there in the future that would be able to bring the past to life in that area.’","Ventilated 'larders' used to keep milk and meats fresh .

When asking Hollywood celebrities what they love about England you'd think they'd say the history, the buildings - or most likely, accent. So this latest revelation from Gwyneth Paltrow may come as quite a shock. Despite having a bank balance healthier than most, the 39-year old actress has revealed her love of Boots the Chemist. In a recent interview the mother-of-two said: 'One of the many exciting things about living in England for a good part of the year is the perpetual discovery. 'Boots is almost as ubiquitous as the pub here in England. Everyone raves about Boots' own line No7 and their range of high quality cosmetics, moisturisers and cleansers.' Bargain beauty: Since moving to the UK Gwyneth Paltrow has become a fan of the No7 range at Boots . The high street chain became popular with Brits following the discovery by scientists from BBC's Horizons programme that the No7 Perfect and Protect cream was a 'miracle product'. Shoppers queued for hours to test it out and stores had to ration purchases after many sold out in minutes. But Gwyneth isn't the only A-lister to admit to being a fan of the popular chemist. Even royalty shop there. The Duchess of Cambridge, 30, is often spotted at her local branch buying Nivea Visage Pure and Natural Moisturising Day crea, which costs just £5.10. Royal Fan: Kate Middleton is often spotted shopping in her local Boots for Nivea moisturiser . And with so many skincare products costing upwards of £100, it's refreshing to see that celebrities appreciate bargain buys too. Jennifer Aniston, 43, may be one of the world's most beautiful - and wealthiest - women but she swears by a £1.99 bar of soap. In an interview she revealed: 'I've been using it since High School. 'I wake up and wash my face with Neutrogena face soap. I use a serum and then a Dr Hauschka day cream - that’s it!' Lather up: Jennifer Aniston swears by Neutrogena soap: 'I've been using it since High School' Even Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr doesn't break the bank with an expensive beauty routine. The 28-year old Australian model says her blemish-free skin and glossy hair is down to a £8.25 pot of coconut oil. ‘I will not go a day without coconut . oil. I personally take four tablespoons per day, either on my salads, in . my cooking or in my cups of green tea,' the model explained. The Secret's out: Model Miranda Kerr says that blemish-free skin is thanks to her addiction to coconut oil . But for Golden Globe nominee Emma Stone, 23, her sensitive skin may limit the choice but a £3.49 bottle of grapeseed oil works wonders. Speaking earlier this year the actress revealed: 'I'm seriously allergic to everything. So I just use natural grapeseed oil from the grocery store on my face as a moisturiser. After the shower, I pat it on, and then I'll use it throughout the day and night.' Feeling fruity: Actress Emma Stone says she uses so much Grapeseed Oil she constantly smells of it . For some stars though creativity can be just as worthwhile as splashing the cash. And in a shock twist the celebrity who swears by this technique is Victoria Beckham. The Spice Girl turned designer has reportedly been experimenting with making her own facemasks with her latest creation being her best yet. A friend of the 37-year old told Heat magazine that blending apricot and avocado is her 'latest thing'.

Marc will only eat shakes, hot beverages, chocolate mousse and custard . He said: 'When I was 14 I weighed 17 stone and was tormented by bullies who called me fat. 'I got incredibly skinny, you could see all my bones jutting out. But I preferred looking like that to feeling fat. 'At my skinniest I weighed less than 7 stone. I barely ate anything. But with the help of my family I’m on the road to recovery.' But Marc's case is not unusual and it is now estimated that 20 per cent of the 1.6million people with eating disorders in the UK are male. As a child Marc says he used to gorge on . sweets, chips and kebabs and was a stone and a half overweight by the time . he was nine, weighing six stone.

But after being targeted by other children at school he gradually became slimmer between the ages of 14 and 19. Concerned about their son's sudden weight loss, Marc's parents, Daniel, 59, and . Janice, 50, took him to see an eating specialist who diagnosed him with anorexia. With the support of his family Marc gradually started eating soft foods, but he still can't bring himself to eat normal meals. He said: 'I refuse to eat in front of people. But at least I can eat - and that’s something. 'I can’t pinpoint exactly what it is, but I really am scared of eating solid food.' Marc, who also suffers from cerebral palsy - a neurological condition that affects his movement and coordination that prevents him from working - thanks his family for helping him to 'beat my demons'. With the support of his parents, Janice and Daniel, Marc gradually started eating soft foods, but he still can't bring himself to eat normal meals . His . mother, Janice, also unemployed due to disability, said: 'We still . worry about Marc although he says he has it under control. 'I would like to see him put on weight and I like him to eat at the table with the family again. 'He used to eating anything and everything but suddenly stopped after being bullied. 'It’s a long road to recovery but we’re proud that he had recognised his illness.' Figures from the NHS Information Centre show that last year there were 228 hospital admissions for men and boys with anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders. Mary George, spokesman for the Beat eating disorder charity, said: ‘We can’t say for sure that there are more men suffering from eating disorders now but there is certainly more awareness which means more are coming forward for treatment . 'There is more pressure on men from magazines with celebrities and male models to have that ideal body image. ‘But there’s still a lot of stigma and misunderstanding because the majority of eating disorders occur in females. ‘That’s why men are ashamed to come forward and admit they have a problem.’ For more information about eating disorders visit the MGEDT website or the beat website .","Marc Corn's anorexia triggered by childhood taunts .

A former fitness trainer who ballooned to 27 stone after becoming addicted to crisps has lost half his body weight - after kicking the 20 packet-a-day habit. James Quinn, 44, devoured the cheese and onion flavoured snacks along with four burgers, bacon, fried eggs, countless biscuits, an entire loaf of bread and two litres of Irn Bru or coke every 24 hours. Mature student James struggled to walk and could not climb a flight of stairs to make it to his college classes to study for a Higher National Diploma (HND) in multimedia technology and web design . Former fitness trainer who ballooned to 27 stone after developing an addiction to crisps that saw him eat 20 packets every day. When doctors told him his lifestyle would kill him, he finally shed 14 stone - and now weighs in at 13st 10lbs . But after being told by doctors his lifestyle would kill him James, with the help of staff at Slimming World, shed 14 stone and a year later weighs in at 13 stone 10 pounds. James said the weight loss also meant James graduated from college and is now studying for a degree in the same subject. Father-of-four James said: 'I loved cheese and onion crisps. I could easily go through 20 packs in a day on top of all the fried food. 'It got to the point where I couldn't walk up the flight of stairs to get to class, I think it would have killed me and I definitely wouldn't have finished the first year, never mind be doing a degree. At his largest, James weighed almost 28 stone and could not climb a flight of stairs at the colelge he attended . 'I feel fantastic now, absolutely great. I'm a totally different person and I haven't touched a bag of crisps in over a year. 'I ate one to celebrate hitting my weight loss target and it was horrible, I didn't like the taste at all.' Grandfather-of-one James, who lives with his wife Joyce, 46, in Irvine, North Ayrshire, began to pile on the pounds after leaving his job as a fitness instructor at the Scottish Sports Council, to manage a video rental shop in the early 1990s. The slow-down in activity and hours spent sat behind a counter saw James eat more and exercise less. Over the next 20 years he moved from job to job in various high street shops until he hit the age of 40 when he left to study at college. As well as the crisps, James' diet consisted of four burgers, bacon, fried eggs, biscuits, an entire loaf of bread and two litres of Irn Bru or coke every 24 hours . The student lifestyle meant James gained weight even quicker as his diet deteriorated into a sea of fast food, fried breakfasts and salty snacks. At his heaviest James weighed 27 stone seven pounds and struggled to walk. James began to realise the seriousness of the situation when he tried to buy a kilt to attend a wedding and found his bulging 62 inch waist was one inch short of needing a specially made garment. But even that wasn't enough for him to ditch his snack filled diet. James said: 'I would buy the big multi-packs of crisps and they would all disappear. 'I would get annoyed and ask my family who had eaten them all, but then I realised all the empty packets were down the side of my chair, because I had eaten the lot. 'My diet was dreadful, breakfast would be four pieces of bread, two eggs and three sausages followed by biscuits and crisps. 'For dinner I would have four burgers, half a plate of chips and a tin of beans or a large curry. 'I had visited doctors who told me that if I didn't lose weight I would probably die but that didn't stop me. 'The turning point came when I started going to college. I would take the lift because I couldn't manage the stairs.' In March last year James decided to change his life and ate his last bag of crisps. He joined a weight loss class at Irvine's Old Parish Church and began to exercise. In just six months he lost seven and a half stone, by nine months he had shed another five in time for the completion of his HND course in November last year. He reached his target last month and said he is determined to continue his healthy lifestyle and shed a few more pounds before his graduation from the University of the West of Scotland in Paisley, Renfrewshire, later this year. James added: 'It just shows what you can do. 'I'm no longer on blood pressure tablets and I'm really happy with the way I look. 'It's given me a new lease of life, some people walk by me and don't realise it's me. 'And I don't miss crisps at all.'","Mature student James Quinn, 44, was so large he could no longer climb a flight of stairs ."

However, earlier this year, when discussing a potential portrait, Philipps stated that she wouldn’t turn down an opportunity to paint the Duchess in a million years, continuing that 'beautiful people are always more difficult... 'With symmetrical faces, there’s nothing to hang the portrait on. It’s very unlikely that you’ll ever do them enough justice.' The artist stressed the importance of sittings: 'the human eye has so many more resources at its disposal than the camera, being a technical object, ever will — however sophisticated.

In the horrific roll call of death and injury that emanates from Afghanistan, it is sometimes easy to forget that each name, rank and number has its own unique story. That is what makes this image of a seriously wounded Scottish soldier being treated in the heat of battle such an immediate snapshot of the random cruelty of war. But the story of Private Stephen Bainbridge also describes the true bravery of a man forced to rebuild his life after a devastating injury sustained on Remembrance Day last year. Injured: Private Stephen Bainbridge lies in agony while being treated by medics, after the Helmand IED explosion which saw him lose both his legs. Now, for the first time, the soldier from Kirkcaldy, Fife, has spoken about his ordeal and the very different battle he now faces for the rest of his life after losing both legs. Recalling the day he stepped on the mine, Pte Bainbridge, who has given his permission for the photograph to be used, said: ‘I was blown into the air, I felt the heat blast. ‘As I was coming back down it didn’t feel like I was falling, more like floating. That was until I hit the ground.’ The 25-year-old, who regained consciousness in hospital on November 20, added: ‘Before I woke up, I pretty much knew the legs were gone. I suppose I was conscious of the doctors talking. It still hit me when I woke up but not as badly as if I believed I was still all there. It wasn’t a pretty sight.’ Yet he has no regrets about joining . the Army, saying: ‘I wouldn’t change anything. I chose the job, I chose . to be with 3 Scots. There was no second choice, it was always going to . be them.’ Line of fire: Private Bainbridge walks towards a doorway, left, in Helmand Province just moments before the IED explosion which saw him lose both his legs . Pte Bainbridge was on patrol in . Helmand Province on November 11 with 3 Scots (The Black Watch), . alongside soldiers from 1st Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment. Walking through open farmland that . morning near Nad-e-Ali, they were part of a series of ops called Tora . Pishaw, aimed at disrupting insurgent activity in the area. Second . Lieutenant Robert Weir led his men on a mission to clear a series of . compounds – and later said they all had a feeling of uneasiness about . the situation. Recovery: At Headley Court Military Hospital in Surrey, Private Bainbridge is in rehabilitation and is learning walk with prosthetic limbs . Private John Cameron, 21, was called forward to use his mine detector to sweep a hidden doorway leading to a compound. After deciding it was safe, he pushed on and swept the area beyond, followed by several others, who also came to no harm. Then Pte Bainbridge, who had been providing rear protection, stepped through the doorway. Lt Weir recalled: ‘I was hit by a wave . of sound and debris. It seemed to be moving in slow motion. I got . launched a few metres and landed on my back. Initially, I thought it was . me that had stood on the device. ‘I . gave myself a quick limb check and realised I was not in any pain apart . from my face. For an instant, I thought maybe no-one was injured – but . then thought that was silly because these things don’t just go off. ‘I . saw Bainbridge lying just inside the doorway. One of his legs was . missing, his hand was very swollen and he was missing the tip of one of . his fingers, I saw the other leg was definitely damaged but it was still . there at that point. I called for a medic and started giving initial . first aid.’ The picture . above tells the next part of the story, with Lt Weir and the squad’s . medic, Corporal John Goode, 21, saving Pte Bainbridge’s life in those . crucial first few minutes. Tourniquets . were applied, morphine and fluids were given and Pte Bainbridge was in . hospital only 36 minutes after the explosion. Lt Weir . said: ‘When I got up to Bainbridge, I had never seen anything like it in . my life. Part of me thought, “Good Lord, what am I going to do here?” But Goode didn’t appear to show any shock, he just treated it like an . exercise. He saved his life.’ Private . Chris Watson, 21, cradled Pte Bainbridge’s head and tried to keep him . conscious and talking. He said: ‘At one point, Bainbridge tried to sit . up and look at his legs. I held him down and told him he was going to be . OK.’ Doctors at the . Headley Court military hospital in Surrey have been much impressed by . Pte Bainbridge’s determination to recover as quickly as possible. ‘He’s a very determined man,’ said physiotherapist Claire Painter, one of the team teaching him to walk on prosthetic limbs.",Private Stephen Bainbridge lost both legs after stepping on a mine in Helmand on Remembrance Day last year .

Outspoken: Steve Hilton, David Cameron's closest adviser, has described British Airways as 'fat cats' and urged a cabinet minister to fly with its rival Virgin . Downing Street has been forced to distance itself from David Cameron's closest adviser after he described British Airways as 'fat cats' and urged a cabinet minister to fly with its rival Virgin. The controversial views of Steve Hilton, the prime minister's director of strategy, have been revealed by the education secretary Michael Gove. According to The Observer, Mr Gove said in an interview: 'When I was explaining to Steve Hilton that I was going off to the States, he said: ""What are you flying? Don't fly British Airways, they are the fat cats. Fly Branson, he is the upstart. We are on the side of the upstarts"". The comments from Mr Hilton - Downing Street's 'blue sky thinker' - will be a huge source of embarrassment to Number 10. It immediately distanced itself from Mr Hilton's comments by insisting that the views were expressed in a personal capacity. It also pointed out that Mr Cameron had recently traveled with BA to Saudi Arabia. The huge rivalry between Virgin and BA is no secret. In 1993, it led to BA having to pay £610,000 damages for a 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin and about £3m in legal costs. Five years ago Virgin also cooperated with a price-fixing enquiry which led to a record £270m fine for BA. Last week Virgin Atlantic claimed that passengers would face reduced services and higher fares if BA  was successful in its planned takeover of rivals BMI. Rivals: Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, left, has welcomed the comments of Steve Hilton. BA chief Willie Walsh is pictured right . Willie Walsh, the chief executive of . IAG, the owner of BA, responded by saying that Branson's views did not . make sense and added that they were driven by the motivation to look . after Virgin's position and not the consumer's. An aide to Sir Richard Branson - the boss of Virgin Atlantic - told The Observer that the billionaire businessman was 'delighted that we appear to be Steve Hilton's carrier of choice and would look forward to welcoming Michael (Gove) on board.' He added: 'We have long fought the ""fat cat"" of the skies and will do all we can to keep it counting calories.' Mr Hilton, 42, is a former Saatchi & Saatchi advertising executive who is also a close friend of the prime minister. Happy: Virgin said it was 'delighted' that it appeared to be Steve Hilton's carrier of choice. This is an image from one of the airline's adverts . He is known for his unconventional . thinking and officials in Downing Street have previously been forced to . downplay the views reportedly held by him. It was reported that during one brainstorming session Mr Hilton asked civil servants why the prime minister had to obey the law. He is also believed to have upset a number of people within Number 10 through his abrasive style. Mr Gove's interview with the right of centre Standpoint magazine took place this month. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron 'regularly travels with both airlines and that it is good to have two successful airlines competing in the market.'

Drivers may find themselves without fuel - with petrol pumps across the country running dry - after fuel drivers voted in favour of strikes today. In a painful reminder of . the fuel protests of 2000, when truckers blocked the crucial flow of . fuel to the forecourts, drivers may find themselves stranded following the vote by Unite members to strike. The 2,000 balloted union members supply fuel to 90 per cent of the nation's garages via seven haulage companies - and a strike could cause 7,900 stations to close. The fallout of the ballot could see the nation brought to a crippling standstill, with drivers unable to find enough fuel for everyday tasks, and businesses or organisations such as the NHS struggling to function normally. Memories of 2000 (when fuel cost less than 80p a litre): Cars rushed to the forecourts as tankers struggled to make it to garages . For just over a week in September 2000 the nation came to a virtual standstill as protesters blocked the crucial flow of fuel. While truckers and farmers blockaded refineries, petrol stations ran dry, tempers soared and panic buying raged. With the memories of the previous strike still fresh, the Government has announced that soldiers are being lined up to stand in for the tanker drivers if strikes go ahead. However, Labour leader Ed Miliband has yet to . condemn the threat of crippling industrial action by Unite, which is one of Labour's biggest donors. Workers in seven major distribution . companies - Wincanton, DHL, Hoyer, BP, J W Suckling, Norbert . Dentressangle and Turners - were balloted for industrial action. A spokesman for Hoyer, which pays workers an average of £45,000 a year, said Unite walked out of negotiations. A Hoyer spokesman said: 'We are dismayed at the outcome of the Unite ballot for industrial action involving 650 drivers on our fuels contracts. The results for the seven companies involved in the ballot are: . 'Particularly as only 215 drivers out of the 650 voted for strike action and we therefore believe that this action is being driven by a small disaffected group of employees. 'In our history of delivering petroleum products for large oil companies, Hoyer has not had a major accident or serious injury to a member of our team. 'Pay and conditions for Hoyer drivers are among the best in the industry. Our drivers earn on average £45,000 a year. 'They are well rewarded because they are professionals, highly trained and skilled in the work that they carry out, particularly with regard to health and safety. 'We have been actively engaged in discussions with Unite through the Industry Forum to examine ways in which these high health safety and training stands can be applied across the industry but Unite walked away from those discussions.' However Unite's general secretary said the union was simply trying to establish 'minimum standards'. Diana Holland said: 'These votes send a clear message throughout the industry and should prompt all the major companies to get around the table to establish minimum standards. 'This is not about pay - this is about ensuring that high safety and training standards are maintained, so that our communities are safe. 'It is about a simple measure, the creation of an industry-wide bargaining forum. It is about bringing fairness and stability back to an essential national industry.' The union is led by the militant Len McCluskey, who has also called for strikes to disrupt the Olympics. Those comments were labelled ‘unacceptable and wrong’ by Mr Miliband - but the Labour leader has not commented on his latest vote. Ghost of 2000 protests: Tankers blockaded ports in order to prevent fuel reaching stations in protest at the Government tax on fuel . Unite, the country’s largest trade union, is also the biggest donor to the Labour party, handing over around £3million a year. It gave £10,000 to Ed Miliband’s leadership election campaign – which only succeeded because of his backing from trade unions. Tricky position: A ballot by the drivers' union Unite is likely to pile pressure on the Labour leader, pictured, to condemn the threat of action . The Government said it had 'robust resilience and contingency plans' to deal with a strike and had already started to put these in place to minimise any disruption to the public. Energy Secretary Edward Davey said: 'The Unite ballot result is disappointing. 'The Government is strongly of the view that strike action is wrong and unnecessary. The union should be getting round the negotiating table, not planning to disrupt the lives of millions of people across Britain. 'This is an industrial dispute and we strongly urge Unite to resolve it by getting back to the negotiating table, not by threatening the nation with economic and social disruption. 'Our economy is just getting back on its feet and any action that makes that harder is totally unjustified. 'With the London 2012 Olympics approaching, it is unacceptable and selfish to behave in this manner and jeopardise our international reputation. 'Unite has committed to ensuring that essential services are not disrupted. We trust it will live up to this commitment and not put anyone in harm’s way. 'The Government stands ready to take whatever action we can to minimise the impact of any strike. 'If we have to, we will use emergency powers to make sure supplies for emergency services are prioritised and we will work to ensure trained military personnel are available to drive oil tankers. 'The police will be on hand to ensure that strike action does not intimidate or prevent drivers that wish to work from doing so. 'While their main concerns are pay and conditions, which are matters for their employers, they have also raised health and safety. We take health and safety very seriously and will be looking carefully at what Unite is saying. 'Ensuring people are safe at work is a priority for us and we are committed to resolving any issues around this. 'But we are clear - first and foremost - the parties must get back around the table. There is no justification for this. It’s the wrong action at the wrong time.' Ministers say the training of Army drivers will begin . next week. Thorn in Labour's side: The union is led by the militant Len McCluskey, pictured, who has also called for strikes to disrupt the Olympics . Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said the Government had learned from 2000, when many petrol stations ran out of fuel and the NHS was placed on red alert. He said: ‘We are calling on the trade . union Unite and the employers involved to work together to reach an . agreement that will avert industrial action. ‘Widespread strike action affecting . fuel supply at our supermarkets, garages and airports could cause . disruption across the country. ‘The . general public should not and must not suffer from this dispute, and . strike action is manifestly not the answer. Although we are pushing for . an agreement, we have learnt the lessons of the past and stand ready to . act to minimise disruption to motorists, to industry and, in particular, . to our emergency services.’ The . contingency plans have been drawn up by Mr Maude, Transport Secretary . Justine Greening, Home Secretary Theresa May, Health Secretary Andrew . Lansley and Energy Secretary Ed Davey. However, the Petrol Retailers . Association, which represents about 5,500 forecourts, said it did not . think the Government was prepared for a strike. Chairman . Brian Madderson said: ‘We have had no word from the Department of . Energy and Climate Change whatsoever, so we have not been asking our . members to keep their stocks at a high level.’ On . its online ballot form, Unite says: ‘While the oil industry rakes in . multi-billion-pound profits, the drivers who supply fuel to forecourts . across the country are being squeezed ... the major employers have been . slashing drivers’ terms and conditions and cutting corners on training . and safety in a bid to win contracts.’ Tanker drivers earn around £45,000 a year for 37 hours of work a week.","Reminder of fuel protests in 2000 as Unite fuel drivers vote to strike .

"PUBLISHED: . 05:07 EST, 26 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:24 EST, 26 April 2012 . Neglected: Molly Darby, seen shortly before her death in 2007, had been a resident at the Beeches home for just a few weeks . A coroner has launched a scathing attack on a care home after an emaciated pensioner was admitted to hospital weighing less than five-and-a-half stone. Just five weeks before, 'sprightly' 94-year-old Molly Darby had walked into a privately-run care home in good physical health. But she deteriorated to such an extent at the Beeches Residential Care Home, in Wath-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, that she was taken out on a stretcher and died shortly after. When she was admitted to hospital as an emergency case her family claimed she resembled a 'concentration camp victim'. Staff nurses were shocked to find the . widowed mother-of-six had a chest infection, pneumonia, pressure sores, . septicaemia and ear and urinary infections. Staff thought she would not . make it through the night but she survived for another two and a half . weeks. Rotherham coroner . Nicola Mundy yesterday said: 'I find it very alarming that such a . vulnerable person who relied on professionals for her care and support . was presented to hospital in the way she was. 'The . vulnerable in our society must be properly cared for on all levels and . their dignity protected. I think that Mrs Darby was not afforded the . care and dignity she deserved on this occasion.' Nurse . Julie Norton who received Mrs Darby on a general medical ward at . Barnsley District Hospital said: 'It was quite upsetting. She was . really, really frail. There were some issues we were really concerned . about. 'When I was changing her bedding with another nurse we were all quite upset and distressed. Her right ear was impacted with ear wax and she had a pressure sore, her hair was thin and wispy and badly stuck to her face and neck and her eyes were completely shut. It took quite a lot of bathing with water to open them.' When old people’s matron Karen Sharpe saw Mrs Darby she immediately contacted social services. Endocrine specialist Dr Elizabeth Uchegbu, who examined Mrs Darby, reported: 'She appeared neglected and unkempt, there was a discharge from both eyes, a smell of urine and she was distressed. She was covered in faeces when she first arrived.' Deterioration: Jim Darby, 72, at his mother's bedside in 2007. The retired miner said Mrs Darby was 'sprightly' when she entered the home . The doctor wrote later: 'I got the impression she was neglected. She was weak and thin and it could not be explained.' Tissue viability nurse Tracy Green, who carried out an investigation after Mrs Darby’s death, said there were no notes about her pressure sores yet Molly was at 'high risk' of skin damage. 'I believe there had been neglect by omission,' she said. 'This is in the absence of any proof that there was any intervention.' The Rotherham hearing was told Mrs Darby had a lower than normal body mass index and had been assessed at risk of malnutrition four months before she went into the home. Her son Jim Darby, 72, a retired miner, told the inquest his mother was 'sprightly' when she was at home in West Melton, near Rotherham. 'Her carers used to say my mum could get up the stairs better than they could,' he said. But the great-grandmother developed dementia and needed 24-hour care so her family decided to put her in the Beeches. She went into the home on July 6, 2007. Failings: An inquiry found the widowed mother of six suffered unintentional abuse through 'neglect by omission' Mr Darby said: 'They kept saying they were feeding her and I had no reason not to believe it but it turned out it was wrong. The nurse at the hospital said she had never seen anybody come into hospital from a care home in such a bad state.' The former care home manager Julie Morgan said in a statement that staff helped Mrs Darby with her personal hygiene and toileting, but her diet was poor and she would often refuse to eat. Care assistant Michelle Burkinshaw told the inquest the elderly patient had mobility problems and she was refusing food and fluids. She regularly washed her, bathed her eyes and put cream on her sores. Pathologist Dr Caroline Quincy said Mrs Darby died on August 29, 2007, from broncho-pneumonia contributed to by coronary artery atheroma. She said her reduced mobility could have played a part in increasing the risk of pneumonia and there was also evidence of malnourishment. The 44-bed Beeches was run by the Winnie Care Group at the time of Mrs Darby's death but last year it was sold to new owners MHA. An inquiry by Rotherham Council’s social services department found the previous owners negligent by 'omission of care' for Mrs Darby in February, 2008. Moira Ockenden, area manager of the Beeches at the time, denied Mrs Darby was emaciated. In a letter to the family read at the inquest she said: 'The references to a concentration camp victim are unjustified.' She said staff claimed to wash or bathe Mrs Darby on a daily basis and they regularly brushed her hair. The widow had a poor appetite and would refuse food, she said. She admitted the old woman had sores on her heels, right hip and lower spine when admitted to hospital and that she should have been referred to a dietician. Sam Newton, Rotherham Council’s safeguarding service manager said an inquiry found Mrs Darby had suffered abuse through 'neglect by omission' but it was not intentional. 'It was based on poor recording, little or no evidence in respect of the care she was receiving, there were no weight charts, fluid or diet recordings and there was no evidence of professional visits.' Tom Parramore, service manager for the current owners of the Beeches said all the staff were now fully trained and there was regular auditing of residents’ hygiene, nutrition and medication needs. Cause for concern: The Beeches Residential Care Home, in Wath-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, has been taken over since Mrs Darby's death, but former operator Winnie Care still runs other homes . Recording a narrative verdict the coroner said: 'Her basic care and medical requirements were not satisfactorily met and her decreased mobility during her time at the Beeches increased her risk of developing a chest infection.' Ms Mundy went on: 'Her nutritional status compromised her ability to cope with the effects of the chest infection, the latter of which led to her death.' After the hearing, Mrs Darby's granddaughter Pearl Green, 56, said: 'The coroner confirmed everything we knew as a family. Neglect did contribute to her death. The care she was provided with in that place was absolutely disgusting. It was inhuman.' Mrs Darby’s son Ray, 68, said: 'Her life was shortened by this. There was a total lack of care. She hardly saw a doctor in 40 years before she went into that home. She did all her own shopping and was very active for her age.' The coroner is also writing to Winnie Care, which still operates other care homes, asking them if they have reviewed all their procedures, documentation and training following Mrs Darby's death.","Molly Darby, 94, was suffering from pneumonia, sores and infections after just a few weeks in a privately-run care home in South Yorkshire .

Pop star Lee Ryan was excused crown court jury duty - after the presiding judge asked him: 'Don’t I know you?' The Blue star, whose hits include the group's May 2001 UK number four single All Rise, was selected as the eighth juror on a 12-person panel to listen to evidence against a defendant facing assault charges during a three-day trial. However, as the singer was about to take his seat in the jury box, Judge Mary Jane Mowat, sitting at Oxford Crown Court, said: 'I believe I know this gentleman.' Bye bye: Judge Mary Jane Mowat, left, dismissed Blue star Lee Ryan, right, from the jury after she recognised him . The 28-year-old said casually: 'If you like music you might have done. I haven’t been to court or anything.' To which the judge replied: 'I was thinking more about horses.' After a brief pause, Mr Ryan, who is known to have ridden in the past, pointed at the judge and said: 'Oh yeah.' 'I would ask that you please stand down,' added Judge Mowat. Blond Mr Ryan, dressed in a denim jacket, tee-shirt, jeans and green trainers, then rose, looking somewhat pleased as he turned around and walked to the back of the courtroom. Mr Ryan, who rose to fame in 2001, lives in nearby Yarnton near Oxford, which was why he was selected for jury service. Six men and six women were chosen to sit on the case of Amar Khan, aged 27, of Windrush Drive, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Khan was charged with unlawful wounding with intent and an alternative charge of unlawful wounding, as well as two counts of assault by beating after the attack in Cowley, Oxon, on July 15 last year. Prosecutor Jonathon Stone told the hearing that the defendant was part of a gang of four men who burst into a mother-of-three’s home and demand she hand over drugs. It was alleged Khan used a claw hammer to hit Charlotte Marshall’s boyfriend Ade Adeniran over the head in a bloody attack, which left him needing stitches. The gang made their getaway empty-handed, but Khan was the only suspect police caught, the hearing was told. His fingerprints were found in a silver Citron car used as the getaway vehicle. A Tesco receipt found in the car placed him near to the scene just 20 minutes before the assault. Khan admits being in the car but not during the time of the attack.

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 04:09 EST, 16 November 2011 . Secret talks are being held about watering down voters’  newly-granted power to trigger debates in Parliament, following  a series of embarrassments for  the Government. Ministers and senior MPs have discussed raising the threshold for the number of signatures needed on e-petitions  before they can be considered for discussion in the House of Commons. Another idea is for debates to be relegated from the Commons chamber to the backwater of Westminster Hall, normally only attended by a handful of MPs at a time. Conservative MP Philip Davies, who sits on the backbench business committee that decides which petitions should be debated, said: ‘Our committee has helped re-establish the faith of a lot of voters in the democratic process. The Government should be pleased about that rather than interfering like this.’ The extraordinary manoeuvres came to light on the day that MPs passed a motion  triggered by an e-petition demanding that the Treasury considers scrapping a 3p rise in fuel duty due in January. Senior MPs appear increasingly concerned that they have created a monster with the e-petition scheme, which forces them to consider debating an issue in the Commons once an online petition attracts more than 100,000 signatories. Its critics had warned that the Government’s plans would  allow the Commons to be hijacked by campaigners, and would mean MPs spending precious Parliamentary time debating proposals that have little or no chance of becoming law. But ministers insisted it would revitalise public engagement with Parliament in the wake of the expenses scandal – even if it forced MPs to confront difficult issues. Popular: Since the site was launched in the summer, several petitions have attracted the required home of signatures - and have then been debated in the Commons . Since the scheme was launched in the summer, several petitions have attracted the requisite number of signatures remarkably quickly. They include a call for a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe, the release of secret documents on the Hillsborough tragedy, stripping rioters of their benefits and curbing immigration to prevent Britain’s population reaching 70 million. The backbench business committee assesses the petitions that reach 100,000 and decides whether the issues should be given time from the 35 days allocated during each Parliamentary session for non-governmental business. Successful petitions then have to be sponsored by an MP who leads the debate. PR disasters: The introduction of the scheme has left David Cameron embarrassed after rebellions against him by his own backbenchers . The scheme has led David Cameron into a series of public relations disasters. The worst came in a debate last month over a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU, which saw the Prime Minister suffer the worst rebellion on the issue ever staged by Tory MPs. Senior colleagues said Mr Cameron blundered badly when he decided to turn a backbench vote, which was designed as a non-binding expression of the view of Parliament, into a trial of strength. Despite the Prime Minister imposing a three-line whip – the toughest possible party instruction on how to vote – and threatening members of the Government that stepped out of line with the sack, 81 Conservative MPs defied him and voted in favour of a referendum. And last night MPs called on the Treasury to scrap fuel duty rises planned for next year and nodded through a motion calling for a new price stabilisation mechanism. More than 100 MPs – including 83 Tories and five Liberal Democrats – had backed the motion. Attempts to change the e-petition system just months after it has been introduced will trigger accusations that the Government is fighting shy of rebellions from MPs over issues popular with voters. A Government source confirmed last night that while the Prime Minister remains committed to the ‘principle’ of e-petitions, discussions were taking place over whether to tighten up the system. One petition, on the treatment of British citizen Babar Ahmad, wanted in the U.S. on charges of terrorism, has already been tacked on to another debate on extradition treaties in Westminster Hall. Others could follow the same route. Contrasting views: Philip Davies said e-petitions had restored voters faith in the democratic process, but Natasha Engel said the Government had not thought the scheme through properly. Both are members of the backbench business committee . ‘There are discussions,’ said one source. ‘We did say from the start that we would see how this worked. If Parliament is getting 100 petitions a year which attract 100,000 signatures, then people will ask if it’s sensible to change the threshold.’ Natascha Engel, the backbench business committee’s chairman, said the Government had ‘not thought through e-petitions at all’ and suggested the system was spiralling out of control. She said there were now false expectations that a petition attracting 100,000 signatures automatically means a debate and vote in Parliament, followed by a change in the law if MPs backed the motion. In reality, Commons leader Sir George Young writes to the committee, asking them to consider a debate and a vote, which has no binding impact at all on Government policy. The chairman said ministers had suggested doubling the threshold for signatures, but admitted doing so would prompt public ‘outrage’. Mr Cameron speaks at the despatch box ahead of the debate about an EU referendum, where he suffered the worse rebellion of his career . ‘They can’t raise the threshold: I think that would just send the signal to the public that politicians and Parliament can’t be trusted, when e-petitions were brought in to address that problem in the first place,’ she said. Senior MPs are understood to be proposing a system similar to Scotland’s, in which a special unit corresponds with people proposing e-petitions and discusses whether the issue would be best addressed with a debate, a select committee inquiry or an amendment to a Bill. Labour’s petition website, which was not accompanied by the right to trigger issues for consideration by the Commons, was suspended ahead of the general election and then shelved by the Coalition. It too hosted a series of highly embarrassing campaigns, including demands for former prime minister Gordon Brown to resign. A Downing Street spokesman said there were ‘no current plans’ to change the system, adding: ‘100,000 remains the qualifying threshold for a referral to the backbench business committee.’","Consider raising signature threshold from 100,000 .

Kristen Stewart has cheated on Robert Pattinson with a married filmmaker twice her age, it has been claimed. The Twilight actress, 22, is said to have enjoyed an affair with Snow White And The Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders, 41. As Kristen prepared to spread her wings from the vampire franchise, she joined forces with the father-of-two to work on his $170m feature debut - which was released just last month. Wife Liberty Ross, 33, played Queen Eleanor - Stewart's mother in the box office hit. Scroll down for video . Infidelity? Us Weekly have claimed to have photographic proof that Kristen Stewart cheated on boyfriend Robert Pattinson . It has been reported that last Tuesday, Kristen was . caught in the arms of Rupert - with celebrity magazine Us Weekly claiming to have . photographic evidence. Kristen can be seen wrapped in the arms of a man alleged to be Sanders on the cover of this week's issue of the American magazine. In another snap, Rupert appears to nestle into Kristen's shoulder, even nibbling or offering a kiss as they were captured at Pacific View Trail - a lookout point with a view of the Hollywood sign. A series of shots sees the pair caught in an embrace as the smiling actress leans against a ledge, while clutching her baseball cap, with Rupert gravitating towards her with open arms. But perhaps the most unsettling pictures are those taken from inside a parked car, where Stewart and Sanders seem to be kissing. While the brunette's face is turned from the camera, her hairstyle and profile resemble the real K-Stew, with her white tank top and neon yellow bra strap showing, as in the other pictures. The not-so-happy couple? Kristen Stewart, 22, is alleged to have cheated on Robert Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, 41 - despite posing together on Sunday at the Teen Choice Awards . Married man: Rupert can be seen with his wedding ring at a Snow White screening in Los Angeles in May . Kristen's head is tilted as Rupert's eyes are closed and their heads come together. As they drive away, Kristen puts her baseball cap back on and both cover their faces in shades. A photographer told Us Weekly: 'He was all over her. (They) would only take a break when they thought someone was walking by. It seemed like they couldn't get enough.' It is believed Kristen may have avoided being photographed if not for the timing of a phone call. While driving back to her $6m Los Feliz home, that she has shared with Pattinson since last September, she answered her mobile and headed off in the other direction. It was then that a photographer followed her black Mini Cooper to 'the back lot of a deserted building plastered with For Lease signs' that he captured the couple. And People.com also reported the story, saying: 'Kristen is absolutely devastated. It was a mistake and a . complete lapse in judgement. She wasn't having an affair with Rupert. 'It was just a fleeting moment that . shouldn't have happened. She never meant to hurt anyone. She's a good . person who just made a bad choice.' Insiders have made the allegations to both Us Weekly and celebrity website People.com.

At the time, the 26-year-old told The Sun: 'It is extremely difficult but we are together, yes. We can't arrive at the same time because of the fans. It goes crazy. 'This . was supposed to be a public appearance as a couple but it's impossible. We are here together and it's a public event but it's not easy. We have . to do all this stuff to avoid attention.'

The news will come as a shock after British actor Pattinson hinted he wanted to marry Kristen. Speaking to BlackBook, he explained: 'There was a magazine, with these pictures, saying I was getting married. No one ever knows what is true or what isn’t. 'Even my own mum called to ask me if it was true. It’s not. At least, not yet. But it is true that Kristen has always done something to me that others haven’t.' And in her most recent interview, with the June issue of Elle magazine, Kristen said she was getting tired of her 'boring' life, and wanted something 'bad' to happen to her. She said: 'You can learn so much from bad things. I feel boring. I feel like, ""Why is everything so easy for me?"" I can't wait for something crazy to f***ing happen to me. Just life.

She later followed this with another retweet, this time quoting American author and poet Maya Angelou, saying: 'If you find it in your heart to care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.' Liberty then simply wrote: 'WOW'. Following her tweets, Liberty appeared to have deleted her Twitter account.

Great grandmother Dorothy Blades shows off the walking stick she used to see off an attempted mugger . Shuffling down the street with a walking stick, Dorothy Blades must have seemed like an easy target. But when a crook tried to snatch the 79-year-old's handbag, the unflinching great-grandmother had other ideas. Mrs Blades - who is disabled with Parkinson's disease - wasted no time in putting up a fight and promptly clobbered him round the ear with her walking stick. Stunned by the pensioner's reaction, the cowardly man took flight empty-handed down the street, Burnley, Lancashire. Still unphazed by the ordeal, the widow says her only regret was that she 'didn't hit him harder' with the aluminium walking stick. Widow Mrs Blades, who uses the stick to steady herself when she walks, said it was her 'instinct' to 'clobber' the man. 'You have to stand up for yourself and I would do the same again, only harder. You should be entitled to walk down the street without being mugged,' she added. 'I surprised myself when I did it, but I don’t regret it. My only regret is not hitting him hard enough.' Mrs Blades was walking alone in the town centre when she was approached by the scruffy looking man. As he grabbed her handbag, she screamed out and he then tried to grab her jacket. But the pensioner, who has 12 grandchildren and eight great grandchildren, fended him off with her stick. The retired weaver, who lives in the Brunshaw area of Blackburn, said: 'He was coming towards me on the street but I didn’t really think anything of it. I was on my way to see my son who works in that area. 'As he got alongside me he moved towards me and grabbed my coat and then tried to pull my bag off my shoulders. 'The bag was across my other shoulder so there was a bit of a struggle, but I wasn’t going to let go. I was saying ''get off, get off, leave me alone. It isn’t yours''. 'He then started to try and unzip my bag but he did the wrong zip, it went on for about five or six minutes, he wouldn’t let it go, so in the end I just clobbered him. 'I was very, very shaken, I was frightened to death and it was just instinct.' The man, who was white, slim with a gaunt face, ran off along Plumbe Street close to the town centre following Tuesday’s attack at around 12.30pm. He  is described as white, 5’6'' to 5’8'' tall with fair hair. He was wearing a scruffy brown jacket, jeans, black shoes or trainers. She then made her way to her son Stephen’s work place, Tool Options, before police were called. Dorothy, who has another son Keith and two daughters Diane and Lesley, said she would do the same again. She said: 'I’m one of 12 brothers and sisters and I’m the smallest so I had to be tough. I wasn’t going to let him take my purse. Brave: Widow Mrs Blades has Parkinson's disease but used her stick to send the man fleeing on his heels. She said she would 'do the same again, only harder' Crime: Plumbe Street in Burnley, Lancashire, where Mrs Blades was walking alone when the man approached her and tried to snatch her bag. Police appealed for witnesses to come forward . 'In some ways I feel sorry for him, but I blame the parents for allowing him to get in this state. I hope he gets comeuppance now.' Since the incident Dorothy has had goodwill visits from her neighbours and friends, including her 83-year-old partner Tom Wynstanley. Burnley MP Gordon Birtwistle said: 'It shows great bravery and spirit to stand up to someone like that so well done on her. 'Like her I am just sorry she didn’t clock him harder, but it’s good she managed to get a good description of the man and hopefully justice will be done.' The man is described as white, 5ft 6ins to 5ft 8ins tall, slim, with a gaunt face and fair hair. He was wearing a scruffy brown jacket, jeans, black shoes or trainers. Lancashire Police said they were appealing for witnesses to the attempted mugging. Detective Sergeant Nick Hodgeson said: 'The lady was extremely shook up and distressed by the ordeal and we would appeal to the public for information to help identify her attacker. 'Another man stood further away on Plumbe Street was seen by the victim; however his identity is as yet unknown. Police would like to speak to this individual and urge him to come forward.'","Widow Dorothy Blades struggled with mugger for five to six minutes .

Amish children raised on rural farms in northern Indiana suffer from asthma and allergies less often even than Swiss farm kids, a group known to be relatively free from allergies, according to a new study. 'The rates are very, very low,' said Dr. Mark Holbreich, . the study's lead author. 'So there's something that we feel is even . more protective in the Amish' than in European farming communities. Healthy: A study compared Amish children in Indiana to children on farms in Switzerland, where most of the Amish originated . What it is about growing up on farms -- and Amish farms in particular -- that seems to prevent allergies remains unclear. Researchers have long observed the so-called 'farm effect' -- the low allergy and asthma rates . found among kids raised on farms -- in central Europe, but less is . known about the influence of growing up on North American farms. Holbreich, an allergist in Indianapolis, has been . treating Amish communities in Indiana for two decades, but he noticed . that very few Amish actually had any allergies. As studies on the farm effect in Europe began to emerge . several years ago, Holbreich wondered if the same phenomenon might be . found in the United States. He teamed up with European colleagues to compare Swiss farming children and non-farming children to Amish kids in Indiana. Just five percent of Amish children had allergies, compared to 11.2 percent of all Swiss children . Amish families, who can trace their roots back to . Switzerland, typically farm using methods from the 1800s and they don't . own cars or televisions. The researchers surveyed 157 Amish families, about . 3,000 Swiss farming families, and close to 11,000 Swiss families who did . not live on a farm -- all with children between the ages of six and 12. They found that just five percent of Amish kids had . been diagnosed with asthma, compared to 6.8 percent of Swiss farm kids . and 11.2 percent of the other Swiss children. Similarly, among 138 Amish kids given a skin-prick test . to determine whether they were predisposed to having allergies, only 10 . kids -- or seven percent -- had a positive response. In comparison, 25 percent of the farm-raised Swiss kids . and 44 percent of the other Swiss children had a positive test, the . researchers report in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The study did not determine why the kids who grew up on . farms were less likely to develop asthma and allergies, but other . research has pointed to exposure to microbes and contact with cows, in . particular, to partially explain the farm effect. Drinking raw cow's milk also seems to be involved, Holbreich said. The going theory is this early exposure to the diverse . potential allergens and pathogens on a farm trains the immune system to . recognize them, but not overreact to the harmless ones. As for why the Amish kids have even lower allergy and . asthma rates than the other farming kids, 'that piece of the puzzle we . really haven't explained,' Holbreich told Reuters Health. He speculated that it could be at least partly a result of the Amish having larger families or spending even more time outside or in barns than people on more modern working farms. Dr Corinna Bowser, an allergist in Cherry Hill, New . Jersey, said there's also a possibility that inherited factors could . play a role. 'The Amish are still of a limited genetic pool, I would . assume, because they're much more segregated than the Swiss kids are,' she told Reuters Health. Holbreich said upcoming studies will further . investigate the differences between the farming groups, with an eye . toward designing possible interventions. For instance, pregnant mothers or young children could . be exposed to the mysterious factors that seem to protect farm kids as a . preventive treatment, he explained. 'The goal is to try to find a way to prevent this . allergy and asthma epidemic that western populations are facing,' Holbreich said.","Study compared children on Amish farms in Indiana to children in Switzerland, where most Amish originate .

Now, . after £9,000 bariatric surgery to reduce the size of her stomach, . carried out on the NHS, Michelle, is a healthy 12st . and is finally able to enjoy a decent night’s sleep, thanks to the fact that her dramatic weight loss has helped prevent the collapse of the upper airways that causes the breathing stoppages. Michelle said: 'I would just never sleep at night time, which meant I would doze off anywhere, anytime during the day. 'It started when we went on holiday over 10 years ago. I constantly felt tired, but didn’t think it was anything serious. Suffocating: Michelle's sleep apnoea meant she stopped breathing for more than 10 seconds at a time up to 666 times a night . 'But it got worse and worse, I had no energy and just piled on the weight. 'The scariest point was falling asleep cutting a customer’s hair. It was awful. It would also happen in front of my friends. 'Sometimes they would spray cold water in my face to wake me up. I was so embarrassed.' Michelle . would fall asleep whilst holding hot drinks or travelling on the bus . and would often fall off the sofa in front of her daughter’s friends. The condition even caused her to drop the scissors she was holding and nod off while she was cutting a client’s hair. Embarrassment forced her to give up work completely and the irregular rest saw her self esteem fall to an all time low. Michelle ended up gorging on comfort foods, eventually tipping the scales at 171 kilos in 2008. Medics discovered she had just 35 per cent of the the oxygen she required in her lungs meaning she struggled to walk and was forced to sit down to do any household chore. With little energy and a body mass index of 59, she agreed to the life-saving weight loss surgery in 2009. Sleep apnoea is a reduction or pause of breathing during sleep for 10 seconds or more. Doctors at University Hospital of North Staffordshire said they had never seen a case of the condition as bad as Michelle’s. She said: 'I also suffered from polycystic ovaries and was mentally and physically exhausted all the time. 'I became a prisoner in my own home. I was just a recluse by the end, I was so big I couldn’t do anything. My self esteem was just so low, I would cry all the time. 'I would sit on a stool to do anything and didn’t go up the stairs at home for years. If I needed anything, I would get the kids to go. 'To do my washing I would wheel myself in a chair from the washing machine to the dryer. Walking a few paces was a nightmare. 'When they gave me a year to live I knew I had to have the operation.' Now that she is 15 stone lighter, Michelle still keeps a pair of size 30 shorts in her wardrobe as a reminder of her former miserable existence. She says her children Jade, 19, and Carl, 17, have enjoyed seeing her change her habit of calling out for takeaways most nights of the week - after she had no energy to cook. Husband Carl, senior, 42, had also became overweight and was frustrated at having to do all of the family’s shopping. After weighing 15 stone having given birth to her two kids, Michelle said the condition overtook her attempts to be slimmer. Unhealthy: Michelle Shufflebotham's sleep apnoea affected her health so much that she gained 27st and fell asleep up to 20 times a day - even when standing up . She admits she was in denial about . her weight and by 2007 would just focus on what she would eat next to . ignore her tiredness and health problems. She said: 'I was a bad yo-yo dieter. I would go to the slimming classes, lose a stone, then give up and gain three back on. 'As . a family we’re all now a lot healthier than we used to be. But I was . just lazy. My friends never had the heart to say you need to do . something. 'When my daughter’s friends saw me fall asleep and fall off the sofa they were in fits of laughter. 'The . few times I went out I would get a taxi, sit on a stool for a few hours . where I had gone to and come home again extremely depressed. 'Getting clothes to fit me was expensive and I lost so much pride in my appearance that I would slob round the house in a big nightie most of the day. 'It was only when I went to my GP and burst into tears that we started to get the ball rolling to having the operation.' Michelle now loves clothes shopping, going for nights out again and hitting the gym three times a week after the successful surgery. She has also returned to her job cutting the hair of friends and family and hopes to return to full-time work at a salon soon. Declined: As Michelle's weight crept, up her problems increased. Eventually a doctor told her she had just one year left to live - and she decided to go for gastric surgery to reduce the size of her stomach . But she is shocked she would now not qualify for the NHS procedure in the future if new rules are brought in because she does not suffer from a range of other illnesses. She said: 'As this is such a life-saver I cannot believe the health bodies are thinking about reducing the number of people likely to have the procedure. 'I can’t believe that only two years ago I was always falling asleep on the bus and having to sit on a stool to cut someone’s hair. 'I owe my life to the bariatric surgery and all those at the hospital who treated me. 'If this rule change goes through then I will feel so sorry for those who will miss out because it was the best thing to happen to me.'","Michelle Shufflebotham would stop breathing a shocking 666 times a night .

However the stuff of science fiction could soon become a reality following the revelation of proposals . to begin mining asteroids to guarantee the human race's prosperity. A . team of scientists are to unveil plans for the new space venture - and the project has the backing of Hollywood film maker and . explorer James Cameron. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cosmic quarry: A team of scientists have unveiled plans to mine asteroids for their raw materials . As well as the Hollywood director, other investors include chiefs from internet giant Google and a former software architect for computer corporation Microsoft. Details of the proposed space mission are to be officially launched on Tuesday, by start-up company Planetary Resources. The proposals will be unveiled at a press conference at the Museum of Flight in Seattle which will also be available to view online. The company's objectives are to be twofold: the mining of natural resources and space exploration, with the aim of selling the raw materials it extracts from the asteroids and adding trillions of dollars to the global GDP. Backing: Film maker and explorer James Cameron (left) is supporting the project, as is billionaire Charles Simonyi (right) Untapped resource: NASA scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in asteroids could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural resources . Space man: Entrepreneur Peter Diamandis . The shortage of sources for raw . materials on the planet has caused global inflation to spike in recent . years causing tensions to rise between nations, experts have said. NASA . scientists say the high concentration of raw materials found in . asteroids - such as ingredients for fuel and precious metals like iron . and platinum - could supply Earth with vital stockpiles of natural . resources. Space entrepreneurs Peter Diamandis and Eric Anderson are just two of the names behind Planetary Resource. In a press release, the company announced its intentions to create 'a new industry in space and a new definition . of natural resources'. Diamandis and Anderson - both known for their aspirations for commercial space exploration - will host the launch event along with two former NASA officials. A driving force behind the Ansari . X-Prize competition to spur on non-goverment space flight, Diamandis has . made no secret of his goal to one day become an asteroid miner. In an interview earlier this year with Forbes magazine, he said: 'The earth is a crumb in a supermarket of resources. 'Now we finally have the technology to . extract resources outside earth for the benefit of humanity without . having to rape and pillage our planet.' Hollywood film maker James Cameron is no stranger to daring exploration. Just . last month the director of Titanic and Avatar became the first solo . diver to  reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep - the deepest point on . Earth. Radical concept, but old idea: Experts believe it is only now that we have the ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near-Earth asteroids . Straight out of a sci-fi film: A scene from the movie Armageddon, where Bruce Willis's character is sent into space to mine an asteroid before it hits the Earth . It might seem like a radical concept, but scientists have been toying with the idea of mining asteroids for their natural resources for longer than the space program has been running. Experts believe it is only now that we have the technology and ability to discover and characterise a sufficient number of small near-Earth asteroids (NEA). The mining could yield a large amount of water - frozen inside the asteroids - oxygen and metals which could not only be brought back to Earth but could help further space exploration by allowing humans to fuel spacecraft and build space stations. Nasa believes capturing placing an NEA . in lunar orbit could provide a unique, meaningful and easy-to-reach . destination for exploration by astronaut crews in the next decade. It is only now that the . sufficiently-powerful electric propulsion systems necessary to transport . a captured NEA are becoming available. Mining asteroids could take several forms. This includes sending humans in a . spacecraft to an asteroid to explore and mine it. Another possible scenario could involve launching a robotic spacecraft to either to mine an . asteroid directly or transport it closer to Earth so it could be reached by humans more easily. Extracting raw materials, such as iron and nickel, from the space rocks is a possibility that has been discussed for decades. However, the obstacles for such a mission has always been the cost, sufficient scientific expertise and technical prowess. It could cost tens of billions of dollars - and could take well over a decade - for astronauts to successfully land on an asteroid, NASA experts have said in the past.

An experienced midwife whose 'catastrophic mistakes' led to the death of a baby boy has told an inquest: 'I will regret what happened for the rest of my life.' Julie Richards was speaking after a coroner heard how 'gross failure' at an NHS hospital caused Noah Tyler to be starved of oxygen, a condition from which he never recovered. The inquest heard that Noah died aged 10 months because of errors made during his birth at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Neglected: Noah Tyler died because of 'gross failure' at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, a coroner ruled . Problems during the birth also put the life of Noah's mother, Colleen Tyler, 31, in danger, the inquest in Cardiff was told. Mrs Tyler and her husband Hywel are suing the hospital for negligence. Mrs Richards, who had 13 years' experience of delivering babies, admitted to making 'catastrophic mistakes' by failing to take action when Noah’s heart rate was dangerously high. 'With hindsight I would have acted differently,' she said. 'I don’t know if I looked at the heart scan properly. 'If I had I would have sent her (Colleen) immediately upstairs to see specialist doctors. 'The raised heart level could have meant foetal distress but it could have been because the mother was in discomfort. 'I chose the more innocent option.' 'Catastrophic mistakes': Midwife Julie Richards told the hearing she would regret what happened for the rest of her life . She added: 'I will regret what happened for the rest of my life.' Noah was born in the hospital's maternity unit in February last year. Mrs Richards, who no longer works as a midwife, said: 'I thought Colleen was pushing so well and the baby was imminent. 'Her blood pressure was extremely high and I was very concerned with the reading. 'I was wrapped up in the delivery of the baby - I didn’t think we needed to call the specialist neo-natal team. 'When he was born I didn’t expect him to be in the condition he was in. 'He was as bad as a baby could be. He was pale and his heart rate was less than 60 and we took him away to be resuscitated.' Earlier Mrs Tyler sobbed as she told the inquest how she was 'tortured' by the memory of baby Noah’s birth. She said: 'I asked if I needed to push but the midwife told me if I needed to push I would not need to ask. 'She said I would just know but I was totally confused by this. I didn’t know whether I should push or not. 'After three hours they took me out of the birthing pool and put me into a bed. 'I kept asking for an epidural but they didn’t give me one. 'I asked if I needed a doctor but they told me there was no need to get the doctors involved because they would just cut me. 'In the end I told them they should do what they needed to to get my baby out.' Mrs Tyler told the hearing that she knew instantly that something was wrong. 'I was told I would hear him cry when they got him out but I didn’t hear anything,' she said. Tragic: Noah Tyler died aged 10 months after being deprived of oxygen when he was born . 'He was very white, not how I expected him to look. 'No one said anything and I was left feeling confused. I was in a state of shock - I thought: “This cannot be happening”. 'I expected to be holding my baby by then but he wasn’t there. 'I knew from the doctor’s face that something terrible had happened.' Noah was taken to an incubator where he was put on a cooling mat in an attempt to prevent his brain being damaged permanently. Mrs Tyler, who is heavily pregnant, said: 'Nothing could prepare me for what I saw, that little thing lying in the incubator with loads of tubes going into him. Parental love: Problems during Noah's birth also put the life of his mother, Colleen, in danger, the hearing was told . 'I keep replaying the birth in my head and torturing myself. What if I could have done anything different to save Noah? 'The thoughts just go on and on.' Mrs Tyler told how she later saw the midwife on the ward. She said: 'I thanked her for doing everything she could to save Noah which I believed was the truth at the time. 'She didn’t say anything and looked very awkward.' Specialists at the hospital treated Noah for months, but he showed little progress and he was moved to a children’s hospice. He died two days before Christmas last year. Pathologist Alistair Lammy told the inquest: 'Noah’s brain had been irreversibly damaged due to lack of blood and oxygen around or during birth.' Cardiff coroner Mary Hassell said: 'I am very, very concerned with the circumstances surrounding Noah’s death. 'What struck me very forcibly was that we might today be dealing with two deaths rather than one.' Miss Hassell recorded a narrative verdict saying Noah of natural causes 'contributed to by neglect'. She said: 'Noah and his mother suffered gross failure of basic medical attention. There were failures.' Speaking outside court, Mr Tyler said: 'It is because of the failings of one person that my boy isn’t here any more and there’s no reason why he shouldn’t be. 'We know it’s a good unit and the experience we’ve had with our new little boy proves they do know what they’re doing. 'When the coroner said this could have been an inquest around two deaths it hit me like a ton of bricks to think I could be here on my own not with my wife or our new little boy.' The family’s solicitor, Stuart Bramley, said: 'We have heard about changes being made as a result. 'Colleen and Hywel Tyler hope that these changes will prevent other parents from having to live through the same nightmare.' Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has admitted that the level of care to Mrs Tyler and Noah fell below the acceptable standard.

A PCSO who helped organise 'stranger danger' days for school children has today being jailed for abusing two vulnerable young boys. Gary Hastings, 48, was condemned as a 'predatory paedophile' as he was ordered to serve 10 years behind bars. He abused the boys, aged 14 and 15, in his home in Hull, East Yorkshire, over a period of two years. Paedophile: PCSO Gary Hastings 48, had helped to organise school days warning children of the danger of strangers . The PCSO had helped organise a ‘Kids And . Cops’ event for schoolchildren in Immingham, Lincolnshire, where he . advised kids of the danger of strangers during school holidays. The Humberside Police worker resigned from his post when the offences came to light. Today at York Crown Court, the Recorder of York, Judge Stephen Ashurst, told Hastings, who was also a foster carer and had worked with children throughout his life: 'This is in any view an extremely serious case. 'It has been made more serious by the fact that you have offended against two young boys who were vulnerable at the time. 'One of the victims, who was 14 at the time, said in his victim personal statement that you have completely messed up his life. It has left him feeling acutely embarrassed and ashamed.' Jail: Gary Hastings, 48, covers his face as he is led into a prison van after being sentenced to 10 years behind bars at York Crown Court today . Condemned: PCSO Gary Hastings was today jailed for 10 years . Prosecuting, Simon Kealey told the court that Hastings, who became a PCSO with Humberside Police in March 2008, first abused one of his victims, a 14-year-old boy, when he took him on a trip to Newcastle. The defendant met his second victim, 15, on a gay chat website and on their first meeting told Hastings that he was at school and studying his GCSEs. Despite this, Hastings engaged in 25 counts of oral sex and 30 counts of anal sex with the boy. On occasions when the schoolboy arrived to meet Hastings in his school uniform, the court was told, the defendant asked him to change, telling him that he 'didn't want to be thought of as a paedophile'. Judge Ashurst praised the two young victims, who were spared the trauma of giving evidence in court as Hastings pleaded guilty to seven counts of child sex abuse in May. He said: 'This case is an example of the courage of young abuse victims in coming forward. 'There was here a very thorough and painstaking investigation and as a result of the courage shown by both victims, it is a demonstration that that is the only way in which predatory paedophiles can be brought to justice. 'There was a huge disparity in age in this case. You were three times as old as these young boys. 'There was no affection and you have said that you did not find these two young  boys attractive. I do not believe this for a minute. 'The fact that they were underage is a factor in your sexual makeup.' Jailed: PCSO Gary Hastings was ordered to serve 10 years behind bars by Judge Stephen Ashurst, sitting at York Crown Court . In mitigation, Mark McKone said Hastings . had 'destroyed his life' and as a former PCSO and convicted sex offender . he would find prison life 'particularly difficult'. Speaking about Hastings' role as a PCSO, Judge Ashurst said: 'You have undergone training in child protection issues. You must have been aware of the particular risks and dangers with vulnerable teenage boys. 'In these circumstances you took advantage and abused that trust. 'The long term effects of this should not be underestimated. I have much hope that these two boys will be able to rebuild their lives and move on.' Hastings was given a five-year sentence for each of his victims, to run consecutively, meaning he will be jailed for a total of ten years. He was also made subject to a sex offenders prevention order, which limits his contact with children. Superintendent Ray Higgins, head of the Professional Standards Branch at  Humberside Police, said: 'I welcome the sentence that has been handed out today. 'I recognise that Gary Hastings pleaded guilty at a very early stage and so has  prevented his victims from being put through the traumatic experience of a lengthy trial, but nevertheless, it was his appalling abuse of trust that lead to these young men becoming victims and no doubt their experiences will live with them for the rest of their lives. 'Hastings worked for Humberside Police as a PCSO between 2008 and 2011 and  underwent the necessary vetting procedures before being taken on by the force. 'He was suspended from duty in August 2011 when this investigation was underway  and he later then resigned from the force in January of this year.'","Gary Hastings, 48, branded a 'predatory paedophile' as he is jailed for 10 years .

Digital music streaming service Spotify has declared war on Apple's iTunes - and aims to become a 'YouTube' for music. Songs from the streaming service can be embedded easily - for free - in any website, just like YouTube videos. It's a highly aggressive move designed to take on Apple's paid-for 'music shop' with a cheaper alternative. Spotify songs are free to try, but then users pay a subscription. Spotify recently hit 10 million users worldwide after a partnership with Facebook which allowed web users to access Spotify via their Facebook log-in . Spotify's songs are available as streams to all users of the service, whether free or paid, and can also be downloaded to apps on iPhone, Android and PC. Spotify . recently hit 10 million users worldwide after a partnership with . Facebook which allowed web users to access Spotify via their Facebook . log-in. The site now has 3 . million paying subscribers, paying around £10 per month to access the . streaming service via phones and desktops. The digital music market is currently dominated by Apple'siTunes, which offers listeners the chance to buy and keep music track by track. But digital music streaming companies, of which Spotify is the most successful, have begun to challenge that model by offering large libraries of music to listen to and share for a flat fee. Spotify has more than 10 million active users and over 3 million paying subscribers for its on-demand service, which offers unlimited streaming for free to those prepared to tolerate ads, or a premium rate of $10 a month. The European start-up, which is backed by digital entrepreneur and Facebook founding president Sean Parker, has grown fast in recent months since launching in the United States and sealing a partnership with Facebook. Parker has invested $15 million of his estimated $2 billion in the music-streaming company, which is already the number two music service in Europe after iTunes. Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker in the film 'The Social Network': The tech billionaire, who was Facebook's first president, claims that Spotify will overtake Apple's iTunes store within two years if it keeps growing at its current rate . Sean Parker with Kate Almay: The tech entrepreneur is seen as having ushered in the era of internet music with his company Napster . 'If . Spotify continues growing at its current rate in terms of subscribers . and users, we will overtake iTunes in terms of the amount of revenue we . contribute to the music labels in under two years,' says Parker. ‘It's a really smart tactic for Spotify to get new users. It's part of their strategy of becoming the de facto standard for music on the Web,’ music analyst Mark Mulligan said. Spotify announced partnerships on Wednesday with web publishers including The Guardian, Vogue and The Huffington Post, and with blogging platform Tumblr. Spotify now has 10 million signed-up users and 2.5 million paying subscribers. CEO Daniel Ek points out that subcribers pay £120 a year, whereas customers of iTunes store only pay £60 on average . Readers who are not registered Spotify users will have to sign up to an app that will run in the background, but will not have to leave the publisher's site. ‘YouTube got to where it is today because people are able to embed YouTube videos easily in any website,’ Giles Cottle, principal analyst at research firm Informa Telecoms & Media, wrote in a note. ‘Any web developer will tell you that, in an online world, you have to offer and bring content to people where they want to be, not make them come to where you are.’","Streaming service is already number two after iTunes .

Police evidence about the links between murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko and British intelligence will be heard in secret, a court was told yesterday. Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 allegedly while having tea with former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovturn at a central London hotel in 2006. It has been claimed that both MI5 and MI6 had regular contact with the former security officer about his work in Russia. But parts of a Scotland Yard investigation into these links will not be made public during the inquest into his death, at the Government’s request. 'We'll get justice': Marina Litvinenko (left), widow of murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko (right), speaks to members of the media as she leaves a hearing into his death in London on Thursday . A pre-inquest hearing yesterday was . told the police evidence might reveal whether his death was a ‘targeted . assassination’ carried out by agents of the Russian state. The Daily Mail has led criticism of . Government plans to allow ‘closed material procedures’, in which cases . can be conducted behind closed doors in any civil or inquest hearing. While lying stricken in a London . hospital bed, Mr Litvinenko said Moscow ordered his death because of his . opposition to government officials, including President Vladimir Putin. Widow: Mrs Litvinenko (right) speaks to a man and woman following a hearing into the death of her husband . Hugh Davies, counsel for the inquest, . told yesterday’s hearing in central London that the contents of the . police report are known to his team and to the coroner, Sir Robert Owen. But they will not be disclosed to the . other interested parties represented at the inquest, at the request of . the Government. This evidence will be redacted, or blacked out. Mr Davies said: ‘Claims have been made . that Mr Litvinenko had contact with British intelligence prior to his . death. The Metropolitan Police Service made an inquiry into these . claims. ‘Pending the outcome of the disclosure . exercise currently under way, the product of these inquiries, which are . known to you sir and counsel and solicitors to the inquest, has been . redacted from the report at the request of Her Majesty’s Government. ‘This redaction should not be taken as indicating one way or the other whether Mr Litvinenko did indeed have any such contact.’ Statement: Mrs Litvinenko speaks to members of the media as she leaves the hearing into the death of her husband, who died from polonium poisoning in London in 2006 . Mr Litvinenko, who had been granted . political asylum in the UK, was allegedly poisoned at the Millennium . Hotel in Grosvenor Square on November 1, 2006. He died in hospital three . weeks later. The full inquest is due finally to begin early next year. Sir Robert, a High Court judge, said . he endorsed the comments of the original coroner who opened the case . that it was in the ‘public, national and international’ interests to . examine allegations the Russian authorities ordered Mr Litvinenko’s . death. Ben Emmerson QC, representing Mr . Litvinenko’s widow Marina and son Anatoli, said that if such claims were . true it would mean Russia was behind ‘state-sponsored nuclear terrorism . on the streets of London’. Scotland Yard and the Crown . Prosecution Service have both named Lugovoy and Kovtun as their prime . suspects, but Russia has refused to extradite them. Both deny . involvement. Outside court, Mrs Litvinenko said: ‘I . believe we will get justice in Britain – we need the truth. Any truth . is very important for all of us, my friends, my family and the public. It was a British citizen killed here, a British soul, a killing that had . never happened before.’","Alexander Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned drinking tea in London in 2006 .

A man who forced his three grandsons on a series of grueling Grand Canyon treks has been jailed for just 27 months - because the judge said he could tell he loves his young relatives. Christopher Alan Carlson, 45, made the trio of overweight boys, aged eight, nine and 12, walk on a 15 mile and then a 19 mile hike in 100 degree temperatures in August last year. He thought trekking in the extreme heat 'would get them into shape' - and punished them for going too slow by kicking or hitting them. After the hikes, the Indianapolis 'fitness freak' only allowed his hungry charges to eat healthy food like tofu, hummus and veggie burgers. He was handed the minimum possible sentence and, because he has already served 10 months behind bars, could be out in under a year. U.S. District Judge Frederick Martone said the fact Carlson 'obviously cares very much for his grandchildren' led to the lighter punishment. He also said that Carlson's suffering of attention-deficit disorder and hyperactivity for his whole life had spared him from being locked up for the maximum of 17 years. Carlson told the court he would never hurt his grandchildren and that he just wanted to show them the beauty of the Grand Canyon. Shackled at the hands and ankles, and dressed in a black-and-white prison uniform, he said: 'I love my grandchildren greatly. Rugged: Carlson took his three grandsons on two 19-mile hikes through the Grand Canyon in August last year . 'I wanted to afford these children a beautiful opportunity at a young age to experience something magnificent.' Carlson is such a young grandfather because he had his first child - Tara Danaher, the mother of the boys - when he was just 15. Danaher was 17 when her oldest was born. In all, Carlson has five children, all with different mothers. The boys are now living with their grandmother in Indiana. They said they love their grandfather and loved spending last summer traveling to various countries with him. But the oldest boy Kevin also testified to jurors that he secretly asked a hiker to call emergency medical services towards the end of the final hike after he began throwing up. He also fell down because of cramping and experienced changes to his vision. Torture: The boys were given no food and water from sunrise to sunset . He said: 'I needed medical attention and I was hurting. He was hitting and pushing me and calling me fat. I was scared and it was hard and I was all weak and tired and kind of hurt.' The middle boy, Micah, said he suffered excruciating pain from the blisters on the bottom of his feet, later undergoing treatment that is usually used for burn victims. And the youngest, Kameron, joined his two siblings in saying their grandfather kicked them repeatedly with steel-toed boots and threw them into cactuses. He also choked, pinched, pushed and squeezed them. The court heard how a ranger with binoculars spotted the group during that day's hike, the same day a man died on another trail from heat exposure. The ranger reported seeing Carlson shoving the oldest boy and whipping him with a rolled-up t-shirt. Once they caught up with them, rangers fed and gave the boys water after one showed symptoms of heat stroke and the other two had signs of heat exhaustion and dehydration. During trial, defence attorney Jeffrey Williams portrayed Carlson as an active health nut who had a firm hand and wanted to show the boys the world. Prosecutors told jurors that Carlson deprived the boys of food and water during the hikes. The boys reported that they did get some water, but not always enough, and ate celery and other snacks during the hike. A jury found Carlson guilty in February of three counts of child abuse stemming from the August 28 hike, but not guilty of any abuse on the August 15 hike.","Christopher Carlson, 45, handed minimum sentence possible .

Concerns over the health of China's future leader Xi JinPing have been allayed after he was seen holding high-level talks with the U.S. foreign secretary today. After spending a fortnight out of public view vice president Xi today hosted a meeting with U.S. defence secretary Leon Panetta to crush rumours that he had suffered a heart attack or a stroke which would throw the succession process into chaos. Mr Xi and Mr Panetta met for more than an hour to discuss U.S.-China military relations, said Pentagon press secretary George Little. Concerns over the health of China's future leader Xi JinPing have been allayed after he was seen holding high-level talks with the U.S. foreign secretary Leon Panetta . Mr Panetta said the meeting went over the allotted 45 minutes because Mr Xi was focused on finding a way to improve relations. 'Frankly my impression was that he was very healthy and very engaged,' he told reporters later in the day. Video of the talks shot by state broadcaster CCTV showed Mr Xi shaking Panetta's hand, posing for photos and smiling during their conversation. The report made no mention of his prolonged absence. Mr Panetta's visit comes at a sensitive time for China with relations with the U.S. and regional neighbours delicately balanced. Mr Xi was seen for the first time in two weeks on Saturday when he appeared at an event for a national science promotion day and his health was closely scrutinized during today's meeting. Mr Xi and Mr Panetta met for more than an hour to discuss U.S.-China military relations, said Pentagon press secretary George Little . In addition to being China's vice president, Xi is also a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission that oversees the 2.3million-member People's Liberation Army, and is due to take over as head of the ruling Communist Party later this year and as president in the spring. In keeping with its secretive one-party political system, Beijing has offered not a shred of information about why Xi was not seen in public, triggering speculation he had injured his back or suffered a heart attack or stroke. Some had questioned whether he had fallen foul of President Hu Jintao or other top leaders, reflecting continuing uncertainty surrounding the succession and lingering political fallout from the downfall of a charismatic leader, Bo Xilai. China has not even announced dates for the congress that will install Xi and other top leaders, an event held every five years that last time began in mid-October. Mr Xi's health was closely scrutinized during the meeting for any clues . about his prolonged absence, which ended on Saturday when he appeared at an . event for national science promotion day . That has led to speculation that the party has yet to agree on the makeup of the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee or even whether to reduce it in size from nine to seven seats. Other crucial matters also remain up in the air, including what, if any, political reforms to embark on amid a rapidly slowing economy and growing social unrest. More than ever, finding common ground among the party's various constituencies appears to be a daunting task. 'The delay apparently does suggest anything but a smooth transition of power, namely, the extraordinary difficulty of reaching consensus on the composition of the Politburo, including the Standing Committee, as well as how to handle factional politics that has never been so acute,' said Warren Sun, a China expert at Australia's Monash University. The delegation led by U.S. Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta, centre . left, and the Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, centre, pose before a . meeting at the Great Hall in Beijing . The party has also yet to announce how it plans to handle the still-popular Bo, whose wife Gu Kailai was convicted last month of murdering a British businessman and whose former police chief and top lieutenant Wang Lijun was tried this week on charges including bribery and attempting to defect to the U.S. Bo is widely expected to face an eventual trial, although it isn't known on what charges, and he remains under party investigation for unspecified grave violations of discipline. Harsh punishment could spark a backlash from supporters in the party, the military and the public, while failure to discipline Bo would underscore weakness in the legal system and among the leadership. Xi is facing 'enormous hurdles to establish a highly unified leadership team,' Sun said.","Vice president Xi hosted meeting with U.S. defence secretary Leon Panetta .

Class concerns: Lisa Marie Presley said she did not want to send her children to school until they were five or six . In an interview on Radio 2, she told presenter Jo Whiley: ‘I am reluctant to send them to school. I just don’t want to shove them off so early.’ The 44-year-old believes that British children join the education system too early. ‘I’m stunned when I see the age range,’ she said. ‘I understand working parents need to do it, but I don’t want to lose them that quick. I’ll go crazy when they all go to school as I won’t know what to do.’ Legally, children in the UK do not have to start school until the term after they turn five.

Famous feckless father Keith MacDonald, known to the public having allegedly sired 15 children with 14 women is being sought by police for attacking his ex-partner. He was given the nickname ‘Sunderland Shagger’ after leaving a trail of pregnant women in his wake, was found guilty of headbutting ex-girlfriend Stephanie Jubb. MacDonald, 27, failed to appear at Sunderland Magistrates’ Court yesterday and the case was heard in his absence. Love rat Keith MacDonald has been charged with assault of his former girlfriend. MacDonald has hit the headlines multiple times for fathering an alleged 15 children with 14 mothers and letting the state pay the bill . This is not the first time MacDonald, who relies on benefits, has attacked one of his partners. In 2008, he was given a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to undertake an anger management course after assaulting Bec Wright who gave birth to his daughter, Clio, in the same year. Defence barrister Gavin Sword told the court the reason for MacDonald’s absence was that he lost his train ticket from his new home in Stoke and was unable to afford a new one. The court heard how the victim and MacDonald had begun their relationship in 2005 but by 2006 the couple were no longer living together. Describing their on-off relationship, . which saw them break up for the last time in 2009, Stephanie Jubb said: . ‘It was the end of 2011 when I heard from him again. ‘He said that he was getting older. At first I didn’t think it was a good idea but he kept in regular contact.’ Victim: Stephanie Jubb, mother of unemployed serial love rat Keith MacDonald's 5th child and victim of the assault . By February 2012 the couple were living together yet again, however at around 5pm on March 1 this year an argument over a ‘toastie’ ended violently. MacDonald’s former girlfriend said: ‘He came back and I could smell alcohol on his breath and his eyes were quite bloodshot. ‘He was fine he was chatty, he made himself a toastie and went to go upstairs to eat it. ‘I told him “you’re not eating that upstairs, I’ve just hovered.” ‘He then threw the toastie and the plate on the kitchen table and shouted “F*** it!”’ MacDonald then went upstairs to their bedroom and was overheard saying: ‘I’m going back to my house.’ Angered by what she had heard, Miss Jubb went upstairs to confront MacDonald and to get his attention she unplugged his X-Box games console. In retaliation MacDonald ran downstairs and threw his girlfriend’s Nintendo Wii console across the room. Describing the following assault, the victim sobbed in the stand. She said: ‘He started to throw his arms around, he started to contort his face up which I knew would usually be when he was going to lose his temper. ‘I grabbed hold of him by the arms and said “What are you doing? Calm down.” ‘I let go of Keith and Keith let go of my arm.’ However MacDonald renewed his attack on Miss Jubb headbutting her after she tried to prevent him from pushing past her. MacDonald pictured with Bec Wright and their daughter Clio. Keith MacDonald attacked Bec Wright and her mother in 2008 and was given a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to undertake an anger management course . The victim said: “Keith grabbed hold of me by both of my arms and headbutted me in the face. ‘There was pain in my nose and my eyes started to water, I didn’t know at the time that my nose was bleeding. ‘I only noticed the blood on my t-shirt when I got next door.’ Miss Jubb ran for help from their next-door-neighbour Paul Gascoigne where they alerted the police. Speaking at court yesterday, Mr Gascoigne said: ‘(She) virtually fell into the house when my mother opened the door. ‘We took her in and she was hysterical. The girl was bleeding a lot from her nose and she had a cut on the bridge of her nose.’ The police arrived 20 minutes later and escorted the victim back into her house. MacDonald had fled but his female victim immediately spotted that her white Sony Ericsson mobile phone was missing from its usual spot on top of the fridge. Upon further inspection she discovered that £160 of her savings was missing. The victim was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham to be checked over. She was discharged with a laceration to her nose and swelling to her face. She said: ‘I had two black eyes the next day. ‘I felt upset, angry and hurt.’ MacDonald was spotted on the street by duty police officers the next day and he was arrested and taken to Washington Police Station where he was interviewed. He was today found guilty of a count of common assault by beating. He was also found guilty of criminal damage to a Nintendo Wii and theft of cash and a mobile phone. A warrant was made for MacDonald’s arrest.","Father of 15 fails to appear in court .

A woman has been jailed for allegedly stealing thousands of dollars from her own son - while he was serving with the U.S. Army overseas. Police in northeast Ohio said they arrested 42-year-old Jennifer Fletcher on Sunday during a traffic stop. A warrant had been out for her arrest after she allegedly stole state and federal income tax refunds from her son Scott Davis while he was in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mother of all thefts? Police arrested 42-year-old Jennifer Fletcher on Sunday during a traffic stop and charged with stealing thousands from her son, who was serving overseas . Sgt Paul Stanley of the Lawrence Township Police Department told MailOnline that the two had a good relationship and lived together prior to his deployment in 2010, but it has since apparently soured. He said that Fletcher and her son no longer have contact and he has since been re-deployed. The Canton Repository reported that police stopped Fletcher in Brewster after determining the vehicle she was driving had been reported stolen. Court records obtained by the paper showed that Fletcher cashed checks in her son’s name after forging his signature. Soldier: Scott Davis' signature was allegedly forged by his mother as she wrote checks in his name and cashed them . She also allegedly deposited nearly $1,400 of Davis' state and federal income tax refunds into her account to pay her bills. The Repository reported Fletcher is suspected of withdrawing $7,500 from her son's account in 2010 and 2011 and forging his signature to cash checks in his name. Davis' wife noticed something was wrong and reported the theft to police back in May. A warrant was issued for Fletcher's arrest in July. Lawrence Township Police Chief Mark Brink told the paper that Fletcher admitted to stealing the money while she was detained by his officers. Chief Brink said it was 'a good job by our guys getting a confession out of her.' Fletcher was subsequently arrested on charges of theft, identify fraud and forgery. Fletcher was taken to jail, and records listed no attorney for her. Bond has been set at $150.000. Police also arrested Keith Hoover, 44, who had been sharing a home with Fletcher at the time the money was stolen.

Militia loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad were accused of the massacre of more than 200 civilians yesterday after helicopter gunships and tanks attacked a village. The mass killing – the bloodiest since the beginning of the Syrian crisis 17 months ago – was described by Foreign Secretary William Hague as ‘shocking and appalling’. United Nations envoy Kofi Annan also condemned the ‘appalling’ attack. Massacre: More than 250 Syrians were killed yesterday when the village of Tremseh was shelled and stormed by what are thought to have been pro-government forces . UN monitors demanded immediate access . to the village of Tremseh, in the war-torn Hama province, to investigate . what had taken place. The Syrian government denied any . involvement, instead blaming ‘terrorists’. But survivors insisted the . military had attacked from the air and with artillery before . pro-government militia carried out waves of executions. Women, children and the elderly were said to be among the victims. Ongoing conflict: Smoke hovers above Homs after the city was shelled earlier this week . Damage: Black smoke rises from buildings near a mosque in Homs . Horrific: The massacre in the Sunni Muslim village Tremseh, Hama province, would be the worst yet since a rebellion against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad began 17 months ago . But the Syrian state news agency said . the bloodshed was caused by dozens of members of ‘armed terrorist . groups’ who had raided the village and were randomly firing on . residents. Security forces clashed with the armed men, killing and capturing many of them, the report said. It said three soldiers and some  50 . residents were killed. The massacre took place on Thursday, as the UN . Security Council began negotiating a potentially crucial new resolution . on Syria. The mandate for the UN’s observer . mission expires next Friday and council members are locked in debate . about a resolution, which must be passed if the mission is to be . renewed. Tremseh was attacked on Thursday. One . video posted online showed the dead bodies of 15 men lined up on a . floor. Some were covered in blood and had head and chest wounds. Another . showed a young man wailing over the body of an elderly man wrapped in a . blanket in the street. Mr Annan said: ‘I condemn these atrocities in . the strongest possible terms. It is desperately urgent that this . violence and brutality stops and more important than ever that . governments with influence exert it more effectively to ensure that the . violence ends – immediately.’ Mr Hague said he would press the UN . for firmer action and insisted the incident should increase the pressure . for a united response from the international community, including . Russia and China. ‘Everything we have seen of the Syrian . regime’s behaviour over the last 17 months suggests that these reports . are credible,’ he said. ‘They demand a united response from the . international community. The time has come for decisive diplomatic . action to bring about a peaceful end to the violence.’ Activists say more than 17,000 people have so far been killed in the uprising against Assad’s regime, most of them civilians. The Syrian government says more than 4,000 members of the security forces have been killed.","The massacre in Tremseh would be the worst yet since the rebellion .

More of us than ever are living on our own – and it seems that the solo lifestyle could be a cause of poor mental health. A third of Britons live alone. The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show that divorce rates are rising and fewer people are getting married. It is estimated that by 2020, 40 per cent of households will have only one person. But now a study suggests that those living alone are 80 per cent more likely to be depressed than those who co-habit. Shocking: Between 2002 and 2008, those people living alone were 1.8 times more likely to purchase antidepressants . Researchers in Finland followed 1,695 Finnish men and 1,776 women aged between 30 and 65 for seven years, of whom 14 per cent lived alone. Use of antidepressants was monitored simultaneously through national prescription registers. Between 2002 and 2008, those people living alone were 1.8 times more likely to purchase antidepressants. Researchers attributed this discrepancy to a number of reasons. Lack of social support was a major risk factor in men and poverty was more likely to  affect women. The results come as no surprise to experts in the UK. ‘We know that loneliness is a major factor in depression,’ says consultant psychiatrist Dr Adrian Winbow, at Fitzroy Square Hospital in London. Although Britons do not take as many antidepressants as the Finnish, numbers are increasing. ‘I’d suggest about one in 20 Britons is on antidepressants. A large proportion of those are likely to live on their own,’ he says. Impact: Lack of social support was a major risk factor in men and poverty was more likely to affect women . Although it may seem surprising that those of working age are so prone to depression – presumably those with jobs have daily interaction with others – Dr Winbow points out that the current economic climate has put great pressure on employees. ‘If you are lucky enough to have a job, you are probably working longer hours and expectations will be higher,’ he says. ‘This stress is hugely alleviated if you have someone at home with whom you can laugh or complain to. Marriage brings a decreased risk for all psychiatric problems.’ Of course, if you aren’t working then this is an extra reason for low moods. So what can you do? ‘Join a gym or a group in the evenings to improve your social life,’ Dr Winbow suggests. ‘Alternatively get a pet – they are proven to help with psychological problems. Flat-sharing or getting a lodger are also great ways to save money and stay social.’",One in 20 Britons is on antidepressants .

A talented straight-A student died after trying to leap from one icy chalet roof to another at an exclusive Alpine ski resort after he had been drinking, an inquest heard. Edward De Nunzio, 18, was seven weeks into a ten-week course to train as a ski instructor at the New Generation Ski and Snowboard School in Courchevel when he attempted the leap at the end of a night out with friends. However, he suffered serious head injuries after falling down the 16ft drop when jumping from roof to roof with a friend in a 'stupid' prank on February 25. His parents Tony - a former Asda chief executive - and Julie, who live in a £1m house in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, paid tribute to their 'bright and talented' son, who achieved five A-grades at A-Level, after his inquest. Edward was on a gap year . when the tragedy occurred. He had been planning to study geography at . University College, London after gaining his grades at Bootham School in . York. Llyr Hughes worked at the complex in the French ski resort - a favourite with celebrities - and told the inquest today that he had also been drinking when he met Edward who was on his way back from an evening with friends. He said they climbed onto the roofs of buildings near their accommodation, and worked their way along the second floor roofs before they reached a gap. He told Selby Coroners Court: 'I remember we did stop and I think I pointed out this was stupid. It was not something we had done before. 'We were just trying to get back to our chalet along the roofs. I decided we were going to go for it.' The inquest heard the gap between the pitched roofs of the buildings was around 4ft, but the roof they were jumping from was higher than the one they were trying to land on. The accident happened in Courchevel, France (general scene pictured) when he tried to leap from one icy chalet roof to another . Llyr managed to jump the gap, landing on his hands and feet, and 'scrambled' up the roof when he heard Edward land behind him. He said: 'I remember being surprised, turned and saw him standing up, and he just, I don't know if he lost his balance or tripped. As I turned he was standing and just toppled over backwards.' Coroner Rob Turnbull recorded a verdict of accidental death and noted that statements from friends and family showed Edward's behaviour was 'completely out of character'.

"Study found celebrity reinventions are behind women's growing confidence . Women today contrasted with those of the Eighties, who confessed to never reinventing their appearance . By . Rosie Taylor . PUBLISHED: . 08:46 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:20 EST, 17 May 2012 . Celebrities who constantly reinvent themselves have inspired millions of women to dramatically change their appearance, according to new research. High profile queens of reinvention - such as Madonna and Victoria Beckham - have influenced everyday women with an estimated 3.5 million changing their own look after seeing celebrities successfully do the same. And mature masters of reinvention - such as Ann Widdecombe and Esther Rantzen - have inspired older women, who might have previously stuck to a tried-and-tested style, to undergo a complete overhaul of their wardrobes and appearance too. Image overhaul: A sophisticated Victoria Beckham at the Oscars in February 2012, and right, in 2007, with crop, deep tan and push-up bra . Fashion changes at a faster pace these days than ever before, making it easier for women to reinvent themselves. But for today's adventurous women, reinvention means more than trying a new shade of lipstick. Now it involves a complete departure from one look in favour of another. Just as Victoria Beckham changed her blonde crop for brunette bob, and her club-style for ladylike chic, so everyday women are performing such sartorial one-eightys. A total of 2.4 million over 50s will have rebooted their wardrobe ten times before they reach their 60s - ditching the clothes, shoes, make up and accessories associated with certain looks. And it does not just stop at clothes. The study revealed that 3.8m women have radically changed their hair 11 times over the past ten years, experimenting with perms, fringes, bobs and everything in between. A further 2.5 million have dramatically altered their hair colour 12 times in order to reinvent themselves, sporting shades of blonde, black, platinum, grey, red - even purple - in the name of fashion. A study of 1,000 British women for online retailer isme.com found the average British woman experiences an 'eight-year reinvention itch', with 40 per cent of over 50s having changed themselves more in the last ten years than at any other time in their lives. Reasons why women overhaul their image include the desire to escape a fashion rut, cited by nearly one in five of those surveyed, or to be taken seriously int he workplace, a reason cited by one in ten of those surveyed. Queen of reinvention: Over the three decades she has been in the public eye, Madonna has tried every look going, from punk to grunge to ladylike chic . And in the early years: Madonna in the 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan . However, 73 per cent feel the desire to reinvent themselves comes from fashion being so accessible and immediate nowadays - giving ladies more opportunity to continually change how they look regardless of age. The top celebrity chameleons were Madonna (48 per cent), Victoria Beckham (29 per cent) and Lulu (28 per cent). This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson also featured on the list (10 per cent). Figures also revealed two-thirds of mature women in the 1980s had never reinvented their appearance for the duration of their adult lives. Harley Street psychologist, Ingrid Collins, said: 'When we look in the mirror, we expect to see a very familiar image, and we have to do this every day. 'Reinventing our image not only to makes other people sit up and take notice of us, but also allows us to express an aspect of our multifaceted personalities. 'A change of image can mark a milestone in our lives - spelling a renewed sexiness, a youthful attitude, sophistication, rebellion, high self-value; any number of messages that help people around us understand what is going on in our life before we've said a word to them.' Jackie Lewis of isme.com said: 'Women's bodies go through three key phases of change - from adolescence to womanhood, once again when we have had families, and a third time as we pass our late 40s. This also drives the clothes choices we make, whether consciously or subconsciously. 'It's natural to like to experiment in our youth, but as we get older we develop a much stronger sense of personal style and understanding of our bodies.' 1. Madonna (48 per cent)2.

But in one British tourist resort, giant-sized versions of the risque cards are stirring up controversy. Traders in the town of Cleethorpes are calling for the larger-than-life, politically incorrect postcards to be taken down. Nostalgic: The signs were installed for the Cleethorpes in Bloom display but now look set to be taken down . Controversy: Traders in Cleethorpes have reacted furiously to the unveiling of the postcards on the seafront . The posters had originally been put on display to welcome judges to the annual 'Cleethorpes in Bloom' floral show due to be held at the end of July. However, shopkeepers say the nostalgic cards - stationed on council-owned land - are lowering the reputation of the seaside town. Angry: Local shop owner, Phyllis O'Connell, pictured, says that the postcards belong in the past . Phyllis O’Connell, 47, who runs an equestrian shop, said: 'How would you explain these sort of jokes to your five year old grandchild? They are so sexist and rude. 'They have really put people’s backs up. They are bad for business and we should have been consulted before anything was put up there anyway.' A caption on one of the postcards, showing a man ogling two girls in bikinis, reads: 'Looking at the lovely birds'. Whilst another shows one angler saying to another 'That’s what I call a catch' as a woman walks past in a skimpy swim suit. Shock: One shopkeeper says she wants the postcards taken down as she will find it impossible to explain them to her grandchild . Traditional? The giant-sized postcards have been defended by a spokesman for Cleethorpes in Bloom who said that one (pictured right) even promotes recycling . Mark Treacher, 38, who runs a gallery and picture framing business directly opposite the display, also said he found the postcards inappropriate: 'The one with the dog is just obscene and the rest are sexist. 'I have got an eight year old boy and don’t know how I would explain some of them to him. 'They may be 1950s postcards but I do not think they have any place at all in a family resort. Humour: Once a staple of the British seaside, traders are now up in arms over the saucy postcards . 'I would term them obscene and I must have had sixty or seventy complaints already from customers. 'A lot of children come in and out of these shops and we are trying to encourage families to come down here to enjoy the scenery and support local businesses. 'They are certainly not going to enjoy these. I would say it’s beyond a joke but there’s no joke to it as far as I can see.' And, following the complaints, it looks as though the giant postcards - designed by a local artist based on original images - will have to be removed. Ironically, in 1954, Cleethorpes was chosen by the Conservative government of the day to lead a crackdown on rude postcards amid concerns about declining public morals. Local police raided seventeen shops and seized thousands of cards to prepare a case under the 1857 Obscene Publications Act against illustrator Donald McGill, who worked for Bamforth’s, the manufacturer of the postcards. Mr McGill pleaded not guilty but was convicted at a trial at Lincoln Crown Court and fined £50 with £25 costs. Bamforth’s appeared to have the last laugh though - going on to sell some 200 million postcards. The company's current Managing Director Ian Wallace hit back furiously at the calls to take down the signs. He said: 'It seems the po-faced tradition continues to this day in Cleethorpes. 'It would be really said if the placards have to be taken down. There is enough gloom and doom about at the moment. 'It is really unusual for these cards to upset anyone. Our images have been in every national paper and TV and we hardly ever get a complaint. Conventional: A non-controversial Cleethorpes in Bloom sign put up to welcome judges for the floral competition later this month . 'My message would be, to those in Cleethorpes who have complained, is to get a life and start making their visitors smile. People love this stuff and still do.' 'Cleethorpes in Bloom' Vice Chairman Jeff Blanchard insisted the postcards were merely intended as 'a bit of fun'. He said: 'Attitudes have changed since 1954, thank goodness, so it’s a shame people have taken the wrong attitude but the last thing we want to do is offend local people. 'I can see in today’s climate it could be considered sexist but was meant as a bit of fun. 'You can still buy saucy postcards in Cleethorpes and all over the country and most people do not take offence. 'Some people think it lowers the tone of the resort and we should be promoting a more sophisticated image. 'Well, a lot of people in the resort like traditional things like funfair rides and I remember these cards from when I was a little boy.' Two of the posters were also promoting public messages about recycling and clearing up after pets, he added.","The risque postcards, inspired by classic versions from the 1950s, were put up to celebrate Cleethorpes' floral display and impress judges .

This summer’s Olympics will increase the already 'extreme risk' of a flu pandemic spreading in the UK, according to a new report. Britain was ranked second only to Singapore for its vulnerability to the rapid spread of an influenza outbreak. The UK is at such high risk because of its densely-packed cities, highly-mobile population and popularity as a global travel hub, analysts Maplecroft found. Incubator: An extra 800,000 people will be travelling on the Tube this summer . Crowd-control: The Olympic Stadium will receive visitors from all over the world . The study said the London Olympics in July and August will increase the danger of flu spreading because an extra 5.3 million foreign tourists - many from countries where any pandemic is likely to emerge - are expected to visit Britain for the Games. The capital is expected to see almost 800,000 additional people use public transport each day, which is an ideal breeding ground for viruses. Maplecroft’s influenza pandemic risk index rates five countries at 'extreme' risk for the spread of the disease, with Singapore top, followed by the UK, South Korea, the Netherlands and Germany. However, Britain was also judged to be one of the 10 countries best placed to withstand any outbreak thanks to its strong governance, effective health infrastructure and good communications networks. It follows advice from U.S health officials that Americans should get vaccinated against measles before visiting London this summer. The Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention told Olympics fans that ‘disease knows no borders’ and warned . that tourists could unwittingly ‘import’ measles on their return to the U.S. The health body said measles was a . particular problem in western Europe and urged all Americans visiting . London to ensure they had been vaccinated. Last year England and Wales had 1,086 cases of measles. By comparison, the U.S. had 214 cases, . compared to 50 the year before – a rise that officials blamed on ‘a . record number of importations’. The latest report found that South-East Asia was most likely to see a new flu pandemic emerge, with the region containing six of the 10 countries at highest risk. Four nations were considered 'extreme' risk in this category, with Cambodia top, followed by Bangladesh, China and Vietnam. The UK is one of the five countries deemed to be at 'extreme risk' from an influenza pandemic . The authors expressed particular concern about China, whose growing prosperity has led to higher consumption of meat and therefore a rise in livestock numbers. They noted: 'The likelihood that influenza strains will emerge within China takes on extra significance in light of the fact that the country is also highly vulnerable to the spread of disease (it ranks 18th and high risk in Maplecroft’s risk of spread index), which increases the risk of a pandemic outbreak.' Past flu pandemics have caused disaster on a global scale. The 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak killed up to 40 million people, more than the number who died in the First World War. The H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009-10 claimed 457 lives in the UK. Experts believe more severe pandemics may occur in the future, possibly as a result of a mutated bird flu strain.","5.3 million extra foreign tourists expected in UK this summer .

The buzz around Condoleezza Rice becoming Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate has increased significantly after internet pioneer Matt Drudge reported that she is ‘near the top’ of his shortlist. Mr Romney could name his running mate as early as next week, significantly before the traditional time of just before the party convention in late August. He is widely expected to name a safe, unexciting figure in order to keep the focus of the election on President Barack Obama’s record. The next Vice President? Condoleezza Rice allegedly has a good chance of being Mitt Romney's running mate . Ms Rice, President George W. Bush’s . national security adviser for four years and then his Secretary of . State, would be a stunning choice and fly in the face of almost . everything Mr Romney himself and his advisers have indicated they want . in a running mate. Mr Drudge used his Drudge Report . website to tease readers with an ‘exclusive’ story: ‘a surprise name is . now near the top of the list: Former Secretary of State Condoleezza . Rice!’ He added: ‘It was Condi who received . two standing ovations at Romney's Utah retreat a few weeks ago, and . everyone left with her name on their lips.’ The Stanford University professor has . never run for office or faced anything like the intense personal . scrutiny vice-presidential candidates have to go through. She has no . domestic policy experience and has said he favours abortion rights – a . position that would make her anathema to conservatives and some . independent voters. She is very closely associated with . Mr Bush and the unpopular Iraq war and has no executive experience. After the 2008 election, she hinted strongly that she voted for Mr Obama . rather than Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee. Announcement: A Romney spokesman has revealed that the running mate will be chosen soon . Aged 57, Ms Rice has never married . and is seen as something of an introvert. She has repeatedly made clear . over the years that she does not believe she is cut out for the rigours . of a political campaign. The floating of her name could well . be a ploy to shift the subject of political conversation away from Mr . Romney’s record at Bain Capital, which is currently taking a hammering, . and to appeal to women voters, who tend to lean Democratic. As a black . woman, she would also have some appeal to minority voters and . independents. Presidential candidates often . indicate they are considering unusual choices and almost always indicate . that a woman or a minority is under consideration, in large part to . placate different party and voting constituencies. But Mr Romney has strongly indicated . he will go for a middle-aged white man with executive experience or a . Washington track record that goes beyond foreign policy. His advisers are determined to avoid . repeating what they see as the mistake Mr McCain made in 2008 when he . gambled on an inexperienced female – Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska – as . his running mate. Ms Palin’s inability to answer basic . political questions in high-pressure interviews and the drip, drip of . revelations from Alaska of events from her past that had escaped the . notice of Mr McCain’s vetters, who had only given her cursory . consideration, bedevilled and divided his campaign. Close: Ms Rice was a long-standing ally of George W. Bush as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State . Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Tim Pawlenty, former governor of Minnesota, are considered the favourites. Also very much in the running are . Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Governor Bobby Jindal of . Louisiana, while Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Marco . Rubio of Florida are much more likely picks than Ms Rice. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire . and Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico probably have a stronger . chance than Ms Rice. Senator John Thune of South Dakota and Governor Bob . McDonnell of Virginia are also frequently mentioned. Senior Romney foreign policy advisers . like John Bolton, Bush’s hardline ambassador to the UN, are highly . sceptical about Ms Rice’s abilities. The memoirs of Vice President Dick . Cheney, who holds a fundraiser in Wyoming for Romney this week, and . Donald Rumsfeld, depict her unfavourably. Ms Rice spoke to Romney donors at the . Utah retreat last month and was well received. She later told CBS News: . ‘I talked about the need for American leadership; I talked about the . importance of the United States to a more peaceful world, a world that . has been quite turbulent in recent years and needs a strong American . anchor. ‘But I also talked about the essence of America, and perhaps that's what people resonated with.’ In the same interview she dampened . speculation that she might be Mr Romney's running mate: ‘I didn't run . for student council president. I don't see myself in any way in elective . office.’ She added: ‘I'm saying there is no . way I will do this, because it's really not me, I know my strengths. Governor Romney needs to find someone who wants to run with him. There . are many people who will do it very, very well, and I'll support the . ticket.’ The news came as Mr Obama apologised . for not inspiring the public enough as president, telling CBS This . Morning he regretted 'thinking that this job was just about getting the . policy right.'","Drudge Report claims Condoleezza Rice could be Romney's VP pick .

The deaths of 25 patients are being reviewed after a leading London NHS Trust admitted 'poor record keeping' meant they had lost track of hundreds of patients. Three local authorities said they were 'extremely concerned' after Imperial College Healthcare admitted 900 patients records were incomplete back in May. A review group was set up to look at 74 affected patients who had since died. Doctors have so far found that delays caused by data issues did not . cause harm in 49 cases, however 25 cases are still being investigated. Charing Cross Hospital is one of four covered by Imperial College Healthcare . At the height of the problem in February around 3,500 . patients were waiting for longer than the 18-week target for treatments . or operations. It has emerged that some cancer patients ended up on a waiting list for up to two years when they should have been seen within a fortnight. The Trust has also been unable to get . in contact with 86 people who were referred for a possible cancer . diagnosis after letters sent to their last known addresses in May went . unanswered. It means potentially that dozens of cancer patients may have died or suffered complications as a result of mismanagement. The problems first emerged in January after the Trust admitted finding that hundreds of patient records were incomplete. Files on some patients were opened but not closed while others were duplicated. A joint letter from Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Kensington and Chelsea Councils said they were unhappy that the Trust had responded to their resulting scrutiny with a 'lack of openness and transparency.' Councillor Sarah Richardson of the Health Policy Scrutiny Committee at Westminster Council, told Mail Online: 'Imperial College NHS Trust have acted dangerously and irresponsibly by allowing patients entrusted to their care suffer a possible deterioration of their condition. 'Managers were more worried about their reputation than about patient safety. In a public forum they said no-one had come to harm. We believe they deliberately misled the council.' The Trust runs four London hospitals: Charing Cross, Hammersmith, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea and St Mary's. The Department of Health said the errors 'may have caused distress and uncertainty for vulnerable patients' A spokeswoman for the Trust says they don't believe any patients have come to serious harm as a result of the lost data. 'To date we have found no evidence that these patients have come to clinical harm as a result of our poor record keeping,' she said. 'We are extremely sorry that this situation was not identified and resolved earlier.' A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'The situation at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was completely unacceptable, and may have caused distress and uncertainty for vulnerable patients. 'That's why when we became aware of this situation in April we sought assurances that this would become an urgent part of the work being undertaken by a team of external experts who were working within the Trust. 'Those experts have helped the Trust to make sure that the right processes are in place so patients should get the care they need, when they need it in future. We will continue to monitor the situation.'","Hundreds of patient records found to be incomplete earlier this year .

This is the moment honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani is alleged to have handed a bag of cash to his taxi driver in return for orchestrating the killing of his wife Anni. The previously unseen CCTV footage shows millionaire Dewani meeting Zola Tongo – who has been jailed for 18 years for organising the murder. It was recorded three days after Dewani’s bride was shot dead in South Africa. The footage, taken from the five-star Cape Town hotel where the honeymoon couple were staying, shows the two men entering the internet room. Dewani arrives carrying a white plastic bag and, after a brief meeting, Tongo departs carrying the same bag at his side. Riddle: Shrien Dewani arrives at the internet room of the Cape Town hotel, where he and Anni were staying in South Africa . At the hotel: Carrying a bag, Shrien is followed by Zola Tongo - who has been jailed for organising the murder . Tongo claims the bag contained 1,000 . South African rand (about £82) in cash which was  his payment for . arranging the murder. But Dewani claims he owed the driver the money for . his services as a tour guide. The . security camera footage from the Cape Grace Hotel has been obtained by . the BBC’s Panorama team as part of a programme investigating the murder. The . footage also shows Anni, 28, and Dewani, now 32, kissing and embracing . in an apparent display of affection just three hours before Anni was in . the hands of her killers. This . contrasts with separate CCTV footage, previously obtained by this . newspaper, showing Dewani and Anni walking yards apart that same night. Tongo later leaves with the bag. He claims the bag contained 1,000 South African rand (about £82) in cash which was his payment for arranging the murder . Previously unseen: The footage was recorded three days after Anni was shot dead . Suggestions of distance between the newlyweds were bolstered by claims from Anni’s best friend and cousin, who said the bride had tried to call off the wedding after throwing her engagement ring at Dewani  during one of their numerous arguments. Dewani is accused of paying two hitmen  £1,400 to kill his wife. He denies the accusations. Last . year Home Secretary Theresa  May rubber-stamped his extradition order . after a campaign by Anni’s bereaved family, who demanded Dewani stand . trial. He  has appealed against the decision to the  High Court. In . the footage, Dewani is shown talking to Anni’s father, Vinod Hindocha, . after they had been to see Anni’s body at a morgue. Cameras show Tongo, . in a white cap, shirt and shorts, walking through the hotel’s front . entrance empty-handed. Dewani then walks towards the internet . room carrying the plastic bag, closely followed by the driver. Tongo . emerges again, after one minute, with a bag-shaped object bulging under . his shirt. ... but do these pictures show a couple in love? Affection: Dewani and Anni are very touchy-feely in the Cape Grace Hotel just three hours before the tragic bride was killed in a rough suburb of Cape Town . He then enters the toilets before leaving the hotel openly carrying the bag. Panorama claims a mystery couple were in the internet room with them who would have witnessed the handover. The footage also tracks Anni and Dewani’s movements on the evening of November 13, 2010 – hours before Anni’s disappearance. She . presses her body up against Dewani as they kiss tenderly in the lobby. Briefly, she pulls away as he takes her picture on his phone before she . is back into his arms in an embrace. Earlier, in the hotel bar, Dewani . zips up a loose fastening on his bride’s dress, after which she reaches . across and strokes his thigh. Dewani then puts his arms around Anni, . pulling her in, and they kiss again. The . footage contrasts with CCTV showing the couple at the Surfside . restaurant in Strand, a resort 30 miles south-east of Cape Town, which . Tongo drove them to. Changing fortunes: Dewani, pictured with his . bride Anni on their wedding day (left) and arriving at . court for a hearing last year . Timed at 9.33pm, the recording shows Dewani, with hands thrust in his pockets, walking ahead of his elegant bride who, with her head bowed, fiddles with her handbag five paces behind. At about 11pm, Anni was kidnapped and later murdered as the couple’s taxi drove through the notorious township of Gugulethu. The . distance between the pair appeared to grow in significance after Anni’s . cousin, Sneha Hindocha, claimed Anni had tried to call off her lavish . £200,000 wedding in India just days before the ceremony.Sneha said Anni threw her engagement ring at Dewani after an  argument. It . was also claimed Sneha received more than 100 texts from Anni which . charted a turbulent and at times unhappy relationship with her . husband-to-be. Zola Tongo pictured during his trial in Cape Town High Court in December 2010 . Other footage shows the moment the British businessman is alleged to have commissioned Tongo to arrange the murder. It shows Anni entering the hotel alone the day before the killing. Dewani is left alone with Tongo for five minutes on the hotel’s forecourt. The driver has claimed this was when Dewani told him he wanted a client ‘taken off the scene’. Charlotte Harris, the Dewani  family’s lawyer, said: ‘Shrien has not been charged with any offence in any country. He is innocent and has always maintained his commitment to clearing his name of all the false allegations against him.’ The Dewani family declined to comment.

A British student accused of running an 'illegal' website from his university bedroom could be extradited to the U.S. within weeks. Richard O’Dwyer faces trial and up to ten years in jail for offences which his lawyers say are not even a crime in this country. The 23-year-old founded the TVShack.net site which published links to illegal download sites - though he himself did not illegally store copyrighted material. Yesterday the family was told that Home Secretary Theresa May had signed an order authorising his extradition. Not happy: Richard O'Dwyer, right, is facing extradition to the U.S. His mother Julia, left, claims he is being 'sold down the river' by the Government . It prompted his mother Julia to launch an impassioned attack on the Government for allowing Britons to be 'sold down the river'. Branding the decision to send her son to the U.S. ‘disgusting’, Mrs . O’Dwyer argued he should stand trial in this country and not thousands . of miles away. She cited the case of computer hacker Gary McKinnon who has spent a . decade fighting extradition over allegations he hacked into defence . department computers, and that of British businessman Christopher . Tappin, who is being held in a Texas jail over arms dealing. Mrs O’Dwyer, a nurse from Chesterfield, said: 'The U.S. is coming for . the young, the old and the ill and our Government is paving the way.

Next time it may be your son. I urge . everyone who cares about unfair extradition to write to their MP and . insist this disreputable law is changed.' Despite not downloading any of the illegal material himself, the ‘quiet and . vulnerable’ son of a GP was arrested and charged. In January a court . ruled there was no reason not to send him overseas. Critics say it is the latest example of how the ‘lopsided’ 2003 . Extradition Act is hurting Britons who lack the same rights as U.S. citizens in the same situation. Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, faces being sent to the U.S. on charges of computer hacking, despite experts warning he is a suicide . risk. He claims he was searching for evidence of ‘little green men’ when he hacked into U.S. military computers. Mr O’Dwyer’s lawyer Ben Cooper said the site did not store copyright . material itself, and operated in the same way as search engines such as . Google and Yahoo. Possible problems: Obama and Cameron could be about to clash on the Anglo-American extradition agreement . Court papers allege the site made around £150,000 from advertising revenue from January 2008 until it was shut down in 2010. Mr O’Dwyer could now appeal to the High Court, and then to the European . Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, in a bid to block moves to . extradite him. Worrying: Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon is still awaiting the Home Secretary's decision on whether he will be extradited to the U.S . His mother accused David Cameron of being ‘wet’, adding: ‘He’s not going . to be saying anything much to President Obama. 'And he won’t get much of . an answer either.’ In December, MPs unanimously backed a call for . action against extradition laws.

He said: ‘Richard O’Dwyer is wanted in . the U.S. for offences related to copyright infringement connected to . the TVShack.net website. ‘It is alleged that between December 2007 and June 2010, Mr O’Dwyer . owned and operated TVShack.net which collected and catalogued links to . websites containing illegal copies of copyrighted material including . films, TV programmes and music.’ He added: ‘The district judge found the allegations were comparable to . an offence under UK law and it was appropriate for any trial to be held . in the U.S.’","Sheffield Hallam University student allegedly earned thousands through advertising on TVShack website .

Two thousand convicts who committed crimes up to 40 years ago have been ordered to provide DNA samples under new powers granted to the police to solve cold cases. Officers have visited the homes of nearly 200 ex-offenders in the Manchester area in what is expected to be part of a nationwide police operation to bolster the National DNA Database.

Police say harvesting DNA from ex-offenders will help them solve more crime . Police chiefs say the harvesting of DNA from ex-offenders will help them solve more crime. But civil liberties campaigners warn that the new powers will disrupt the lives of former offenders who are rehabilitated. Nick Pickles, director of the civil liberties and privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘This is a disproportionate use of a police power and not a very good use of police resources.’ But the police say they are only targeting ex-cons who offended before the database was created – and others who avoided being added to it.

Mother-of-two Tina Nash, 31, had her eyes gouged out and was brutally beaten in the assault. Yesterday she told of her heart-break at never being able to see her children again. Devastated: Tina Nash, pictured left speaking out today, and right before the attack, said she missed 'the things people take for granted' like seeing the sea and sky . The horrific attack by Shane Jenkin left her feeling as if she had been ‘buried alive’. Miss Nash, who has sons aged four and . 14, said: ‘He has taken everything from me and robbed me of one of the . most precious things in life – my sight. ‘I actually look forward to going to sleep because in my dreams I have sight. It’s when I wake up that the truth hits home. Thug: Shane Jenkin who blinded his lover in a sickening 12-hour attack . ‘I feel like I have been buried alive. I feel like a ghost. I can hear everyone but I can’t even see my kids’ faces. That is really harsh. ‘I actually wish I wasn’t here. I miss the world, my kids’ faces, I miss everything. ‘Some days I just don’t want to get up but I’m determined to provide a future for my children and this is my motivation.’ Jenkin, 33, who had regularly . assaulted Miss Nash on previous occasions, attacked her while she was . asleep at her home in Hayle, Cornwall, last April. He broke her nose and . jaw, throttled her until she was unconscious, and then gouged out her . eyes. Miss Nash recalled: ‘He was blaming me, saying, “It’s all your fault – I am going to do years for this”.’ She had several operations over four weeks of hospital treatment but surgeons could not save her eyes. She said she had thought she could . change Jenkin’s violent behaviour but warned other victims of domestic . violence to get out ‘before it is too late’. She added: ‘It’s not going . to get better, it’s going to get worse.’ Miss Nash, described by a relative as . ‘friendly, bubbly and outgoing’, had helped win Jenkin’s release from . jail for previous offences. ‘I’ve done so much for him and this is how he’s repaid me,’ she said. Miss Nash thanked her friends and . family for their ‘amazing support’ in an emotional interview yesterday . after attending Truro Crown Court to hear Jenkin, of Hayle, plead guilty . to grievous bodily harm with intent. Originally charged with attempted . murder, he was remanded in custody and will be sentenced next month. The brief hearing did not reveal . details of what led to the assault. It is understood the couple had been . out drinking earlier that evening, and that Miss Nash’s children were . asleep in the house at the time of the attack. Suffering: Ms Nash is led into Truro Crown Court by a police officer last year, her damaged eyes covered by sunglasses . Detective Inspector Chris Strickland . of Devon and Cornwall Police described Miss Nash’s ordeal as the most . shocking attack he had ever dealt with. He said: ‘This was a . premeditated, sustained and vicious attack on a defenceless woman. ‘Tina has displayed incredible strength, however, and has shown great desire to care for her two children.’ Those who knew Jenkin last night described a terrifying thug who would attack without warning. He was banned several times from pubs . in Penzance for violence. One barman said: ‘He could just turn and go . from being nice and polite and jovial then bang, it was like flicking a . switch. ‘I have seen him talking to people, having a laugh, then stamping on them on the floor.’ Vile: Shane Jenkin, 33, assaulted his girlfriend in a 'premeditated and vicious attack' Callous Shane Jenkin could turn like 'flicking a switch' and was on a five-year pub ban for violence. He was banned from pubs several times but excluded again in 2010 after punching a policeman, a pubwatch chairman said. The thug, who will be sentenced next month for blinding his girlfriend Tina Nash, struck fear into fellow drinkers who knew his volatile temper could erupt with little warning. One Penzance barman said Jenkin had previously tried to gouge out a man's eyes during a brawl. 'I and several others have had run-ins . with him and would say he is generally a nasty piece of work,' said the . barman, who asked not to be named. 'What he did to Tina he tried to do to . other people - I know someone else he had a fight with and tried to do . that to him but he was 6ft 4in and could defend himself. 'He could just turn and go from being nice and polite and jovial then bang, it was like flicking a switch.I saw it on several occasions.' 'I have seen him talking to people, having a laugh to stamping on them on the floor. 'There have been various violent crimes and he has been to jail but he always pulled the mental health card - he says he isn't responsible for his actions and has mental health issues. 'He once dragged someone outside, up the road, put a bench on his head and started jumping on it. 'He ended up with a fractured skull and brain damage and I think he did some prison time for that but played the diminished responsibility card and was out in about 10 months. This was several years ago in his mid-twenties.' Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm details of their previous dealings with Jenkin - who has the word 'Outlaw' tattooed on his forearm and a scorpion on his chest. Helen Cadman, Penzance pubwatch chairman and owner of the Sportsmans Arms in Heamoor, Penzance, said: 'He was put on the pubwatch scheme several times before but was put on it again in March 2010 for assaulting, punching a policeman outside a nightclub out of hours. 'He was on it previously for more minor offences.' One landlord, who did not want to be named, said Jenkin was a well-known troublemaker. 'I have certainly thrown him out of a few pubs over the last decade,' he said. 'He was on the pubwatch scheme for violence and general drunken behaviour, just generally obnoxious. Ms Cadman said she noticed he was 'quite aggressive' and that smaller members of staff became intimated by him and that he 'wasn't the full ticket.' 'He was on the pubwatch scheme serving a ban until 2015, a five-year ban. He was a general trouble maker, he'd start fights and get drunk,' she added. Three months before the 33-year-old gouged out his girlfriend's eyes he was charged with breaching bail conditions by failing to observe a curfew, it was reported. At the time he was allegedly on bail for an alleged domestic assault causing actual bodily harm.","Tina Nash was subjected to 'sickening' 12-hour assault while her two children were in home .

A court heard the traveller family used 'vulnerable' men as virtual 'slaves' A traveller family used ‘vulnerable’ men as virtual ‘slaves’ and kept them in ‘concentration camp’ conditions, a court heard yesterday. Dozens of homeless people and drink or drug addicts were allegedly approached by the Connors family to do lucrative block paving work or collect scrap metal from homeowners. But after agreeing to go with them it is claimed they were made to work up to 19 hours a day, six days a week, lived in appalling conditions and were often left starving. Promised wages never materialised, the court was told. Many of the workers were too scared to escape because of the fear of ‘physical violence and the threat of such violence’. The . alleged victims said their heads were shaved and they were unable to . shower for months at a time. Clothes went unwashed and were thrown away . when they began to fall apart. One described the site where they lived as being like ‘a concentration camp’. Some slept in sheds and even a converted horsebox. Frances . Oldham, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘The case is about control and . exploitation. The victims, and I deliberately call them that, were . exploited because they were among the most vulnerable in society. ‘They were controlled in such a way . that in many cases they could not see the extent of the control. They . became conditioned so that these defendants could earn an awful lot of . money.’ She added: ‘A number . of words may spring to mind to describe what was happening. They may . not, in the strict sense, have been slaves but they were not free men.’ Irish-born . Tommy Connors snr, 52, his children Johnny, 28, Tommy, 26, James, 24, . Patrick, 20, daughter Josie, 30, and her husband James John Connors, 34, . are accused of 20 charges in total relating to eight workers.

Crown Court heard the alleged mistreatment came to light when one . worker escaped and contacted police. Officers raided Greenacres Caravan . Park near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire – where six of the defendants . live – on September 11 last year. Johnny Connors lives in St Albans, . Hertfordshire. Thirteen men were taken away from the caravan park. None can be named for legal reasons. One, . the jury heard, was living in Brighton on benefits in the mid-1990s . when Tommy snr offered him ‘£50 a day in cash and a roof over his head’. The following day he began knocking on doors asking homeowners if they . wanted block paving or tarmacking work. Mrs Oldham said that over the years Tommy . snr, known as ‘Pa’, had attacked him more than a dozen times. Usually . he was punched but he had also been hit with a broom handle and . scratched so deeply that blood was drawn. Another worker later claimed he saw the man being ‘used like a human punch bag’.

One of the workers told police he regarded the site as 'like a concentration camp', the court was told. The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was living on benefits when he was recruited by Tommy Connors Snr and two of his sons, jurors heard. The Connors offered him a job, £50 in cash and a roof over his head and took him to a site in Burgess Hill, West Sussex, where Tommy Connors Snr was living, it is alleged. The following day, the man is said to have been set to work, knocking on doors and asking for block paving or tarmac work. Ms Oldham said: 'At first he had been treated OK and given pocket money to buy cigarettes, biscuits and crisps. 'After a while, the travellers' treatment of [him] changed. Tommy Snr would hit him in the face for no reason when in a temper.' As time went on, Tommy Connors Snr's children began to treat him 'worse and worse', she added. Some days he was given 'no food at all', or just biscuits and crisps to snack on, the court heard. Nor were labourers allowed to leave work to get something to eat, it was alleged. It is also claimed that the workers were 'conditioned' to do what the Connors wanted. For the past five years the alleged victim, who is in his fifties, lived at the Leighton Buzzard site. The court heard he had lived in a shed since 2009 where the bedding was changed about every four months. Workers used to be taken for showers on Fridays, ready for knocking on doors over the weekends, Mrs Oldham said. But the intervals eventually stretched out to months. The only other way to wash was using a sink. After the police raid the victim told officers he had received only £80 cash in 15 years. Sometimes only one meal was given at night, he claimed, ‘and only then if they were not back too late’. The court heard he had been too ‘frightened’ to leave the camp and didn’t know where to go. One worker claimed he had suffered ‘seven years of abuse, starvation and torture’. He said: ‘There was no respect. They treated me like a slave. And that’s putting it mildly.’ The court was told another worker said he had seen ‘hundreds’ of people being used by the family over the years. He added that he believed workers’ heads were shaved because it would allow them to be spotted in a crowd if they tried to escape. The man described being given ‘chip shop food’ and that he  had lost a lot of weight and his teeth were falling out. Mrs Oldham said that at time he would be offered the leftovers of a kebab by two of the brothers, adding: ‘At other times they were given food that was so old flies were crawling over it.’ The jury was shown photos of the Connors’ spotless accommodation at the site, with new fitted kitchens, comfortable sofas, flat-screen TVs, expensive china and Waterford crystal jugs. Tommy snr had a jukebox and a giant bottle of Taittinger champagne in his chalet-style home and £4,000 in cash was found in a cooking pot on the stove. The case continues.","Victims 'recruited' from soup kitchens or off the streets, court told .

Employees at a McDonald’s in Maryland are outraged at a co-worker who claims she won a $105million Mega Millions jackpot which she is not planning on sharing - despite the fact they had pooled their money for tickets. Workers at the fast food outlet bought a number of tickets together for the biggest lottery in world history but Mirlande Wilson, 37, claims she separately bought one of the three tickets nationwide that will split a record $656 million payout. 'We had a group plan, but I went and . played by myself. [The ‘winning’ ticket] wasn’t on the group plan,' Wilson told The New York Post. Lucky winner?

Haitian immigrant who has seven children claimed she had hidden the . winning ticket and would present it to lottery officials today. A Kansas man was struck by lightning hours after buying three Mega Millions lottery tickets on Thursday, proving in real life the old saying that a gambler is more likely to be struck down from the sky than win the jackpot. Bill Isles, 48, bought three tickets in the record $656 million lottery Thursday at a Wichita, Kansas grocery store. On the way to his car, Isles said he commented to a friend: 'I've got a better chance of getting struck by lightning"" than winning the lottery. Later at about 9:30pm, Isles was standing in the back yard of his Wichita duplex, when he saw a flash and heard a boom -- lightning. 'It threw me to the ground quivering,"" Isles said in a telephone interview on Saturday. 'It kind of scrambled my brain and gave me an irregular heartbeat.' Isles said doctors wanted to make sure his heartbeat was back to normal. He suffered no burns or other physical effects from the strike, which he said could have been worse because his yard has a power line pole. But later she started to backtrack saying she wasn't sure whether she had won or not. 'I don’t know if I won. Some of the numbers were familiar. I recognized some of them,' she said. 'I don’t know why' people are saying differently. 'I’m going to go to the lottery office today. I bought some tickets separately.' With winning tickets also sold in Illinois and Kansas, a single Maryland winner would get an after-tax lump sum of $105 million, or $5.59 million a year for 26 years. Wilson’s co-workers — who make little more than $7.50 an hour — are furious at her claims she bought the winning ticket with her own money. 'She can’t do this to us!' said . Suleiman Osman Husein, a shift manager and one of 15 members in the . pool. 'We each paid $5. She took everybody’s money!' A . man identifying himself as the boyfriend of a McDonald’s manager named .

'She said, ""Turn on the news"". She said she had won. I thought it was a joke or something. She doesn’t seem like a person who’d do this,' he said. Allen told the Post he and Layla then went to Wilson's home to question her about the winning ticket. Though she first refused to come out, they banged on her door for 20 minutes until she finally relented. 'These people are going to kill you. It’s not worth your life!' Allen said he told her. 'All right! All right! I’ll share, but I can’t find the ticket right now,' she said, according to Allen. A clerk at the . 7-Eleven where Wilson bought the tickets said they believed it was a man . who had bought the winning ticket and doubted that Wilson's story was . actually true after lottery officials reviewed the . store’s CCTV footage. Carole Everett said they had no information about the Maryland winner and whether it was a man or a woman who bought the winning ticket. She said: 'Right now, everything is just speculation and gossip. Until someone comes through that door and hands over the winning ticket we will not know who the winner is.' If Wilson won, and if it was with a . pooled work ticket, the situation would be very similar to that of . New Jersey man Americo Lopes, who was sued by his former colleagues . after he claimed he was the sole winner of a $38.5 million Mega Millions . lottery jackpot. The five construction workers say . they and Lopes were members of a weekly lottery pool, each person . contributing $2 and Lopes would buy the tickets. He . claimed he played the lottery both by himself and as a member of the . pool and that the winning ticket in the November 2009 drawing was one he . bought for himself. Lopes chose the lump-sum payment option and received $24 million. A woman buys Mega Millions lottery tickets at a shop on New York City's upper west side of Manhattan . A jury found that he wrongly refused to share the lottery win with his friends and ordered that he pay them $4million each. The three jackpot-winning tickets were purchased in Red Bud, Illinois, Baltimore County, Maryland, and Kansas, where state lottery officials have said only that the ticket was sold in the northeast part of the state. In Illinois, the Chicago Tribune said a second jackpot winner, who also has yet to step forward, bought a quick-pick ticket at a gas station and convenience store in Red Bud, a community of about 3,700 in southwestern Illinois. There were also some big consolation prizes. Lottery officials said 161 ticket holders won $250,000 each by matching the first five numbers, and 897 people won $10,000 by matching four numbers plus the stand-alone Mega Ball. The Maryland and Kansas winners are allowed to remain anonymous because of state laws, but in Illinois, the winner has to be publicized. Though lottery officials say they encourage winners to come forward and enjoy their 15 minutes of fame. A donut shop worker in California quit his job after winning $228,000 from Friday's draw. It took Lazaro Ramos less than an hour to hand in his resignation after he discovered he was among 29 Californians to match five of the six winning numbers in Friday's drawing. He plans to return to his home country Guatemala to open up his own restaurant. The winning numbers in Friday night's drawing were 02-04-23-38-46, and the Mega Ball 23. Previous lottery winners have found that winning an eye-popping jackpot wasn't exactly the dream come true they hoped it would be. In fact for some, it turned into a nightmare.","Mirlande Wilson, 37, pooled money with colleagues at Maryland burger joint .

Two police officers who twisted the arms of a man in custody, in order to convince him to answer their questions have been spared a jail sentence. Sergeant Stephen Harvey and civilian detention officer Michael Mount assaulted David Healer after arresting him in County Durham in March last year. Harvey, 50, and Mount, 61, who were both convicted of two counts of common assault at a trial at Teesside . Magistrates’ Court, were today ordered to pay Healer a mere £100 in compensation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Police custody officer, Sgt Stephen Harvey, left, and civilian detention . officer, Michael Mount, right, assault David Healer in the custody . suite at Peterlee Police station . The attack which was condemned as a form of torture by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), showed Harvey twisting Mr Healer’s arm behind his back as Mount held his other arm. He was then grabbed by both wrists across the custody suite desk by both defendants after again refusing to answer questions. DIY shop boss Mr Healer, who sat in the . public gallery to watch the sentencing, left the courtroom wiping his . eyes as his screams of pain were played on the DVD. The 48-year-old, of Seaham, County . Durham, who had recently been treated in hospital and was an angina . sufferer, said he feared he would die in the attack. David Healer, left, feared for his life during the attack by Durham Police Sgt, right, Stephen Harvey . Harvey, of Chester-le-Street, and Mount, of Thornley, both County Durham, argued that they used reasonable force to restrain Mr Healer, who had been arrested on suspicion of breaching bail conditions and assaulting a police officer. Both men had exemplary records during their time in the police and the incident last year was described as being out of character. Steven Crossley, for Harvey, said: 'The consequences of these convictions for Mr Harvey has already been great. 'He’s someone who prides himself on being a good police officer, prides himself on his reputation. 'Of course, there has been devastating damage to that reputation as a result of these convictions. That represents real punishment to him.' Police Detention Officer Michael Mount escaped with a fine of £50 following his role in the attack . Sentencing both men, Oliver Johnson, chair of the bench, said: 'The greater punishment you will have received today is not the fine but the fact that your position in society will be severely downgraded in a bad way.“Your unblemished character has gone.' Speaking outside court after the sentencing, father-of-six Mr Healer said he was happy with the outcome. He said he would be pursuing a claim for compensation for injuries to his spine, which he said he received as a result of the assault. He said: 'At the end of the day, it’s the consequences of what they did in society that’s going to affect them.It’s a shame that two people have ruined their careers over this.' Mr Healer continued: 'As far as I’m concerned, it’s over now.' Stephen Gowland, Mr Healer’s solicitor, said: 'Mr Healer suffered a great injustice but today at least he can be content that justice has been done.' He added: 'My client’s life has been affected greatly by the treatment he received both mentally and physically and he now has to live with severe pain for the rest of his life, due to the serious spinal injuries incurred in this incident.' Mr Gowland said Mr Healer was lucky to be alive after the assault. 'Stephen Harvey and Michael Mount were tasked to ensure the safety of the public and uphold the law and failed to do so,' he said. 'Since 1990, nearly 1,000 people have died in police custody in England and Wales. My client thought he was going to die in the police station and it is only through luck that he was not part of those statistics.'

Deputy Chief Constable Mike Barton, of Durham Police, said the excessive force used by the two staff members was wrong and should not have happened. Speaking outside court, Mr Barton said: 'Durham Constabulary aims to treat everyone who comes into custody with due respect, dignity and fairness and in accordance with the law and codes of practice. 'When this does not happen, then we take the appropriate action and, on this occasion, our professional standards were not upheld. 'The actions of our staff were completely out of character but they were wrong and this should not have happened. 'This was clearly a case where there has been a use of excessive force.' Mr Barton added: 'Without wishing to condone the actions of these particular members of staff, I must point out that custody can be a very challenging environment for our staff. They regularly have to deal with people who are drunk, or violent, or both. 'We process around 20,000 people a year and, in the vast majority of these cases, there are no issues.' Harvey was told to pay £1,395 in fines and costs for his role in the attack, while Mount was told to pay a total of £730.","Attack condemned by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .

But after a bodyguard has died and a homeless man was left with serious injuries in two separate incidents on the same journey, Robert Mugabe has been living up to his reputation. The Zimbabwean president was on his way to a funeral when the two incidents occurred. First of all, one of the tyrant's outrider . motorbikes allegedly ran into a homeless man as they rushed the . octogenarian president to a funeral. Robert Mugabe pictured getting out of his Mercedes last week. He is believed to have the longest motorcade in Africa . The independent Daily News reported . that the unnamed victim was rushed to hospital following the gruesome . near-fatal accident on Wednesday. A source told the newspaper: 'If that guy is still alive, it is a miracle. The bike ripped through the man's legs while the bike rider was thrown off. The scene was so ghastly and bloody that one would not take a second glance.' The Daily News reported that the . motorbike which knocked down the pedestrian had been the first vehicle . in Mugabe's motorcade, which is reportedly one of the longest in Africa. The newspaper claimed the rest of the . statesman's long chain of vehicles sped by without stopping to help the . victim, who is believed to be a homeless man. Mugabe's motorcade had two accidents on his way to a funeral . It reported: 'When the Daily News . arrived at the scene of accident, which was guarded by police officers, . the damaged motorbike was being loaded into an unidentified truck. 'An eye-witness said the bike was speeding and ran into the vagabond, who was in the middle of the road. The motorcade sped past the accident scene in usual fashion and did not stop to assist the injured. 'The vagrant and rider were taken to hospital by ambulances that arrived at the scene later.' The motorcycle accident was reportedly the first of two smashes involving Mugabe's motorcade on Wednesday. The 88-year-old statesman is . traditionally ensconced safely in a luxury Mercedes limousine when he . travels around his poverty-stricken country. The presidential vehicle is . accompanied by more than a dozen others as part of an extensive . motorcade which includes Land Cruisers, security vehicles full of armed . soldiers, high-powered motorcycles and a standby ambulance. It is believed Mugabe was being . transported from Zimbabwe's capital Harare on Wednesday to a funeral in . his home village of Zvimba when the accident happened. The Daily News reported that several . of the leader's security guards were later injured in a second accident . after a tyre blew out in one of their Land Cruisers. Presidential spokesman George Charamba confirmed the victims of both accidents had been taken to hospital. The motorcade smash comes a decade after Mugabe brought in new laws to ease his passage around Zimbabwe. Since 2002 motorists have been legally required to pull over if they see the presidential car approaching. It is also an offence to gesticulate at the motorcade with the intention of insulting those inside. Offenders have previously been arrested or met with a robust physical response from Mugabe's guards.","Condition of homeless man is currently unknown but witnesses said it is unlikely that he would recover from the injuries he suffered .

There was trouble brewing at the tea shop when monarchist Anita Atkinson invited her customers to stand for the National Anthem. While most duly obliged, three elderly women resolutely remained seated. A furious Mrs Atkinson could not let this insult pass, so she gave the grey-haired trio their marching orders. ‘I was shocked, but it’s my tearoom,’ said 55-year-old Mrs Atkinson. ‘Everyone knows it has a royal theme. We play patriotic music and there’s memorabilia over the walls, so if they didn’t like it, why did they come in?’ Royalist: Anita Atkinson sent the three dissidents packing when they refused to stand up for the National Anthem . Mrs Atkinson, Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Durham, has leased a shop in the village of Stanhope from April to August, to cover the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. She calls her cafe Royal Teas and it features hand-painted Union Jack chairs and even a Union Jack lavatory in the ‘Throne Room’. Visitors from Germany, Spain and Australia have already enjoyed her hospitality. Customers are served on Mrs Atkinson’s own collection of royal crockery and encounter life-size cut-outs of the Queen, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge. There are books and newspaper clippings documenting significant royal moments in a bookcase for patrons to flick through. And at 3pm every day, the National Anthem is played by a musical helium balloon. Anita Atkinson (above), who owns royal-themed tearoom Royal Teas in County Durham, threw out a group of grey-haired women after they refused to stand for the National Anthem . ‘The whole thing is just meant to be a bit of fun,’ Mrs Atkinson said yesterday. ‘Some customers stand with their hands on their hearts, just like the Americans. ‘On Saturday I announced, “Ladies and gentlemen, please be upstanding for Her Majesty the Queen”. ‘Everyone – including four teenagers – stood up, apart from these  three ladies who were all looking a bit miserable. One said, “I’m not standing”. So I asked, “Will you just please leave then?”. These ladies had come in for a coffee but were looking for trouble. ‘They were shaking their heads and making a scene and would not stand up. As they were leaving they said they weren’t going to pay. In the end, two of them paid and one of them threw a pound in change at the counter and said my coffee was rubbish and that’s all it was worth. Mrs Atkinson, 55, plays the National Anthem at 3pm every day and customers are expected to stand for the occasion . ‘They deliberately talked through the National Anthem and were grumbling all the way out. I don’t know their views on the monarchy, but the tea room is just meant to be fun. ‘My husband says the customer is always right, but those ladies were rude and aggressive to me.’ Mrs Atkinson, a grandmother, who camped out for two nights ahead of the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last year, began collecting memorabilia at the age of 21 when relatives bought her royal mementoes for her birthday in 1977 – Silver Jubilee year. She now has more than 5,000 items but has had to cede her Guinness World Record for the largest collection of royal memorabilia to a woman in Australia.","Owner plays anthem every day at 3pm - and it says so on the menu .

A disgraced office manager at a police station stole more than £100,000 from his own force by secretly pocketing registration fees. Craig Rothwell, a civilian worker at Greater Manchester Police, got away with his crimes for four years and was even promoted during that time. But his career with the force is over after he appeared in court and admitted theft. He will be sentenced later this month. Rothwell, 27, joined as a clerk and later became a supervisor at Greater Manchester Police's International Visitors Registration Unit, based at Bootle Street station in Manchester. Under visa regulations, some foreign visitors, including overseas students, migrant workers and academics, must notify police and pay £34 for a registration certificate. Tens of thousands of applicants paid the fee during Rothwell's tenure but, instead of banking the money for the force, he kept it for himself. It is unclear how the offences came to light. It is understood that Rothwell tried to hide the fraud by saying he had banked money without specifying how much. Rothwell, of Havenwood Road, Wigan, pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to five charges of theft from Greater Manchester Police Authority. The court heard that the final figures have yet to be agreed, but the prosecution believe the total is more than £100,000. It is understood that he stole almost £40,000 in the tax year beginning April 2009 alone. The police worker was supported in court by his mother and father. Judge Michael Henshell adjourned the case for pre-sentence reports to be prepared. Offenders can expect to be jailed for up to four years in cases of theft involving a breach of trust and sums of more than £100,000. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said Rothwell had resigned from the force prior to disciplinary proceedings.

Recovered: Debra Gotch was delighted to find out her brain tumour had finally gone six years after she was diagnosed . A mother owes her life to her daughter - after her pregnancy led doctors to discover a huge brain tumour that had been hidden in her skull for years. Just hours after Debra Gotch gave birth to daughter Sophie doctors found a tumour the size of a satsuma growing deep within her brain. They carried out emergency surgery in a bid to save her life and feared she might not make a full recovery. However, Debra, from Hull, fought back saying she was determined to watch her daughter grow up. Now six years after her initial diagnosis, doctors have finally told the mother-of-one, 44, that the tumour has gone - and will probably never return. Debra is now lobbying the government for more training to be given to medics to help them diagnose brain tumours earlier. Debra said: 'I’d been suffering really severe sickness and blinding headaches all the way through my pregnancy - but I just assumed I was one of the unlucky people who had to put up with morning sickness for nine months solid. 'I’d had bad headaches for about three years before I got pregnant - but I put it down to stress. 'I would wake up feeling like there was an axe buried in my head. But after Sophie arrived, I felt like my brain was shutting down, and I suffered a huge fit. 'I was stunned when doctors told me I had a tumour in my brain the size of a satsuma, which they thought had been growing for at least two years. 'If I hadn’t had Sophie, it might have been too late by the time I was eventually diagnosed - she probably saved my life.' Debra in hospital following brain surgery. She lost her sense of smell during the operation . Debra first started suffering from headaches in the year before she fell pregnant - but put the symptoms down to stress. She was running a health and beauty sales business at the time - working long hours and travelling around the country, and was convinced that the stress of her job, and pressure of keeping the business afloat, was affecting her health. But when she fell pregnant, the symptoms grew more severe - and she started to suffer from terrible nausea - which she believed was as a result of her pregnancy. Debra said: 'I was being horrendously sick all hours of the day, but I just thought I was unlucky with my pregnancy. 'It got so bad that one day, when I was driving to a business meeting across a bridge over a river, I ended up being sick all over myself, as I couldn’t pull over - it was awful. 'The headaches I was suffering were changing too, they were really debilitating, but as a first-time mum, I didn’t know any different. 'My sense of smell went wild -everything smelt to strongly, and made me feel ill. 'I even started to experience hand tremors, but after visiting the doctor, he put my symptoms down to stress during pregnancy, and sent me away. 'When Sophie did finally come along, I had a horrendous labour, which lasted for two and a half days, and after two episodes of shaking uncontrollably, I had an emergency c-section. 'But immediately after the birth, I felt like I was closing down - I was exhausted, and couldn’t enjoy Sophie properly.' The tumour had been growing for around two years before it was discovered . Debra said she felt like she was 'closing down' after her daughter Sophie was born. The next day she suffered a convulsion and was rushed to hospital . Although Debra was allowed home from hospital within hours, the next day, she suffered a convulsion while nursing Sophie - and doctors realised something was seriously wrong. She said: 'Mike had left me nursing Sophie with her lying on my chest - but when he came back into the room, I was convulsing and unconscious. 'He quickly grabbed our baby and called an ambulance - and within hours, they had found out what was causing my symptoms. 'The doctors said my tumour was big, and wrapped right around a cord in the middle of my brain. I was shocked, but I didn’t have time to be frightened for myself - I just knew I had to fight this for the sake of my baby. 'Nothing in this world was going to stop me from pushing her around in her pram.' Debra had risky surgery at the Hull Royal Infirmary to remove the tumour. The operation was a success - but surgeons were forced to damage the part of the brain which detects smell. Although Debra made a steady recovery, doctors have kept a close eye on her, fearing the tumour would return, having regular scans. But now, medics have confirmed the tumour is unlikely to return - and have told her she no longer has to be monitored every few months. Debra two weeks after surgery to remove her brain tumour (left). Right her inspiration - daughter Sophie . Debra, who is now writing a book about her recovery, said: 'It’s such a relief to finally be told I can get on with the rest of my life - but I am starting to focus on campaigning for more funding and research into brain tumours.' Carol Robertson, charity development manager for Brain Tumour Research and Support across Yorkshire, said: 'Research into brain cancers amounted to less than one per cent of the funds allocated for cancer research, and as was the case with Debra, diagnosis of brain tumours is often delayed. 'Symptoms can often be mistaken for side effects of other conditions, as Debra’s were, and by the time one doctor has a Eureka moment, diagnosis has often been delayed by several weeks. 'We’re lobbying the government to change that and provide better training for GPs in spotting tumours.'","Debra started suffering headaches a year before she fell pregnant but put it down to stress.

The antioxidant - called  N-Acetylcysteine, or NAC - lowers irritability in children with autism and also reduces their repetitive behaviour patterns. Irritability affects 60 to 70 per cent of children with autism. Future treatment? An antioxidant called N-Acetylcysteine, or NAC, lowers irritability in children with autism and also reduces their repetitive behaviour . Researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital studied 31 children with the disorder. Lead researcher Dr Antonio Hardan said: 'We're not talking about mild things - this is throwing, kicking, hitting, the child needing to be restrained. 'It can affect learning, vocational activities and the child's ability to participate in autism therapies.' The study tested children with . autism ages 3 to 12. They were physically healthy and were not planning . any changes in their established autism treatments during the trial. In a double-blind study design, children received NAC or a placebo for 12 weeks. The NAC used was a pharmaceutical-grade preparation donated by the neutraceutical manufacturer BioAdvantex Pharma. Subjects were evaluated before the . trial began and every four weeks during the study using several . standardised surveys that measure problem behaviours, social behaviours, . autistic preoccupations and drug side effects. During the 12-week trial, NAC . treatment decreased irritability scores from 13.1 to 7.2 on the Aberrant . Behaviour Checklist, a widely used clinical scale for assessing . irritability. The change is not as large as that seen in children taking antipsychotics. 'But this is still a potentially valuable tool to have before jumping on these big guns, Dr Hardan said. In addition, according to two . standardised measures of autism mannerisms and stereotypic behaviour, . children taking NAC showed a decrease in repetitive and stereotyped . behaviours. Finding new medications to treat autism and its symptoms is a high priority for researchers. Currently, irritability, mood swings and aggression, all of which are considered associated features of autism, are treated with second-generation antipsychotics. But these drugs cause significant side effects, including weight gain, involuntary motor movements and metabolic syndrome, which increases diabetes risk. By contrast, the side effects of NAC are generally mild, with gastrointestinal problems such as constipation, nausea, diarrhoea and decreased appetite being the most common. The state of drug treatments for autism's core features, such as social deficits, language impairment and repetitive behaviours, is also a major problem. Dr Hardan said: 'Today, in 2012, we have no effective medication to treat repetitive behaviour such as hand flapping or any other core features of autism.' The researchers believe that NAC could be the first medication available to treat repetitive behaviour in autism - if the findings hold up when scrutinised further. 'One of the reasons I wanted to do this trial was that NAC is being used by community practitioners who focus on alternative, non-traditional therapies,' Hardan said. 'But there is no strong scientific evidence to support these interventions. Somebody needs to look at them.' Dr Hardan cautioned that the NAC for sale as a dietary supplement at chemists differs in some important respects from the individually packaged doses of pharmaceutical-grade NAC used in the study, and that the over-the-counter version may not produce the same results. He said: 'When you open the bottle from the drugstore and expose the pills to air and sunlight, it gets oxidised and becomes less effective.' Although the study did not test how NAC works, the researchers speculated on two possible mechanisms of action. Firstly, NAC increases the capacity of the body's main antioxidant network, which some previous studies have suggested is deficient in autism. In addition, other research has suggested that autism is related to an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. NAC can modulate the glutamatergic family of excitatory neurotransmitters, which might be useful in autism. The scientists are now applying for funding to conduct a large trial in which they hope to replicate their findings. Dr Hardan said: 'This was a pilot study. Final conclusions cannot be made before we do a larger trial.' Stanford University is filing a . patent for the use of NAC in autism, and one of the study authors has a . financial stake in a company that makes and sells the NAC used in the . trial. The researchers said that the . findings must be confirmed in a larger trial before NAC can be . recommended for children with autism. The study appears in Biological Psychiatry.","Scientists believe N-Acetylcysteine, or NAC, could be an effective therapy for autistic children ."

The last moments of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on camera were released today, showing the Florida teen wearing a hoodie and purchasing the last snacks he would ever buy. Surveillance video from the Sanford 7-Eleven shows the teen in a grey hoodie and long khaki trousers, first looking through the aisles and then paying for his bag of Skittles and Arizona iced tea. The chilling video was taken before Martin returned to the gated community in which Martin’s father lives and was gunned down by George Zimmerman. Scroll down for videos and legal documents . Convenience store . surveillance video shows Martin at the local 7-Eleven as he goes to purchase a snack . He is seen buying a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea, and pays the cashier with bills . He is then seen walking out of the store; a short time later, he was shot dead by George Zimmerman . The surveillance video is the last bit of evidence that has been released by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey, who has also published a collection of documents and photos of Zimmerman taken the night of the shooting. Among the massive amounts of evidence are nearly 200 pages of documents, including photos and eyewitness accounts, that show Zimmerman and Martin were in a loud and blood fight in the moments leading up to the shooting, and that Zimmerman appeared to be getting the worst of it, with wounds to both his face and the back of his head. According to statements made by Martin’s girlfriend, who was on the phone with the teen the night of February 26, his last words were: ‘Get off, get off.’ His cell phone then cut off and Martin was shot, his girlfriend said in the interview with a prosecutor. But the original lead detective in the case believed Zimmerman caused the fight by getting out of his vehicle to confront Martin, who wasn't doing anything criminal, and then could have defused the situation by telling Martin he was just a concerned citizen and tried to talk to him. Brawl: Injuries to Zimmerman's face and head, combined with Trayvon Martin's bloody knuckles, reveal a fight between the two that is consistent with Zimmerman's story to police . Evidence: This photo shows the head wounds that George Zimmerman's doctor noted in his medical report . Trayvon's tragic end: The dead teenager's body lying under a yellow tarpaulin after he was killed in a gated community in Sanford, Florida . He didn't think Zimmerman could legally invoke Florida's 'stand your ground' law and should be charged with manslaughter. Under that law, people are given wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat in a fight if they believe they are in danger of being killed or seriously injured, they weren't committing a crime themselves and are in a place they have the legal right to be. The original prosecutor in the case accepted Zimmerman's invocation of the law after the February 26 shooting but a special prosecutor rejected his claim last month and charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder. The former neighbourhood watch volunteer has pleaded not guilty, has been released on bail and reportedly is in hiding. He and his attorney will have two more chances to invoke the law. First, they will try to convince a judge during what will be a mini-trial. If the judge agrees, the charges will be dropped although prosecutors could appeal. That is likely months away. If the judge rejects the claim, Zimmerman could they try to convince the jury and win an acquittal. A trial is unlikely to start before next year. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, didn't return a phone call seeking comment Thursday from The Associated Press. Bleeding: Zimmerman's head wound is clearly visible in this photo provided to his defence team this week . Speaking Friday on NBC's Today show, Mr O'Mara said he couldn't talk about the individual pieces of evidence in the case. But he said that rather than talking about the 'what-if's' — as in what if Zimmerman had stayed in the car — O'Mara said 'we have to deal with what happened and try to explain that.' Joelle Moreno, a Florida International University law school professor, said the evidence now released makes it difficult to predict if a 'stand your ground' defence will work. She is a member of a state senator's task force examining the law. Zimmerman also sent a letter from prison in response to an Ohio man who contacted him about where to donate money. Zimmerman responded in the letter: ‘The best way to send your support is through prayer!’ he wrote, adding: ‘If you insist on sending funds, the best way is through my website.’ He said that his site, therealgeorgezimmerman.com ‘accepts checks and credit card payments via PayPal.’ The overall tone seemed upbeat, as he wrote: ‘This will all work out for me in the future’ and that he had ‘given my burden to the Lord and he has blessed me with tremendous patience.’ Martin, meanwhile, had drugs in his system the night he was shot and killed, a medical report has revealed. The autopsy on the 17-year-old showed traces of THC, which is found in marijuana, in the teenager's blood and urine. Optimistic: Zimmerman wrote in a letter from prison: 'This will all work out for me' Martin was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest fired from 'intermediate range'. Self-appointed neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman is on trial for the teenager's murder in Florida. New pictures also support the gunman's claim that he was injured in a fight with the teenager, as he is shown with a swollen - possibly broken - nose and bleeding profusely from his head. An autopsy report seen by NBC News claimed Martin also had broken skin on his left ring ringer below the knuckle. The report, prepared by the medical examiner in Volusia County, follows a separate medical examination on Zimmerman which found he had black eyes, a nose fracture and two cuts to the back of his head a day after the fatal shooting on February 26. The report from Zimmerman's doctor at Altamonte Family Practice bolstered the 28-year-old's claims that he was being punched and pummeled by the unarmed teen when he opened fire in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, who is charged with murder in the killing, claims he acted in self-defense and only shot Trayvon when the teen saw the pistol he was carrying and reached for it. It was then, Zimmerman said, he drew the gun himself and pulled the trigger. Hiding out: Zimmerman walked out of jail in the dead of night after posting bail and was quickly whisked away to an undisclosed hiding place . Building a defense: Zimmerman's lawyers received dozens of documents and other pieces of evidence from prosecutors on Tuesday . On Tuesday, ABC News obtained a medical report from Zimmerman's family, who examined the neighborhood watch volunteer the day after the shooting. Zimmerman wanted to be checked out so he could be cleared to return to work. Zimmerman, 28, told his doctor he was troubled by what happened the night before, saying he experienced 'occasional nausea when thinking about the violence.' The doctor said it was 'imperative' that Zimmerman go to a psychologist he had been seeing to be examined. It's unknown what Zimmerman had sought counseling for in the past. Before the shooting, Zimmerman had been prescribed Adderall, a common psycho-stimulant used treat ADHD, and Temazepam, a sleeping medication. Both drugs cause agitation and mood swings as side effects, though they occur in fewer than 10 percent of patients. Zimmerman claims he followed Trayvon, who was wearing a hoodie, when he saw him walking through the gated community when Zimmerman lives. Trayvon, who was staying at his father's girlfriend's condo, was returning home after buying at snack. Zimmerman followed the teen in his car and called 911. He then got out of his car, despite the emergency dispatcher saying he didn't need to continue pursuit. Zimmerman claims that's when Trayvon approached him and threatened him. He told police the teen started the fight by punching in him the face. A national uproar resulted in protests across the country after police declined to arrest Zimmerman. Protestors and Trayvon's parents say he was targeted for being black and the Zimmerman went free because he is not black. Zimmerman was later charged with murder by a special prosecutor who was appointed by Florida Gov Rick Scott. Zimmerman is currently free after posting $150,000 bail. He is currently in hiding after receiving 'thousands' of death threats. video platform video management video solutions video player . State v.

"John Guerin, 56, featured on the Channel 5 show Cowboy Builders in January 2011 . Jailed for five years after admitting ten fraud charges . By . Chris Kent . PUBLISHED: . 09:55 EST, 4 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:35 EST, 4 May 2012 . A conman who was caught in a sting on the TV show Cowboy Builders has been jailed for five years after ripping off a string of customers for more than £370,000. Builder John Guerin, who featured on the Channel 5 show presented by Dominic Littlewood in January 2011, was jailed at Croydon Crown Court after pleading guilty to 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception. The court heard how the 56-year-old, from Biggin Hill, Kent, targeted vulnerable people and that after starting work, he convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished. Guerin's tactics saw him try to get 'at least' 90 per cent of the quoted price before he did a runner - leaving dozens of homes across London in a 'state of ruin' and in need of emergency structural work between 2006 and 2010. Behind bars: John Guerin, pictured during his appearance on the Channel 5 TV show Cowboy Builders in January 2011, has been jailed for five years . Poor workmanship: An example of the shoddy work carried out by jailed conman John Guerin . Many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls, skips lying full and unpaid for in the driveway, and dodgy electrics and plumbing. Some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in. The court also heard how many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix Guerin's shoddy work. Many of Guerin's crimes took place in the London Borough of Bromley. After he was jailed, Bromley Borough Council released photos of some of his shoddy building work. The council said Guerin traded under a range of company names, including Bluewood Constructions Ltd, Greyfox Project Management and Merlyn Refurbishment Ltd, before he was snared. Challenge: John Guerin, right, is confronted by TV presenter Dominic Littlewood during an episode of Cowboy Builders . Jailed: John Guerin is now behind bars after admitting ten charges of fraud . The council's trading standards department said Guerin employed the same tactic on most jobs, by giving homeowners a quote for the work and then demanding 90 per cent of the full amount before doing a runner. In one case, Guerin was asked to build an extension for a man suffering from Parkinson's disease, but left with the project in a 'total mess' after getting more than £20,000. Sentencing Guerin to five years in jail, Judge Heather Baucher said: 'It beggared belief that he would inflict such harm. 'Nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused.' The court heard how the total amount paid by victims was £370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be 'left considerably out of pocket'. Bromley Council added that it had made an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize Guerin's assets. Councillor Tim Stevens said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid. 'The outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on Bromley residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.' During his appearance on Cowboy Builders, Guerin was challenged by Mr Littlewood about the quality of his workmanship.The show is co-presented by former glamour model Melinda Messenger.","John Guerin, 56, featured on the Channel 5 show Cowboy Builders in January 2011 .

"By . David Williams, James Slack and Stephen Wright . PUBLISHED: . 08:09 EST, 8 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:22 EST, 8 May 2012 . Thousands of passengers flew to America from UK airports last week unaware they were being guarded by US air marshals amid fears that Al Qaeda was planning to explode a bomb on a transatlantic flight. Security officials in the US said hundreds of armed sky marshals flew to Europe to accompany flights after intelligence that the terror network could be looking to mark the first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden by special forces in Pakistan. Dozens of US-bound flights from Heathrow and Gatwick by both British and American airlines are understood to have had at least one marshal on board. Horror in the sky: Sky marshals train to foil a terrorist attack. Hundreds have been stationed on flights between the U.S. and UK in recent weeks following an intelligence alert warning of an Al Qaeda attack . Target: The fact Gatwick was so heavily monitored suggests there was specific information that one of its departures would be targeted . Plotter? Senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot . At one stage, every flight heading for . the US is said to have been ‘shadowed’ by the marshals, whose weapons . include low-velocity bullets that carry enough force to bring down a . potential terrorist but not enough to blow through the skin of the . aeroplane. Amazingly, it appeared that Scotland Yard was kept in the dark about the scale of the security operation. The alert came after two intelligence . breakthroughs by US investigators which provided evidence that Al Qaeda . was still seeking to carry out attacks on US-bound commercial aircraft. New terror alert: Al Qaeda reportedly planned to strike on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death . The first was the discovery that . terrorists were attempting to target airlines travelling from British . and other European airports with explosives surgically implanted inside . their bodies. The second was the seizure by an . undercover CIA agent of a device built without metal or tell-tale . materials to avoid airport scanners that could be carried by a terrorist . in his underwear. Officials would not say whether a suspect had been . caught during the operation. US security officials are said to have . focused particular attention on flights using British airports because . so many US-bound flights go through the UK, and Britain has a ‘history’ of links to potential such attacks. Two years ago bombs shipped to the US on cargo planes inside printer cartridges travelled through the UK. In addition, Britain has been . identified as a source of potential suicide bombers by the US because ‘a . significant number’ of its citizens are known to have travelled to . Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia for terror training or to be . sympathetic to jihadist causes. Officials pointed out that young . Britons, several trained in Pakistan, were part of a plot to bring down . airliners over the Atlantic in a suspected Al Qaeda bomb plot five years . ago. And British shoe-bomber Richard Reid . tried to blow up a US-bound plane in 2002 – one of at least five airline . bomb plots linked to the UK. Notified: The White House said President Obama was told about the terror plot back in April, despite his administration's claim over the last few weeks that there was no 'credible threat' The scale of the deployment of air . marshals had now been stepped down, officials indicated, but some ‘are . still travelling’ while others ‘remain on standby’ in European and . Middle Eastern cities. Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic declined to discuss security issues last night, as did the major US airlines. When air marshals are on board, pilots . are aware of their presence but passengers are not told because of the . fear of causing panic. On an average week, around 630 . transatlantic flights depart from Heathrow. Some 17million passengers . flew from UK airports to the US last year. The disclosure of the plot comes amid . efforts by Barack Obama’s  administration to make its counter-terrorism . accomplishments a central issue in the presidential campaign. Armed sky marshals were introduced on British airliners in 2003 in response to fears of a 9/11-style terror attack launched from airports in  the UK. Then Home Secretary David Blunkett said the move, which was confined to transatlantic routes, was a ‘proportionate and appropriate response’ to the terror threat against this country. At the time, reports indicated that plain-clothes officers would carry guns firing low-velocity bullets, to prevent one going through the target and piercing the shell of the plane. In all likelihood they would be seated near the cockpit, in first or business class. Passengers are never notified if an air marshal is on their plane, although pilots are told. Neither the airline industry, police nor Government officials will comment publicly on the policy, and since its introduction it has largely been shrouded in secrecy. Other countries are more open about their use of sky marshals. The Israeli national airline, El Al, has had an armed marshal on every flight for more than a decade. And air marshals have  been used in the US for more  than 30 years. The bomb seized last month is said to . be a ‘sophisticated, modified version’ of the device carried by Nigerian . Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the former British-based student who tried . to detonate his underwear device on board a packed Detroit-bound . airliner on Christmas Day 2009. US bomb experts are said to be picking . apart the latest device, which had a more advanced detonator than the . one that fizzled out in the previous attack, leaving Abdulmutallab with . severe burns. The Nigerian, who is serving a life sentence in the US, is . to be questioned again following the latest discovery. Officials said it was also likely that . British Al Qaeda supergrass Saajid Badat, who trained UK shoe-bomber . Reid, will be questioned. Badat was convicted in 2001 of trying to blow up a Miami-bound flight but released early after agreeing to become a supergrass. Both that bomb and the new device are . suspected of being ‘commissioned’ in Yemen by an affiliate of Al Qaeda . and built by Saudi Arabian bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri. US officials said the CIA and other . agencies tracked the latest plot for about a month before moving to . seize the device in recent days in the Middle East, outside Yemen. Officials said that the bomb or its . components were in transit when intercepted, but that the device was not . seized at an airport and that Al Qaeda had yet to target a specific . flight. Officials stressed yesterday that it was a US-led operation and there was no known threat to UK airports, planes or passengers. Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard . Hogan-Howe said the Metropolitan Police was not involved in the inquiry. He said: ‘The US have said they are examining material recovered. We . will be interested to hear what the outcome is. ‘I won’t say an awful lot more. We are . in a position of trying to get information from America to see what . they have discovered.’ Additional reporting: NICK MCDERMOTT . To anti-terror investigators, there was little that marked out Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as a potential Al Qaeda recruit and suicide bomber. As the son of one of Nigeria’s most prominent businessmen, the 25-year-old former British university student lived a privileged life with access to large funds, homes in three countries and international travel. During his time studying mechanical engineering at University College London, he was described as a ‘quiet, caring, diligent student’. Investigators admit he ‘simply did not fit their profile’ of a potential terrorist. Yet on Christmas Day 2009, Abdulmutallab came close to blowing up a packed transatlantic flight with explosives sewn into his underwear. He flew from Lagos to Amsterdam, then boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew. Hours into the flight, he tried to detonate the explosives by injecting chemicals into them. He suffered severe burns when the bomb failed to explode, and was overpowered by passengers and crew. Disturbingly, the bomb was not picked up in airport security checks in Lagos and Amsterdam. Now serving a life prison sentence in the United States, Abdulmutallab is certain to be questioned again about his bomb, its maker and those who supplied it. In London, he was president of the university’s Islamic Society and ‘crossed the radar screen’ of MI5, the UK’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency, for radical links and communications with Islamic extremists. But investigators say that Al Qaeda operatives identified Abdulmutallab  only as ‘vulnerable’ and did not target him until after he began studying Arabic in the Yemeni capital San’aa in August 2009. Old bomb: Pictured here is the slightly charred and singed underwear which housed the explosives used by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab . Since the terror attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda has put different types of plans into action in numerous Jihad plots. While none of the plots have been successful, they have brought change to airport screenings and other security measures.","U.S. media says marshals sent to Europe and placed on scores of flights .

He was arrested, but not charged, a decision Miss C said left her feeling scared and suicidal . A victim of a serial rapist jailed indefinitely yesterday was so scared he might return after police released him without charge she slept in her bathroom for a year. The woman, known only as Miss C, said she chose that room because it was the only one she could lock after being told there was not enough evidence to prosecute former Army captain Brian Witty. Witty, 41, was convicted of three rapes and one sexual assault over a 15-year period between 1996 and 2011 after meeting his victims online or in bars. Miss C, his third victim, was attacked in Witty's flat after meeting the ex-Parachute Regiment member for a drink in Richmond in 2008. She said: 'I was so scared of Brian. He knew where I lived, where I worked. He'd said he was going to kill me that night. 'He held my hand on a hot radiator. The more I said it was hot the more he raped me even harder.' Miss C, who is in her late 30s, managed to escape, calling 999 and knocking on the doors of neighbouring flats. But she said she considered suicide after police told her he would not face charges. She subsequently lost her job and has barely worked since. A court heard Witty, who now works as a City banker, was arrested and questioned after three of the attacks, in 1995, 2006 and the one on Miss C in 2008, but was never charged until after another rape in 2011. This, the judge said, left Witty believing he was 'untouchable'. Detectives contacted Miss C last year saying the fourth woman had come forward, but she claims even then they were reluctant to re-open the case. 'The police let him do this,' Miss C is reported as saying in The Guardian. 'It's awful because they're the only people you depend on and they let you down.' Predator: The former Parachute Regiment captain, pictured here in his Army days, was finally charged when a fourth victim came forward last year. He has been jailed indefinitely for three rapes and a sexual assault over a 15-year period . She said the way she was cross-examined during the trial may have put other women off reporting rape. The defence claimed she had made up her allegation and revealed to the court how she made four 'false' allegations of sexual assault. She says the allegations were not false, but had simply not gone to court. A CPS spokesman told The Guardian: 'There are strict rules governing the cross-examination of victims in rape cases. 'In this instance, the prosecution made written and oral submissions and the judge ruled on the appropriate scope of questioning.' Smile of a predator: This photo was used by Brian Witty on his dating website profile . Shame of a disgraced rapist: Another picture Witty used online to attract women . Judge Nicholas Price QC passed an indeterminate sentence for public protection and ordered the former officer spend at least eight years behind bars. He will only be released when the parole board considers he no longer poses a risk. Sentencing Witty at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Price told him he was a ‘demanding, frightening and determined rapist’ who hid behind his military background to lure women into a ‘false sense of security.’ Witty was arrested after each of the first three attacks, but it was not until the final attack - in which he raped a 42-year-old woman after meeting her through the website DatingDirect.com - that he was finally charged. Judge Price said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that you pose a very real danger to women and the only appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment for public protection. ‘It is clear to me that you set out and prayed on vulnerable women. You hid your base intent behind the veneer of charm and lulled each victim into a false sense of security. ‘Each of them was beguiled into believing that with your military background and apparent social attributes that you were a gentleman and would behave as one. ‘Each of them described, in chilling evidence, your change from plausible and caring into a bullying, self-obsessed, arrogant sexual predator who was determined to indulge in fulfilling your sexual desires irrespective and dismissive of their pleas that you should desist.’ The fact that no action was taken after the first three complaints, he said, led him to feel as though he was ‘untouchable’ by the authorities. He went on: ‘With the benefit of hindsight, it is perhaps too easy to say that had you been successfully prosecuted in 1995, you may well not have been free to commit these other, later, serious offences.’ ‘It is to the benefits of justice’, he said, ‘that each of your three earlier victims did have the courage to not only make their original complaints but to come before the court so many years later and tell the jury what you had done to them and to relive the traumatic experience.’ City watering hole: Abacus, a bar on Cornhill, next to the Royal Exchange in the Square Mile, where Witty claimed to have made eye contact with an alleged victim as she ate chicken 'suggestively' The victim impact statements, he said, ‘speaks in harrowing terms of the long-term consequences of your actions on them...it is clear that what you did to each of them has changed their lives immeasurably. ‘It has resulted in distrust, if not fear, of other relationships. It has had adverse consequences on their work and social lives. ‘If anyone ever doubted the devastating long-term consequences of rape or sexual assault, these statements provide eloquent testimony against such doubts. You actions changed forever their lives and the lives of their close family and friends.’ The fact that no initial action was taken ‘led inevitably to feelings of loss of self-worth and despair that they had not been believed’, he said, adding: ‘Justice has been for too long delayed.’ Witty met his first victim, a nanny, in a pub in Fulham in 1995, and when she tried to fight him off at his Kensington flat he told her: ‘I don’t believe this, I’m a good-looking bloke’, before raping her. A second victim, a 25-year-old recruitment consultant who Witty contacted through DatingDirect.com in May 2006, met him for drinks in Covent Garden. Dating Direct: Witty met another victim through this online matchmaking service . Witty shook his head as he was given the verdicts at Kingston Crown Court . At the end of the evening he ‘forcefully dragged’ her into a doorway and sexually assaulted her, telling her afterwards: ‘You’re lucky, I don’t usually do that.’ He met the third woman in a City bar in October 2008 where he claimed she was ‘suggestively’ eating a chicken skewer. They met up for drinks three days later in Richmond before heading back to his riverside flat where he raped her. Witty’s fourth victim also met him through DatingDirect.com and went back to his flat after a few drinks in Teddington, where he raped her. Father-of-two Witty, of Twickenham, was given a sentence of six years for the first rape in 1995 to run concurrently with three indeterminate sentence for the two other rapes and sexual assault. He will serve a minimum of eight years and will sign the sex offenders’ register for life. Judge Price said he believed there was ‘significant risk to members of the public, by which I mean women, of serious harm occasioned by you.’","Brian Witty jailed indefinitely for three rapes and a sex assault over 15 years .

A jury has convicted Steven Powell of voyeurism charges that stemmed from an investigation into his missing daughter-in-law, finding him guilty on all 14 counts. Powell looked off into a corner of the courtroom as the verdict was read. Anne Bremner, an attorney who represents Susan Powell's family, smiled. Authorities brought the voyeurism charges last year after searching Steve Powell's home during their investigation into the disappearance of Susan Powell of Utah. With the conviction on all 14 counts, Powell faces the possibility of up to five years in jail for each. His sentencing is scheduled for June 15. Guilty: Steve Powell, left, talks with his attorney, Mark Quigley, as they wait for the start of closing arguments in Powell's voyeurism trial yesterday . Relief: Denise Cox, sister of missing Susan Powell, hugs a relative after the guilty verdict is read in Steven Powell's voyeurism trial today . Powell will also be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life. Prosecutors claim images used as a basis for the charges were found on a disc in his bedroom. Though they have said Susan Powell was the subject of many of Steve Powell's photos, those images were not part of the case. Instead, prosecutors focused on images of two young girls who lived next door to Steve Powell as he had hundreds of images of them bathing, getting dressed and going to the toilet. Susan Powell's family believes Steve Powell has information on her disappearance, and authorities say he has been uncooperative in the investigation. Susan Powell's husband, Josh, killed himself and the couple's two young children earlier this year by taking a hatchet to his sons before blowing the house up. Speaking after the verdict today, Jennifer Graves, Powell's estranged daughter who testified for the prosecution, revealed she was pleased with the verdict. 'I am so relieved, so relieved. So much tension was building during this last week,' she told the Deseret News from her West Jordan home. 'I hope it (time behind bars) goes higher than lower. I'd like to see him off the streets for quite a while. For my peace of mind and other people's safety.' Voyeur: The court was shown a slide show of where Steve Powell's house is in proximity to the neighbor's home he was found guilty of spying on . Graves said she also believes her father knows what happened to missing Utah mother Susan Cox Powell. During closing arguments yesterday, Pierce County prosecutor Grant Blinn methodically showed photos of the young girls to the jury while saying that Powell captured the images from his bedroom window. 'He was sitting there, lurking in the shadows, leering at the girls,' Blinn said. 'It is difficult to imagine a more obvious invasion of privacy.' Jurors deliberated for three-and-a-half hours yesterday before they were dismissed, according to ABC. They returned twice to the courtroom seeking information on two issues - the first was to learn whether the evidence found in boxes only belonged to Steve Powell and the second was to ask for the disc in which Powell allegedly taped himself viewing the images of the young girls. Prosecutors claimed Powell was 'naked, urinating and masturbating'. Today they returned to the courtroom about 45 minutes into deliberations to ask whether all of the exhibits had been presented to them. In total they deliberated for six-and-a-half-hours to reach a unanimous verdict. Victim: Evidence relating to Susan Powell was not allowed to be used for the trial, though Powell was convicted on all counts of voyeurism anyway . Listens: Chuck Cox, the father of missing Utah mom Susan Powell, sits with other family members during the closing arguments in the voyeurism trial of Susan Powell's father-in-law, Steve Powell, yesterday . Trial: Steve Powell at the trial last week after the court was shown a slideshow of the pictures he took of his neighbor's children while they were bathing and dressing . Authorities say the files show the young girls in a bathroom as they bathed and used the toilet. The girls, identified in court only by their initials, were about eight and ten years old when the images were captured. They testified they had no idea someone had taken photos of them in the bathroom. Defense attorney Travis Currie argued there were too many uncertainties in the evidence to convict. He questioned whether Steve Powell was the one who actually captured the images, noting others lived in the home. He also wondered whether the images were used for sexual gratification. 'There are people who are nosy, who like to spy on their neighbors,' Currie said. When talking about the burden of 'reasonable doubt', Currie reached as high as he could into the air, towering over the jury to emphasize how high of a bar that standard is. Among the images recovered from Steve Powell's home were many of Susan Powell that appeared to have been filmed without her knowledge, investigators said. There were also journals in which Steve Powell detailed his obsession with Susan Powell, they said. Much of that evidence has been barred from the trial as unduly prejudicial against the defendant. Steve Powell is not charged with acts of voyeurism involving Susan Powell because authorities can't prove she didn't know about the filming.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:14 EST, 5 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:30 EST, 6 May 2012 . It was an embarrassing start for President Obama's re-election campaign yesterday as he held his first political rally of the 2012 race in a half-empty arena. With wife Michelle dressed head to toe in campaign colors at his side, Obama targeted swing states Ohio and Virginia that are critical for his bid to remain in the White House. The President formally launched his Chicago-based re-election effort last year but his official political events have been confined to fundraisers since then. Scant support: Obama's rally for the 2012 presidential race at Ohio State University appeared to have a poor turnout . Rousing: President Obama addressed his first official campaign rally in Ohio Saturday after releasing an email to encourage supporters to watch the rally and donate money . That changed this weekend, however, with results which may have surprised Obama. The President, who was propelled to power in the 2008 election thanks in part to huge rallies across the nation, hoped to regain that momentum with events in large arenas in Columbus, Ohio and Richmond, Virginia. Come game time, however, with his first event - which was free and open to the public - held at Ohio State University, his numbers appeared to fall flat, according to several reports. One photo taken and posted to Twitter by Republican rival Mitt Romney's campaign spokesman Ryan Williams showed the floor and seats with more space than people. The venue holds 20,000 and according to figures from Obama's campaign, 14,000 attended the event - 70 per cent of the stadium's seating capacity. According to the paper, event organisers busied themselves moving people from the stage's surrounding seats to the arena's floor to depict a better crowd to television cameras. GOP forecast: The Republican National Committee earlier released their own prepared remarks for the president which forecast a tepid audience . Aiming to encourage his supporters, Obama released an email prior to his rally reminding them to watch his first rally and donate money. 'The . crowd's starting to form in Columbus, and they're ready to go,' he said . in the email. 'In a little while, I'll go on stage for the first rally . of 2012.' Obama's campaign is eager to get the president on the road and at the center of the political battle. 'We're ready to go,' campaign manager Jim Messina told reporters in a recent conference call. 'While . Mitt Romney has been busy endearing himself to the Tea Party and making . promises he can't keep, we've been busy building the largest grassroots . campaign in modern American history.' The Republican National Committee . released their own email earlier Saturday morning, however, in the mocking form of fake . prepared remarks for the president's rally in Columbus. 'Ohio, . thanks for the tepid welcome. I know I'm not as popular here as I once . was, so I'll take what I can get,' the RNC said in the imagined speech . it dubbed 'as prepared for reality.' True blue: The First Lady, wearing campaign colours from head to foot, also addressed the Ohio crowd . Support: Obama is traveling to Ohio and Virginia where he will hold rallies and officially begin his re-election bid for the 2012 US Presidential election . 'It . turns out the hope and change I promised didn't work out. So, we've . launched a new strategy: hype and blame,' the RNC's email said. Since Mr Romney became his party's presumptive nominee, Mr Obama has criticised his opponent in formal and informal situations - a sign that he is more than ready to launch the attacks that are expected to characterise a potentially ugly and negative campaign. Republicans accuse Mr Obama of infusing politics into his official White House events and scoff at the notion that his campaigning is just starting. The president has done official trips in recent months to highlight his energy record and to tout proposals to reduce costs for students. Young people are an important constituency for his campaign. The Obama campaign has mapped out several scenarios to win the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency, and the choice of states for his inaugural rallies was not coincidental. Ohio, with its large cache of 18 electoral votes, is a particularly coveted prize. Capacity: According to reports, the event filled just 14,000 of its 20,000 capacity which was free and open to the public . No Republican has made it to the White House in the last century without winning the state. Obama bested Republican rival John McCain there in 2008. Ohio has struggled with a loss of manufacturing jobs, but its unemployment rate, at 7.5 per cent in March, is below the national average, which was 8.2 per cent in March and dipped to 8.1 per cent in April. That could help blunt Mr Romney's attacks on Mr Obama's economic record. The president's campaign also hopes to capitalize on union anger over an attempt by the state's Republican governor, John Kasich, to limit collective bargaining rights for firefighters, police officers, and other state workers. The law was later repealed. Polls show Mr Obama is leading Mr Romney in Ohio and Virginia. An average of polls by RealClearPolitics showed the president ahead in Ohio by 4.2 percentage points and ahead in Virginia by 3.2 percentage points. Virginia had an even lower unemployment rate in March, coming in at 5.6 percent. The Obama campaign will also try to capitalize on an advantage with women voters in the state, where the governor - Republican Bob McDonnell - promoted legislation that would have required women to undergo an invasive trans-vaginal sonogram before getting an abortion. Mr Obama's wife, Michelle, will also help attract the female vote. The popular first lady, who has done fundraisers across the country for her husband's campaign, will be at his side for both rallies.",Mitt Romney's campaign posted picture showing sparsely populated rally at Ohio State University .

Dangerous: John Moir 45, has now racked up an incredible 208 convictions and was caught driving while banned for the 37th time . One of Britain's most prolific criminal drivers is back behind bars after his 208th conviction, 37 of which were carried out behind the wheel. John Moir, 45, of Ipswich, Suffolk, has been jailed for 16 weeks for driving while banned and uninsured, just two years after he almost killed a pedestrian in a brutal hit-and-run. The reckless driver, who has clocked up more than 200 total crimes, has received a four month sentence after his Hyundai Lantra was spotted by police on May 23. An officer gave chase and pulled him over, finding him in the passenger seat. But his female companion, who was spotted walking around the car, then told police he had in fact been driving. Moir served just nine months in prison after he nearly killed electrician Simon Jacobs, 43, in August 2010. Moir jumped a red light and ploughed into him as his helpless victim crossed a road in Ipswich. He then sped off, leaving him in a coma so serious that doctors told his devastated family he might die. His terrible injuries included a fractured skull and jaw, two fractured . eye sockets, a broken nose and one of his ears was almost severed. But miraculously Mr Jacobs battled back from the brink of death, although he had to surrender his own driving licence because of the risk of epilepsy as a result of his injuries. Caught: Moir was behind the wheel of a Hyundai Lantra like this one despite being banned and uninsured . Furious Mr Jacobs said people Moir should be punished much more . severely and should still be in jail. 'He nearly killed me,' he said. 'Do we have to wait for someone to actually lose their life, for him to . kill someone before he is given the sentence he deserves?' He added: 'I got lucky. 'If it had been a woman or a child he had hit, they probably would have died. 'He clearly has no regard for the law.' But just just eight days after his release for this crime, he was convicted of his 35th and 36th disqualified driving offences and jailed for 14 months. In addition to driving despite being banned and without insurance on August 16, 2011, Moir had stolen DVDs, gym clothing and a handbag from two cars. Four days later he drove while banned and without insurance again. Moir also perverted the course of justice by giving police a false name. Sentencing him at Ipswich Crown Court then Judge John Devaux told him: 'You show no sign of changing your ways.'","John Moir is back in prison again just two years after almost killing a man in a hit-and-run .

When Naomi Jacobs gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, it should have been the happiest time of her life. But the devastated new mother feared she would never see her child grow up, because she had a rare form of cancer that could kill her within 18 months. Ms Jacobs, from Newcastle, had an emergency caesarean when she was 37 weeks pregnant with baby Lily after suffering an infection. Terrible revelation: Naomi Jacobs, pictured with baby Lily and partner Mark Hurry, found out she had cancer after doctors found a tumour on her cervix during an emergency caesarean . Surgeons found and removed what they thought was a non-cancerous tumour on her cervix during the operation last October. It was sent off for a biopsy, and just two weeks after the birth, they told the crushed 23-year-old that she had large cell neuroendocrine, an aggressive form of cervical cancer. Ms Jacobs, who lives with partner Mark Hurry, 28, said: 'If I wasn’t pregnant with Lily I might never have known that I had cervical cancer. 'We gave her the middle name Grace because she saved my life. 'It was horrible being told that I had cervical cancer, but it was easier because I had Lily. Over the moon: Ms Jacobs feared she would never see her daughter grow up, but is now in remission and making the most of every day . 'She still needed her nappy changing and she still needed caring for so there was no option. 'I was told the survival rate was just 20 per cent. 'I looked it up on the internet when they told me what I had and it was the worst thing I could have done. 'It said that I would be dead in 18 months. That was a tough week.' For two months Ms Jacobs underwent a series of gruelling chemotherapy treatments before doctors put her on a five-week course of radiotherapy. Large-cell neuroendocrine cancer is rare, but very aggressive, when found in the cervix. In its early stages, neuroendocrine carcinoma does not have any symptoms so it is not always spotted straight away. Later on, symptoms include irregular bleeding, increased discharge, pelvic pain, painful urination, pain during sex, tiredness, leg swelling and backache. When left untreated, metastasis or even death may occur. At the beginning of March her treatment ended and she was told that she was technically in remission - although there is an 80 per cent chance of the cancer returning. The delighted mother believes Lily saved her life, because doctors would never have found the tumour if she hadn’t been pregnant. ''They say you have to seize the day and that’s exactly what we have been doing. 'We’re just enjoying life.' 'My mum has found it hard, but she has just not let it show. 'My partner, whenever I contemplate the fact I might not make it, he has never let me continue to think like that. 'Doctors have told me I can’t have more kids, but Lily is like a shining light.' Ms Jacobs is now raising money the Freeman Hospital’s Teenage Cancer Trust, where she has been receiving treatment for the past six months. She said: 'When I was first diagnosed they weren’t sure whether to put me in a children’s or an adult’s unit, but this TCT unit is incredible. 'You’ve got more things in common with the people. 'There was one night when the football was on and we just sat and watched the football together. 'Without the TCT I would not have been able to have my baby girl with me throughout my treatment. 'Offering me a private room with space for my baby, partner and my mum meant I was never alone. 'For that, I am eternally grateful and will work my hardest to ensure I pay it forward. 'Every young person deserves the love, care and respect I have been shown.'","Doctors would not have found tumour if Naomi Jacobs had not been pregnant .

But this is, in fact, a flock of starlings flying in formation at a Somerset nature reserve. The 'fantastic', not to mention appropriate, shape came about due to the threat of a nearby Peregrine Falcon. Big bird: A flock of starlings flies in formation in the sky above Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve in Somerset . Once the flock had spotted the predator, it quickly grouped together and inadvertently mimicked the appearance of a giant bird. When a hungry predator hovers nearby, . the birds must converge, flocking together, in an attempt to confuse the hunter, whether it be a . sparrowhawk, buzzard or Peregrine Falcons. These incredible pictures were taken by an amateur photographer at Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve. Rob Wolstenholme had travelled to the beauty spot specifically to shoot starlings as the area is well known for them. The . 51-year-old, himself the manager of a nature reserve in the Cotswolds, . said: 'Normally starlings fly in loose and dispersed flocks. But with . the Peregrine Falcon circling around them they bunched together and . coordinated and acted as one. 'I . suppose it is some kind of predatory avoidance strategy, because it . will make it more difficult for the falcon to pick out one starling.' 'Fantastic': The appropriate shape came about due to the threat of a nearby Peregrine Falcon . The mass of birds remained in formation for about 15 minutes until the falcon ceased its pursuit and the starlings scattered. Mr Wolstenholme, from Great Somerford, Wiltshire, added: 'I only realised how good the picture was when I looked back at it. 'I was just trying to compose a shot without any branches sticking out in the corner, then I found I had got that. 'I've never seen anything like it before - it's fantastic.' Scientists recently discovered the secret behind starlings' amazing spatial awareness. When they flock together, each starling tracks seven other birds - irrespective of distance - which produces the group's aerial ballet. Eventually, in late spring, birds pair off and look for suitable nesting grounds. They will not regroup until September, when their amazing daily display will begin again.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:46 EST, 9 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:32 EST, 10 May 2012 . A former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards broke down on the stand today as she described how close friend Elizabeth Edwards told her one of her fears of dying was that there would be no man there who loved her. Jennifer Palmier, who is now deputy communications director for President Barack Obama, also told the Greensboro court about the time Elizabeth angrily confronted a key donor about his support for the presidential candidate's pregnant mistress in 2007 at a hotel in Iowa. She said the candidate had called her to . the Davenport, Iowa, hotel room where his wife was arguing . with campaign finance chairman Fred Baron and his wife about the . couple's financial help to Rielle Hunter. Palmieri had become close friends with Elizabeth Edwards, and her husband hoped her presence could help calm the situation. Worried: Jennifer Palmieri, right, John Edwards' chief spokesman during Edwards' 2004 presidential run, arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, today to testify and left Edwards with his daughter Cate . Witness: Wendy Button, who once wrote speeches for John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse today after detailing conversations she had with Edwards in July 2009 about whether he should issue a statement saying he had fathered Hunter's child . She said she eventually distanced . herself from the former candidate after he acknowledged the affair in an . August 2008 television interview because he hadn't been truthful about . the baby he had with his mistress. The former aide later began crying . while discussing her friendship with Elizabeth Edwards who she had grown close to while working with her husband. Palmieri was with the Edwards . family when Elizabeth died in December of 2010 after battling . cancer. She broke down in tears describing what Elizabeth said: 'She was concerned that when she died, there would not be a man who . loved her there,' Palmieri said, though she noted that John Edwards was . there in the end. That day in Iowa in October of 2007, . Palmieri said Baron's wife, Lisa Blue, admitted to Elizabeth Edwards . that she had flown Hunter to Los Angeles for a shopping trip. 'You've got to hold your friends . close and your enemies closer,' Palmieri quoted Blue as telling the . enraged wife. Blue added that Hunter was a 'loose cannon' who could have . exposed the affair to the media, Palmieri said. At the time, a tabloid was publishing . an article about the affair, and Palmieri said the campaign was . absorbed with keeping the story from crossing over into the mainstream . media. Edwards had told his wife he had a . brief fling with Hunter, but that he had ended the affair many months . earlier, according to earlier testimony. In fact, Edwards had continued the . affair and Hunter was then pregnant with his child. A close aide to . Edwards, Andrew Young, had rented the mistress a home a few miles away . from the Edwards family estate in Chapel Hill. The candidate had kept the arrangement secret from his wife. Team: Defense lawyers for John Edwards, Allison Van Laningham, left, and Alan Duncan, right, enter a federal courthouse today to continue questioning the witnesses . Witness: Former Edwards donor Tim Toben, center, . arrives today for his second day of testimony in the trial against . Edwards and is the first person to mention the sex tape . Palmieri said Elizabeth Edwards couldn't comprehend why Baron and Blue would have any contact with Hunter. 'She didn't understand why they were embracing her, spending time with her,' Palmieri said. Asked what Edwards was doing during the argument, Palmieri said she didn't remember him saying much. 'He was more of a spectator than a participant,' she testified. How much Edwards knew about the money . spent in the effort to cover up his affair is a critical question at . his trial. Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six counts for campaign . finance violations related to about $1 million in secret payments from . Baron and 101-year-old heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon. Edwards has denied knowing about the . money, much of which was used to hide the pregnant mistress as he . campaigned for the White House. Baron flew Hunter across the country . in his private jet, paid for stays in luxury resorts and secured a . $20,000-a-month rental mansion in California. Glare of the media: Everyday since the beginning of his trial John Edwards has had his daughter Cate by his side . On Tuesday, campaign speechwriter . Wendy Button testified that Edwards had later admitted to her he knew . 'all along' that Baron had been supporting his mistress and baby. The girl was born in February 2008 a . few weeks after he suspended his presidential campaign after poor . showings in the early primary states. That contradicts what Edwards has . said about his knowledge of the money, most notably in a nationally . televised network interview in August 2008. During an initial phone call, she . said Edwards told her that he had wanted to tell the truth since . November 2008 but had been hampered by things at home. 'He . acknowledged that Quinn was his daughter and that he'd always known she . was his daughter,' Button testified. 'He said that it was wrong for him . to deny her.' On Wednesday, Edwards' defense lawyer . Abbe Lowell admitted his client had 'lied quite extensively' in that . interview, saying he had only a brief sexual relationship with Hunter . and denying he fathered her baby. Palmieri said she had advised Edwards . against doing the interview, which came shortly after tabloid reporters . photographed Edwards visiting his mistress and baby at a Beverly Hills . hotel. 'I said I did not want him doing the . interview if he was going to lie,' Palmieri recounted. 'Even I didn't . believe what he was saying.' But Palmieri said Edwards decided to . go ahead anyway after his wife pressed him to make a public statement . denying the baby was his. Yesterday: Toben testified that he retrieved . possessions of Rielle Hunter's from a rented house in Chapel Hill that . included a signed picture of Edwards. The picture was signed: 'I love . you, John' Benefactor: Paul and Bunny Mellon seen circa 1987. Bunny is now blind and a recluse . In an attempt to mitigate the damage, . Palmieri said she selected ABC's Nightline as the venue for the . interview because the news show was going up that night against the . opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics on rival NBC, which was . expected to get far bigger ratings. 'If John couldn't do the interview . and tell the truth, it was a mistake,' Palmieri said. 'I didn't think it . would be great if the whole country watched.' After the interview, Palmieri said . she asked a friend of Edwards' to deliver him a message that she didn't . want him to call her for help any more. 'I believed John was continuing to lie and trying to drag me into it,' Palmieri said. The government says the money should . have been reported as political donations because it was meant to keep . Edwards' image and candidacy intact. The defense argues the payments were . from one private third party to another and should not be characterized . as campaign contributions. Mellon's money went into the personal . accounts of Young and his wife and was used to help cover Hunter's . living and medical expenses. Baron paid for private flights and luxury accommodations as the Youngs and Hunter spent months on the run to keep the media from finding out about Edwards' affair.","Former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards also testified about how Elizabeth angrily confronted Fred Baron over financially supporting Rielle Hunter .

The euro crisis has turned violent in Germany after a shady terror group torched a car belonging to the EU finance chief tasked with sorting out the Greek financial catastrophe. German left-wing extremists claimed responsibility for the Sunday night arson blaze which destroyed a car used by Horst Reichenbach's wife. Reichenbach is leader of the EU task force on Greece and therefore seen by left-wingers as responsible for the continued misery of the Greek people as the country remains poised on a painful exit from the euro. The extremists are named after the dog Loukanikos, or sausage, who was pictured barking in front of Greek riot police in central Athens . His wife Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, a social democrat EU politician, had parked the BMW outside the family home near Potsdam when it was set ablaze. The attackers also threw stones at his house as well as bottles filled with red paint that left marks on the outside walls. Berlin, just 25 miles away, has been the scene of numerous luxury car arson attacks in recent months but police were initially puzzled about the attack on Reichenbach's car until the group responsible admitted it in a letter to a city newspaper. Continued unrest: Protesters throw petrol bombs at riot police in front of the Greek Parliament in Athens . An Italian anarchist group that has claimed responsibility for shooting the boss of a nuclear engineering firm threatened on Wednesday to target Prime Minister Mario Monti. The group, calling itself the Olga Nucleus of the Informal Anarchist Federation-International Revolutionary Front, said in a statement sent to a newspaper in southern Italy that Monti was among seven remaining targets after Roberto Adinolfi, boss of Ansaldo Nucleare, was shot in the leg last week. The attack fuelled rising concern about a return of political violence in Italy because of economic hardship and increasing opposition to austerity measures implemented by Monti's government. The group called itself the 'Friends of Loukanikos' - a reference to a dog whose name in English means 'Sausage' who has been pictured at the thick of the action in recent Greek riots. He is understood to be a stray. 'We say to Monti that he is one of the seven remaining and that the people have no interest in staying in Europe, saving the banks and helping to balance the accounts of a state that squandered money for its own interests,' the statement said. The group called itself the 'Friends of Loukanikos' - a reference to a dog whose name in English means 'Sausage' who has been pictured at the thick of the action in recent Greek riots. He is understood to be a stray. The Berliner Morgenpost received the letter which read; 'The target of the attack was not Roth-Behrendt, but her husband Reichenbach. 'As leader of the EU task force on Greece, he is responsible for holding the Greek authorities to austerity measures, which have extremely worsened the lives of Greek people.' Further threats were made in the letter to the European Union, International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, as well as various multinational firms. For Germany, the attack is a significant ratcheting up of public anger over the entire Greece issue and the wider eurozone problems. Germany fought an urban war against leftist guerllias in the 70's and 80's that polarised the country. At the moment far-right violence is seen as more of a threat, but authorities are keen to choke off support for violent left-wingers as quickly as possible. German police admitted they had not heard of the group until the letter was sent to the newspaper. 'We are pursuing all avenues,' said a spokesman for the local prosecutor.","Group named after Greek riot dog called Loukanikos .

The Olympic torch began its 8,000-mile relay around Britain yesterday – and was quickly at the centre of a moment of drama. As 76-year-old Eric Smith carried the flame for one section of the journey through Cornwall, a man came out of the cheering crowd and attempted to run alongside him. But the interloper quickly found himself bundled unceremoniously into a hedge by a Metropolitan Police officer in grey jogging gear. The officer was a member of the torch’s security team. The incident sent out a clear message to anyone planning to gatecrash the relay over the next 70 days before the torch arrives at the Olympic Stadium in East London. Mr Smith, a recipient of the George Medal in 1962 as a helicopter rescue winchman who helped save six people from a shipwreck at Land’s End, was unfazed by the incident. His son Ronnie said: ‘He’s had a great day.’ In a brief statement, Scotland Yard said: ‘We can confirm that officers from the Met’s Olympic Torch Team took action to prevent a man from gaining access to the torch-bearer close to Land’s End. Over zealous: The man emerges from the crowd and attempts to run alongside torch bearer Eric Smith . Oh no you don't: The man is immediately tackled by guards who swiftly get him out of the way . Taken down: He is thrown to the floor into some hedges and torch bearer Eric Smith carries on as if nothing happened . ‘We would like to remind members of the public not to attempt to breach the security envelope.’ The first to carry the torch was sailing champion Ben Ainslie, who said it was ‘one of the more nervous moments in my life’ after setting out from Land’s End. The triple Olympic gold medallist opted to ‘savour the moment’ by walking rather than running his allotted 300 metres. He stopped regularly to let some of the 3,500-strong crowd see the flame close up. After passing it on to GB girls surf champion Tassy Swallow, 18, of St Ives, Cornwall, he admitted: ‘I did not really want to rush it. I wanted to give everyone the chance to touch the torch.’ Being the first to carry the flame on home soil would be a treasured memory, said Ainslie, 35, who is aiming to win his fourth successive gold this summer. He said: ‘That particular moment ranks right up there with winning a gold medal. State - backed Royal Bank of Scotland has provoked fury by lavishing corporate hospitality on its clients at the London Olympics. Executives from RBS’s investment banking division, which was widely blamed for the bank’s near-collapse four years ago, will be able to enjoy gourmet dishes and champagne while they watch the events – most of which are sold out to members of the public. RBS chiefs have purchased tickets thought to have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds from a company which is charging up to £7,500 per seat. But despite repeated requests by this newspaper, the bank, which is 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer, refused to reveal the cost of the tickets. A spokesman said: ‘It’s just not something we want to put out there.’ Another added: ‘The policy of not talking about the tickets has been decided way above my grade.’ Last night Labour MP John Mann said: ‘It’s an outrageous use of taxpayers’ money. We have bailed them out to the tune of £50 billion. ‘It is quite unnecessary at the current time and shows that RBS is continuing with the sort of old-style extravagance that we saw when Fred Goodwin was in charge.’ The £7.5 million pavilion where RBS bosses will entertain guests is 50 yards from the stadium in the Olympic Park in Stratford. Guests will be offered a gourmet menu  as part of the deal with hospitality firm Prestige Ticketing. Dishes will include loin of salmon, smoked duck roulade and Avruga caviar, which costs £25 for a 4oz serving. Four-course dinners are expected to feature seared scallops, wild nettle risotto and saddle of lamb. The wine list includes Laurent-Perrier Cuvee Rose Brut, which costs about £60 a bottle. RBS said: ‘Like all British companies we have been asked to support this historic event and are happy to do so. The Olympics has provided opportunities for us and our customers to do new business together to the benefit of the  wider economy.’ ‘It was incredibly special. It is one of those moments in your life where you are just in shock. At least I didn’t trip over.’ After her leg, Miss Swallow added: ‘This meant the world to me.’ Today the torch will head towards North Devon from Plymouth en route to 1,021 villages, towns and cities across the country. The flame, lit by the sun’s rays at a ceremony in Olympia, Greece, last week, will be carried by an average 110 torch-bearers each day. The event will end on July 27 when the final runner – still unnamed – enters the Olympic Stadium to light the Games cauldron.","Man is bundled into a hedge after trying to run alongside torchbearer Eric Smith .

When businessman Ian Bury discovered and detained a suspected metal thief carrying a crowbar, wire strippers, cutters and a screwdriver, at his lighting firm, he assumed it was an open and shut case. But to his astonishment, police told him the alleged criminal - caught ‘bang to rights’ hiding at the scene - had been released without charge due to a lack of evidence. The head of a lighting company, which that week had been broken into four times, has spoken of his anger at the outcome. Raided: Ian Bury thought he had caught the suspected metal thief 'bang to rights' when he discovered a man hiding at his lighting firm building . He said: ‘We couldn’t believe he was let off.’ The incident which led to the suspect’s arrest was the second in 48 hours at Mr Bury’s company, Sparkbrook-based Luminaire. Thieves first struck at the premises, in Statford Street North, on May 13, then again on May 15 and for a third time on May 16. Copper piping was taken on each occasion and Mr Bury said the site suffered a fourth break-in on May 19 - but there was nothing left to take. Mr Bury, 48, said he and some colleagues were making his company’s base secure after the first break-in when they disturbed intruders on May 15. 'Bang to rights': The alleged thief was detained at the scene until police arrived after being caught hiding beneath a pile of cardboard . Furious: Ian Bury's lighting firm had been repeatedly targeted by metal thieves who had stripped his premises of valuable cables and left a trail of destruction . ‘In the first raid, the boiler was ripped from the wall and copper pipes, cable and radiators were all taken,’ he said. ‘We must have disturbed the intruders on the second time. One ran off down a passage, down the fire escape route and disappeared.’ Mr Bury and his colleagues caught a second suspect hiding beneath a pile of cardboard and called the West Midlands Police. But the businessman took a call the next day informing him it had been decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute. And the firm, which employs 30 people, was then burgled for a third time that night. A police spokesman said the force had no record of the May 19 raid, but added: ‘We can confirm we are investigating three burglaries at a building on Stratford Street North in Sparkbrook. Ransacked: Ian Bury inspects some of the damage done during several raids on his lighting firm by metal thieves in the space of a few days . ‘One person was arrested on May 15 on suspicion of burglary but was later released without charge. The decision on whether to charge, bail or release a suspect is always made based on the evidence available at the time. Police patrols were stepped up in the area following the initial burglary.’ Det Sgt John Jacob added: ‘This is still an active investigation and we are following up a number of lines of enquiry. We are also looking to improve CCTV coverage of the area. ‘We will continue to use a wide range of tactics, both overt and covert, to stamp out metal theft; a crime which brings misery to all of the community.’","Businessman Ian Bury and colleagues detained a suspect hiding under cardboard on the site and held him until police arrived .

'Guilty secret': Tim Loughton said the sexual exploitation of children in Britain had been swept under the carpet for too long . Britain needs an open debate about 'issues around culture' that may explain why men from Pakistani backgrounds are over-represented among offenders prosecuted for grooming white girls for sex, a Government minister has said. Children's Minister Tim Loughton was speaking a week after nine members of a grooming network in Rochdale were jailed for offences against vulnerable girls aged between 12 and 16. The men, all but one of whom are of Pakistani heritage, lured their victims off the streets with free food and alcohol before sexually abusing them over a two-year period in flats and houses across northern England. The trial was the latest in a series of court cases in which men from the Pakistani community have been prosecuted for sex offences against teenagers. Mr Loughton told a conference on child sexual exploitation, reported by The Times, that the Rochdale case raised 'troubling questions' about the attitude of the men towards white girls. He said that nothing was gained by 'shying away from taking this issue and debating it head on' and warned that the sexual exploitation of children in Britain had been swept under the carpet 'like a guilty secret' for too long. 'As a result,' he added, 'there was a real and tragic failure to grasp the scale of the problem with awful consequences for hundreds, if not thousands, of children and young people.' Mr Loughton said the issue was now at the very top of the Government's agenda. Speaking in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Cameron said he would consider calling for a serious case review into the Rochdale crimes. He said the gang's victims had 'been brave to come forward and to tell their stories', adding: 'It is a truly shocking case. 'We need to look very carefully at what went wrong.' Mr Cameron said he had asked for the case to be considered by Education Secretary Michael Gove, who had referred it to the Office of the Children's Commissioner. The Prime Minister added: 'I think it's important we get to the bottom of a truly, truly dreadful case.' Jailed: Eight of the Rochdale child sex gang put behind bars last week. Pictured (top row left to right) Abdul Rauf, Hamid Safi, Mohammed Sajid and Abdul Aziz; (bottom row left to right) Abdul Qayyum, Adil Khan, Mohammed Amin and Kabeer Hassan . It has been reported that England's children's homes have seen 631 cases in the last five years of young residents being sold for sex. Most offenders in other types of sex crime against children - such as online grooming and abuse within the family - are white men, research has found. Mr Loughton told the Safe & Sound national conference, held at the British Library in London yesterday, that he expected local authorities to take immediate action if there was any suggestion that children in their care were being harmed. He said it was 'unacceptable' that some children's homes had failed to protect young people. Concerned: Trevor Phillips said it would be a 'national scandal' if it emerged that social services and schools had not acted on reports of abuse for fear of 'demonising' minority communities . The minister's comments come only days after the chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, Trevor Phillips said it would be 'fatuous' to suggest there was no racial link in the Rochdale case. He said it would be a ‘national scandal’ if it emerged that social services and schools had not acted on reports of abuse for fear of ‘demonising’ minority communities. Nazir Afzal, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West of England, has said the authorities should have acted sooner to protect girls in care.","There is nothing to be gained by 'shying away' from the issue, Tim Loughton said .

The last will and testament of Joe Paterno has been ordered permanently sealed from public view along with all related court filings at the request of a family attorney. The judge's order and petition by a Paterno attorney requesting the action were also sealed. County records indicate that Paterno's was the only will sealed in the county in the past 18 months. A family spokesman said today that the step was intended to preserve 'a measure of privacy' for the family and was 'not an unusual request for high-profile individuals'. The coach, who had a record-breaking . 409 victories in more than four decades at Penn State, died from lung . cancer in January at age 85, months after he was ousted by . the school's board of trustees following the explosive child sex abuse . allegations against retired assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. The ruling came as Sandusky's trial was due to begin this week. He . is charged with 52 counts relating to child sex abuse. The seven women and five men on the jury who will hear opening statements on Monday. On . April 5, Paterno's will entered probate, the legal process for validating the . document, and estate attorney Raymond Parker petitioned to keep the . matter secret on the same day. Four days later, a judge ordered the . record sealed. The decision was 'very strange', said Wilkes-Barre attorney Jerry Chariton, who has worked on estate law cases for four decades. 'Would . there be reasons why any family would like to preserve confidentiality? Sure, but that would be true of lots of people,' Chariton said. 'I . don't know what creates any special situation here.' The paper said court officials could . not determine which of the county's five judges ordered the Paterno will . and case file sealed. Judge . Thomas Kistler, who as president judge oversees the county courts . system, didn't return messages left at his chambers and home. Parker . also didn't return telephone and email messages. Family spokesman Dan McGinn said today . that the step was recommended by the estate attorney 'in an attempt to . preserve a measure of privacy for the family'. Getting ready for trial: Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant football coach who is charged with 52 counts relating to child sex abuse, appeared in unexpectedly good spirits when he walked into court last week . 'This is not an unusual request for high-profile individuals, and all parties to the will and the judge readily agreed to the request,' Mr McGinn said. The Paterno family has been totally transparent with 'respect to Coach Paterno's contract and pension. Sue Paterno has also reiterated her commitment to support charitable causes connected to Penn State and the State College community. These efforts will continue'. Only a court docket sheet remained public record and provided limited details about the former coach's will, wealth and estate. Paterno completed his last will and testament in June 1997 and filed an amendment in February 2010, naming his wife, Sue, as executor. The estate paid a $200,000 inheritance tax on April 23. The paper said that depending on the applicable rate, the taxable portion of Paterno's estate at the time of the tax payment was worth between $1.35 million to $4.45 million. Publicity: Coach Joe Paterno died shortly after the child abuse scandal surrounding his former coach Sandusky came to light . Other details came from Penn State and the state employees retirement system. On April 19, the university paid Paterno's estate more than $3 million in salary, television and radio revenue sharing, bonuses and death benefits. The university also said it would forgive $350,000 in unspecified outstanding loans and debt incurred by the Paternos. On May 22, the state retirement system said Paterno left his wife his $13.4million in pension benefits. McGinn said at the time that she would give $1.5million to charity, including $500,000 to the Suzanne Pohland Paterno Catholic Student Faith Center. The former coach for years sidestepped questions about his salary, and state officials declined requests to reveal his compensation until late in his career. In 2007, a court ordered the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System to disclose Paterno's base salary of $512,664, saying it was a public record.",Child abuse trial of assistant coach Jerry Sandusky starts today .

A cash-strapped Spanish Baroness is hoping one of her prized Constable paintings will fetch £25million at auction so she can 'ease her cash flow situation'. Baroness Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza, who founded the Madrid art museum bearing her surname, said her country's recession was 'also affecting collectors'. It had forced her, she said, to sell British painter John Constable's The Lock - finished in 1824 and the last of The Stour Series, which includes his famous work The Hay Wain, to be privately owned. For sale: The Lock, by British painter John Constable, is up for grabs at Christie's auction house in London in July . Reluctant: Baroness Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza said she did not want to sell her Constable painting . 'I need the money, I really need it, I have no liquidity,' the owner of an art collection worth more than £800million told Spanish reporters in a staggeringly frank admission. She added: 'I am very austere with my life, but to maintain the collection requires lots of costs. 'I have had £640million of art work lent for free to the Spanish state over the last 13 years. I did not want to sell this. 'It has given me a lot of pain to lose this painting, that myself and my husband bought at an auction in 1990, but if God chooses I will not have to sell any more.' Art home: The Thyssen-Bonemisza museum is located in the 19th century Villahermosa Palace in Madrid . Couple: Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza (left) and her late husband Baron Hans Heinrich (right) build up a formidable art collection which has become the envy of the world . The Lock, to be sold at Christie's auction house in London on July 3, depicts a man operating a wooden canal lock gate in preparation for a boat to pass through. A rural church is visible in the distance. It was first acquired by 19th century collector James Morrison at the Royal Academy’s summer exhibition in the year it was completed. Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza was one of Europe's richest men in the latter half of the 20th century - and following in his father Baron Heinrich's footsteps he became one of the world's greatest art collectors. Using wealth generated from the large industrial conglomerate inherited from his father, he preserved and augmented the outstanding collection of Old Master pictures formed in the 1920s and 1930s. He also significantly expanded the range through his own acquisitions, most particularly of the work of European and American artists from the 19th and 20th centuries. His father’s collection included masterpieces by European masters including Hans Holbein the Younger, Albrecht Durer, Jan van Eyck, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Caravaggio. It was largely displayed at the Villa Favorita, a 17th century mansion on Lake Lugano acquired from Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia in 1932. Baron Hans Heinrich added more than 200 paintings, as well acquiring over 900 more modern works which were completely outside his father’s range of interest. As his collection increased in scale, he began to focus on the possibility of finding it a suitable, permanent home. In the mid-1980s, the main body of the collection was placed into a trust and in 1992 the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum was opened in the newly refurbished 19th century Villahermosa Palace in Madrid. Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza shared her now deceased husband’s passion for collecting and they spent much of their marriage visiting museums, art galleries and auction houses. The Thyssen-Bornemisza's bought it at auction for £10.8million in 1990 - at the time a world record price for any British work of art. It has since been in the collection at the Madrid museum - which the couple opened in 1992 in the refurbished 19th century Villahermosa Palace after placing their collection into a trust some years before. The Baroness tried to sell it to a British collector last year for £30million, but the deal was never sealed. She also tried to negotiate with the Spanish state, saying: 'I offered it at a special price, to be paid in installments, but we could not reach a deal.' She also revealed that the museum has been been hit the country's economic crisis, with Caja Madrid recently cancelling its long-standing annual £1.75million sponsorship. But it is not her most valuable painting, which is the Mata Mua by Gauguin, which has been valued at around £120million. Constable himself said of The Lock: 'It looks most beautifully silvery, windy and delicious - it is all health - and the absence of everything stagnant, and is wonderfully got together.' Jussi Pylkkanen, president of Christie’s Europe, Middle East, Russia and India, called the piece 'an outstanding masterpiece of European art'. He said: 'This superb landscape, coming from the same series as The Hay Wain, represents British landscape painting at its very best.' Richard Knight, co-Chairman of Old Master and British Paintings Department, and John Stainton, International Director, British Paintings, said: 'The sale of this painting will be a moment of huge significance for the art market, and for that of Old Master paintings in particular. 'In 2006 we combined the forces of our Old Master and Early British paintings departments due to the broadening international appeal for works dependent on their quality, as opposed to the nationality of the artist. 'Since then we have seen British art reach new heights and have broken records for a number of the greatest British artists including Stubbs, Gainsborough and Lawrence. 'We look forward very much to presenting this hugely significant work of art to the world's leading collectors and museums.'","Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza said crisis was 'also affecting collectors'

"By . Rob Preece . PUBLISHED: . 07:42 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:50 EST, 14 June 2012 . Seventy-six suspected paedophiles, including a Scout leader, a retired teacher and Government employees, have been arrested across the UK in a major police investigation into sickening child sex images on the internet. Members of the armed forces, a pathologist and a firefighter were also among those detained in the 48-hour operation, which involved more than 40 police forces nationwide. About 80 children have been taken to safety as part of the investigation, including 20 who were found to be living at the properties searched by officers. Raids: Police led by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre executed at least 141 search warrants and arrested 76 suspects . Police led by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) executed at least 141 search warrants, as experts warned that images being downloaded by paedophiles are becoming more extreme, sadistic and violent. Most of the warrants related to image offences, including the possession and distribution of indecent images of children, Ceop said. Others arrested include a referee, an outdoor activities instructor, a computer programmer and known offenders who had breached the conditions of the Sex Offenders' Register. Ceop today published a report warning that anyone caught downloading child abuse images online poses a risk of committing physical sex attacks on children. The report said that one analysis showed 55 per cent of paedophiles who possess indecent images also commit sexual offences against children. The report also warned that detectives investigating online indecent images of children faced an 'unprecedented caseload' at a time when police budgets are being cut. Kate Fisher, a principal analyst at Ceop, said: 'The images being downloaded are increasingly becoming more extreme, sadistic and violent and feature increasingly younger children.' However, the severity and number of images held by offenders are not enough alone to assess the risk they pose or the sentence they should receive, the report said. Ceop urged police forces to prioritise the investigation of anyone caught with child abuse images who has easy access to children. Andy Baker, deputy chief executive at Ceop, said: 'It is clear that those who possess indecent images also pose a significant risk to children and understanding and managing that risk is not an easy undertaking. Disturbing: Experts warned that images of children on the internet were becoming more extreme, sadistic and violent. (File photograph) 'However, when we bring together the latest intelligence picture, nationally co-ordinated police action and operational support from our colleagues in the Serious Organised Crime Agency, we are making the UK a more hostile place for those who are seeking to exploit our children.' Ceop called for the authorities to look beyond the quantity and severity of the images, adding that a full risk assessment should be considered before a judge hands down any sentence. Ms Fisher said the dramatic increase in images being downloaded, and the cuts to police resources, meant officers struggled with the workload but stressed that the notion that any case may result in the identification of a victim should be at the forefront of every investigation. She added: 'The levels of austerity and the caseload of indecent images of children is unprecedented. 'A quick and timely investigation for each case is increasingly unrealistic. Victim identification is the key element.' Almost 100 case studies from 34 forces found offenders who both possessed child abuse images and attacked children were 'almost exclusively white males', most aged between 19 and 45. One offender was found with 2.5million still and moving images. Mr Baker said: 'This is an exceptional number of images but it does not necessarily mean that person will go on to commit contact offences.' Those not in work, and possibly therefore those with high levels of internet usage, those working in schools or care work, and those in manual and manufacturing jobs made up most of the sample, the report said. In 85 per cent of cases, offenders looking at indecent images of children did so at home, with the rest looking at images mainly at work. The majority lived with a spouse or partner and of that group, more than half were living with children. From the 97 offenders in the study, 246 victims of contact abuse were identified. Referrals to Ceop increased by 181 per cent between April last year and March, figures showed. The report said: 'This point in time has the potential to be a golden age for child protection, but the evolution of technology is likely to make the internet an increasingly difficult place to investigate. 'The predicted dramatic rise in work volumes will require a fresh look at policing priorities and the resources allocated to this area of policing.' Under pressure: A report warned that detectives investigating indecent images of children faced an 'unprecedented caseload' at a time when police budgets are being cut . West Midlands Police said it raided six addresses over the past two days as part of the nationwide sting operation. Three people were arrested and four children 'safeguarded' after 35 officers executed warrants across the force area in Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Solihull, Sandwell and Dudley. A 47-year-old man was arrested in Wolverhampton, a 37-year-old man was arrested in Dudley and a . 38-year-old man was arrested in Sandwell, all on suspicion of downloading indecent images of children. All three have been released on police bail with strict conditions pending further enquiries, a spokesman said, and computers were seized from all addresses. The raids related to suspected offences involving images, including the possession and distribution of indecent images of children, a spokesman said. The force said Operation Tharsley was a joint operation between 42 police forces and officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), targeting people thought to be in possession of child abuse images. Suspects in the West Midlands were identified through local investigations as well as intelligence received directly from Ceop. Detective Inspector Kay Wallace, from the force’s Child Online Safeguarding Team, said: 'This type of work is going on every day across the West Midlands as we seek to tackle those who use the internet as a vehicle to offend against children be it grooming for sexual activity or making, possessing or distributing indecent images. 'We are committed to arresting suspects, seizing images and ensuring our children are protected from abuse.' Gloucestershire Police confirmed that its officers also took part in the raids. A 68-year-old man, from Newent, near Gloucester, was arrested on suspicion of the making, possession and distribution of indecent images of children. A force spokesman said the man was released on bail to attend Gloucester police station on September 4. Jon Brown, head of the NSPCC’s sexual abuse programme, said: 'This supports research the NSPCC carried out last year which revealed one in three of those convicted of possessing child abuse images has also committed other serious sexual offences against children.' He added: 'It’s a very worrying situation and more research is needed on the most effective punishment and treatment of offenders caught viewing child abuse pictures. 'Trying to stop the terrible trade in these images is obviously a huge task. 'But it mustn’t be seen in isolation. It’s part of a much bigger sexual abuse problem. 'And we must never forget that these images are abuse in themselves and often very young children, including babies, are being assaulted and raped so these pictures can be produced.'","Some 80 children were taken to safety as part of the sting operation, which was led by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre .

It's the traditional sound which has greeted the start of children's sack races, sprints and egg and spoon challenges for generations. And when Gartocharn Primary School in Dunbartonshire secured the services of the London Olympics chief starter for their own sports day, the school must have thought it would be an extra special occasion. But the school had not reckoned with the administrative power of health and safety council officials, who banned Alan Bell from firing a pistol at the event in case the sound frightened the school's children. Banned: Mr Bell, who has officiated over 25,000 race starts, has been told he cannot use a pistol because it might frighten the children . In an even more bizarre move, the council's solution was to play a recording of a starting pistol from an iPod, before it was eventually agreed that Mr Bell could use a klaxon instead . Parents of pupils at the school have branded the ruling 'ridiculous' and accused the local authority of 'tying themselves in knots'.. Mr Bell has clocked up over 25,000 race starts in his career and even famously false-started world's fastest man Usain Bolt at the athletics World Championships last year. Alternative: Officials eventually allowed Mr Bell to start the race using a klaxon . The 61-year-old had agreed to start the primary school race as he has family near the affluent Scottish village, and had previously officiated at hundreds of primary school events. One parent, who did not wish to be named, told a Sunday newspaper: 'It was ridiculous. We were told that the children would be distressed by Mr Bell firing his starting pistol. 'Anyone who believes they would be . frightened by a starting pistol has never experienced the noise at a . typical three-year-old’s birthday party. 'The . council tied themselves in knots trying to sort this out. 'One solution . they came up with was to play a recording of a starting pistol on an . iPod so the gun would not actually be fired on school grounds.' A . spokesman for West Dunbartonshire Council said: 'A klaxon was used . because it was felt that a gunshot might frighten some of the nursery . children. The event was still a huge success.'

Although a man who was 32 wasn't breaking the law by having sex with a 17-year-old girl in 2008, he was by photographing the act, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled Thursday. Marshall Hollins was convicted in Stephenson County of making child pornography and sentenced to 8 years in prison. He admitted he had sex with the girl when she was 17, which is the age of sexual consent in Illinois. Guilty: Marshall Hollins, 35, is serving an 8-year prison sentence for child pornography, for photographing himself having sex with his 17-year-old girlfriend in 2009 . In a 5-2 ruling, the high court said that although the law allows 17-year-olds to consent to sex, they are still minors, making photos or video of such sex child porn. The consequences of sexual activity are apparent to teens, but the consequences of being in pornography aren't, the court found. 'These concerns are exacerbated in the modern digital age, where once a picture or video is uploaded to the Internet, it can never be completely erased or eradicated,' Justice Rita Garman wrote for the majority. 'It will always be out there, hanging over the head of the person depicted performing the sexual act.' The majority also noted that Congress in 1984 changed the definition of a minor in child pornography to anyone under 18 because it found 'the previous ceiling of 16 had hampered enforcement of child pornography laws since, with the 16-year-old ceiling, there was sometimes confusion about whether a subject was a minor since children enter puberty at different ages.' Ruling: The jury ruled that since the 17-year-old was still a minor at the time, the photos were pornographic (stock photo) The two dissenting justices said that because the photos don't show an illegal act, they shouldn't be illegal. 'There was nothing unlawful about the production of the photographs taken by defendant in this case because the sexual conduct between defendant and (the girl) was entirely legal,' wrote Justice Anne Burke, who was joined by Justice Charles Freeman. 'The photographs are therefore not child pornography as defined by the U.S. Supreme Court for purposes of the First Amendment.' Attorney Kathleen Hamill of the Office of the State Appellate Defender represented Hollins. She said the office hasn't decided whether to challenge the ruling. The Illinois Legislature changed the age of consent for pornography from 16 to 18 in 1985, she said. 'This apparently is the first case that has arisen challenging that,' Hamill said.","Age of sexual consent in Illinois is 17 .

An ailing man whose sister bled to death on the operating table while donating her kidney to him has spoken out about his overwhelming guilt at her death. Mother-of-three Yolanda Medina, 41, died after her aorta was sliced at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. In the wake of the death, the hospital has now stopped transplanting organs from live patients. Yolanda Medina was donating her organ to her younger brother, 39-year-old Roberto Medina, whose kidneys began failing two years ago. Tragedy: Mother-of-three Yolanda Medina, left, bled to death while donating her kidney to her younger brother Roberto, right. He has spoken out about his overwhelming guilt following the death . 'It’s just tough on me... because she lost her life trying to save mine,' Roberto told the New York Post. 'And that’s really what is killing me every day.' Yolanda's death was the first at the hospital in more than 40 years and 3,500 kidney donation operations. The procedures have stopped until a full investigation is complete. Her brother was placed on the donor waiting list two years ago, but she stepped forward to help after he suffered renal failure and started dialysis in February. She said: 'That’s it,' and offered herself as a donor, Roberto said. He added: 'She wanted to do it. I didn’t ask her for it. Nobody from the family asked her to do it.' The night before the operation - on . May 23 - relatives asked Yolanda if she was sure about her decision. 'She said: ""Yes, I'm sure"",' Roberto said. 'She said nobody could stop . her.' Roberto collected his . sister from her home in the Bronx where she sobbed as she left her . children - aged two, seven and 11 - but promised them she would see them . later. Surgeon: Roberto Medina named his sister's . surgeon as Dr. Javier Friedmann, pictured. On the doctor's Facebook, an . image shows him napping in his scrubs, right . At work: Dr. Friedmann (left) left the operating room and told the family something was wrong . The pair were then prepped for surgery, with Yolanda's operation going first. Roberto identified her surgeon as  Dr. Javier Friedmann. As she went, 'she turned and gave me a look, a deep look in my eyes' before winking, Roberto said. But two hours later, Medina’s surgeon, Dr. Liise Kayler, told him the transplant was not going to go ahead as there had been complications and they needed to resuscitate her. Soon afterwards, the family gathered to hear that Yolanda had died. Losing his sister also came with the extra blow that there was no longer a kidney to save him. But . he added to the Post that the hospital called him on Wednesday to say . they had a kidney match. He was scheduled to go to the clinic for a . check up of Thursday to see if he was ready. 'Amazing,' he said. 'Heaven sent. This is what Yolanda wanted for us.' His . lawyer Ben Rubinowitz said: 'If he doesn’t get a kidney in a timely . manner, he will remain on dialysis, and unfortunately, it might result . in something far worse.' Under investigation: The live-donor organ transplant program at Montefiore Hospital shut down in the wake of the tragedy. Yolanda's death was the first for the program in 40 years . A spokesperson for the hospital said: 'This is a heartbreaking situation in so many ways, and our hearts are with the patient’s family during this difficult time. 'Surgeons respect and honor the trust that is placed in them every day, but in rare situations like this, it is still readily apparent that medicine is far from perfect. 'Our transplantation department is among the very best in the country and in 40 years we have never experienced a loss such as this. We are focused now on caring for the patient as he awaits his transplant.' Of the failed surgery, a spokesperson added: 'The patient experienced a rare . complication of this surgery. The doctors . recognised the problem and took extensive steps to save the patient's . life.' In the wake of the incident, Montefiore Hospital has stopped transplanting organs from live patients. On its webpage, Montefiore had written: 'In 40 years of performing live donor transplant . surgery, Montefiore has not experienced a single living donor death . related to donation.' The sentence has been taken down in recent weeks. Shattered reputation: The hospital has carried out 3,500 kidney transplants over the past 40 years, with 1,000 from live donors . The state Health Department is . investigating the death and the program will only start again when the . investigation has concluded. 'We are working closely with the hospital to determine what occurred,' Health Department spokesman Bill Schwarz told the Post. The hospital has conducted 3,500 kidneys transplants since 1967, with around 1,000 coming from live donors in that time. Deaths while on the operating table for organ donation are rare; Montefiore estimates three people die out of every 10,000 surgeries. In a recent high-profile case, Lorraine Hawks from Massachusetts launched a lawsuit against the clinic where her husband died in surgery. Paul Hawks, 57, was donating part of his liver to his brother-in-law when he bled to death. His wife claimed her husband's EKG before the operation was abnormal and staff had not used a high speed blood pump as he was bleeding to death.","Yolanda Medina's aorta was sliced on the operating table in May .

Respected: David Mockett stood up to 'bully boys' he suspected of fraudulently claiming they had been attacked . A British marine expert blown up in a car bomb attack was murdered by a fraud gang who had claimed Somali pirates attacked their ship, an inquest heard yesterday. David Mockett, 65, was working for a shipping company when he died in a car bomb explosion in Yemen almost a year ago. His death was ordered by a gang running a scam making fraudulent insurance claims for ships apparently attacked by Somali pirates, the hearing was told. Mr Mockett had stood up to the 'bully boy' gang but was later killed because of his investigation into their tanker, it was claimed. The inquest in Plymouth, Devon, heard that he had survived another attempt on his life in 2001, which was believed to have been linked to his work. The father-of-two, who was employed as a marine shipping surveyor and consultant, had grave doubts about one insurance claim. The hearing was told that Mr Mockett doubted that an oil tanker, the Brillante Virtuoso, had come under attack from Somali pirates armed with guns and grenades. Mr Mockett's widow, Cynthia, 66, told the inquest that part of her husband's work was assessing insurance claims submitted by owners and agents. 'The last job David did before his death was to survey a ship called the Brillante Virtuoso, an oil tanker which had allegedly been attacked by Somalian pirates,' she said in a written statement. 'The ship was anchored about 20 miles off the Yemen coast to the south of Aden. 'In an email David sent to the agent of the ship, which he sent a copy to me with photographs, David states he could not find evidence of bullet holes or from explosions from grenades. 'After David's death I had a conversation with a friend of David's and mine, John Murphy, who informed me that he believed that David had been killed because of his involvement in investigating the Brillante Virtuoso. 'John told me that he believed there had been two other ships with the same captain that had been in the Brillante Virtuoso and that these two ships had been allegedly attacked by Somalian pirates and the salvage company involved was the same for all three ships, which is unusual.' The Gulf of Aden is one of the busiest maritime corridors in the world and handles around 20% of world trade. Blast: Mr Mockett was killed by a TNT bomb which was planted under this car in Yemen last year . Mrs Mockett, who lives in Plympton, Plymouth, said her husband of 44 years felt safe in Yemen even though he was working in a very dangerous country. 'While living in Yemen David never checked under his vehicle as he did not feel threatened even though he had been the victim of a shooting incident in 2001,' she said. The inquest was told that Mr Mockett, who was born in Kent but grew up overseas and in Plymouth, died on July 20 last year in the TNT-packed car bomb, which had been placed under his car. After leaving school at 16 he had joined the Merchant Navy but left after 15 years' service having risen to the rank of captain. Mr Mockett then worked in the Middle East in shipping and when he died he was employed by Arabian Marine Surveyors Ltd. The inquest heard that Mr Mockett's Lexus car exploded a few minutes after he had left his hotel in Aden. He died almost instantly from blast injuries and was later formally identified by dental records. Detective Superintendent Jonathan Tottman, a member of the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist department based at New Scotland Yard, investigated Mr Mockett's death because he was on attachment to Oman and Yemen. Mr Tottman said the Yemeni authorities had investigated Mr Mockett's death very thoroughly and they believed criminals were responsible, rather than terrorists. Mr Mockett's inquest heard that noone in Yemen has been brought to justice for his death . 'In countries where there is no government, terrorists, as well as criminal gangs, fill the void,' the officer said. 'I think it is fair to say they felt this was a criminally motivated act. Mr Tottman said that he supported Mrs Mockett's view that gangs involved in shipping insurance scams were responsible. 'It seems like this was a scam where a lot of money was being made in what we call 'insurance jobs',' he said. 'I suspect this was the motivation. 'David, being a man of great integrity and professionalism, wasn't going to bow to some bully boys tactics.' The inquest heard that no-one in Yemen had been brought to justice for Mr Mockett's death. Ian Arrow, the Coroner for Plymouth and South West Devon, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.","David Mockett died in car bomb explosion in Yemen last year .

The father of a British tourist who died after falling down three flights of stairs while drunk has hit out at cheap alcohol deals. Adam Atkinson, 20, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, was killed in the accident at the HM Martinique hotel in Magaluf, Majorca, in April. His father Alan Atkinson has called for tougher laws governing the selling of cheap alcohol in tourist resorts popular with young people. Since Adam's death, four more Britons have fallen from a hotel ledge or balcony in Magaluf. Two of the falls were fatal. Mr Atkinson told New! magazine: 'There have been four accidents like Adam's in Magaluf since. These kids aren't looking for trouble. They are naive youngsters living . life to the full and taking advantage of cheap alcohol deals. 'There should be tighter laws on . cheap deals and binge drinking.

The Indonesian militant accused of helping to build a massive car bomb used in the deadly 2002 Bali nightclub attacks has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Known as 'Demolition Man', Umar Patek is a leading member of the Al Qaeda-linked network Jemaah Islamiyah. He was found guilty by the West Jakarta District Court of violating the country's harsh anti-terror law. In today's ruling, the five-member judge panel also convicted 45-year-old Patek for his role in Jakarta church attacks on Christmas Eve in 2000. Those blasts killed a total of 19 people. Patek is the last main suspect in the October 12, 2002 Bali resort island attacks that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians and seven Americans. Patek can appeal against the ruling to a higher court. Last month Patek, given his nickname after the explosions, said sorry to the victims and their families before adding that he felt 'guilty' about the bombings. He had denied playing a major role in assembling the massive car bomb that, on Saturday, October 12, 2002, went off outside two nightclubs packed with foreign tourists on the busiest night of the week. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: Three masterminds in the Bali bombing . attack already have been tried and executed, and authorities have made . big strides in dismantling their regional terror group, Jemaah Islamiyah . But he still said: 'I still feel guilty. From the bottom of my heart, I apologise to the victims and their families. I knew about the plan. I helped mix some of the chemicals use in the explosives.' A suicide bomber inside one of the clubs had blown himself up, killing many people and forcing others to run outside where the vehicle loaded with the bomb was parked. Another suicide bomber then blew that up in an attack which eventually killed 88 Australian victims and seven Americans. After the bombings, Indonesia was thrust onto the front lines in the battle against terrorism. Plea: An emotional speech by Patek at a previous hearing saw him apologise to the bombing's victims . There have been several attacks targeting Western hotels, restaurants and an embassy since then. But all have been far less deadly, thanks in part, security experts say, to a relentless crackdown on Jemaah Islamiyah that has largely decimated their ranks. Patek, who was arrested in Pakistan just over a year ago, told the court the Bali bombings were in theory meant to avenge Western policies in the Palestinian territories. 'From my point of view, it was total failure,' the suspect earlier said, adding he saw 'no connection' between the original mission, fighting against the oppression of fellow Muslims, and the target, partying tourists. 'Yes, most of the victims were white, but there were no Israelis,' he said. 'Some were even Indonesian. That's a failure.' Planned: Patek left Bali a few days before the . devastating October 12 attacks were carried out . Patek had faced a maximum penalty of death by firing squad. He insists he did not play a major role in assembling the massive car bomb - saying that job fell to Jemaah Islamiyah bomb-making masterminds, Azahari bin Husin and Dulmatin, both of whom have since been killed in police raids. 'I only played a small role,' he said, acknowledging that he helped mix less than 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of nearly a ton of the chemicals used in the explosives. Patek escaped the country after the attack and went on a nine-year flight from justice that took him to the Philippines and Pakistan, allegedly in pursuit of more terror opportunities. Patek was captured in January 2011 in Abbottabad, where U.S. Navy Seals would kill Osama bin Laden just a few months later. Patek was then one of Asia's most wanted terror suspects, with a $1 million bounty on his head.

Seven times more British citizens have been sent to the US under the lopsided Extradition Act than there have been Americans sent in the opposite direction. Home Office figures reveal how the treaty at the centre of the case against Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon is being used by the US authorities far more often than their British counterparts. Since 2004, 99 people have been extradited from the UK to the US. Yet only 44 have been extradited to the UK. When the figures are broken down by nationality, the picture is even more stark. Some 35 British nationals have been extradited from the UK to the US. But as few as five US citizens have been extradited from the US to the UK. Britain has extradited more of its nationals to the United States in the past six months – seven – than the United States has sent the other way in the past five years, according to data unearthed by the Tory MP Dominic Raab. This is despite the fact the population of the US (311million) is five times greater than that of the UK (62million). The figures will heighten calls for changes to the Act, which was passed by Labour in 2003 and is currently under review by the Home Secretary. Critics say it is biased against UK nationals. Britain must provide US authorities with ‘such information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offence for which extradition is requested’. This is known as the ‘probable cause’ test and means US citizens have the right to a court hearing to examine the evidence against them. However, if the US wants to extradite a UK citizen, the authorities need only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect. Tory MP Dominic Raab unearthed the alarming figures . The most high-profile victim of the Act is Mr McKinnon,  who faces being hauled to the US for crimes committed from his North London bedroom.He hacked into NASA and Pentagon computers while looking for evidence of ‘little green men’ Medical experts say he is likely to take his own life if extradited. As well as his, there have been a string of other controversial extradition cases. They include Chris Tappin, a retired golf club president from Kent who was extradited to the US in February over allegations of arms dealing. Student Richard O’Dwyer, of Chesterfield, is also fighting extradition on copyright infringement charges over a website he ran from the UK. Last night Mr Raab, who has campaigned for changes to the extradition rules, said: ‘In 2012, we are surrendering our citizens to the US at the fastest rate since the new treaty came into effect, despite woefully inadequate safeguards. Overall, we have extradited seven UK nationals for every American extradited to Britain. If we don’t reform our blunt extradition regime, we will see more appalling cases.’ Campaigners are also demanding changes to the controversial European Arrest Warrant (EAW), which allows people to be sent to other EU countries over even minor charges. As with the Extradition Act, the country demanding a British or EU citizen does not have to make a substantial case against them. The number of EAWs issued to the UK has risen from 1,865 in 2004 to 5,832 in the year ending March 2012. Britain is extraditing 11 times more people than are being sent to the UK by our EU neighbours. The number of British citizens surrendered under an EAW has risen from five in 2004 to 32 in 2011/12. Mr Raab said: ‘Britain now extradites six times more of our nationals under the European Arrest Warrant than the US treaty. Too many face corrupt police, incompetent courts and appalling prison conditions. ‘The case for reform or withdrawal from this flawed measure is overwhelming.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have effective, fair and balanced extradition arrangements with the US and other international partners. ‘People who have committed serious offences such as murder, rape, other sex crimes and fraud, have been successfully extradited to the UK and convicted.’","Tory MP Dominic Raab unearths damning figures .

Scroll down for video . Tragic: Just six after Japan celebrated the birth of its first panda bear in 24 years the newborn cub has been found dead . Heartbroken: It was the first time the zoo's natural breeding programme had been successful, and heartwarming photos of proud mother Shin Shin cuddling her new baby had been shown around the world . The baby had been kept in an incubator earlier this week, but had been returned to its mother on Tuesday. Keepers tried to massaged the panda's heart after it was found at the zoo, but the cub was declared dead an hour later. Experts say pandas often struggle to conceive naturally, particularly when they are on public display. The birth was captured on night . vision webcam and a video showing Shin Shin giving birth and holding the . tiny baby to her chest was released by the zoo. The cub was the first panda to be born after being conceived naturally in Japanese history. The task is extremely difficult task as female pandas are only in heat for 72 hours over the entire year and can only become pregnant during a 24 hour slot. In the wild female pandas normally have a cub every two or three years. Love and care: Shin Shin cuddles her newly born baby holding the cub close to her chest . The unnamed cub was too young to have gained the characteristic black . marks and its size is not living up to the name of Giant Panda . The baby panda was still unnamed when it died, but suggestions for names had caused a stir even before it was born. Shin Shin's pregnancy was only announced by Japanese governor Shintaro Ishihara last month. He said the bear would be called Sen Sen or Kaku Kaku – a wordplay on the disputed Senkaku Islands which are part of Japan but are claimed by both Taiwan and China. The giant panda is threatened by loss of habitat, poaching and a low reproduction rate. Females in the wild normally have a cub once every two to three years. Only about 1,600 pandas live in the wild, mostly in China's southwestern Sichuan province. Around 300 live in captivity mostly in Chinese breeding centres and zoos but also in foreign zoos around the world. China’s policy on panda export is very strict in order to protect their national symbol. A panda is never sold to a foreign country, but is instead on loan for a yearly fee of up to £650,000. There is also a clause that any cubs born during the loan belong to the People's Republic of China and have to be returned within two years. He got a quick response from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei regarding the islands, known to the Chinese as the Diaoyu. Speaking at a press conference in the capital the spokesman said: ‘Ishihara’s scheme to undermine China-Japan relations is a clumsy performance. It will only tarnish the image of Japan and Tokyo,’ ‘No matter what names the Japanese side gives, it cannot change the fact that the two pandas belong to China. ‘Likewise, what names Japan gives to the Diaoyu Island and the adjacent isles, it cannot change the fact that these islands belong to China.’ The zoo's panda team, comprised of five . workers and four veterinarians, will continue using two cameras to . observe the pair 24 hours a day for about a week, and have been joined . by a breeding expert from Sichuan, China, where Shin Shin grew up. Visitors to the zoo eager to see the . baby will be disappointed as Ueno Zoo, which is the oldest in Japan, has . expressed wishes to keep the cub and mother away from the public for . another six months. Shin Shin and her mate, Ri Ri, are on loan from China for 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement between Japan and China, the cub will be sent back in two years.

Two callous thieves who snatched floral wreaths from a crematorium so they could use them for free at a family funeral have been fined £35 each. Police caught Richard Boyd, 55, and 41-year old Alan Mayor with seven tributes - left just hours earlier by grieving families - hidden in their car following a tip-off. When an officer asked them what they were doing, Boyd said: ‘I was just moving the wreaths - I didn’t think I had done anything wrong.’ Alan Mayor, left, and Richard Boyd, pictured in the wheelchair leaving Burnley magistrates court, admitted theft by finding and were fined £35 each . Mayor then butted in sarcastically saying to his partner: ‘Another one of your plans? Thanks!’ The pair claimed they had ordered flowers for the funeral of Mayor’s father the following day, but instead decided to steal the wreaths from Burnley Crematorium in Burnley, Lancashire, on June 17, after turning up late for the florists and finding it shut. Boyd, who was brought to and from court . in a wheelchair and Mayor, formerly of Burnley, but now living in . Blackburn, admitted theft by finding. They were each fined £35, with a £15 victim surcharge and Boyd was ordered to pay £50 costs at Burnley Magistrates Court. Sentencing, chairman of the bench, Irene Divine told the couple the case was aggravated by the number of wreaths taken. She said it seemed ’rather odd’ several were taken if they were going to use them elsewhere. Mrs Divine added: ‘I find it quite offensive that you felt that you could go in a crematorium and remove flowers that had been left there for people who had been cremated that day. ‘I wonder how either of you would have felt if the reverse had happened and somebody had done that at the funeral in Lancaster. ‘Your actions could potentially have caused distress to mourners. Whether the wreaths are on a grave or not, to me, is irrelevant.’ The court heard the pair stole the wreaths from Burnley Crematorium, pictured, after arriving late at the florist where they had ordered flowers for Mayor's father's funeral . Andrew Robinson, prosecuting told the court the wreaths had been left outside the crematorium after funeral services held that day. The wreaths were all returned to the place where they had been left. Mr Robinson added the value of the flowers was not known, but added: ‘I know funeral wreaths can be very expensive.’ Defending lawyer Graeme Parkinson said the flowers were not placed on a grave and would have ‘withered away’. He said they had all been recovered and put back, adding: ‘As a consequence of that, has anybody actually been upset and distressed by the offence? Probably not. There was potential for causing some distress.’ After being caught driving out of Burnley Crematorium, pictured, Boyd told a police officer: 'I was just moving the wreaths - I didn't think I had done anything wrong.' Mayor’s father had died, there was a funeral the day after in Lancaster and the two of them had ordered flowers which they were due to pick up that evening. They had got stuck in traffic and missed the closing time at the florist. Mr Parkinson said they came up with the ‘brainless’ idea to take the wreaths. They accepted it was stupid. The solicitor continued: ‘Mr Mayor obviously wasn’t thinking straight because of the death of his father and Mr Boyd went along with it, but between the two of them, they should have thought better. ‘Alan Mayor, per se, is not dishonest. Maybe he wasn’t thinking straight, maybe he went along with a harebrained plan.’ Mr Parkinson said Boyd was in very poor health and had signed himself out of hospital against medical advice to attend court. The solicitor continued: ‘They do both apologise. They do both appreciate the seriousness of this offence and they wish to apologise profusely for their actions on that day.’","Richard Boyd, 55, Alan Mayor, 41, took tributes hours after they had been left by grieving families .

The Romney campaign has accused Barack Obama of being a serial liar and the President’s aides hit back by suggesting the Republican candidate might have committed a felony as the 2012 election reached new heights of rancour. After weeks of Republicans urging Mr Romney to hit back hard at attacks on his record at Bain Capital, his campaign released a new television ad entitled ‘No Evidence’ accusing Mr Obama of deceit in claiming that the former Massachusetts governor shipped jobs overseas while heading the venture capital firm. The ad, which will run in several battleground states, asks voters: ‘When a president doesn't tell the truth, how can we trust him to lead?’ The press release which accompanied the ad in an email to journalists also referred to Mr Obama's ‘lies and exaggerations’. Under fire: Mitt Romney has been accused by the Obama campaign of committing a felony by lying in regulatory documents about his employment at Bain Capital . But Mr Romney found himself on the defensive over a Boston Globe article citing federal documents filed by Bain Capital that conflicted with the presumptive Republican nominee’s statements about when he left Bain Capital. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Mr Romney as the company's ‘sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president’. It said Mr Romney's ‘principal occupation’ was as Bain's managing director. Mr Romney's campaign, backed up by a number of independent fact checkers, has repeatedly said Mr Romney had almost nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the imperilled 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Andrea Saul, Mr Romney’s spokeswoman, said that her boss ‘left Bain Capital in February of 1999 to run the Olympics, and had no input on investments or management of companies after that point’. Accusation: The Romney campaign has suggested that President Obama is lying about Bain in campaign ads . The significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when Bain oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It's also when Mr Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital. For example, in late 1999, Bain-controlled Steam International set up overseas call centres, and a subsidiary moved jobs from California to Mexico. The following year, the Ampad company declared bankruptcy. In 2001, the steel maker GS Industries also fell to bankruptcy as Bain made $58.4million from its investment. Republicans fear that the relentless attacks on Mr Romney, who is worth more than $250million, over his time at Bain Capital, his failure to release tax returns, his investments in Swiss bank accounts, Bermuda and the Caymans are defining him as an out-of-touch plutocrat. The two presidential campaigns dispute how many American jobs were affected but the Romney campaign's line all along has been that it is irrelevant because Mr Romney wasn't involved in the company’s decisions for that period. Stephanie Cutter, Mr Obama's deputy campaign manager, said that Mr Romney may have committed a felony if he misrepresented his role at Bain on the SEC documents. And if he was running Bain after 1999, Ms Cutter said, Mr Romney hasn't been truthful with the public. ‘If that's the case, if he was lying to the American people, then that's a real character and trust issue,’ she said. Matt Rhoades, Mr Romney’s campaign manager, issued a blistering statement in response. ‘President Obama's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about Mitt Romney that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign,’ he said. ‘President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behaviour of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.’","President has hit out at Romney's record as boss of Bain Capital .

A mother-of-three was shamed into losing more than 15 stone after she wasn't able to take a dream hot air balloon flight because she was too heavy. Jane Qualtrough was mortified when she couldn't take the trip while on holiday in Australia with her daughters three years ago because her 27-and-a-half-stone weight meant the balloon would be unable to take off. Her size was further brought home to her when she saw a holiday snap from the occasion which made her look bigger than one of the massive inflatable balloons. Grounded: Jane, left, was mortified when she saw this picture where she looks bigger than a hot air balloon which she was too heavy to ride on . 'It was humiliating. There's a photo of me at that time with the balloon in the background. I was Hot Air Balloon Mum,' she said. The experience prompted Jane, 48, to overhaul her lifestyle and she became determined to lose weight and regain her life. 'I took a long hard look at myself and couldn't believe how far I'd slipped. Instead of eating burgers I switched to salads and joined a gym,' she explained. Transformed: Jane is now 12 stone and dress size 14, left, after taking up exercise and eating healthily. She previously weighed 27st 7lb and was a dress size 36 . Jane's weigh rose to 27st 7lb and a dress size 36 after she split with the father of her three children, Joshua, 23, Jasmine, 20, and Maxine, 18, in 1995. Her weight had a huge impact on her confidence and made her feel unsexy and 'ready for death'. 'I was such a big fat blob having sex was the last thing on my mind,' she said. 'I was having a destructive love affair with food and used to gorge on biscuits and ice-cream in front of the TV. I hated myself and was ready for death. Wake-up call: It was holiday snaps like this one from her trip to Australia which made Jane realise how big she had become . 'My clothes all came from Premier Man because I couldn't find nice things in my size. I didn't care what I looked like anymore. I had stopped looking in the mirror or wearing make-up.' On a typical day, the nurse from Port Erin on the Isle of Man would eat six pieces of . buttery toast or a big fry up for breakfast; two portions of bolognese for lunch and a massive takeaway curry for dinner. But thanks to eating more healthily and taking up exercise, she lost an incredible 15 stone in 14 months. Her trimmer figure also gave her more confidence, leading her to meet the man of her dreams - and have sex for the first time in 12 years. New love: The nurse piled on the pounds after splitting from the father of her children but after losing 15 stone has found happiness with boyfriend Barry, right . Now a slim 12 stone and a size 14, Jane says she has an amazing sex life with new man Barry Uran, 45, who she met last August. 'I have a fabulous man now and I have never been happier,' she said. 'I can't keep my hands off him and he tells me I'm gorgeous all the time. Barry has even said to me, ""give me a break, I'm worn out"", but I can't help it, he's so lovely.

"By . Anthony Bond . UPDATED: . 09:48 EST, 9 November 2011 . A German poker professional who was thinking of quitting the game to return to college has won an incredible $8.72 million in the World Series final. Pius Heinz, 22, beat Martin Staszko of the Czech Republic to take victory in the World Series of Poker. It is believed that Heinz, who had a rough six-month run in poker before the series, was thinking about quitting the professional circuit. Show me the money: Pius Heinz celebrates claiming the $8.7 million after winning the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas . Celebrations begin: Pius Heinz is mobbed by his delighted supporters following his tense victory . But thankfully for him he decided against such a move and won the game's biggest tournament - along with the huge amount of money. The tournament used the Texas hold 'em format in which all players 'share' five 'community' cards and two cards of their own. Heinz held an ace and a king, while his opponent held a seven and a ten, with the community cards helping neither player. According to The Washington Post, Heinz said after his victory: 'Honestly I’m not sure what I’m going to do with the money. 'Probably my family is going to get a couple of gifts.' High stakes: The tension shows on Heinz's face as he competes for the cash . So close: Czech Republic's Martin Staszko was the unlucky loser on the night . Tense: Pius Heinz, left, and the Czech Republic's Martin Staszko during their final match . He added: 'It’s got to be the happiest day of my life. I can’t believe what happened - it’s unreal.' For the first time ever the final was . aired almost live on TV with just a 15-minute delay to ensure that . players couldn't cheat. And viewers were treated to a tense game which resulted in a number of changes in the lead. Heinz, from Cologne, Germany, and . Staszko, 35, of Trinec, were each guaranteed a payday of at least $5.43 . million for finishing second. Heinz . led at the start with just over half the chips in play, but Staszko . quickly took that lead away as the players began trading chips. Texas Hold 'em is a variation of the standard card game of poker. The game consists of two cards being dealt face down to each player and then five community cards being placed face-up by the dealer - the first three are dealt then two additional single cards. Bets can be placed before any of the community cards are dealt, after the first three, and then after each of the other two. Players have the option to check, bet, raise or fold after each deal. The no-limit betting structure allows each player to raise the bet by any amount up to and including his entire remaining stake at any time. Each player must lose all his chips to be eliminated from the no-limit Texas Hold `em tournament, and win all the chips in play to take the crown. Pius Heinz wagered the last of his chips against Martin Staszko with his two cardas being an ace and a king. This was a brave move as it is one of the trickiest hands to play in tournaments. Staszko held a seven and ten of clubs.The board was a five of clubs, deuce of diamonds, nine of spades, jack of hearts and four of diamonds, helping neither player. There were eight lead changes over . the first three hours of play, the eighth coming just after a break when . Staszko responded to a 20 million chip bet from Heinz by announcing a . re-raise. Heinz immediately folded. Staszko at one point had a 2-1 chip advantage, but that was gone within minutes. Staszko regained the lead before a break in play, and had about 60 per cent of all the chips in play after five hours, excluding breaks. Each player must lose all his chips to be eliminated from the no-limit Texas Hold `em tournament, and win all the chips in play to take the crown. Heinz aggressively stormed from seventh in chips to first at the nine-hand final table on Sunday. He went from 16.4 million in chips to 107.8 million in just more than 7 1/2 hours of play, propelling him to a higher finish than at least six of his competitors. Las Vegas poker professional Ben Lamb collected a cool $4 million for finishing in third place. The 26-year-old was defeated by Staszko on Tuesday night. 'I got the sense he wasn't like super strong, but he actually was stronger than I thought he was,' Lamb said. 'Every poker player dreams of having the year I had, so I don't want to sit here and have people like cry for me,"" he said. ""I'll be OK."" Glitzy: The final was played out at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas . Staszko congratulates Heinz on his World Poker Series win .

Murder convict John Massey, who escaped from Pentonville Prison on Wednesday, was arrested today in Faversham, Kent . A convicted murderer who was on the run for 48 hours has been arrested in a house near his dying mother's care home. John Massey, 64, accomplished his most . dramatic break-out two days ago using a makeshift rope to scale the walls of the . Victorian-built jail Pentonville prison in north London on Wednesday evening. But after two days in hiding, Scotland Yard said Massey was arrested in Faversham, Kent on Friday not far from his 86-year-old mother May's care home. Neighbours reported several police vehicles and armed police officers surrounding the Victorian two-bedroom cottage around 5pm on Friday afternoon. After a quick swoop two men were brought out of the house and taken away in the cars. One of them said: ‘I realised there were several armed police officers in my back garden and I could see them in other gardens as well. ‘They must have thought Massey would try to escape out the back of the house. There were also two officers with guns in an alleyway around the side of the house. ‘I don't think they put up a struggle because it was all over quickly.’ Local sources said Messenger, known as Harry, has served time in prison for smuggling offences. One source said: ‘Harry's friends are shocked to hear about this because . they thought he was looking to lead a more settled life now he's . getting on a bit. Lifer: Massey (above) was jailed in 1976 for murdering a bouncer outside an Essex club after a drunken row . Another neighbour, a woman who did . not want to be named, added: ‘I saw a big black four-wheel drive vehicle . outside and five men wearing plain clothes jumped out of it and went . inside the house. ‘Then I saw one man being escorted out of the house and put in the car.’ An occupant of that house - said to be . a 70-year-old man named Henry Messenger - was arrested on suspicion of . aiding and abetting Massey's escape. Daring: Massey climbed over a wall at Pentonville Prison using a makeshift rope . Pentonville Prison has held some notorious inmates down the years. The jail houses Category B and C prisoners - and not the most serious Category A cases. Oscar Wilde spent time inside Pentonville before being transferred to Wandsworth in the late 19th century. More recently, Pete Doherty (below) spent six weeks inside for possessing cocaine last year, while Boy George and George Michael have also been held there. In 2008, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse's then husband, was jailed at Pentonville for causing grievous bodily harm. The prison, in Islington, north London, holds up to 1,250 inmates and has been used since 1842. Convicted arsonist Julien Chautard escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of the security van he arrived in three years ago. Both of Massey’s previous escapes were . to see ailing family members . Friends of his family said he had . learned only a few days ago that May, who has Alzheimer’s . disease, had been calling out his name at a care home in Kent. A friend of his mother . said: ‘May is getting very old now, she is in her eighties, and she has a . touch of Alzheimer’s. She has been crying lately and asking for John.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'John . Massey has this afternoon, Friday June 29, been arrested by detectives . from the Metropolitan Police Service specialist crime and operations . command. 'He has been taken into custody at a north London police station.' Massey was found following an intelligence-led operation, the spokesman said. A second male was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting an absconder and was also taken into police custody. The Prison Service is investigating how Massey managed to elude staff. Massey was sentenced to life in 1976 . for shooting bouncer Charlie Higgins, 36, with a sawn-off shotgun after . being thrown out of an East London pub for fighting. He was also . convicted of attempting to shoot a policeman dead after being chased in . his Aston Martin getaway car. An Old Bailey judge jailed the . carpenter for a minimum of 20 years but he has become one of the . country’s longest serving prisoners because of his repeated escapes. The escape on Wednesday is a huge . embarrassment for the authorities, not least because it is the third . time Massey has slipped from their grasp. Massey is suspected of hiding in the . roof of the gym building as other inmates returned to their cells on . Wednesday afternoon. He then used a makeshift rope – . believed to have been strung together out of sheets – and a pair of . heavy duty gloves to scale the high  prison wall. Guards monitoring CCTV cameras saw the . rope and raced to the perimeter wall at about 6.30pm but were too late. They suspect he was assisted by someone outside. A source said: ‘The guy went to the gym and then hid in the roof and just waited and then escaped from there.’ Prison staff have been banned from . speaking about the escape, but one added: ‘He’s done this before, he’ll . be back.’ Massey’s first escape was in 1994 during a home visit when he . calmly walked out of a social club while his guards played pool and . drank. He fled to the Costa Del Sol and spent three years on the run before being caught and returned to Britain. In 2007 he was released on parole but . was told he must live in South London and could not stay with his . family. But he broke the conditions by travelling to stay with his . father, Jack, 82, who was dying at the Royal Free Hospital, in North . London. Afterwards, Massey said: ‘My dad had . travelled the length and breadth of this country a thousand times in 30 . years in order to visit me in various god-forsaken and dingy prisons. ‘I could not fail him or my mother. To do so would have buckled my shoulders with guilt of unspeakable things to come.’ Two years ago he absconded from Ford . open prison in West Sussex after being refused permission to visit his . terminally ill sister Carol, who was in the same hospital where his . father died. She died two weeks later but rather than hand himself in Massey went to live with his mother and was not caught for ten months. Last night, the sister of Massey’s victim said she was disgusted at his escape. Mother-of-three Carol Spooner, 64, of . Braintree, Essex, said: ‘I was stunned to hear it was the third time he . had escaped. It is disgraceful. ‘As far as I am concerned, a life . sentence should mean just that. 'He should die behind bars. ‘I was very . close to my brother and went to each day at court during the trial. I . can still remember the jeers of his family, saying “At least ours is . still alive”.’ A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This continues to be the subject of a thorough ongoing investigation and Mr Massey will be returned to prison custody as soon as possible. 'We always press for the heaviest penalties for those who escape or attempt to escape.' Pentonville houses up to 1,250 category B male prisoners, rather than . the most serious category A offenders. Police last night carried out door-to-door enquiries in an attempt to find out where he had gone. Pentonville was described by prison inspectors as one of Britain's most . challenging jails to run last year, but the inspection also found 'no . obvious problems with physical security'. In 2009 a convicted arsonist escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of a security van. Julien . Chautard was sentenced to seven years in jail at Snaresbrook Crown . Court in February 2009, but spent just minutes inside Pentonville before . slipping out underneath the van he had arrived in.

Mexican soldiers have arrested the leader of a drug cartel for the massacre of 49 people whose corpses were decapitated, dismembered and dumped on a highway last week.Leader of the Zetas drug cartel Daniel Elizondo, also known as 'El Loco' or 'The Madman,' was detained in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, an army spokesman confirmed yesterday.Alleged perpetrator Elizondo headed the Zetas trafficking operations in the town of Cadereyta, close to where the bodies were dumped. Forensic experts lift one of the 49 mutilated bodies fount dumped on a highway in Cadereyta, Monterrey, Northern Mexico, last week, none of which has yet been identified . The massacre is one of the worst atrocities committed in Mexico's drug war, which has raged since President Felipe Calderon took power in 2006 and launched a national offensive against the cartels.Police found the corpses on the highway about 18 miles east of the city of Monterrey, Mexico on May 13. As the bodies lacked heads, hands and feet, police said they could only identify them using DNA, yet a week later none of the victims have been identified, investigators said.Police said they have found no signs of recent mass disappearances in the region and the victims could be migrants from Central or South America passing through Mexico on the way to the United States.Drug cartels often kidnap foreign migrants for ransom, killing those who do not pay. Forensic experts had to be guarded by police and army members as they investigated the crime scene last week. The drugs war has been ongoing since 2006 when president Felipe Calderon launched an offensive against the cartels . Graffiti sprayed at the scene of the corpses showed the mark of the Zetas, who are fighting for control of the region.A video that allegedly shows the men dumping the bodies was also posted on the internet. In the film, men can be seen pulling a large pile of corpses from a truck onto the road during the night. They are then seen leaving a message on a blanket that threatens security forces and the rival Gulf and Sinaloa cartels of traffickers. Federal agents take photographs of a sprayed ""Z"", the symbol of Zetas drug cartel, on a pillar at a crime scene . Signed by the Zeta leaders the message was clear: 'Gulf cartel, Sinaloa cartel, marines and soldiers, nobody can do anything against us or they will lose.'However, in the following days, messages were put up in several Mexican states claiming the Zetas were not behind the massacre - an unusual measure as the gang openly claims to be behind many mass killings.The Zetas were founded by former soldiers who defected from the Mexican military in 1998 to work as hired killers for drug traffickers. They have since carved out their own smuggling empire, expanded massively across Mexico and diversified into kidnapping, extortion and theft of crude oil.In recent weeks, violence between the Zetas and their rivals has intensified in several parts of Mexico.Among the worst incidents, 18 people were decapitated near the city of Guadalajara and nine victims were hanged from a bridge in the city of Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas.In total, around 55,000 people have died in drug related violence and more than 5,000 have disappeared in Mexico since Calderon took office in December 2006. The victims included six women, and police have confirmed that some of the bodies were found in bags and others uncovered .","Daniel 'El Loco' Elizondo arrested .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 20 November 2011 . The former husband of Natalie Wood has admitted he blamed himself for the actress's death for years after she drowned off the California coast. In his autobiography, Robert Wagner recounted the final time he saw his wife – and how he felt he felt guilty he did nothing to save her. 'Yes, I blamed myself,' the actor wrote in his 2009 book, Pieces of My Heart. 'If I'd been there, I could have done something. I wasn't, but ultimately, a man is responsible for his loved one. Scroll down for video . Together: Ms Wood and her husband Robert Wagner embrace on their yacht Splendour two weeks before the tragedy. The couple married twice. First in 1957 before divorcing six years later and then again in 1972 . 'I would have done anything in the world to protect her. Anything. I lost a woman I loved with all my heart and I will never completely come to terms with that.' Los Angeles police last week said ‘substantial new evidence’ led them to re-open their investigation into her death 30 years ago . Wagner – who was on his yacht Splendour with his wife and her alleged lover, Oscar-winner Christopher Walken, on the fateful night – has always maintained Wood, 43, accidentally slipped and drowned as she drunkenly tried to tie up a dinghy against the boat. But retired stockbroker Marilyn Wayne said she heard the star’s ‘last desperate cries for help’ - and claimed police had previously refused to listen to her evidence. Natalie Wood and husband Robert Wagner (left) on their boat Splendour, with captain Dennis Davern (right), just weeks before she died. Family members have explained how fearful Wood was of the water . The boat’s skipper, Dennis Davern, also . claimed he was ‘coerced’ by Wagner’s lawyer into saying the death was . accidental. He claims that, in fact, Wagner had not allowed them to . search for his wife. A police source described Wagner as ‘a person of interest’ in the case. But the lead detective at the heart of the original investigation has said he never suspected Wagner. Duane Rasure, a retired detective sergeant for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau, said the actress was small, so it was believable that she drowned quickly. ‘It was an accidental drowning, she just happened to be a famous movie star. She was a small lady. She drowned in short time, I'd say,’ Rasure told 48 Hours for the program Vanity Fair: Hollywood Scandal. He also accused Mr Davern, the boat’s skipper, of cashing in from his part in the death. R Davern has said he blames Wagner for his wife’s death. Mystery: Natalie drowned after a row while drinking with Robert Wagner and co-star Christopher Walken . ‘Obviously he was trying to sell a . book and make money off of it. And I think that's the whole purpose . behind his-- his writing this book,’ Rasure said. ‘If . I have ever the slightest inkling there was a murder, something . suspicious, I would have worked it,’ Rasure says. ‘I did not cover for . anybody and I wouldn't cover for anybody. I don't care about their . celebrity status. They were people.’ In his autobiography, Wagner retraces his steps before his wife’s death off the coast of California thirty years ago. He explains how he had been on his boat, the Splendour, with Natalie – who he had married twice – and Walken when an argument broke out. 'Accidental': Duane Rasure, the Los Angeles detective at the heart of the original case, said he believed Wagner's account. Rasure added that the actress was small, so it was believable she drowned quickly . Conflict: But the yacht's former captain Dennis Davern has blamed Robert Wagner for Natalie Woods' death. He said Wagner did not let them do anything to find her . Wagner wrote: ‘Chris [Walken] began . talking about his 'total pursuit of a career', which he admitted was . more important to him than his personal life. He clearly thought Natalie . should live like that, too. ‘I got angry. 'Why don't you stay out of her career?' I said. 'She's got enough people telling her what to do without you.' As the argument escalated, Natalie left for bed. ‘The last time I saw my wife she was fixing her hair in the bathroom while I was arguing with Chris,’ he said. ‘I saw her shut the door. She was going to bed.’ He described how he and Walken moved up to the deck as ‘things were threatening to get physical’ and they were calmed by the fresh sea air. He said he waited up a little longer before going to bed – but his wife was not there. Friends: Wood with her co-star Christopher Walken - who was on the boat the night she died - during filming of her last motion picture Brainstorm. Walken and Wagner had a heated argument hours before the tragedy . He noticed the dinghy had gone, but he . would have heard its motor fire up had she taken it. They called the . coast to see if she had gone there in the dinghy. ‘I . was scared and confused,’ he said. ‘The Coast Guard started the search . and rescue, crisscrossing the ocean surface with helicopters. Hour after . hour - nothing.’ On finding out of her death, ‘my knees gave out; everything went away from me’. He said it was his belief that Natalie, who had drunk seven or eight glasses of wine, had heard the boat’s dinghy banging against the boat and slipped trying to retie it. ‘Others have suggested she was trying to get away from the argument,’ he said. ‘But nobody really knows.’ He also explained in the autobiography how enraged he became when other men showed interest in his wife. Happy: Actress Natalie Wood pictured with her husband Robert Wagner on their first wedding day in 1957. They divorced six years later only to remarry again in 1972 . Funeral: Robert Wagner bends over to kiss the flower-covered casket of his wife during graveside ceremonies for her at Westwood Memorial Park Cemetery in December 1981 . Rasure said he believed this version of events and that Wagner had not purposefully waited to contact help. ‘There was time. They were uncertain,’ he says. ‘They felt that she had gone ashore in a Zodiac, that nothing was wrong. He did call and have the people on the shore search. ‘The only person who really knows is Natalie Wood. Robert Wagner knows. I think he told me the truth.’ But Wood's sister, Lana, who was not on the . boat, told CNN's Piers Morgan she has spoken with Davern many . times and believes her sister did not fall off the boat. 'I don't think she fell, I don't know if she was pushed, I don't know . whether there was an altercation and it happened accidentally but she . shouldn't have died and that does stay with me and hurt,' Lana Wood . said. 'I would prefer to always believe that RJ [Wagner] would never do . anything to hurt Natalie and that he loved her dearly, which he did, and . I don't believe that whatever went on was deliberate. I've always cared . about him. I always will care about him,' she said. Family: Natalie with her husband and two children Natasha, left, and Courtney, pictured in 1976 . Since the investigation re-opened last week, Wagner has remained out of the public eye, holed up in his Hollywood mansion. His publicist released a statement . saying they were leaving the matter in the hands of the LA County . Sheriff's department but appeared to blame Dennis Davern, skipper of the . Splendour, for trying to profiteer from her death. The . statement said: 'We trust they will evaluate whether any new . information relating to the death of Natalie Wood Wagner is valid, and . that it comes from a credible source or sources other than those simply . trying to profit from the 30-year anniversary of her tragic death.'

A judge on Friday revoked the bail of George Zimmerman and ordered him to return to jail within 48 hours after berating the neighbourhood watch captain and his wife for falsely testifying to his court. Safe in a secure location outside Florida since his release on bail in April, Zimmerman will now have to return to jail in the Sunshine State and await his trial for the second-degree murder of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin. This comes as it emerged that Zimmerman had $135,000 available that had been raised by a website he set up to pay for his reduced bond even though Zimmerman's wife, Shellie, testified at the bond hearing in April that they had limited funds available. Revoked: George Zimmerman testifies from the stand during a bond hearing on second degree murder charges at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Florida in this file photo taken April 20, 2012 . Bailed: Neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman (L) leaves the Seminole County Jail in April after posting bail in Sanford, Florida . As he revoked Zimmerman's bail on Friday, the judge said Mr Zimmerman had responsibilities to stop his wife, who testified at one hearing, and . his lawyer from making false statements. 'Mr Zimmerman can't sit back a potted palm and let his wife . testify falsely before the court when he knew well in advance of the . hearing the amounts of money in controversy,' said Judge Kenneth Lester. 'He can't sit back and obtain the . benefit of a lower bond based upon those material falsehoods.' Under Florida's Rules of Criminal Procedure, a judge has discretion to revoke a defendant's bail if he finds there's 'good cause' to do so. Lying to a court about one's finances apparently fits the bill. In arguing for George Zimmerman's bail to be revoked, prosecutors asserted his wife Shelly 'flat-out lied' to get a lower bail. 'This . court was led to believe that [George Zimmerman and his wife] didn't . have a single penny,' one prosecutor argued. But it turns out the . Zimmermans had collected about $200,000 in online donations via a . website -- a fact Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara has acknowledged. Case: Zimmerman, right, shot Martin, left, in February during a confrontation at a gated community of townhouses in Sanford, Florida, where Zimmerman lived and where Martin was visiting his father's fiancee . In . addition, Zimmerman and his wife 'spoke in code to hide what they were . doing' during jail telephone calls, prosecutors alleged. Prosecutors also used phone . conversations recorded between Zimmerman and . his wife Shelly, to show that the pair intentionally deceived the court . by talking in code that designates multiples of thousands to much lower . sums. George Zimmerman asks: 'in my account do I have at least $100? Shelly Zimmerman responds: '$8. $8.60' Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said the fact that Zimmerman and his wife never used the money for anything indicated 'there was no deceit.' Since his release in late April, Zimmerman has been staying at an undisclosed location for his safety. Prosecutor Bernie De la Rionda described the Zimmermans' testimony as 'misleading'. 'This court was led to believe they didn't have a single penny,' said De la Rionda. 'It was misleading and I don't know what words to use other than it was a blatant lie.' The judge said he . would schedule a hearing after Zimmerman is back in custody so the . neighborhood watch leader could explain himself. Killed: Zimmerman is pleading not guilty to second-degree murder and claims self-defense in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . It was also revealed that Zimmerman kept a second passport at his home and he and his wife can be heard to discuss it. 'I have one for you in the safety deposit box,' said Shellie. 'Okay, you hold onto that,' replied Zimmerman. Zimmerman is . pleading not guilty to second-degree murder and claims self-defense. Zimmerman shot Martin in February during a confrontation at a gated . community of townhouses in Sanford, Fla., where Zimmerman lived and . where the 17-year-old Martin was visiting his father's fiancee. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Trayvon Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, said his clients have always said Zimmerman should remain in jail until trial, which O'Mara said he believed wouldn't be until next year. Crump was asked if he thought that if Zimmerman would be willing to lie about his finances that he would be willing to lie about what happen the night Martin was killed. 'We fully expect that the special prosecutor will make George Zimmerman's credibility be front and center in this entire case,' Crump said. 'And whatever dishonesty that comes forth by George Zimmerman that they can prove, you can best believe it will be the issue of this case and rightfully so. Prosecutors also said Zimmerman had failed to surrender a second passport, but the judge dismissed that concern as the equivalent of someone who has lost a driver's license, applies for a new one and then finds the old driver's license. The delay in an arrest for 44 days prompted protests nationwide and led to Sanford's police chief stepping aside so emotions could cool down. Shot dead: In this undated photo provided by the Martin family, Trayvon Martin holds an unidentified baby. Martin was killed by a neighborhood watchman following an altercation in Sanford, Fla. as he walked from a convenience store in February, 2012 . At Friday's court hearing, De la . Rionda and O'Mara also asked a judge to stop the public release of . witness names and statements made by Zimmerman to police officers. Those . documents normally are part of the public record under Florida law. George Zimmerman started a website to raise funds for his legal defence under the URL www.therealgeorgezimmerman.com in April. ‘I have created a Paypal account solely linked on this website as I would like to provide an avenue to thank my supporters personally and ensure that any funds provided are used only for living expenses and legal defence,’ he posted on the website in April . According to prosecutors, he allegedly raised $135,000 but the website was shut down on April 24 so his attorney could regain control of the fundraising drive. The 28-year-old's bond hearing was on April 20, where the amount of money the website had raised was not disclosed. Zimmerman was released from jail on April 23 on a $150,000 bond after paying 10 per cent upfront. Later that week, his lawyer told CNN that the website had raised more than $200,000 in donations. 'What's . occurring, unfortunately, are cases are being tried in the public . sector as opposed to in the courtroom,' De La Rionda said. 'We are in a . new age with Twitter, Facebook, and all these things I've never heard of . before in my career. Everybody gets to find out intimate details about . witnesses that never occurred before. Witnesses are going to be . reluctant to get involved.' A consortium of more than a dozen media groups, including The Associated Press, asked the judge to ignore the request, saying such records are presumed to be publicly available under Florida law. Rachel Fugate, an attorney for the Orlando Sentinel, cited the Casey Anthony trial as an example of a highly publicized case in which a jury was able to be seated despite intense media coverage. The Florida mother was acquitted last year of killing her 2-year-old daughter. 'Discovery in Florida has traditionally been open ... and Florida hasn't encountered problems seating juries and giving defendants fair trials,' Fugate said. O'Mara said Friday on a website that he doesn't expect the case to be ready for trial until next year. O'Mara said he expects to call on 50 witnesses who need to be deposed before he decides whether to file a ""stand your ground"" motion which would ask for a hearing before a judge without a jury. At the hearing, Zimmerman would argue self-defense under the Florida law which gives wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat in a fight if people believe they are in danger of being killed or seriously injured.","Prosecutors claim Zimmerman had $135,000 available that had been raised by a website he set up .

"PUBLISHED: . 04:05 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:42 EST, 22 May 2012 . The types of drugs taken at music festivals often varies depending on the lineup, police figures show. Records of the substances seized at 10 major festivals over the past four years indicate how common drug use is and how, while fans at one event are more likely to be found in possession of cannabis, those at another might prefer cocaine or ecstasy. The data, which comes to light as legions of music fans gear up for the summer festival season, also shows seizures of cannabis and cocaine are falling - with the trend thought to be down to changes in festival-goers' habits, demographics and police tactics. Revellers at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival, Somerset, where almost £45,000 worth of drugs were seized . Use of cocaine, a relatively expensive class-A substance at around £40 a gram, appears to have dropped particularly dramatically as cash-strapped festival crowds look to cheaper drugs such as the horse transquilliser ketamine. According to the figures, compiled and analysed by the Guardian, last year saw officers confiscate drugs with a total street value of more than £100,000, with almost £45,000 of that from Glastonbury alone. Large quantities of cannabis and ecstasy were taken from revellers at the Somerset event, but higher still were the figures for ketamine and the stimulant piperazine. Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis insists there is no drug problem at his festival, where substances worth £200,000 have been seized over four years . Most of last year's cocaine seizures were made at the Isle of Wight festival and, together with Bestival, which also takes places on the island, it accounted for most of the ecstasy confiscated across the 10 festivals. It is thought the differences in the range of drugs brought to such events is linked partly to the acts on stage. Womad (World of Music, Arts and Dance) is a much smaller music festival than the likes of Glastonbury and Bestival and the crowds it draws are typically older and middle-class, with a taste for obscure world music. While headliners at Glastonbury 2011 included bands famed for their lyrics about drug-fuelled excess - Primal Scream or Queens of the Stone Age, for example - last year's Womad fans could be found contemplating Senegalese singer Baaba Maal or flamenco stars Rodrigo Y Gabriela. Cannabis was the only illegal substance seized by police at the Wiltshire festival, with a street value of just £151. Meanwhile, Download in Leicestershire and Sonisphere at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, might have been dominated by heavy metal acts, but it seems relatively few fans were out to emulate the rock star lifestyle. Police at Sonisphere, where 190,000 people flocked to watch Metallica and Slipknot, made a fairly modest haul worth £413. This was made up of cannabis and a small amount of cocaine, while ecstasy and amphetamines - more commonly associated with dance music - were not found. After Glastonbury and the two events on the Isle of Wight, the fourth largest drugs haul was at V festival, held at Hylands Park in Chelmsford and Weston Park in South Staffordshire. The total value of £7,111 was mostly made up of cannabis and ecstasy, but piperazine also featured. Changing habits: Cannabis seizures are falling, as are those of cocaine - but lesser known substances such as ketamine and BZP are on the rise . Three friends at last year's Isle of Wight Festival, where more than £27,000 worth of drugs - mostly cocaine and ecstasy - were seized . The twin festivals at Reading and Leeds saw similar totals of £804 and £797 respectively, though cannabis and methadone were the most common at Reading while at Leeds it was cocaine and mephedrone. Finally, drugs confiscated at Wireless, in London's Hyde Park, were worth a total of £585, including cannabis and unknown Class A tablets. At Glastonbury, where organiser Michael Eavis last year denied there was a drug problem, more than £200,000 worth of drugs has been seized in four years. At £44,869, the value of substances confiscated at the 2011 festival marked a 12 per cent increase on the previous year, though this was still lower than the peak in 2009. The value of piperazine seized, also known as BZP, has seen a tenfold rise over four years, though it is still less than half as common as each of cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine. Ketamine, known as a 'party drug' popular among younger users, also appears to be on the rise and was most commonly found at Glastonbury.","Almost £45,000 worth of drugs confiscated at Glastonbury last year .

High-maintenance trophy wives, physical attractiveness and TOWIE-type party girls are these days being shunned by British men in favour of women personality, wit, brains and sophistication, according to new research. And it seems both the Duchess of Cambridge and the economic downturn are to thank for this shift. Funny girl: British men look for wit, thoughtfulness and brains in women these days, as opposed to more superficial and high-maintenance traits . Thanks . to the former Kate Middleton's elegance, classic style and intelligence, British men . have now decided they are most attracted to smart, dark-haired women . with sophisticated dress sense and a sense of humour. Psychologists also believe that poor economic conditions have led to people becoming less materialistic, seeking partners who can provide happiness and security rather than manicured nails and good cleavage. Nowadays men are least attracted to the . energetic, party-girl types seen on TV programmes such as The Only Way . Is Essex. In fact, 72 per cent of men say they look for a good personality rather than good looks in women, and rather than high-maintenance TOWIE types, most British men would prefer a Kate Middleton type: smart, five six with dark brown hair and just a touch of bronze to the skin. The research also found half of men say they are most attracted to brainy girls with a funny spark and a classic dress sense. Interestingly, the same held true for . the girls, with exactly 50 per cent saying a brainy chap was most . attractive. Eighty-two per cent of women rank a man's personality as more important than his . looks.

I have been through pretty much . everything,' Rutherford said. 'It’s just been crazy.' Rutherford recalled her tearful reunion in France earlier this month with her son, five, and daughter, three, while blasting Giersch's parenting techniques. 'I last saw them ten days ago. My . little girl said ""I want to come home mama, I want to come back to New . York."" My son - who’s kind of been brainwashed that where he is is so much better - but he always says, ""Mama, I love you so much.""' Exhausted: Rutherford wore tired eyes, and said she must keep working to afford legal fees . Tearful reunion: Kelly showered her children with affection as she embraced them at a Nice airport earlier this month . Fears: The actress, 43, said she worries the sudden change in custody will have a drastic negative impact the children . The judge gave custody to Giersch as . it was his opinion that Rutherford had repeatedly tried to cut her . ex-husband out their children's lives. Opening up about what led to the . breakdown of their marriage, Rutherford said today: 'I was pretty . scared about what I was finding out about him, some very strange things . happened... I said let's separate... and he just came at me. 'I don't think he would intentionally . harm the children... but I do think the children are at risk because I . was the primary caregiver and now I am the visitor.' The actress, 43, said she fears the sudden switch will have a drastic negative impact their children. Amicable at first: Kelly Rutherford, with ex-husband Daniel Giersch on July 31, 2010. The former couple split while she was pregnant with their baby girl . 'They're just little babies,' she said. 'He could disappear tomorrow and I’d have no way to look. My biggest fear is that I wouldn’t know where they are.' 'I just want them to be okay. They’re just little babies. They need a chance to have a consistent life.' Rutherford said she is consulting with lawyer Alan Dershowitz to get the children, who are American citizens, back to the U.S. As ABC News reports, Dershowitz was a legal adviser in the Elian Gonzalez custody case. High society role: Rutherford stars as Serena's (Blake Lively) mother Lily van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl . According to the Los Angeles Times, Giersch is required to buy six round-trip coach airline tickets for his ex annually. However, Rutherford, who said she . travels to France as frequently possible, claims she is forced to . maintain a busy work schedule to pay off her legal bills. Giersch previously released a statement through his lawyer, Fahi Takesh Hallin, about the custody battle. Hallin told ABC Giersch is 'focused on . co-parenting the children, and continuing to promote any and all . contact of the children with Kelly.'","Actress, 43, lost residential custody of five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter in family court .

The Chinese police chief who exposed the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood and then tried to defect to the US, has avoided the death penalty in China. The Intermediate Court in the central city of Chengdu did not issue a verdict following the two half-day sessions in which it heard charges that Wang Lijun tried to defect, abused his power, took bribes and ignored the laws. Wang's lawyer declined to comment other than to confirm the trial had concluded. Verdict: Former police chief Wang Lijun facing the court during his trial in Chengdu, in southwest China's Sichuan province . On the bribery charge, prosecutors said Wang had improperly accepted 3.05 million renminbi, which equates to £300,000 ($484,127.) The most explosive charges against . Wang - defection and abuse of power - were heard in a closed-door . hearing. They were connected to his unexpected visit to the U.S. consulate . in Chengdu in February, during which he handed over sensitive information . about Heywood’s grisly death to U.S. consulate officials. His dramatic flight for freedom lead . to the downfall of powerful politician Bo Xilai and the conviction of . Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, who was last month handed a suspended death . sentence for poisoning 41-year-old Heywood over a business dispute. Trial: Chinese police chief Wang Lijun (left), who exposed the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood (right) and then tried to defect to the U.S. Wang later . turned himself in and provided information to investigators that led to a . murder conviction against Heywood's business associate Gu Kailai, the . wife of Chongqing Communist Party chief Bo Xilai. She received a suspended death sentence. The trial summary briefly described . Wang's role in covering up the murder last year, saying that he 'knew . perfectly well' that Gu was under 'serious suspicion' for the crime all . along. On guard: Chinese policemen stand guard outside the Chengdu People's Intermediate court in Chengdu, in southwest China's Sichuan province . It said that . although he helped cover it up, both the prosecutors and defense lawyers . told the court that he later cooperated with authorities. The scandal has thrown the ruling Communist Party’s carefully choreographed once-in-decade power transition into disarray. Wang, 52, is the former mafia-busting cop and right hand man of popular party secretary Bo Xilai. The pair ruled with an iron fist over the western Chinese mega city of Chongqing and enjoyed national fame together. But . their relationship imploded late last year after the death of Heywood . and the erratic behaviour of Bo’s wife Gu, who with the help of her . orderly killed the Briton with a cyanide-laced drink following a . business dispute. Prosecutors in her trial claimed she conferred with Wang before murdering Heywood and reported back to him afterwards. Wang then fled with details of the murder and pleaded for protection from the US after falling out with Bo earlier this year. Wang's dramatic flight for freedom lead to the downfall of politician Bo Xilai and the conviction of Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, who was handed a suspended death sentence for poisoning 41-year-old Heywood . But . he was persuaded after 30 hours of what was fast becoming an . embarrassing diplomatic dispute to hand himself over to Chinese armed . police who had surrounded the consulate. British . officials have been criticised for not acting sooner on the information . handed to them by the US about Wang’s murder file. 'We made every effort to establish whether additional information existed,'  a spokesman for the British Embassy said. What is certain is that Heywood’s murder would likely never have been investigated had Wang not fled to the US consulate and Bo Xilai would still be in line for a seat on China's most powerful political body, the standing committee of the Politburo. Wang's trial clears the way for the leadership to deal with the scandal's stickiest issue: whether to expel Bo from the party and prosecute him. China's leaders appear to still be in damage-control mode, and they have yet to announce a date for a party congress to install the new leadership, though it is expected in mid to late October.","Heywood's death in November was initially ruled as either from excessive drinking or a heart attack .

"By . Adrian Lowery and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:33 EST, 23 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:53 EST, 23 July 2012 . Global stock markets brace for a terrible day of trading as the Dow was down by more than 200 points after being open for less than an hour on Monday morning. By nearly 4pm much of the drop had recovered and the Dow was back to only being 78 points down. The significant drop has refueled fears about the stability of the Euro-zone financially and the possibility that Spain may be in need of a formal bailout which came as the Euro reached 11-year lows. Spain is the epicenter of the current bout of fears, with investors increasingly concerned that the country will not be able to turn its public finances around without outside help. A ban on short-selling by Italy and Spain- whereby investors are prohibited from selling stocks they don't already own - helped contain the fallout on the Milan and Madrid exchanges but did little to encourage traders elsewhere. Scroll down for video . Recovering: By the late afternoon, the Dow was back to being only -78.56 points down . Continuing the downfall: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 200 points within an hour of the American markets opening on Monday morning . The catalyst to the day's dramatic . falls was the sharp increase in the yield on Spain's benchmark 10-year . bond to well above 7 per cent. If it remains around that level, . investors believe the eurozone's fourth-largest economy will likely need . a financial rescue like Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Markets went into crisis mode this . morning after the Spanish region of Murcia yesterday went to the central . government for a bailout - following Valencia, which took the same step . on Friday. With fears . that more regions will follow and tip Spain into effective bankruptcy, . the cost of borrowing for the Spanish government soared and that sent . the FTSE 100 index of leading shares plunging 107.7 points or 1.9 per . cent to 5,544.1. The fall follows a 1.1 per cent loss for the Footsie on Friday, and the euro also took a hammering overnight, falling to its lowest level versus the yen since November 2000, at 94.37. With traders anticipating a fully-fledged bailout for Spain, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds shot up a further 30 basis points to a crisis level of 7.59 per cent and two-year yields were up almost 90 points at 6.64 per cent, while Spain's Ibex stock index tumbled almost 6 per cent, its worst fall in two years. Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 indices were also down 1.6-1.9 per cent. 'Greece is not far from leaving the euro which is not as big a deal as it was one year ago, but Spain was not as much a worry a year ago and is an enormously big deal today,' said Lex van Dam, hedge fund manager at Hampstead Capital. Against the dollar, the euro sank below $1.2100 for the first time in more than two years, hitting a low of $1.2093  and creeping ever closer to the 2010 trough of $1.1876. Although sterling lost a little ground against the single currency today, it stands close to four-year highs at more than €1.28 to the pound. 'With such strong risk aversion it is the yen and the dollar that will keep gaining against risk currencies,' said Teppei Ino, currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in Tokyo. 'The Spanish scenario has not been priced in yet.' Officials from the European Union, . European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund will meet today . with the Greek government government to discuss progress with its budget . pledges. If Greece is unable to deliver the . spending cuts and tax reforms necessary then the so-called troika are . unlikely to be forthcoming with further aid and a Greek exit from the . single currency bloc will be back on the cards. Crisis mode: World stocks skidded lower today as Spain's regional governments topple into insolvency . Over the weekend, the Spanish region of Murcia said it would seek government financial assistance, and media reported that half a dozen other regional governments were ready to follow in the footsteps of Valencia, which on Friday asked for help from a new rescue fund. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi tried to quell fears that the eurozone is spiralling back into crisis, with a statement that the euro is 'irreversible' and that there is no danger of the single currency bloc breaking up. The ECB president went even further to suggest that, far from collapsing, the eurozone is set to become even stronger and more integrated. Speaking in an interview with French newspaper Le Monde on Saturday, Mr Draghi dismissed some analysts' worse case scenarios for the euro. 'We see analysts imagining the scenario of a eurozone blow-up,' he said. 'They don’t recognise the political capital that our leaders have invested in this union and Europeans' support. Mr Draghi went on to say that in the long term, greater integration will be necessary among eurozone countries, saying that movement towards 'financial, budgetary and political union' is 'inevitable'. On the up: At 1.285 euros, the pound is 14 per cent stronger versus the euro than this time last year . European leaders took a step towards greater integration last month at a Brussels summit where they agreed to put the ECB in charge of supervising banks and gave the ESM rescue fund the power to recapitalise troubled banks. But Spain's borrowing costs have remained stubbornly high despite the approval last of the £80billion rescue package for its beleaguered banks. Stock markets across Asia were also hit overnight, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index losing 1.9 per cent, South Korea's Kospi falling 1.8 per cent and Australia's ASX 200 index shedding 1.7 per cent. The outlook for the UK economy was little better, with the Government braced for official data on Wednesday that is expected to confirm the UK has failed to climb out of recession amid calls from London Mayor Boris Johnson that ministers do more to boost confidence and growth. Gross domestic product figures for the period between April and June, published on Wednesday, are expected to show that the double-dip recession has persisted. The economy entered a technical recession in the first quarter of 2012, with gross domestic product declining by 0.3 per cent after a 0.4 per cent drop in the final quarter of 2011. Philip Shaw, an economist at brokers Investec, forecast a further slump in output of around 0.4 per cent. The gloomy picture provoked Mr Johnson to launch an outspoken attack yesterday on David Cameron and George Osborne’s handling of the economy – demanding action to boost public confidence and growth.

In addition, Victim 1 will grant their first interview to ABC, to be aired in synch with the book’s release, though it is unclear which personality at the network will interview him. Sandusky, who was convicted in the scandal that brought shame to Penn State, will be sentenced on October 9, nearly four months after he was found guilty. Tell-all: Jerry Sandusky, right, was found guilty of extensive child sex abuse; Victim One will release a tell-all book and give his first interview to ABC in October . Page Six exclusively confirmed Victim 1’s plans to grant his first interview to ABC to coincide with his book release. The details of the ABC interview are still being ironed out, including who will conduct it, and where the interview will take place. A representative for ABC declined to comment, and Victim 1’s rep could not be reached by Page Six. Sandusky was convicted in June of 45 counts of sex abuse involving 10 boys. Prosecutors said some of the assaults took place on the Penn State campus. The 68-year-old Sandusky, given his age and the serious nature of the crimes, is likely to receive a sentence that will keep him in prison for life. He is jailed pending sentencing and maintains his innocence.

Support: Students showed their appreciation for players who opted against accepted the NCAA offer for a free transfer to a different athletic program . Judge John Cleland scheduled a morning . hearing at the courthouse in Bellefonte to determine if Sandusky should . be classified as a sexually violent predator, a designation that . subjects a convict to intense reporting requirements upon release. An . assessment board has recommended Sandusky for the designation, though . it's expected to have little practical effect since he stands to die in . prison. Sandusky will be . sentenced immediately after the hearing.

The family of a Dallas woman found dead two days after she tried to call 911 during a deadly attack filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city and local police today. Deanna Cook called 911 on August 17 to report that her ex-husband was assaulting her. Police have acknowledged the call was not logged correctly so the responding officers did not know it was an emergency. The two officers who went to Cook's south Dallas home received no response at the door and left without entering, police said. Cook was found dead in her bathtub on August 19 after Cook's relatives forced their way into the home. The ex-husband, Delvecchio Patrick, is charged with murder. Cry for help: The body of Deanna Patrick, 32, was discovered in her bathtub on Sunday, two days after she called police. Husband Delvecchio Patrick, 35 (right) has been charged with murder . Mother: Vickie Cook listens during a news conference about the domestic violence death of her daughter Deanna Cook and the federal lawsuit her family has filed against the City of Dallas . Family wants answers: Vickie Cook, right, looks on with her daughters Valecia Battle, left, and Karletha Cook-Gundy during the news conference . According to dallasnews.com, she can be heard screaming: 'Delvecchio, why are you doing this?' Later she said: 'Red, please stop, I didn’t do anything to you.' The name Red is reportedly her husband's nickname. Police fired one call taker who told . worried family members searching for Cook on August 19 to call the jail . and local hospitals first. The call taker who received Cook's . original call was suspended for 10 days. Police say they have also made . changes to how calls are logged and announced they are hiring more call . takers. The federal lawsuit alleges police were late responding to the call and relied on officers who didn't properly investigate. It accuses the city of violating Cook's due process and equal protection rights by failing to implement necessary policies. Cook's family said on Wednesday that . police have refused to let them hear the tape of Cook's call. Police . have also declined to release a transcript. However, the lawsuit says Cook was . screaming and begging for help during the call, and Chief David Brown . has said the attack on Cook can be heard in the background. It was 50 minutes before officers arrived at Cook's home, according to the lawsuit. Attorney Nick Pittman said the . officers stopped twice on the way — for a burglary call and a personal . trip to 7-Eleven. He said the officers acknowledged the 7-Eleven stop in . internal interview reports he reviewed. Pittman described authorities' response last month as a 'comedy of errors'. Crime scene: Mrs Patrick, 32, called police for help on Friday but officers left after no one answered when they knocked at the door of her Dallas home . 'They have long had a policy of not taking the 911 call center seriously,' Pittman said. Dallas police declined to comment today. A spokesman for the city did not return a message. Family members also said they felt police shortchanged Cook because she was black and lived in south Dallas. 'I would like for it to be understood . how Dallas Police Department responds to certain victims, no matter . what the crime is,' said Valecia Battle, one of Cook's sisters. 'I think . it needs to be understood that it does play a role what your class is. Your gender does play a role. Your race does play a role.' Battle, another sister, Karletha . Cook-Gundy, and their mother, Vickie Cook, said they wanted to see . domestic violence taken more seriously. Patrick had been arrested multiple . times for allegedly attacking Cook. Cook filed for divorce last year, . and the divorce was finalized in January. He remains jailed in Dallas County, . with bond set at $500,000. His attorney, Roger Lenox, did not . immediately return a phone message. Family members said Patrick continued to harass Cook in recent months. 'I just wish and I pray that it . becomes urgent and that nobody should find any individual behind . domestic violence dead,' Vickie Cook said in an interview. The family's lawsuit calls for unspecified damages. No court date has been scheduled yet. Brown, in an earlier interview with . Dallas television station KDFW, said Patrick's assault on Cook that . 'obviously led to her death' is clearly audible on the tape. He met with . family members after the incident. The call 'should have been escalated . to the highest priority — lights and sirens — and that did not happen, . and so we're trying to find out what breakdown in communication happened . along the way between the 911 clerk, dispatcher and the officers that . didn't allow that to happen,' Brown told the television station.","Deanna Patrick dialled 911 on August 17 because her husband was allegedly strangling her .

"By . David Williams . UPDATED: . 05:36 EST, 22 December 2011 . He lies in bed looking desperately weak and gaunt, apparently with just days to live. But Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi summoned up enough strength in his ‘final’ interview to insist he would be proved innocent in death. Speaking in the run up to the 23rd anniversary of the atrocity that killed 270, the former Libyan intelligence officer appealed to his supporters to fight on to clear his name. Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi claims he will be proved innocent in death . His head supported by a special pillow as he lay in bed at the family home in Tripoli, the 59-year-old asked that he be left alone to die from the ravages caused by prostate cancer. ‘I am an innocent man,’ Megrahi pleaded, but said he was too weak and tired to explain in detail why he believed his name would be  eventually cleared. Megrahi revealed that he was recently . visited by Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the bombing of Pan . Am Fight 103, and had confided in him details of dramatic new . discoveries made by investigators working to clear his name. In his final interview Megrahi revealed that he was visited by Dr Jim Swire (pictured) whose daughter Flora died in the bombing of Pan Am Fight 103 . Pivotal to these, it is understood, . are new forensic studies of fragments of a circuit board alleged to have . been a piece of the bomb  that was the single most crucial piece of . evidence linking the bombing to Libya. Dr . Swire, who is convinced Megrahi is innocent and has repeatedly spoken . out on his behalf, refused to comment on the new discoveries last . night. The images of the frail bomber are the . first to be seen of him in more than six weeks and appear to show a . marked deterioration in his condition. Propped on pillows and covered by . a thick floral blanket, he spoke slowly and falteringly, sometimes . closing his deeply-sunken eyes as he considered answers. Megrahi . is the only person convicted of the December 21, 1988 bombing. He was . controversially released on compassionate grounds from a life sentence . in August 2009 because of his terminal illness. In . the interview he accused the authorities of deliberately withholding . investigation interviews with a key prosecution witness from his lawyers . for more than a decade. That witness was Maltese shopkeeper . Tony Gauci, who identified the Libyan as resembling the man who . purchased clothes which were subsequently found in the remains of the . suitcase containing the bomb. Bringing out the dead: One of the 270 victims is carried away from the wreckage of the bombing of Flight 103 that exploded over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 . Despite . his weakness, Megrahi became angry at the mention of Gauci. He said his . lawyers had not been able to secure all the 55, sometimes allegedly . conflicting, statements made by the shopkeeper and added: ‘Where is the . justice? 'There is no justice.’ It had always been believed Gauci was the only witness who could identify the buyer of the clothes but Megrahi claims new evidence will prove the shopkeeper’s brother also met with him. ‘This information has never been raised before,’ he said, ‘There is an opportunity to have another physical witness who could have identified the man, yet they kept the brother out of it.’ Megrahi was given a hero’s welcome on his return to Libya and feted by Colonel Gaddafi. Debris: Remains of the plane can be seen pictured here following the Lockerbie disaster . In . the interview he condemns two retired Scottish detectives as the main . architects of the ‘fabricated case’ against him. He is pinning great . hope, he said, on a book to be published early next year he has . co-written with journalist and investigator John Ashton. ‘I want people to read the book and use their brain not hearts and make judgment,’ he said, ‘Information is not from me, not from lawyers, not from the media, but experts who deal with criminal law and science. It will clear my name.’ The Megrahi interview on December 15 was conducted by George Thomson, a former police officer, who is now a criminal defence investigator. It is due to be used in a TV documentary to be broadcast in February. The pair became close after Mr Thompson joined the defence team in January 2003 looking into the case. Mr Thompson said: ‘It saddens me that if justice is ever done in this case, he won’t be there to see it done.’","Megrahi revealed he was visited by Dr Jim Swire whose daughter Flora died in the bombing of Pan .

A baby born with a rare condition will never be able to smile, cry, frown or show any facial expression. Cody James, who is 13 months old, also has to roll his eyes to keep them moist because he cannot blink. He was born with Moebius syndrome, a rare condition that affects just two out of every million children. Rare condition: Cody James, pictured with his parents Kim Eastwell and Talan James, was born with Moebius syndrome and will never be able to smile, cry, frown or show any facial expression . There are only 124 children with the condition in Britain, said his parents, Kim Eastwell and Talan James, of Helston, Cornwall. Miss Eastwell said: 'He is so clever, and he is gorgeous. My heart breaks that I will never see my son smile at me.' Moebius syndrome is present at birth and affects some cranial nerves, leaving sufferers unable to move their faces. The left-hand side of Cody’s body is also affected. Mrs Eastwell said that she and her husband panicked when Cody was born because he did not scream or cry. Cody is one of only 124 children with the Moebius syndrome in Britain . After a while, they noticed his facial palsy was not improving, he was not supporting himself, or smiling. She said: 'All I could hear was the other babies crying, I cried myself to sleep that night.' But it was not until the couple later saw an eye specialist - after being told the problem was nerve damage which would repair itself - that Cody was diagnosed with the incurable syndrome. Miss Eastwell said: 'Cody doesn’t sit up or crawl but he does roll and has one cheeky personality. 'Even though he doesn’t smile we all know he’s happy with his dirty, cheeky little laugh. He’s making so much progress, everything Cody does he has to work ten times harder for. 'At the end of the day you don’t give up on your baby.' Now Miss Eastwell and Mr James are determined to help other children with Moebius syndrome by raising money for research into the condition. On Saturday, the Lizard Fundraising Fair near Kynance, Cornwall, will be raising money for the Moebius Syndrome Foundation as well as Cornwall Air Ambulance Trust.","Cody James has Moebius syndrome, which affects two in a million children .

A 22-month old girl with a rare condition is recovering from a £60,000 life-changing operation to fit a bionic hearing aid inside her skull. It was a race against time for little Evie Small who was flown to Italy for the surgery which will finally give her the chance to hear and speak.

Her lawyer parents David and Emily needed to raise £60,000 for the operation by the world's top specialist surgeon, Professor Vittorio Colletti. They have raised almost half the money and although the operation was completed last week they have 18 months to raise the rest. When Prof Colletti first saw Evie, he told the family 'this little girl needs operating on by the end of June, it's no concern to me when you can pay'. Evie pictured after her operation.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:57 EST, 28 September 2011 . The scale of customers' anger at High Street banks was revealed today as it was announced that the banks receive 10,000 complaints every day. The number of complaints has risen by the three per cent since last year thanks to the scandal of mis-sold Payment Protection Insurance. Barclays is the UK's most complained-about bank, with more than 250,000 new disputes recorded in the first half of this year. Banks: The FSA reports that customers file 10,000 complaints a day . Following closely behind Barclays' 251,563 complaints were Lloyds TSB with 181,907 and Santander with 168,888, according to the Financial Services Authority. The bank says that a large number of complaints were connected to PPI, an issue which has affected the whole sector. According to the FSA, more than half a million complaints were received about PPI - over a quarter of the total 1,852,284 recorded bank complaints. The insurance, which looks set to become the UK's biggest ever mis-selling scandal, covers debt repayments if the holder is unable to work due to an accident or illness, or if they lose their job. In May, the banking industry dropped its legal challenge over whether new FSA rules on PPI mis-selling claims could be applied retrospectively. This means more than three million people are in line for compensation, with firms facing a total bill of up to £9billion. Only half of all complaints in the first half of 2011 were upheld. Firms do not have to report complaints that are resolved to the customer's satisfaction by the close of business the day after the complaint was made. High Street: Lending to small businesses has risen while it remains stable for larger companies . Despite the rise in complaints, it has also been reported that banks lent more to households and small businesses this summer. But the Government's financial watchdog says that banks must strengthen their balance sheets to avoid damaging the economy in a future crisis. Lenders said there was a slight increase in the availability of credit to households in the third quarter of 2011, according to a survey by the Bank of England. Credit conditions for large and medium-sized businesses were stable, while there was a slight increase for small companies. But banks warned 'adverse wholesale funding conditions', most likely to be caused by the eurozone debt crisis, might constrain their ability to offer loans in the future. And small businesses are also facing tighter lending conditions in the form of covenants and collateral requirements. Unrest in Greece: Eurozone turbulence could force banks to boost balance sheets . Financial markets have . come under increasing strain in recent months after banks became less . willing to lend to one another because of fears about exposure to Greek . debt. And the eurozone . debt problem has created a crisis of confidence among investors, reducing . the amount of money they have pumped into financial markets. According to the Financial Policy Committee, eurozone debt fears have also made it harder for banks to hoard cash to prepare for the shocks ahead without choking off lending to households and firms. In its first meeting in June, the FPC said banks should build up cash levels when earnings are strong - but today admitted this may not always be possible given increasing risks to the economy. The latest quarterly update from the FPC, set up to oversee the country's financial stability in the wake of the credit crunch, comes after the IMF warned the eurozone debt crisis had added £260billion to the risk exposure of EU banks. But there was good news for the housing market, as the Bank of England survey revealed that demand for prime mortgages - those which are viewed by banks as relatively safe - has increased for the first time since 2009, while demand for buy-to-let mortgages also showed a 'substantial' rise.","Barclays most complained about with more than 250,000 disputes recorded in first half of year .

But the photographer who captured this stunning vista of the orange sun splashed gloriously across a mountaintop claims the amazing view was all natural. Harry Lichtman saw the awe-inspiring scene during a sunrise over Grinnell Peak in Glacier National Park, Montana, at the exact moment the peak was bathed in orange sunlight. Sunrise spectacular: Harry Lichtman captured this picturesque scene in . Montana when early morning sun bathed orange light over Grinnell Peak . Mr Lichtman said a combination of the sun's warm glow, along with the reddish brown of Grinnell Peak's sedimentary rock, helped create the unique early morning landscape. The 47-year-old also points out that evergreen trees in the left corner of the picture are also turning red at the sun-shade boundary. And he insists that, although many may suspect otherwise, the incredible image did not receive any Photoshop treatment. Mr Lichtman, from Newmarket, New Hampshire, said: 'The morning started out pretty stormy and cloudy, which can be magical, as in this case, or a real dud. 'It can be hit or miss, which is why a photographer must consistently make the effort to be at a location and ready. The before shot: This image shows what Grinnell Peak in Glacier National Park looks like under more usual circumstances .

'I kept looking behind me, checking for a hole in the eastern horizon that the sun might break through. 'What is unusual about this shot is that the sun managed to find its way through clouds to illuminate Grinnell Peak, but little else. 'I couldn't see the cloud break where the sun came from, but was certainly glad it made it through. 'Normally, I would have expected and hoped that the clouds and surrounding peaks would turn the same brilliant orange but that never happened. 'The peak glowed for maybe a couple of minutes, and then the sky fizzled to grey. In the end, this is what makes the shot unique since the peak stands out from the rest of the landscape and becomes a real focal point.'","Photographer Harry Lichtman claims stunning sunrise effect on image was completely natural .

England's south coast tends to hog the praise when it comes to beaches and sea views, but the north coast of Kent has much to offer - especially in the county's eastern corner. Whitstable is the pearl in the crown of England's oyster industry - the place where tens of thousands of cultivated oysters are bred, grown and harvested for sale at London's Billingsgate market and beyond. Shingle-coated beaches and small weathered cottages provide a quiet atmosphere far removed from the candyfloss and pier shows of Southend. Whitstable is all about seafood and you'll find oyster-selling restaurants by the dozen. Among them are the internationally acclaimed Crab And Winkle restaurant and Wheelers Oyster Bar - which is widely regarded as one of the UK's best fish restaurants. There are also numerous galleries, gift shops, boutiques and pubs. And you may even bump into one of its famous residents, such as comedian Harry Hill (above) or actress Faye Ripley. Whoever bags the idyllic lifestyle will find themselves at the centre of one of Britain’s trendiest seaside towns and count themselves neighbours with celebrities such as TV comedian Harry Hill and Cold Feet star Faye Ripley.

When baby Llana began struggling to sleep and feed properly in September, her concerned mother, Shaz, 39, took her to the doctors. Tests at South Tyneside District Hospital revealed she had a murmur on her heart and she was transferred to Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital for specialist treatment. There she was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, which affects the heart muscles and meant her heart was not strong enough to work on its own. Mrs Qazi and her husband Muhammed, 47, were told Llana urgently needed a heart transplant. While the family faced a terrifying wait, Llana was put on a Berlin Heart - a machine that helps the left side of the heart pump blood around the body. She required a further four artificial heart machines as doctors could not keep her stable. The family waited desperately for news of a donor, and their prayers were answered on February 29 when they received a call that a suitable heart had been found. But doctors warned Llana had a 50/50 chance of survival. The operation was an initial success but Llana’s life hung in the balance after her new heart stopped for 63 minutes a day after the transplant. Llana’s lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest. She was also placed in isolation more than once after her rejection levels soared sky-high.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . UPDATED: . 19:01 EST, 14 April 2012 . Sales of breathalyser kits are soaring as British motorists planning summer holidays  in France try to comply with new laws. All drivers must carry breathalysers in their vehicles in France this summer or risk a £9 fine. The new rules come into force on July 1. The gadgets, designed so that drivers . can test themselves to ensure they are under drink-drive limits, are the . latest addition to a list of rules for driving on the other side of the . Channel. Another essential: Motorists travelling to France after July must carry a breathalyser kit in the car, along with other items . Halfords has reported a strong demand for its £4.99 twin pack of breathalysers. Motorists . are advised to carry  two single-use breathalysers so that if they have . used one to check their own alcohol levels, they can still show police . an unopened kit if stopped. Motorists found with between 50mg and . 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood can be fined 135 euros (£112) and lose . six out of 12 points on their driving licence. Above that, a driver . risks a fine of 4,500 euros (£3,744), losing their licence and being . sent to prison for up to two years. The French drink-driving limit of 50mg is much lower than in the UK where the limit is 80mg. Police, however, will use their own breathalysers to carry out any roadside test. Those drivers caught without a kit will face a fine of 11 euros (£9) but the French have said there will be a period of grace till November before police start issuing the penalties. The breathalyser kits cost between around £1 and £2 and will be available at ferry and tunnel terminals for crossings to France, but motoring groups have warned that many drivers will still forget to pack them in their car. Andrew Howard, the AA’s head of road safety, explained that it takes time for alcohol to be absorbed into the blood, so early readings could be misleading. He said: ‘After you have had your last swig of alcohol, your reading will continue to rise for the next 40 minutes because it takes time for alcohol to go down into your stomach and be taken into the bloodstream.’ He added: 'Driving requirements in France are now quite complicated and the list of things you need to take is beginning to be quite a substantial extra charge to a holiday.' Police are expected to carry out random checks on drivers crossing into France via Calais to ensure that they understand the latest drink-driving rules. Anyone driving in France is already required to carry a warning triangle and a fluorescent safety vest to use in an emergency. The drink-drive limit in France is lower than it is in the UK . Additionally British motorists must display a GB plate and have their headlights adjusted to the right. But even if drivers have the full list of equipment they can still be caught out by the complexity of the rules. If a motorist carries the luminous vest in their boot rather than the main section of the car they can still be fined. Drivers are not obliged to carry a spare set of lights, but if one of their bulbs goes and they do not have a replacement ready they can be fined. A fire extinguisher and first aid kit could also be required in the case of an emergency so not to fall foul of a law about assisting in the event of an accident.","£9 Fine for drivers who fail to carry the £2 kit .

Witnesses told us they saw the horse bucking when it got out of its box so we think there was something wrong from the beginning. It could have been in there for hours.' The family were furious to discover this week that the carriage operator was not insured, meaning they will receive no compensation. Mrs Sykes added: 'We will never get our wedding day back, no matter what happens. But with some compensation we could have had a trip away or a new photoshoot which would have made us feel a bit better.' A police spokeswoman confirmed that officers were called at 11.52am last Saturday to a road traffic collision involving a horse-drawn carriage.","Rampaging animal threw James and Claire Sykes and their daughter Abby-Lei, 4, head-first towards the tarmac .

A breakthrough by British scientists could lead to new  treatments for the most common form of arthritis. Researchers have discovered eight sections of our DNA that are responsible for osteoarthritis, the crippling incurable condition that affects millions. Crucially, they think that at least two or three of these so-called ‘genetic regions’ could be used to treat the illness. The research, carried out by scientists at the University of Newcastle, could lead to new treatment for thousands of arthritis sufferers . They all contain genes responsible for the production of cartilage, the tissue between bones that is damaged by osteoarthritis. The scientists from the University of Newcastle believe that in future they could alter patients’ genes to make them produce stronger cartilage, helping to repair the damaged joints. Around 8.5million Britons suffer from osteoarthritis and it is believed to affect as many as 40 per cent of the over-70s. It causes debilitating joint pain – particularly in the hips and knees – and often leaves patients immobile or unable to walk long distances. At present there is no cure and patients can only alleviate their symptoms with drugs, physiotherapy or in severe cases through surgery to remove the affected joint. The study, published in the Lancet, looked at 7,400 patients with osteoarthritis and compared their DNA to 11,000 people without the disease. The team found eight sections of our DNA that are responsible for osteoarthritis . Although the authors acknowledge that it will be at least five or ten years before they are close to a treatment, they say the findings are an important ‘first step’. Professor John Loughlin, who led the research, said: ‘We’ve identified eight regions of human genomes that increase the risk of the disease. ‘We would dearly like to use the information gathered to enable patients’ cells to be modified to ensure they make better cartilage. But it’s a long way off. Our results don’t enable us to do that at this point and it’s not something that anybody who has got the disease now can hope for.‘It’s a major breakthrough, the largest study of its kind performed in this world to date. ‘We’re trying to work out now exactly what these genes are doing and what is going wrong.’ He said it was not possible yet to use their findings to carry out genetic tests to predict who was more at risk from the illness. Scientists have known for many years that osteoarthritis runs in families. But until now they knew of only three genetic regions that increased the risk of  the illness. They have now identified a further eight. Professor Alan Silman, medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said: ‘There is no cure for osteoarthritis yet it affects millions of people around the world. ‘For 60 years we have known that you are twice as likely to have osteoarthritis if your  parents have the disease, yet we haven’t  known why. ‘Until we understand the cause of this complex disease, we cannot hope to find a cure. ‘This is a major breakthrough in our  understanding of osteoarthritis which we hope will help us to unlock the genetic basis of the disease.’ Osteoarthritis is notoriously difficult to diagnose, with patients waiting an average of almost three years to be diagnosed and referred for treatment, according to a recent report by Arthritis Care. The number of Britons suffering from the crippling condition is expected to double over the next 20 years due to the ageing population and higher levels of obesity, reaching 17million by 2030, according to the charity. A third of sufferers are forced to retire early or substantially reduce the numbers of hours they work, because of the condition. It is estimated to cost the economy £3.2billion in lost working time.","Breakthrough made by researchers at the University of Newcastle .

When her beloved husband was killed in Afghanistan, Christina Schmid thought she could never love again. But nearly three years after Staff Sergeant Olaf ‘Oz’ Schmid died defusing a Taliban bomb, his widow has a new man in her life. The 36-year-old met Mark Clarke, who is also a serving member of the Armed Forces, six months ago and believes her late husband would give them his blessing. Christina has fallen for military man Mark Clarke, pictured, who she met in a coffee shop queue, and she believes Oz would give them his blessing . Has his blessing: Christina with Oz, whom she still loves and misses everyday . Staff Sgt Schmid, 30, died while trying to defuse a bomb in Afghanistan in October 2009, 24 hours before he was due to fly home. He was awarded a posthumous George Cross for his bravery, which saw him disarm more than 60 explosive devices in six months. Mrs Schmid was left devastated but knew she had to be strong for her son Laird, who is now eight. Christina tells her story in the latest issue of Hello! ‘I didn’t know if I would ever be able to love again after I lost Oz, but Mark has taught me that I can; that I have a lot of love still left to give and a lot of life left to live,’ she told Hello! magazine. Posing for a lavish photo spread with 30-year-old Mr Clarke, she said her love for her husband has ‘not in any way diminished’ and she misses him every day. But she added: ‘I have been lucky enough to meet this lovely man who cares deeply for me and wants to be with me – and I adore him.’ Mrs Schmid said Laird has accepted his mother’s new partner – and is already asking if the pair will marry. ‘He wants to have brothers and sisters. Children don’t understand it’s more complex than that.’ She added: ‘Mark gets me completely, and I get him. It’s refreshing, comfortable and easy. Some people don’t find that once in a lifetime. I’ve been fortunate to find it twice. ‘Having Mark in my life hasn’t changed the way I feel about Oz. He is always in my heart and spiritually he’s always by my side.’ Mrs Schmid, who lives in a £500,000 detached house in rural Hampshire, has just published her memoir Always By My Side about her life with her husband, whom she described as her ‘soulmate and best friend’.She says she actually completed the book a year ago and then felt ready ‘to move on to the next chapter of my life’. Hero: Oz was awarded the George Cross after his death for defusing more than 60 defusing bombs . Brave and proud: Christina gave a thumbs up as she waited for Oz's body to be repatriated in November 2009 . The widow met Mr Clarke, who had just returned from serving in Afghanistan, in a coffee shop last autumn. The attraction was instant and they spoke for two hours before parting, having exchanged phone numbers. Mrs Schmid, who accepted the George Cross on her late husband’s behalf, said she believes he would have liked her new partner ‘very much’ and added: ‘We did have a discussion once, Oz and I, about how he’d feel about me meeting someone new. ‘He said, “If anything happens to me, honey, you and Laird have got each other, and nothing can break that. But if you meet someone who will look after you, then that’s lovely”. So I feel I have his blessing.’ Mrs Schmid and Mr Clarke are now discussing having a blessing to symbolise their commitment to each other and ‘new start’ to their friends and relatives. But it is too soon to say if they will marry. ‘Mark is a big part of my life,’ she added. ‘But at the same time I am a widow and I am aware that I have to be dignified. I have my closest friends to consider, many of whom are also Oz’s dearest friends. Whoever comes into my life must be able to get on with them. Luckily, Mark has. I feel that, in some ways, I have been pigeonholed as a grieving widow and campaigner – and don’t get me wrong, I was that woman. But I achieved what I set out to achieve, and now I want to move forward. I want to leave that woman in the past and look to the future.’ Mrs Schmid bought her new home, in its own grounds with a stream running alongside, eight months ago when she moved out of Army accommodation. It is understood she and Laird live there with frequent visits from Mr Clarke – the couple are often seen walking her late husband’s dog in the countryside. A neighbour said: ‘They seem very happy.  Is she pregnant? I don’t know but I think she has said she would like more children one day.’ The full interview with Mrs Schmid is in the current issue of Hello! magazine. My first call was to my mother. ‘Oh no, no, not Oz. Oh my God, you knew . . .’ she wailed.Over . the next few hours I called Oz’s family and friends. When I finished, I . launched the phone across the room and smashed the base. I was . screaming ‘no’ and shaking uncontrollably. People . came and went. The night passed in a blur but I still remember it . vividly — the flashbacks of that night still happen to this day. Later, I’d discover that Oz had been killed while trying to defuse his third IED of the morning. Colonel Bob Seddon, who led the technical investigation, showed me photographs of Oz kneeling over the device that killed him. The . pictures had been taken a few moments before the explosion. There was a . compound wall in the background, and wires poking out of the ground a . few yards in front of it. Oz was deep in concentration. The . next photographs of the same spot showed a crater with scraps of burned . paper lying about — the remains of letters and photos that Oz had . tucked into his body armour. Grim . as the details were, I wanted to know the full story of my husband’s . death. But no witness could say for sure why the IED had exploded. My . own belief is that it may have been detonated by remote control. Oz was . always so careful — he once said to me: ‘I deal with every device as . though you and Laird are on the end of it. That’s how I keep my focus.’ Extracted from Always By My Side, by Christine Schmid .

It may look like its glory days are far far behind it - but this rusting Mini is expected to fetch £15,000 at auction. It has been left untouched and unloved in a Chichester barn since 1986, but it now emerges that the car is the world’s oldest original Mini. The decrepit motor was the eighth to be made when it rolled off the production line in 1959 and despite is poor condition, the vehicle is being described as a ‘classic’. Rusty: The grey paint work on the Mini is still visible in place, but the car is still far from roadworthy . Enthusiasts keen on the prospect of returning the dusty Austin Mini Se7en De Luxe Saloon to its original condition are expected to drive up its price. The vehicle was bought by a David Gallimore in 1986 from a Gladys Hobro of Aldwick, Bognor Regis, West Sussex. Mr Gallimore kept the car, which originally cost £497 and has a 848cc engine, in a Chichester barn until last year. The Mini has just 30,000 miles on the clock, but after rusting away for more than two decades doesn’t actually work. Interior: The basic design is a far cry from modern luxuries such as air conditioning and electric windows . Through the rust it is possible to . glimpse the original Farina Grey paintwork, and it retains the original . registration plate: XLL 27. The interior is basic, but has all the original features including its only dashboard instrument - a speedometer. It was built in July 1959 at Longbridge, Warwicks, three months before the model went into full production. Workings: The Mini was designed in the 1950s at a time of fuel shortages and its engine is just 848cc . It was then sent to Car Mart Limited in . Colchester, Essex, where it was first sold. It has emerged again in . need a full make-over: inside, outside and under the bonnet. John Polson, from Bonhams which is selling the car, said: 'This is a wonderful opportunity to buy the car and restore it. It is the oldest unrestored Mini. 'Collectors love the fact it has had very little done to it since it was built. It was the eight to be produced and is the fourth oldest that survives. Glory: Despite its run down condition the Mini retains many of the features that made it such an influential car . 'The Mini is one of the most important cars of the 20th century. They have always been collectable. 'Some collectors would want to return her to new, but others would just like to get her going again and keep her in the original condition.' It is thought that only three Minis earlier than this one exist today, but they have all been restored over the years. One is at the British Heritage Motor Centre Museum in Warwickshire, and the other two are in private collections in Japan. In 1999 the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T. Its design came about because the Suez Crisis meant that the country was short of petrol, and smaller cars were required. The sale is on April 30 at The Royal Airforce Museum in London.","The Mini first rolled off the production line in 1959 .

Supermodel Linda Evangelista and the billionaire father of her five-year-old son have settled their bitter child support battle - over the phone. The surprise settlement, revealed by a source to The New York Post, comes three days into the court scrap that revealed some of the uglier truths about the former couple's four-month relationship. In the first two days on the witness stand, Francois-Henri Pinault, who is now married to actress Salma Hayek, revealed he broke up with Evangelista when he discovered she was pregnant. Settled: Supermodel Linda Evangelista, pictured arriving at court on Monday, has made a surprise child support settlement with Francois-Henri Pinault, the father of her son . And Evangelista's lawyer also claimed the . Frenchman, who is heir to a staggering $11.5 billion family estate, had . demanded the supermodel have an abortion as he did not want the child. It . is not clear whether Evangelista has won the $46,000 a month she . expected Pinault to pay for their son, with the source only claiming he . had 'gone a  long way toward meeting those original demands'. The . exact settlement was not disclosed by the source, but it comes just . before Evangelista was due to take the witness stand, potentially . offering further insight into Pinault's reluctance to raise a child. The . legal teams will appear in the Manhattan family court at 2pm today . to announce the settlement. It is believed they will have to return to . court on Tuesday to confirm the details in writing. Shake-up: The agreement comes as Evangelista was due to testify against Pinault on Monday . The court battle, which began last Thursday, has focused on the care of five-year-old Augie, who was conceived during his parents short-lived relationship in 2005 and 2006. His supermodel mother had said the boy's care - including around-the-clock nannies and armed drivers - cost her $46,000 a month, and she wanted Pinault to cover the hefty bills. Evangelista's . lawyer William Beslow had also argued that Augie deserves a lifestyle . similar to that of Pinault's four-year-old daughter with Hayek, born just months after Augie. Pinault, 49, is heir to a family estate estimated at $11.5billion. As chief executive of . PPR, . the conglomerate that owns Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Bottega Veneta, he earns $5million a year. He . spends $50,000 a month just on the taxes, upkeep and loan payments for . the $12million Los Angeles home he's put in trust for the girl, . Valentina, the Post reported. And taking the witness stand, he . revealed he spent a staggering $260,000 on gifts for himself in 2010 - . but could not remember what he had bought his son or how much he had . spent on him. Escape: It is not known if Pinault, seen Monday, will pay the $46,000 a month Evangelista demanded . Bitter feud: The former couple were expected to spend four days in court to thrash out a settlement . 'I have a watch collection,' he said, the New York Post reported. 'It's for when I buy a watch for me.' He . went on: 'I bought him a present for his birthday and for Christmas,' yet admitted he could not remember what he bought Augie for his fourth birthday. And for Christmas: 'I bought it online. It was a piano thing.' Despite his wealth, Pinault had criticised Evangelista for . her outlandish demands, suggesting the $46,000 a month is in fact for 'mom . support'. She has maintained she is modelling or working on her image at . all hours of the day. 'Most of the expenses do not relate . to Augie but they relate to Ms. Evangelista,' Pinault's lawyer, David . Aronson, said in opening statements on Thursday. 'It is the classic case of someone trying to bootstrap herself to something that is alimony.' Support: Ahead of the settlement on Monday, Evangelista was pictured with her son Augie and ex-boyfriend Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton, from whom she broke up last year . Revelations: Evangelista's lawyer claimed Pinault asked her to abort the baby. Augie is now five . Also at the trial on Thursday, Evangelista's lawyer recounted a conversation the former couple shared in January 2006. 'After some initial happiness, he told her he wished she would terminate the pregnancy,' Beslow told a support magistrate. Evangelista, . who was then in her early 40s, told Pinault she would keep the baby. Pinault revealed the couple had spent just seven days together in four . months when she made the announcement. Ready to party: Linda Evangelista appeared at . the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Ball the same night as she was thought . to have settled her alimony suit against her former boyfriend . Francois-Henri Pinault . 'She would support the child herself, since he had made it perfectly clear to her that he had no interest in doing so. And she did.' Pinault said he found out she was pregnant . in early 2006 and admitted he broke up with her on hearing the news. 'She was so happy to be pregnant,' he said. 'But it was not planned. I decided to stop the relationship at that point.' He added: 'We were dating four months and I didn't even know her very much.' Asked . why he didn’t pay Evangelista anything in child support for the first . years of Augie's life, Pinault answered: 'She didn’t ask and I didn’t . offer.' Unhappy ending: Evangelista was excited about her pregnancy, while Pinault was not, he said in court . Fears: At the child support trial, Francois-Henri Pinault (left) also revealed his wife actress . Salma Hayek (pictured) feared their daughter Valentina (right) might . have Down's syndrome . It also emerged on Friday that he had . asked his former girlfriend to delay the process of legally recognising . Augie as his son as his wife Hayek was going through a difficult . pregnancy. 'We were told the baby had Down . syndrome until late May 2007,' Pinault said, adding that Hayek, then 41, . almost lost their daughter Valentina. Evangelista agreed to delay the process and he was grateful, the New York Post reported. Although she was accused of piggybacking on Pinault's lifestyle, Evanglista's lawyer said she was 'looking for a continuation of the . reasonable lifestyle of Augie'. 'I need to protect him,' Evangelista told Love magazine in February. Last year a judge questioned the model's need for full-time nannies, asking how often she worked. 'When I work, it can be a 16-hour . day,' she said. 'On days when I do not work, I am . working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I . have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an . athlete.' Demands: Evangelista is not so hard up herself, earning millions from high-profile modelling campaigns, cosmetic contracts and cover shoots . Last week, Manhattan divorce lawyer Raoul Felder . said the eye-watering payout - which comes to $1,500 a day - was unlikely. He pointed out that judges . consider how much it costs to care for a child, rather than the wealth . of the parents. 'She’s in for a big surprise. I wouldn’t be counting the money yet,' he told the New York Daily News. Evangeista is worth $8million and owns a . penthouse in Chelsea, New York and an apartment near her . son’s school on the Upper East Side.

Jack Straw gossiped with Rebekah Brooks as he commuted to work when he was Justice Secretary, he told the Leveson Inquiry yesterday. The former Labour Cabinet minister revealed he deliberately arranged to sit with Mrs Brooks often so they could ‘gossip about personalities’ and what ‘was in the papers’. His comments turn attention back on Labour after embarrassing revelations about the former Sun editor’s closeness to David Cameron and George Osborne. Political chats: Jack Straw today revealed that he used to sit with Rebekah Brooks every Monday morning on the train from Oxfordshire to London . Train journeys: Mrs Brooks and Mr Straw travelled to London together from Charlbury, Oxfordshire . Mr Straw told how the pair used to travel together on the hour-long journey from their homes in West Oxfordshire. The MP said: ‘We would talk about what was in the papers, what was the gossip about personalities, that sort of thing. We weren’t nattering the whole journey. ‘There were all sorts of people around ear-wigging so there was a kind of limit to what one was going to say either way.’ He also revealed that his commuting arrangement with Mrs Brooks ‘stopped when she became chief executive of News International’ in 2009. Both Mrs Brooks and her husband, the racehorse owner Charlie, were charged with four others, on Tuesday with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over the Scotland Yard investigation into phone hacking. Mr Straw, one of the few MPs to attend the Brooks’ wedding, told the inquiry that although he had decided his approach to the media was ‘don’t have favourites’, the Blair government had had ‘incestuous’ relations with some figures. And he came closer than other witnesses to saying Rupert Murdoch had influenced policy. ‘[Mr Murdoch] reckoned his political influence would be greater if, as it were, his support was available in return for what he thought he could get out of it,’ Mr Straw said. ‘I don’t mean a deal... But he thought there was something in it.’ The meetings petered out after Mrs Brooks - who was yesterday charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to the phone-hacking scandal - was made News International chief executive in 2009. The disclosure offers yet more evidence of Mrs Brooks' extensive contacts with major political players. Last week she told the inquiry that David Cameron regularly signed off text messages with 'LOL' for 'lots of love'. Commuter route: Jack Straw and Rebekah Brooks travelled to London together from Charlbury Station often, he told the Leveson Inquiry today . Mr Straw also admitted that Labour's links with journalists were 'sometimes incestuous' in opposition'. He said Rupert Murdoch believed the power wielded by his newspapers benefited his wider commercial interests. Mr Straw said the media mogul, 81, liked his publications to keep their options open on which party to support because it could 'open more doors' when it came to issues such as regulation and licences. Power man: Rupert Murdoch, pictured with his wife Wendi, liked his publications to keep their options open on which party to support because it could 'open more doors', Mr Straw claimed . He admitted that Tony Blair's government had been too cosy with the press, blaming the fact that in opposition, links with journalists had become 'very, very close, sometimes incestuous'. He said: 'One of the reasons why the Blair Government was too close to people in the press was because we had not stopped that sort of contact but allowed it to continue to operate in that way in government.' Mr Straw said the culture of spin developed within Labour because they were determined to cling on to power after the papers turned against them in the 1980s and the 1992 election. He said Downing Street became 'too close' to certain journalists under Tony Blair. Mr Straw added: 'What I saw was that generally some newspapers and some journalists with newspapers were being favoured by Downing Street and some Ministers. 'They had these little groups - it was very incestuous. 'It suited No 10 and it suited those journalists at the time as they were getting stories that others in their newsrooms weren't. 'I think it was a bad idea and I didn't like it. I tried to get on and do things in a different way.' Favoured journalists: No 10 became 'too close' to the media under Tony Blair's government, Jack Straw told the Leveson Inquiry today . Asked about Mr Murdoch's impact on politicians, Mr Straw insisted he had 'power'. While stressing he had only had a 'paragraph' of conversation with the owner of the Sun and The Times, and no direct information, he said: 'He reckoned his political influence would be greater if, as it were, his support was available in return for what he thought he could get out of it. 'I don't mean a deal, because I have seen no evidence of a deal. But he thought there was something in it.' He went on: 'I think that the perception I have got is that Mr Murdoch is enjoying the fact that he has been willing to play with political leaders in the way that the senior executives of the other papers have not. 'He is very interested in power for its own sake, because you do not get to that position running a huge international media empire without being interested in power.' Pressed on what Mr Murdoch might have thought he would get from his influence over politicians, Mr Straw suggested he wanted to 'consolidate his non-newspaper interests in this country'. Mr Murdoch believed remaining available could 'open more doors in government when it came to things like media regulation, licences, regulation of football and so on'. The Labour MP rejected as 'disingenuous' James Murdoch's efforts to play down the importance of News International's publications to the wider News Corporation empire. Although they only constituted two per cent of the group's financial interests, they were far more significant to the business in other ways, he said. Asked whether Mr Murdoch wielded 'power' or 'influence', Mr Straw replied: 'Certainly, to those on the receiving end it felt like power.' Earlier Mr Straw said that he had always kept a 'respectful acquaintanceship' with journalists as it was his instinct not to get to close.","Mr Straw would talk politics with Mrs Brooks as they travelled to London .

The mass funeral marked the 17th anniversary of Europe's worst massacre since World War II. The annual ritual was as heartbreaking as ever - Izabela Hasanovic, 27, spent the last minutes crying over one of the coffins before it was lowered into the ground. Scroll down for video . Grieving: Some 30,000 Muslims traveled to a memorial center in Srebrenica, in Bosnia today to bury 520 newly identified victims . Time to mourn: Three women grieve beside the coffin of their relative at the Potocari memorial complex near Srebrenica . Last honour: The coffins represented only a small number of the thousands of Muslim men and boys slaughtered in July 1995 by Serb forces . 'My father, my father is here,' she sobbed. 'I cannot believe that my father is in this coffin. I cannot accept it!' Another woman dropped on her knees next to a coffin, pressing her lips against the green cloth covering its wood. 'It's your sister kissing you. It's me,' she whispered to the coffin, caressing it with both hands until others lowered it. Then the valley echoed with the sound of dirt landing over 500 coffins from thousands of shovels as a voice read out the names of the victims and their ages from loudspeakers. Among them were 48 teenagers as well as 94-year-old Saha Izmirlic, who was buried next to her son who also died in the massacre. On the other side of her grave, an empty space is waiting for her grandson who has not yet been found. History: Srebrenica was a U.N.-protected Muslim town in Bosnia besieged by Serb forces throughout Bosnia's 1992-95 war . Final goodbye: The bodies of the victims are still being found in mass graves throughout eastern Bosnia. The task has been made even more difficult by the fact that the perpetrators dug up mass graves and reburied remains in other mass graves to try to cover their tracks. Uncovered: The victims have been identified through DNA analysis and newly identified ones are buried at the Srebrenica memorial center every year. So far 5,325 Srebrenica massacre victims found this way have been laid to rest . Srebrenica was a U.N.-protected Muslim town in Bosnia besieged by Serb forces throughout Bosnia's 1992-95 war. Serb troops led by Gen. Ratko Mladic overran the enclave in July 1995, separated men from women and executed 8,372 men and boys within days. Dutch troops stationed in Srebrenica as U.N. peacekeepers were undermanned and outgunned and failed to stop the slaughter.

Lined up: Bosnian Prime Minster Vjekoslav Bevanda (left), Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic (centre) and Bosnian Foreign Affairs Minister Zlatko Lagumdzija attend a ceremony at the Memorial Center in Potocari . In Washington, President Barack Obama issued a statement honoring the memory of the '8,000 innocent men and boys' massacred in Srebrenica. 'The name Srebrenica will forever be associated with some of the darkest acts of the 20th century,' Obama said, adding that the U.S. 'rejects efforts to distort the scope of this atrocity, rationalize the motivations behind it, blame the victims, and deny the indisputable fact that it was genocide.' In London, Prime Minister David Cameron said Srebrenica should never be forgotten or denied and called on the world to 'prevent such atrocities from taking place.' Mladic was arrested last year in Serbia and is on trial now at the tribunal in The Hague. He faces 11 charges, including genocide, for allegedly masterminding Serb atrocities throughout the war that left 100,000 dead, especially the Srebrenica massacre. He denies wrongdoing. Many Serbs still deny the Srebrenica genocide, including Serbia's newly inaugurated president, Tomislav Nikolic. Some of them view Mladic as a national hero.

Remembrance: People gather at the Potocari memorial complex near Srebrenica, some 160 kilometers east of Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina . 'Serbs believe he is an honorable and fair man,' said Bosnian Serb Novica Kapuran from the town of Pale, near Sarajevo. 'He is being blamed for something he has not done.' Tired of political speeches every year, the families of the victims allowed only Holocaust survivor Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Park East Synagogue in New York to address them during Wednesday's ceremony. 'Shalom, Salam,' Schneier greeted the crowd, addressing them as 'brothers and sisters.' He said the Srebrenica genocide was a crime against humanity but also a crime allowed by the rest of humanity. 'Silence is not a solution, it only encourages the perpetrators and ultimately it pays a heavy price in blood,' Schneier said. He reminded the audience that even today, the Syrian regime was killing its own people. '(It's time) for humanity to say in one clear voice: These crimes against people will end!' the rabbi declared. 'Here on this sacred day we say `Never again!' And we mean `Never again!' The crowd greeted his words with 'Allah Akbar,' or 'God is great' in Arabic.

A disgraced farmer has appeared in court after he was found to have kept a pack of shivering dogs feeding on rotting pig carcasses in squalid conditions. Animal welfare officials found collies caked in mud and fighting over the decomposing body of a dead pig on Leon Henry Smith's land in Okehampton, Devon. Smith, 62, who was already banned from keeping cattle and sheep for previous offences, kept 13 dogs in a filthy open wire pen. WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT . Squalid: Animal welfare inspectors found the collie dogs caked in mud and fighting over a dead pig (circled) Inspectors also found the remains of dead sheep were in a horse box, along with various animal bones scattered across the field. A judge sitting at Exeter Crown Court said he had 'grave concerns' about Smith's attitude to animal welfare. But he deferred sentence for six months to give the farmer time to improve the conditions in which the dogs are kept. Smith admitted failing to provide a suitable environment for the 13 collie dogs on February 14 last year. Filthy: The dogs were kept in a open wire pen and the remains of dead sheep were found in a horsebox . Foul: The shivering dogs were feeding on rotting pig carcasses when animal welfare officials found them . He pleaded guilty to a similar charge relating to nine of the dogs on February 16 last year and also admitted six offences of failing to dispose of pig remains and allowing them to be exposed to wild animals. Judge Barry Cotter QC said: 'Standards in relation to animal welfare vary. 'Some people treat their dogs better than humans but what we are concerned with here is something utterly different. 'We are concerned with minimum basic standards and these are immutable and unchanging. That is what you are required to provide. Poor animals: Inspectors found the dogs on Leon Henry Smith's land after receiving complaints from the public . 'Anyone sitting in my position is bound to have grave concerns about your attitude generally to animal welfare and your understanding of their basic needs. 'The defence may well say that these dogs were in your view in good health and had food - but you pleaded guilty because there was not an adequate environment for them faced with bad weather. 'That will simply not amount to an adequate excuse in the future, as it does not today.' The court heard that Devon County Council began an investigation into Smith's practices following complaints from members of the public. Sean Brunton, prosecuting, said Smith was convicted in 1998 of failing to dispose of animal by-products and in 1999 of welfare offences. He was banned from keeping sheep and cattle for five years. In 2008 he was convicted of both offences again, resulting in a second five-year ban - a prohibition which remains in force. Kelly Scrivener, defending, said Smith was determined to provide good conditions for his dogs and was keen for the RSPCA to take part in any future monitoring. Judge Cotter QC deferred sentence on all matters until November to give Smith the opportunity to improve conditions for the dogs. He claimed this would allow Smith to avoid a disqualification from keeping them in the future.","Collies were found caked in mud and fighting over a dead pig on Leon Henry Smith's land .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 01:24 EST, 6 June 2012 . A Peruvian court has ruled that convicted murderer Joran van der Sloot will be extradited to the U.S. to face trial allegedly linking him to the disappearance of Natalee Holloway. Not before, however, he has served his 28-year jail sentence in Peru for the murder of Stephany Flores. The decision by the Peruvian Supreme Court means that the family of Holloway, who disappeared in 2005 and has since been declared dead, will have to wait many more agonising years before they will see van der Sloot on trial. Jailed: Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot will face extradition to the U.S. for allegedly trying to extort money from Natalee Holloway's mother Beth . Convicted: Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years in prison in the murder of Stephany Flores . In the U.S., he is accused of trying . to extort $250,000 from Beth Holloway, Stephany's mother, to tell her where to find the . remains of her daughter, who was 18 when she disappeared in Aruba, a Dutch island in the southern Caribbean Sea. Prosecutors said $25,000 was paid to van der Sloot, but nothing was disclosed about Stephany's whereabouts. It . was thought that van der Sloot would be extradited to the U.S. to . participate in the trial before returning to begin his Peruvian . prison sentence. However, . the ruling is not all bad for the prosecution case against the Dutchman, . according to a leading international defense expert. 'There . is an upside because the U.S. now has several years to put together a . murder investigation. On murder, there is no statute of limitations,' Michael Griffith, senior partner at the International Legal Defense . Counsel, told the Huffington Post. Tale of two women: Stephany Flores, left, was murdered five years after Natalee Holloway, right, went missing in . Aruba. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in the Holloway case, but never . charged . 'Maybe . by the time he is released, [the U.S.] will have an airtight case . against him in Natalee Holloway's disappearance,' said Griffith. Legal . hurdles - including van der Sloot’s appeal for his Peru murder . conviction - have kept the process from going through immediately. The ruling on Friday came as some surprise to van der Sloot's lawyer. 'We were surprised by how quickly the . extradition request was heard,' Van der Sloot's attorney, Maximo Altez, . told Reuters. 'We think there is a lot of pressure from the U.S. government.' Altez had recently speculated he thought his client would be extradited within three months, and had believed the U.S. trial would go ahead before the Peruvian murder sentence. The ruling, however, may come as some relief to van der Sloot since Altez . said his client feared extradition because U.S. prisons have a reputation . for being 'very hard' on inmates. Taken away: Van der Sloot, centre, is seen escorted by police officers in Lima in this photo from June 2010, after his arrest for the murder of Stephany Flores . Authorities in the U.S. said they . believe the Dutchman used the money to travel to Peru on May 14, 2010, . where he was convicted of killing Stephany Flores, 21, a woman he met in . a Lima casino, on May 25. The date is a chilling one to the family of Natalee Holloway, from Mountain Brook, Alabama, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen. He . took cash and credit cards from Ms Flores before fleeing to Chile, . where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found. He confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after she found out about his suspected involvement in the Natalee Holloway case. Under Peru's penal system, van der Sloot could become eligible for parole after serving half of the sentence with good behaviour, including work and study. Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30, 2005, during a high school graduation trip to Aruba, where Van der Sloot grew up. Parents: David Holloway, left, is seen . during a hearing in Alabama, while Beth . Holloway, right, is pursued by reporters after a hearing after which . her daughter was officially declared dead . Her body was never found and repeated searches turned up nothing as intense media coverage brought the case worldwide attention. Investigators have long worked from the assumption that the young woman was dead in Aruba, where the case was classified as a homicide investigation. That investigation remains open, though there has been no recent activity, according to Solicitor General Taco Stein, an official with the prosecutor's office in Aruba. Before and after: Van der Sloot is seen left in a mugshot from 2010 and right at in a Peru court on in January .","Delay will give prosecution plenty of time to pull together 'airtight case'

The embattled top cop who faced a firestorm of outcry over his department's investigation of the Trayvon Martin shooting has been axed from his post. Chief Bill Lee had only been police chief in Sanford, Florida, for about a year, taking the position in April 2011 after nearly three decades as a deputy in the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte said in a statement on Wednesday that he fired Lee after determining 'the police chief needs to have the trust and respect of the elected officials and the confidence of the entire community.' Fired: Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, left, was fired by City Manager Norton Bonaparte, right, months after Lee came under fire for not arresting Zimmerman on the night of the shooting . Bonaparte added: 'We need to move forward with a police chief that all the citizens of Sanford can support. 'I have come to this decision in light of the escalating divisiveness that has taken hold of the city.' Sara Brady, a spokeswoman for the former chief, said Lee and Bonaparte met Wednesday morning to discuss his termination. She said: 'They had a discussion this morning, but the details were not worked out, and that is how it was left.' Lee had been on paid leave since March and even offered to quit in April, but the city council rejected his resignation by a 3-2 vote, mostly because the council wished to hold out for a Department of Justice review of the investigation of Trayvon Martin's death and his alleged killer. In May, Rick Myers took over as . Sanford's interim police chief, saying he wanted to heal the emotional . wounds caused by Martin's death. Killed: Trayvon Martin was 17 years old when he was shot dead on February 26 . Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, said they respect the city7 manager's decision. Their attorney, Benjamin Crump said: 'They remain vigilant in getting justice for their son and the tragedy that claimed his life.' Also on Wednesday, the desperate phone call of Tracy Martin in a desperate effort to find his son was revealed. From his girlfriend's home in a Sanford, Florida, gated community, Martin contacted a police non-emergency line on February 27 - the morning after Trayvon left the house for a nearby 7-Eleven but never returned. But what Tracy Martin didn’t know was that his son was dead, shot in the chest by George Zimmerman, who claimed he was acting in self-defence. Father and son: Tracy Martin, right, poses with his son Trayvon in this photo taken before the teenager was shot dead in Sanford, Florida . anguish: Tracy Martin is heard speaking calmly as he reported his son missing in a newly-released call to police . As the call was made, police were trying to identify the body of the 17-year-old, who had not been carrying identification. In audio obtained by NBC News through a Freedom of Information request, Tracy Martin speaks calmly: 'I need to file a missing persons report. It hasn’t really been 24 hours.' He added: 'But I'm from Miami. And my son’s up here with me. I’m in Sanford. He don’t know anybody up here.' He said that he last saw his son between 8 and 8:30 the night before. That was when Trayvon, who had been . watching the NBA All-Star Game at the home, left to pick up a drink and some . candy for his younger brother. Brawl: . Injuries to Zimmerman's face and head, combined with Trayvon Martin's . bloody knuckles, reveal that the two had been fighting prior to the shooting . When asked what his son might be wearing, he told the dispatcher that Trayvon had been wearing khaki shorts, a grey sweatshirt and Jordan Taylor shoes. As Martin walked back to his father's . girlfriend's home in Sanford, he was spotted by Zimmerman, a . neighbourhood watch volunteer who had become concerned with recent . burglaries in the area. Detained: Zimmerman remains jailed since he turned himself in after his bail was revoked . Zimmerman called 911 to report a suspicious person, telling the operator that the teenager looked like he 'was up to no good.' The . operator advised Zimmerman to stay in his truck and not follow the . person. But he, for unknown reasons, ignored her, saying: 'These . a**holes always get away.' Details . of what happened next remain sketchy, but a confrontation took place . between Zimmerman and Martin and the two began fighting. Zimmerman . claimed that he lost track of Martin and was returning to his truck . when the teen suddenly appeared and 'sucker-punched' him. As the two struggled, Zimmerman claims Martin saw the pistol he was carrying and reached for it. That was when Zimmerman drew the gun himself and shot him. The teen was not armed. He had only a can of Arizona Iced Tea and a bag of Skittlesr. According . to statements made by Martin’s girlfriend, who was on the phone with . the teen the night of February 26, his last words were: ‘Get off, get . off.’ His cell phone then cut off and Martin was shot, his girlfriend said in the interview with a prosecutor. Zimmerman was taken into custody by police but later released in accordance with Florida's 'stand your ground' law.

Deposed former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak's health has deteriorated sharply in prison with doctors needing to use a respirator five times to help him breathe. Mubarak, 84, began suffering health problems days after he was sentenced to life for failing to stop the killing of protesters in the uprising that unseated him last year. Security officials at Torah prison south of Cairo said he was suffering from shock and high blood pressure as well as breathing problems. Health crisis: Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is wheeled into court in Cairo during his trial last month. Doctors treating him in his jail cell needed to use a respirator five times after he began suffering breathing difficulties . Specialists were called in to examine him, and a transfer to a military hospital was being considered, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. Mubarak was sentenced to life on Saturday, but he and his two sons - one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa - were acquitted of corruption charges. The sons are also being held in Torah, awaiting a separate trial on charges of insider trading. The officials said prison authorities were allowing Gamal to be by his father's side. Alaa also applied for permission, but it has not yet been granted, the officials said. Location: Mubarak is being held at the Tora prison on the outskirts of Cairo. Specialists are now considering a transfer to a military hospital . Mubarak's authoritarian regime was widely unpopular, however conditions in Egypt have deteriorated since he was overthrow last year. The country has seen in a wave of deadly protests, a battered economy and seemingly endless strikes. Some evidence of displeasure over conditions could be seen in the second-place finish by Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, in the first round of presidential elections last month, ahead of more liberal candidates. Discontent: Demonstrators pack into in Cairo's Tahrir square to protest against verdicts given to Mubarak and his interior minister Habib al-Adly . Anger: Mubarak was sentenced to life on Saturday, but he and his two sons - one-time heir apparent Gamal and wealthy businessman Alaa - were acquitted of corruption charges . Shafiq is facing Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohammed Morsi in a runoff election June 16-17, but it could still be called off. Despite the anger felt towards the old regime Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, came in second in the first round of presidential elections last month, ahead of more liberal candidates . A spokesman for Egypt's highest court said it would look into whether a 'political exclusion' law is constitutional on June 14, two days before the runoff. The law bans senior officials who served in Mubarak's regime starting in 2001 from running for office. It applies to prime ministers, vice presidents and senior members of Mubarak's now-dissolved ruling party. If upheld, it could mean that Shafiq could not run - possibly forcing cancellation of the runoff and a repeat of the first round. Quoted by Egypt's official news agency, the spokesman, Maher Sami, did not say whether the Supreme Constitutional Court will issue its verdict on the same day. Sami, however, said the court's experts have prepared their report on the law, suggesting that a June 14 ruling is likely. Also to be considered by the court on June 14, according to Sami, is a ruling by a lower tribunal that ruled against the law that regulated recent parliamentary elections. If the ruling is upheld by the higher court, the elections would be declared illegal and the Islamist-dominated parliament would be dissolved.","Mubarak is serving life sentence for failing to stop the killing of protesters in the uprising that unseated him last year .

Revolt: Nick Clegg's plans to reform the House of Lords are being threatened by a group of Tory backbenchers . Rebel Conservative MPs are threatening the biggest revolt in the party’s history over Nick Clegg’s plans to replace the House of Lords with a mainly elected second chamber. A group of about 100 backbenchers, nicknaming themselves ‘The Sensibles’, are vowing to vote down the proposals, warning they will not hand the Liberal Democrats the balance of power in a reformed upper house in perpetuity. Downing Street sources concede they are expecting ‘blood on the walls, floor and ceiling’ over legislation which threatens to put Coalition relations under unprecedented strain. Several parliamentary private . secretaries, the most junior members of the Government, are considering . resigning rather than voting in favour. David Cameron insisted yesterday it was ‘time to make progress’ over bringing democracy to Parliament’s second chamber. The .

Members will be elected in tranches of 120 at each of the next three elections, with the process of change completed by 2025. They would serve a single 15-year term, and represent large, multi-member regional constituencies. Crucially . for the Lib Dems, they will be elected using a form of proportional . representation, which all but guarantees no party could ever hope for a . majority, meaning their influence will always be critical. Even . after it is reformed, the chamber will continue to be known as the . House of Lords – though its members will not be able to call themselves . ‘Lord’. After . suggestions they would be called senators, Members of the House of . Lords (MHLs) or Members of the Upper House (MUPs), Lord Strathclyde, the . Tory leader of the House of Lords said: ‘We are not calling them . senators at the moment – we are not actually calling them anything.’ Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘We have been discussing this issue for 100 years and it really is time to make progress. There . are opponents of Lords reform in every party. But there is a majority . in this House for a mainly-elected House of Lords and I believe there’s a . majority for that in the country. The . Prime Minister attacked Labour leader Ed Miliband as ‘hopeless’ for . saying he backed the reforms, but indicating Labour would vote against . on the basis that more time should be allowed to debate the legislation. The . Tories sent two ‘big beasts’ – Foreign Secretary William Hague and . Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke – onto the airwaves to try to rally . Tory support for the plans. However, Mr Clarke conceded there was . disagreement on almost every aspect of the Bill. He said: ‘There isn’t a . solid majority on almost any detail – bishops, electoral system.’ Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg said: ‘The Coalition stands on the brink of an historic achievement. ‘It . cannot be right that ordinary, hard-working people are expected to obey . laws that are created by people appointed entirely by birth or . patronage, who have a generous pay packet and a job for life. The time . for idle talk is finished. Now is the time for action.’ Big beasts: Foreign Secretary William Hague and Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke have been tasked with trying to rally Tory support for the plans . But Tory MP Conor Burns, parliamentary private secretary to Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, said he would join the Tory revolt even if he had to resign. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell added: ‘I didn’t get elected as a Tory MP to throw Margaret Thatcher out of the British parliament.’ Fellow Conservative Jesse Norman said the plans would mean that in Wales, every voter would have six elected politicians: their councillor, a local member of the Welsh Assembly, a list member of the Assembly, an MP, an MEP and a Senator. He said the Bill was a ‘total nonsense’ and he would ‘absolutely without any question’ vote against it. Sources close to the Prime Minister, who used to refer to Lords reform disparagingly as a ‘third term issue’ denied Conservative MPs were being given ‘a nod and a wink’ that they could rebel over Lords reform without suffering consequences. But one senior MP said when he told a party whip in charge of discipline that he intended to vote against, he was told: ‘Good.’","Group nicknaming themselves 'The Sensibles', will not accept Nick Clegg's plans to replace Lords with elected second chamber ."

Her long career was finally over. She wanted to soak up the moment as long as possible. The 45-year-old Torres came up short in her bid to make it to the Olympics for a sixth time. She finished fourth in the final of the 50-meter freestyle Monday night, her only event at the U.S. swimming trials. Sinking in: Dara Torres lingered in the water after the other swimmers had climbed out of the pool after the 50-meter freestyle qualifier race when she came in fourth place . Humbling: The 45-year-old mom waved to fans after she realized she would not make it to her sixth Olympic Games . 'This is really over. That's it, I'm going to enjoy some time with my daughter, have a nice summer and cheer on the U.S. team,’ Torres said. After winning three silver medals at the Beijing Olympics, Torres underwent radical knee surgery and put all her hopes into a chaotic dash from one end of the pool to the other. Those hopes were slashed when Jessica Hardy won in 24.50 seconds, while Kara Lynn Joyce took the other Olympic spot in 24.73. 'Obviously I was hoping to make the team,' Torres said. 'That was my goal and missing it by less than a tenth of a second is tough, but I don't think there's anything I could have changed.' Torres was denied a trip to London by nine-hundredths of a second, also touching behind third-place Christine Magnuson (24.78). Reading the score: Torres knew it was over when she saw her time (24.82) and noted it came in fourth . Congratulatory: Torres (left) praised her competitors Kara Lynn Joyce (top) who came in second and winner Jessica Hardy (bottom) who will both be going to the London games . Torres smiled when she saw her time (24.82) and hugged both Hardy and Joyce. When Torres finally got out, she began motioning for her daughter, 6-year-old Tessa, to join her. Torres walked into the stands, still dripping wet, and scooped up Tessa, who was wearing a green shirt that said 'Go Mom.' 'She's bummed she's not going to London now. I told her I'd still take her,’ Torres said of her daughter. In the last event of the eight-day trials, Andrew Gemmell won the grueling 1,500 freestyle in 14 minutes, 52.19 seconds. Connor Jaeger was right with him all the way, taking the second spot for London in 14:52.51. Torres said she had the same nervous anticipation before her last race as she did at her first U.S. trials in 1984, when she earned a spot in the Los Angeles Games. She had no illusions about being a serious medal contender in London, but she wanted to end her career with one more trip to the Olympics. 'Being 45, getting fourth in Olympic trials against girls almost half my age, it's OK,' Torres said. Support: Torres walked into the stands, still dripping wet, and scooped up her six-year-old daughter Tessa, who was wearing a green shirt that said 'Go Mom' 'I'm used to winning, but that wasn't the goal here. The goal was to try to make it. I didn't quite do it, but I'm really happy with how I did. I was able to hang in there.’ Torres remembered her late coach, Michael Lohberg, who died in 2011 from a rare blood disorder that was diagnosed just before she swam in Beijing. 'I was very emotional before my swim,' Torres said. End of an era: Torres has competed in five Olympics and won 12 medals during her expansive career . 'When I was putting my suit on with my trainer, Anne Tierney, we started crying because I started thinking about Michael. In July of 2010, he had said to me, “Let's go for this.” I really wanted to finish the story that I started with him. I didn't make it but I know he would have been proud.' Hardy said it was an honor to compete against Torres, who retired twice but came back to win five medals at the 2000 Sydney Games, then three more silvers in Beijing. This time, she's retiring for good. 'I love racing Dara,' the 25-year-old Hardy said. 'I wish she could have made it this year, but swimming with her the past couple years has been really an awesome treat for sure.' Hardy failed to qualify for the Olympics in her best event, the 100 breaststroke, but she bounced back to win the 100 and 50 freestyle, capping her comeback from a failed doping test that kept her off the team four years ago. An arbitration panel ruled that Hardy was the victim of a tainted supplement. 'Doing so well, winning two races here, I couldn't have predicted this in a million years,' Hardy said. 'I'm so happy and so grateful that this meet went as it did.' Joyce didn't even get out of the preliminaries of the 100 free, but she came back in the 50 free to make her third Olympic team. 'I didn't start out the meet very well,' Joyce said. 'I did my best to visualize and prepare my body. It  was my one chance to lay it all the line for this 50. I can't believe I did it.'",Bid to make Olympics for sixth time... and missed out by tenth of a second .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:20 EST, 10 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:00 EST, 11 May 2012 . While gay rights activists are lauding the President's public show of support for same-sex marriages, it has drawn and surprising apology and counter-intuitive criticism from some high-profile figures. Vice President Joe Biden reportedly met with Mr Obama in the Oval Office on Wednesday to apologize for essentially forcing the President's hand on the issue after he made his own demonstration of support earlier than the commander-in-chief. The same day, Mr Obama was the target of Republican ire for the move, including one such blast from the Bristol Palin. While her criticism is expected as she is the daughter of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, it was seemingly hypocritical for her to promote the need of fathers and mothers in children’s lives while she herself is raising her own son on her own and forbidding his father from seeing their child. Apology: Vice President Joe Biden met with Mr Obama on Wednesday to apologize for 'forcing his hand' on the same-sex marriage debate and turning it into a campaign issue before the White House wanted it to be . The meeting with Mr Biden was seen as an attempt to smooth tensions that were raised between the President and his Vice President after he spoke out on gay marriage without White House consent, leaving Obama aides deeply frustrated. Mr Biden's comments pushed gay marriage to the forefront of the presidential race and focused a fresh spotlight on Obama's vague position on the matter. The president, who once opposed gay marriage, had been saying for more than a year that his personal views were 'evolving.' In an interview with ABC News, Obama said he wasn't angry at Biden, though he thought the vice president had gotten 'a little bit over his skis' by voicing his support for gay marriage ahead of his boss. 'Would I have preferred to have done this in my own way, in my own terms, without I think, there being a lot of notice to everybody? Sure,' Obama said. 'But all's well that ends well.' Change of heart: President Barack Obama said he once thought civil unions were sufficient rights for gay couples, but he no longer believes that . The White House and Obama's presidential campaign at first tried to play down Biden's remarks, insisting that the vice president had gone no further in support of equal rights for same-sex couples. But gay rights advocates latched onto Biden's remarks, which occurred on Friday during a taping of an interview that aired on Sunday, declaring him the highest-ranking U.S. official to support gay marriage. By Tuesday morning, the president came to the conclusion that he couldn't stay silent on the issue any further. The White House hastily arranged a television interview with ABC News for Wednesday, during which Obama explained to the public that he had decided it was important for him to 'affirm that same-sex couples should be able to get married.' In response, Bristol Palin took to her blog to lambast the move, claiming that a child needs a mother and father - even though she is a single mother. 'We know that in general kids do better growing up in a mother/father home,' the daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote on her blog. 'Ideally, fathers help shape their kids’ worldview.' Despite this lecture, she has largely raised her three-year-old son Tripp on her own, after splitting with his father Levi Johnston three months after the birth. Criticism: Bristol Palin has criticsed Obama for supporting gay marriage, saying a child needs a mother and a father. She split with Levi Johnston, right, the father of her son Tripp, left, three months after he was born . 'He’s seen Tripp twice in the past four months,' she told In Touch magazine in a recent interview. 'He once went an entire year without seeing him at all.' It comes a day after the president endorsed same-sex marriage in an interview with ABC News. Many deemed the move as a political calculation for his re-election campaign as it draws a clear distinction between himself and Republican Mitt Romney, who opposes gay marriage. 'At a certain point I’ve just . concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and . affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married,' the . president said. Obama said his daughters and their friends were a major reason he changed his mind about gay marriage - a factor that Bristol Palin ridiculed in her blog. 'Malia and Sasha, they have . friends whose parents are same-sex couples,' he said on Wednesday. Historic: President Barack Obama is the first sitting US President to publicly support gay marriage. President George W Bush opposed it and President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage act into law . 'There have been times where . Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we’re . talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it . wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be . treated differently. 'It doesn’t make sense to them and frankly, that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.' Palin objected: 'While it’s great to listen to your kids’ ideas, there’s also a time when dads simply need to be dads. 'It . would’ve been helpful for him to explain to Malia and Sasha that while . her friends parents are no doubt lovely people, that’s not a reason to . change thousands of years of thinking about marriage.' She . continued: 'Sometimes . dads should lead their family in the right ways of thinking. It . would’ve been nice if the President would’ve been an actual leader and . helped shape their thoughts instead of merely reflecting what many . teenagers think after one too many episodes of Glee.' While . Palin has been quick to criticise the president, many others have come . out in support of his historic endorsement of same-sex marriage. Ellen . DeGeneres, who has been married to actress Portia de Rossi for nearly . four years, branded the move 'brave' during a taping of her talk show. 'There . have been moments in history when someone has had the courage to stand . up for what they believe in and that one action changes everything, I . hope this is one of those times,' she said. 'It . takes a brave man to take a stand like this, especially in an election . year so to you Mr President I say thank you very, very much.' Other celebrities have applauded the move, including gay stars Neil Patrick Harris and Ricky Martin. During his speech, Obama claimed the change is a personal one only, and that he still believes . the issue of gay marriage should be left up to the states to each decide. Currently, six states allow gay couples to wed and 30 states have constitutional amendments explicitly banning it. It appears that the president is . banking on the issue, which is heavily supported by younger Americans, . to mobilize the youth vote, which has become disaffected during his term . in office. Obama had long . been suspected of supporting gay marriage, but was thought to be afraid . to make it public because of the political backlash. But he had been under intense pressure . to clarify his view toward gay marriage after Vice President Joe Biden . publicly supported it on Sunday. 'I am absolutely comfortable with the . fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and men . and women marrying are entitled to the same exact rights, all the . civil rights, all the civil liberties. Family affair: Obama said his decision was swayed by his daughters Sasha and Malia, who have friends with gay parents. Palin said he should not listen to his children but he should be a 'leader shaping their views' 'And quite frankly, I don’t see . much of a distinction beyond that,' Biden said on Meet the Press. 1996, running for Illinois State Senate: 'I favor legalizing same-sex marriages,and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.' 2004, running for US Senate in Illinois: 'My religious faith dictates marriage is between a man and a woman, gay marriage is not a civil right.' 2008, running for US President: 'I believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman. As a Christian it's also a sacred union.' 2010, after Republican wave election: 'My feelings with this are constantly evolving, I struggle with this.' 2012, running for reelection: 'I think same sex couples should be able to get married.' Obama has famously flip-flopped on the issues. Since 2004, he has opposed gay marriage, saying his beliefs were based on his Christian faith. He signaled that he was . open to changing his opinion on gay marriage in 2010 when he said his . feelings on the issues were 'evolving.' 'I struggle with this,' he famously said. But, this isn't the first time Obama has changed in mind on the issue. In . 1996, as an Illinois State Senate candidate, he told a gay newspaper in . Chicago that he was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and 'would . fight efforts to prohibit such marriages.' Now, he seems to be making an election-year political gamble by directly . challenging Mitt Romney, his Republican opponent in November. Before the president's remarks today, Romney re-affirmed his opposition to gay marriage. 'I do not favor . marriage between people of the same gender and I don't favor civil . unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name,' he told . KDVR-TV in Denver. Thanks: Ellen DeGeneres, along with other celebrities, thanked Obama for the move, which she called 'brave' Last week, Romney's spokesman for foreign policy, Richard Grenel, quit the campaign after he came under fire from some conservatives for being openly gay. Recent . polls show 50 percent of Americans support gay marriage, but also . reveal that the 45 percent who oppose it have strong convictions.

Two former dictators who oversaw the systematic stealing of babies from political prisoners in Argentina 30 years ago have been sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison. The convictions of Rafael Videla and Reynaldo Bignone has been seen as a big step in Argentina's effort to punish the human rights abuses of that era, although authorities say it is certainly not the last. At least 17 other major cases are before judges or are nearing trial. 'Historic day': Former Argentine dictators Rafael Videla (left) and Reynaldo Bignone (right) have been sentenced to 50 years and 15 years in prison respectively for the systematic thefts of babies from political prisoners . Among them is a 'mega-trial' involving the Navy Mechanics School, which became a feared torture center as the 1976-1983 military junta kidnapped and killed 13,000 opponents while trying to annihilate an armed leftist uprising. That case involves 65 defendants, nearly 900 victims, more than 100 witnesses and about 60,000 pages of evidence. A 'Never Again' commission formed shortly after Argentina's democracy was restored in 1983 documented thousands of crimes against humanity during the military regime, but hardly any of the violators were prosecuted until the late Nestor Kirchner was elected president 20 years later. Justice Minister Julio Alak said Thursday that Kirchner's wife and successor, President Cristina Fernandez, deserves credit for making the human rights cases a cornerstone of government. Sentenced: The former military leaders in court to hear their punishments after going on trial earlier this year for atrocities committed during the late 70s and early 80s . 'It's unthinkable that in a state of . law, the murderers of the people could be in any place but prison,' Alak . said after the verdicts were read. Videla, 86, was sentenced to 50 years in prison, while the 84-year-old Bignone got 15 years for their roles in the baby thefts. The . prison time is symbolic, though, because both men have been behind bars . for years following multiple convictions and life sentences for other . crimes against humanity. Seven . of their co-defendants were also convicted on charges involving the . theft of 34 babies, while two people were acquitted by a three-judge . panel. Despite the jailing . of Videla and Bignone, most people who have been convicted of rights . violations during the dictatorship remain free on appeal and many others . have yet to stand trial. Dictators: Videla (left) and Bignone . (right) during their time in charge of Argentina. Tens of thousands of . people vanished during their regime . Sworn in: Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla (centre) takes an oath as President in March 1976 . According . to a March tally by Argentina's independent Center for Legal and Social . Studies, a total of 1,861 defendants have been named in cases of state . terror, but verdicts were reached for only 17 per cent of them - with 92 . per cent of those found guilty. Since . the trials began in 2006, at least 65 have resulted in sentences, but . only seven of these have exhausted an appeals process that takes more . than two years on average. Still, . Thursday's verdicts were a cause for celebration outside the federal . courthouse in Buenos Aires, where activists watched them being announced . on a huge television screen. 'This . is an historic day. Today legal justice has been made real - never . again the justice of one's own hands, which the repressors were known . for,' prominent rights activist Tati Almeida said. The . baby thefts set Argentina's military regime apart from all the other . juntas that ruled in Latin America at the time. Videla and other . military and police officials were determined to remove any trace of the . armed leftist guerrilla movement they said threatened the country's . future. Argentine President Jorge Rafael Videla (center) after he had presented the World Cup Trophy to Argentine's captain Daniel Passarella (number 19) in 1978 . Many pregnant . women detained as dissidents were 'disappeared' shortly after giving . birth in clandestine maternity wards, and their babies were handed over . to families trusted by military officials. In . his testimony, Videla denied there was any systematic program for . stealing babies, and accused prisoners of using their unborn children as . 'human shields' in their fight against the state. He . called himself a 'political prisoner,' labeled the trial a farce and . characterized his sentence as revenge by people who after being defeated . militarily now occupy positions in the government. Despite this, Videla said, he would accept his sentence 'in protest, as an act of service,' and with a clear conscience. Witnesses during the trial included former U.S. diplomat Elliot Abrams. He . was called to testify after a long-classified memo describing his . secret meeting with Argentina's ambassador was made public at the . request of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group . whose evidence-gathering efforts were key to the prosecution. The Mothers of the Disappeared group protest for their missing familiy members during the first March of the Resistance against the Argentine dictatorship . Abrams . testified from Washington that he secretly urged that Bignone reveal . the stolen babies' identities as a way to smooth Argentina's return to . democracy. 'We knew . that it wasn't just one or two children,' Abrams testified, suggesting . that there must have been some sort of directive from a high level . official - 'a plan, because there were many people who were being . murdered or jailed.' No . reconciliation effort was made. Instead, Bignone ordered the military . to destroy evidence of 'dirty war' activities, and the junta denied any . knowledge of baby thefts, let alone responsibility for the . disappearances of political prisoners. The U.S. government also revealed little of what it knew as the junta's death squads were eliminating opponents. The . Grandmothers have since used DNA evidence to help 106 people who were . stolen from prisoners as babies recover their true identities, and 26 of . these cases were part of this trial. Many were raised by military . officials or their allies, who falsified their birth names, trying to . remove any hint of their leftist origins. The . rights group estimates as many as 500 babies could have been stolen in . all, but the destruction of documents and passage of time make it . impossible to know for sure. The . trial featured gut-wrenching testimony from relatives who searched . inconsolably for their missing children, and from people who learned as . young adults that they were raised by some of the very people involved . in the disappearance of their birth parents. The . other seven defendants convicted and sentenced Thursday included former . Adm Antonio Vanek, 40 years; former marine Jorge 'Tigre' Acosta, 30; . former Gen Santiago Omar Riveros, 20; former navy prefect Juan Antonio . Azic, 14; and Dr Jorge Magnacco, who witnesses said handled some of the . births, 10. Former . Capt Victor Gallo and his ex-wife Susana Colombo were sentenced to 15 . and five years in jail, respectively, after their adopted son, now going . by his birth name Francisco Madariaga, testified against them.","Rafael Videla, 86, sentenced to 50 years behind bars .

The senior commander said it would take ‘divine intervention’ for the hardline group to recapture Kabul. But he said Taliban chiefs could not admit this weakness because it would harm the morale of their fighters - raising the prospect that more British blood will be shed on the battlefield before combat troops withdraw in 2014. Defeat: Insurgents will not win the war in Afghanistan warns a senior Taliban leader . In an extraordinary interview with the New Statesman, the veteran also launches a withering attack on al-Qaeda, branding the jihadists a ‘plague’. ‘At least 70 per cent of the Taliban are angry at al-Qaeda,’ said the former Guantánamo Bay inmate. ‘Our people consider al-Qaeda to be a plague that was sent down to us by the heavens. ‘To tell the truth, I was relieved at the death of Osama [bin Laden]. Through his policies, he destroyed Afghanistan. If he really believed in jihad he should have gone to Saudi Arabia and done jihad there, rather than wrecking our country.’ The Taliban commander - identified only as Mawlvi in the interview - was speaking to Michael Semple, a former UN envoy to Kabul who had maintained strong contacts with the radical group. Despite the insurgents pumping out triumphalist rhetoric about their successes against coalition forces, Mawlvi said the only way forward for the group is to come to a political agreement with opponents. Shocking: A video clip of a Taliban soldier gunning down a woman sparked international outrage this week . Fury: Afghan women hold banners and placards during a protest against the execution of the unnamed Afghan woman by Taliban militants . He said: ‘The Taliban capturing Kabul is a very distant prospect. ‘Any Taliban leader expecting to be able to capture Kabul is making a grave mistake. ‘Nevertheless, the leadership also knows that it cannot afford to acknowledge this weakness. ‘To do so would undermine the morale of Taliban personnel. The leadership knows the truth – that they cannot prevail over the power they confront. ‘It would take some kind of divine intervention for the Taliban to win this war.’ The Taliban, he said, had shelved its vision of re-establishing the Islamic emirate it set up when in power from 1996 to 2001. This regime banned women from education, carried out thousands of executions as rough justice and outlawed eating lobster, even though Afghanistan has no coastline. Cost of war: A total of 422 UK troops have been killed since the conflict began in 2001 . ‘Any side involved in a conflict like . this has decided to fight for power,’ he said. ‘If they fall short of . national power, they have to settle for functioning as an organised . party within the country.’ Mr . Semple said speaking unofficially allowed Mawlvi to stray from the . Taliban’s ‘party line’ and reflect the views of its pragmatic wing. This, he said, was a sign that the group wanted to re-open talks with the U.S. However, only a few days ago video footage was released depicting the unwavering brutality of the Taliban, executing a woman for adultery. She was machinegunned in cold blood because two commanders could not decide who should ‘own’ her. Mawlvi’s suggestion that the Taliban could be open to dialogue was welcomed by Western politicians with former Foreign Secretary David Miliband calling the commander’s comments a ‘landmark’ moment. ‘The candour and clarity of the remarks about al-Qaeda, Nato and the Afghan government show we are dealing with a sophisticated and long-term presence,’ he said.

The study at the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry at Plymouth University is a blow to hopes that the drug could provide long-term benefits for patients with the debilitating nerve disease. Despite promising signs in earlier, shorter studies, researchers found patients who took capsules containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a key active ingredient in cannabis, fared no better than those given a placebo. Damning research: Cannabis does not slow the progression of multiple sclerosis, a large-scale study has concluded . The trial involved 493 people with progressive MS at 27 centres around the UK and began in 2006. Participants took either THC capsules or placebo for three years. In the study known as Cupid - cannabinoid use in progressive inflammatory brain disease - MS patients were assessed on both a disability scale administered by neurologists and another based on their own reporting. Lead researcher John Zajicek said: 'Overall the study found no evidence to support an effect of THC on MS progression in either of the main outcomes.' The results from the study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council, were presented at the Association of British Neurologists' annual meeting in Brighton today. The research is a blow to hopes that the drug could provide long-term benefits for patients with the debilitating nerve disease . Cannabis contains more than 60 different cannabinoids, of which THC is thought to be the most active, and many MS patients have long said the drug helps them cope with the effects of the disease. Drug companies, too, have been interested in cannabis as a medicine. Soon after he turned 40, Stephen, from Suffolk, was diagnosed with MS. Some five years later, separated from his wife, wheelchair-bound and re-housed in a bungalow, he was put on cannabis-based drug Sativex. ‘So far I’ve taken it for six months. It looks like a breath freshener. I spray one burst under my tongue up to 15 times a day, from half an hour before I get up to just before I go to bed. It is alcohol-based, tastes unpleasantly bitter and is absorbed through the mouth’s lining within 30 minutes. ‘It gives me relief from pain so I can relax or focus enough to make decisions. Though I’m in a wheelchair, it’s nothing like the limitations caused by continual intense pain. In fact, it’s been so effective that I’ve stopped using painkillers. ‘Cannabis has given me back my quality of life. It has aided my sleep, which means I am less irritable and depressed. It has improved my eyesight and allows me to control my bladder and bowel more easily. ‘I’ve been able to sit at a computer and use voice-activated software. Because it relaxes the body, it reduces the spasticity so I can even use an exercise bike. ‘Because of Sativex, I’m able to walk Oscar the dog in my wheelchair twice a day.’ GW Pharmaceuticals, working with Bayer and Almirall, recently started selling an under-the-tongue cannabis spray called Sativex to relieve spasticity.. David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the latest research, said the study's failure did not mean cannabis had no role in helping MS patients. He said: 'It would be wrong to interpret these preliminary findings to mean that cannabis does not achieve its licensed use. 'Cannabis is not licensed for limiting disease progression, it is licensed for dealing with spasticity and pain.' Professor Zajicek's study did find some evidence to suggest a beneficial effect in less disabled patients, but because this was seen in only a small group of people it was unclear how strong the effect was. The overall study population also experienced slower disease progression than had been expected, making it more challenging to detect any treatment effect, the researchers added. MS is a disease in which immune system cells destroy the myelin sheath that protects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common type is relapsing remitting MS, affecting around 85 per cent of patients at the time of diagnosis. Several drugs are available to treat this stage of the disease, including injections of beta-interferons and a new pill from Novartis called Gilenya. Secondary progressive MS comes later and involves a sustained build up of disability.","Researchers found patients who took capsules containing THC, a key active ingredient in cannabis, fared no better than those given a placebo .

Rebel: Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West, has vowed to join those voting against a policy for Lords reform, despite the fact it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide . David Cameron is braced for a crushing defeat tonight on House of Lords reform. Up to 70 Tories are expected to rebel against a policy that tops the wish-list of their Liberal Democrat coalition partners. One of them, Conor Burns told the Mail he will join them even though it will cost him his job as a ministerial aide. ‘When I asked the Prime Minister recently why on earth we were going to bring in this bill, he replied simply: “It’s the only thing Nick Clegg asked for in the Queen’s Speech”,’ Mr Burns said. Downing Street is expecting the Government’s first Commons defeat, pitching the two parties of the Coalition into turmoil. Mr Clegg was heckled by Tory MPs last night as he attacked opponents of elected peers ‘whatever the century’. The Lib Dem leader suggested the Government might agree to fresh Commons votes to approve further stages of reform after the first tranches of peers are elected in 2015. But as 70 Tories broke cover yesterday to say they would rebel, one senior Conservative said it would be better for the legislation to suffer a heavy defeat than a narrow one. A big loss would put Mr Cameron under intense pressure to tell Mr Clegg the plan must be abandoned. The key vote this evening is on the timetable for the legislation, which the Government wants to limit to ten days of debate. A defeat would mean months of open-ended Parliamentary debate on the issue, snarling up other Government business. Tory stalwart Nicholas Soames, who has defied his party only once in three decades, said the bill was a ‘constitutional catastrophe’ that ‘must be defeated at all costs’. Mr Burns, a ministerial aide to Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson, said the proposal to abolish the Lords and replace it with a mainly elected second chamber was an act of ‘constitutional vandalism’. Split: David Cameron is braced for defeat over the House of Lords reform policy championed by Nick Clegg . He claimed the Prime Minister’s private remarks about the reason for pressing ahead with the legislation showed it was a ‘Liberal Democrat obsession’. ‘But it is also a distraction for Parliament from important debate and an irrelevance to the British people. I will be proud to vote against it,’ he added. Mr Burns wrote last night to Mr Cameron and the Government’s chief whip Patrick McLoughlin informing them of his intentions and inviting them to sack him. Number 10 said any member of the Government voting against or abstaining in tonight’s vote would lose their job. At least one other parliamentary private secretary is expected to quit, with half a dozen more harbouring serious doubts. Under the Government’s plans, the . House of Lords, which will soon have 1,000 appointed and hereditary . members, will be transformed into a democratic chamber over 15 years. Members . will be elected in three tranches at the next three general elections, . using a system of proportional representation designed to ensure no . party wins an overall majority. 'Constitutional catastrophe': Tory stalwart Nicholas Soames, who has defied his party only once in three decades, said the bill 'must be defeated at all costs' By 2025, there will be 450 members serving single 15-year terms. Eighty per cent will be elected and 20 per cent appointed by an independent commission. Pro-reform ministers say it is high time to end the culture of cronyism which means parties appointing failed MPs, ex-ministers and donors to an unelected second house. But Mr Burns insisted the proposals would produce a second chamber of Parliament ‘with a new phalanx of politicians chosen from lists selected by the political parties and their ever-diminishing memberships’. ‘The quality of the debate in the Lords is enriched by the presence of captains of industry, retired senior civil servants and military figures, people from the arts and voluntary sectors, diplomats and bishops,’ he added. ‘Many are figures who would never contemplate standing for political office on a party ticket. It seems obvious to me that Parliament would be worse off if we swapped this for 400 party placemen.’ He warned there would be ‘no stopping’ an elected Lords challenging the supremacy of the Commons. ‘I have told the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip I cannot support the Bill. In all probability, this will mean that I have to give up my job. But it is too important to stop this act of constitutional vandalism to put career before principle.’ Mr Clegg insisted Britain was the only country in the world, other than Lesotho, that has a second parliamentary chamber that is appointed rather than elected. ‘There is neither accountability nor legitimacy in the status quo. Surely it is time to trust the British people,’ Mr Clegg told MPs. Conservative constitutional reform minister Mark Harper urged fellow Tories to realise that Labour – which says it will vote against the Government’s timetable, but support the legislation later – was trying to damage the Coalition. But Baroness Boothroyd of Sandwell, former speaker of the Commons, urged rebels to  wreck the bill. ‘I have never witnessed such a reckless attempt to change the British constitution and to do it on such spurious grounds,’ she said. Every time Nick Clegg dealt with one . bunch of enemy insurgents, another lot sprouted elsewhere. I say ‘enemy’ insurgents, but in fact they were on his own side of the Chamber: . Tories pinging curried devilment at this gulpy, scratchy-voiced deputy . PM. Coalition-on-Coalition . fire. Here, Cleggy, catch this fizzing hand grenade. ‘I am very . grateful to my Rt Hon Friend... ka-BOOM!’ Mr . Clegg opened the second reading debate of the House of Lords Reform . Bill at 3.38pm. By 3.40 the first wave of Tory mujihadeen came screaming . over the horizon: Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills) and Peter . Lilley (Hitchin & Harpenden). Mr Clegg played the eeh-bah-gum card, . trying to claim that not enough peers come from the north-east of . England. He also felt that peers were too old. That’s a bit ageist, . isn’t it? Reforms: The Government plans would see appointed and hereditary peers transformed over 15 years into a democratic chamber . A friend of mine once had lunch with . China’s Deng Xiaopeng (who kept gobbing with astonishing accuracy into a . distant spittoon).

Instantly, more Tory . backbenchers were up, hollering and waving their shields. Clifton-Brown, . Tredinnick, Norman, Mistress Main, Griffiths. These warriors and others . hopped and wailed. Mr Tredinnick’s voice was so high, you wondered if . he had submitted to the surgeon’s snip. While Mr Clegg tried to provide . answers, Steve Brine (Con, Winchester) stared bleakly at the ceiling.

Only 25 were on parade. Of these, . not all of them were necessarily ardent fans. Chris Huhne (Eastleigh) put in a rare appearance. He rotated his ankle and wore a dazzling . smile. Bliss for him. The Cleggster was just about managing to keep his . chin above the waters, despite the hoo-hah (Labour MPs were asking . sceptical questions, too). John Redwood (Con, Wokingham) attacked Mr . Clegg’s policy from directly behind his right shoulder. Next to Mr . Redwood sat Anne McIntosh (Con, Thirsk & Malton), shaking her head . in full camera view. David Davis (Con, Haltemprice & Howden) was . loving it. Lib Dem minister Lynne Featherstone looked as though she . might start to cry. Mr . Clegg claimed that Sir Winston Churchill supported Lords reform. Churchill’s grandson Nicholas Soames (Con, Mid Sussex) rose to offer a . more considered view. Mr Soames was genuinely irked. He said Churchill . had altered his view as he matured. The subtext here, unless I am . mistaken, was: you’ll grow out of this fetish, Clegg. The . House relished the Soames intervention. Mr Clegg tried to cite past . Labour support for his policy, only for Margaret Beckett (Lab, Derby S), . so gnarled a Comrade that she may once have taken dictation from Keir . Hardie, to correct him. Now yet more Tories were on their feet: Dineage, . Burns, Bridgen, Rees-Mogg. For Mr Clegg it must have been like trying . to drive a car packed with squabbling family members. Why . is he insisting on this Bill? Easy. Lib Dems in future have little hope . of making it to Parliament unless the Lords is fixed on a PR basis.Edward . Leigh (Con, Gainsborough) suggested Clegg’s Lords would be full of . failed politicians. Mr Clegg: ‘No. They’ll be a different kind of . politician.’ The House hooted, Oliver Heald (Con, . NE Herts) clapping with delight. Pete Wishart (SNP, Perth) asked if Mr . Clegg and his Lib Dems would refuse appointment to an unreformed Lords. Answer came there none. For .

"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:50 EST, 15 June 2012 . Scientists say modern relationships are partly to blame, picture posed by model . The stress of family breakdown could be to blame for girls starting puberty at the age of ten, according to scientists. The average age at which girls start growing breast tissue has fallen over the past 15 years and it usually begins when they are still at primary school. This is thought to be caused by a hormone imbalance, which  in turn has been linked to a number of factors, including rising levels of obesity. However, experts are increasingly concerned that the strain of modern relationships may also be a key factor. Professor Richard Sharpe, of Edinburgh University said the trend towards broken families and absent fathers could be triggering the hormone imbalance. He said long-term stress could also be caused by the higher expectations put on girls to achieve at school and fit in with the crowd. Studies have shown breast development – the first sign of puberty – begins on average at the age of ten, which is five years earlier than during the 19th century. Doctors say the risks of this include premature sexualisation of young girls and teenage pregnancy. It is also linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in later life. Professor Sharpe, group leader at the Centre for Reproductive Health, told the Cheltenham Science Festival yesterday: ‘We are seeing early puberty in situations which we would deem stressful for girls, for example being adopted or growing up without their biological father in the house. 'There may be a stepfather or the child is having to live in two homes. That is all somewhat stressful and it is much more common nowadays than it was. Higher levels of child obesity is another key factor identified as a reason to earlier onset puberty . ‘It may even be that it is all the expectations of the modern world on girls, because there’s been a radical change in what their expectations are.’ Two years ago a study by US researchers found girls of all backgrounds whose fathers had left home were 2.4 times as likely to develop breasts at a younger age. Many began at nine and some as young as seven, according to a study of 440 girls by the University of California Berkeley. One explanation is to do with overproduction of the male hormone androgen – which girls naturally produce during puberty – but could be produced in higher quantities and earlier due to stress. Professor Sharpe said that researchers are looking at ‘societal factors’ to explain why breast development is getting earlier, while menstruation is not. Breast tissue and body hair are the first stages of puberty, followed by menstruation, but the average age for girls to start their period has been 12-and-a-half since the 1960s. Professor Sharpe said it was difficult to establish exactly how different hormones were interacting to trigger early breast development. Dr Tabitha Randell, of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, also speaking at the festival, said: ‘We need to help parents deal with the physical and psychological consequences of early puberty which are very serious and can very distressing for the child. ‘There is a strong link with early onset of sexual activity when they are not emotionally ready, and with teenage pregnancy for which already have the highest level in Europe.’","Broken homes, stress and obesity behind girls entering puberty earlier than ever .

Giant TV screens have helped to bring families back together in the living room, new research suggests. Ofcom's Communications Market Report found that despite competing challenges for recreational time, the time people spent watching television has actually gone up. British viewers spent an average of four hours each day watching TV in 2011, up from 3.6 hours in 2002. Meanwhile, in the first quarter of this year, more than 35 per cent of TV sets sold were at least 33in in size. Happy family: Big televisions are luring the children back to the living room, a new report by media regulator Ofcom suggests . James Thickett, Ofcom's director of research, said larger and flatter TV screens appeared to be bringing children back into the living room, reversing a trend which saw them watching a separate set in their bedroom. 'Television viewing has been robust between 2002 and 2011,' he said. 'What's interesting here is that with all these new technologies being adopted by 16 to 24-year-olds and to some extent children, we're not seeing TV viewing among those age groups falling. 'It's always been lower than average for the younger age groups because they have different lifestyles and less time at home. But we're not seeing a major impact on TV viewing by all this extra adoption and use of new technology. 'At the same time we are seeing an increase in viewing among the older age groups.' Some 40 per cent of households had only one TV set in 2011, compared to 35 per cent in 2002. In 2011, individuals watched around 209 minutes of TV on their main set each day, compared to 187 minutes on a main set in 2002. 'One of the things that has helped drive strong TV viewing figures is the evolution of television technology,' Mr Thickett added. 'In the past 10 years we have seen the development of widescreen television, HD television, screens getting flatter and very importantly screens are getting bigger... 'What this is doing is actually bringing people back into the living room and television is taking on a new role as a family experience whereas 10 years ago, in the early 2000s, we were seeing kids, different members of the family watching different television shows in different rooms using different sets. 'The quality of the TV viewing experience has improved, the choice of channels has improved. 'We've now got new technologies like digital video recorders that are improving the television experience. We believe that has all helped to maintain television viewing at around four hours a day.' He said that if younger members of the family did watch different shows, they now tended to use a laptop rather than a different set. 'Kids are now more likely to watch stuff on their computer or on their laptop through the iPlayer rather than go up and watch television,' he said. 'The proportion of digitally enabled second TV sets is relatively low compared to the proportion of analogue TV sets say 10 years ago. 'They're not replacing their TVs in their bedrooms. They're relying on laptops or different screens. We're not going to see that mass adoption of TV screens all around the house.' Glued: In 2011, individuals watched around 209 minutes of TV on their main set each day, compared to 187 minutes on a main set in 2002 . While TV watching has remained stable, the long-term radio listening trend has gone down. In 2011, UK adults spent 22.5 hours a week listening to the radio, down from 24 hours in 2001. But the figure was up by 24 minutes on 2010. Among 15- to 24-year-olds, the long-term downwards listening trend was even more pronounced, by 22 per cent compared with 2001. BBC Radio 4 Extra was the most popular digital-only station, reaching 1.5 million listeners in the first quarter of 2012. Mr Thickett said: 'There has been a gradual decline in listening, being driven primarily by the younger age group. 'While they have remained pretty consistent with their TV viewing their radio viewing has gone down significantly. 'In the future we're likely to see these trends continuing.'","British viewers spend an average 4 hours a day in front of the box - up from 3.6 hours in 2002 .

A woman with a rare condition that means she collapses every time she laughs fears she may have passed the rare illness onto her young son. Kelly Timson cannot visit a comedy show or even go to the pub with her friends as every time she laughs, she collapses in a literal fit of giggles. She suffers from a rare neurological condition called cataplexy which means her body goes into a state of total paralysis in response to strong emotions such as amusement, surprise, anger and even love. Inherited? Kelly Timson has both cataplexy and narcolepsy (right). Her younger son Ronnie is undergoing tests after experiencing a fit a few weeks ago . Just gazing in motherly admiration at her two young children Charlie, five, and Ronnie, two, brings on an attack leaving Kelly totally unable to move or speak. Often, she finds herself collapsed in a heap on the floor having injured herself on the way down and once she nearly suffocated after landing face-down on the sofa.  She suffers up to 20 cataplexy attacks a day and has to have her mother or brother around her all the time in case she collapses. She also suffers from the related condition narcolepsy which means she randomly falls asleep throughout the day, no matter what she is doing. Limits: Kelly can never have a bath alone as she could have an attack and drown . Kelly, 25, from Ashford, Kent, said: . 'I've lost count of the number of times I've fallen asleep face down in . my dinner. I can't even go to a restaurant with my boyfriend in case I . nod off at the table. It's so embarrassing. 'Once . I had an attack of cataplexy in the supermarket and then another and . another. I must have had about 20 in a row and I think people must have . thought I was drugged or drunk. Every time I stood up, I collapsed . again. 'When I have an . attack, I can see and hear but I can't move or communicate at all. It . can last a few seconds or it can last for an hour. 'The . worst times are when there is no one around. I might be laid on the . floor, completely paralysed and the boys will be pulling all the food . out of the cupboards and there's nothing I can do. That's why I don't . like to be left alone with the boys in case anything happens to me or . them.' Kelly first noticed the narcolepsy when she was 16 and would fall asleep suddenly in front of the television or while sat on the sofa, even after a long night's sleep. Her condition worsened over time until the point where she never knew where she might nod off.Kelly said: 'I would be in the middle of eating my dinner and I would just fall asleep or I would fall asleep in the bath. 'I used to work on a dunking doughnuts kiosk as a teenager and once I fell asleep while I was frothing some milk for a cappuccino, which is impressive when you think of the noise those machines make. I just fell asleep standing up and I was lucky I didn't burn myself on it. 'Eventually I saw a consultant who diagnosed me with narcolepsy and gave me some medication.' Then, at the age of 19, she fell pregnant with Charlie and everything changed.  Suddenly, Kelly would find herself going limp and heavy while she was holding her new baby. Her head would become heavy and loll to one side and her arms would flop to her sides. She said: 'I would have to call to my mum to come quickly and grab Charlie off me in case I dropped him. 'I would just be looking at him and thinking how much I loved him and then all of a sudden my arms would go floppy. 'I was really worried because I was terrified of hurting him.' Over time, Kelly found her attacks were becoming more frequent and more severe, causing her to become completely paralysed and unable to speak whenever she had one. In 2007, she was officially diagnosed with cataplexy. While cataplexy is extremely rare, 70 per cent of sufferers also suffer from narcolepsy. In addition, Kelly also suffers from poor short term memory and often forgets what she did the previous day. Kelly found her attacks got worse after having Ronnie (left) and Charlie . Kelly said: 'I often panic when I'm going into an attack and I'm always hurting myself. One time I landed on the sofa on my nose and I couldn't move my head in order to breathe.  The cushion was pushed up against my face and I thought I was going to suffocate. 'My boyfriend was asleep on the sofa and I couldn't even make a sound to alert him to what had happened. 'It felt like it lasted for ages although it was probably less than a minute and then the attack started to ease off so I was able to move my neck just enough to breathe. At times like that the attacks can feel like forever. 'Another time I went down and hit the doctor's desk while I was in the middle of talking to her. She didn't even realise what was happening until it was too late and I had smacked my head on the edge.' Like many epileptics, Kelly needs constant supervision and cannot drive or even take a bath on her own. However, she can suffer up to 20 attacks a day and is not entitled to extra support for her condition. Now she is worried she may have passed the condition onto her son Ronnie, who suffered a fit in a supermarket two weeks ago. He is currently awaiting tests to see if he has inherited either of his mother's rare conditions. She said: 'I'd hate for Ronnie to have it as it affects every aspect of my life. 'I'd love to be able to go for a drink and have a laugh with my friends, but I can't. As soon as someone cracked a joke I would be paralysed on my barstool and it would be mortifying. 'I'm trying some new medication at the moment and I'm waiting to see how that goes. With any luck it will help my condition and I might even be able to go to a comedy club someday.'","During an attack Kelly can see and hear but her body is temporarily paralysed .

Skulls found buried in a Florida back yard have been dated to 1200-1400 AD, authorities said yesterday. The skulls, of a man and ten-year-old boy, were believed to be from Peru or another region of South America almost 900 years ago. The bones were found at a home in Winter Garden, Florida in January when a plumber working on a new swimming pool came across a bone fragment and called the police. Scroll down for video . Burial site: A plumber who was working on a pool in Winter Garden, Florida came across the skulls while digging in January . Far from home: The Florida back yard was believed to be the second burial site of the skulls. Scientists suggested they could have been brought into the U.S. by a tourist as souvenirs . Medical examiner Dr Jan Garavaglia, known as Dr G, discovered human tissue still within the bone, causing concern that it could be a child who had died recently and been buried illegally. However, the medical examiner also said that the skulls are not from the same time period – in fact, one of them dates to the 1970s. Dr G told WESH-2 in February that the skulls could have been from a ritual of some kind. Each of the three skulls were missing their jaw bones, but a newspaper clipping from around 1978 could help add more context to the mysterious craniums. The clipping was found inside of a purse retrieved from the site. Scientists discovered an Inca bone which gave a clue to their origin with Florida believed to be the  second burial site. The human tissue on the cheek of the skull had been mummified. Cloth items also found with the bones were ancient purses made of woven material according to archaeologists from University of Central Florida and Yale who had been enlisted to work on the mystery. Mystery bones: The two skulls, one belonging to a ten-year-old boy and another to an adult male were believed to be of South American descent . Although they may never get to the bottom of how the skulls ended up in this area of Florida, the items could have been brought back to the U.S. as holiday souvenirs at a time when it was more acceptable. It is now illegal to transport bones. Ms Garavaglia told ABC: 'Another possibility is that it used to be a migrant farm worker camp, and some cultures will bring part of their heritage with them when they leave. It could be that they were moving on and decided to bury it there.' video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","Bones found by plumber working on a swimming pool in January .

Multimillionaires Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who last week sold their photo-sharing service for a staggering $1billion, 'rocked out' as details of their deal continued to sink in. Pictured at dinner with superstar DJs and producers Deadmau5 and Avicii at Wynne and Encore Las Vegas' Botero restaurant, the pair then moved on to the celebrity haunt of Encore's XS nightclub. Posted: Instagram's co-founders Kevin Systrom (centre top) and Mike Krieger (right) with club managing partner Jesse Waits (left bottom), Deadmau5 (top left) and Avicii (bottom right) They were said to be clearly enjoying the limelight as the club's managing partner Jesse Waits appropriately posted a picture of the group via their app. But their antics all looked a bit tame, especially considering they have now entered into the league of the 'super-rich'. There was no suggestion the 26-year-olds splashed out $150,000 on the world's biggest bottle of champagne, the 30litre Armand de Brignac 'Midas'. And it seems they didn't blow $3,000 on a private table at the venue - a favourite for, among others, Khloe Kardashian, Ryan Seacrest, Kelly Osbourne and Gerard Butler. They even went to bed on Saturday morning at a relatively early 4am, after sneaking backstage to watch DJ Avicii in action. But maybe they were just tired, having capped a remarkable seven days.

Luxurious: Private tables cost around $3,000 per night and clients can spend $150,000 on the world's biggest bottle of champagne . Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg announced last week he would hand over $1billion to buy the company.

Facebook will complete its initial public offering of stock next month. The service - used by 30 million people, including celebrities Hilary Duff, Mandy Moore and Jessica Alba - is increasingly becoming a rival for Facebook, which also relies on people posting pictures. The deal comes just days after the service began offering a version for Android phones in addition to its popular Apple app. Interestingly, it also comes eight years after Systrom turned down Mark Zuckerberg's offer to join the Facebook team in 2004 - before it shot to success.

Mr Zuckerberg said he would keep Instagram running separately and users will still be able to use it on rival social networks, such as Twitter - yet experts predict the deal could be the death of the app. Facebook has had a tendency to buy small startups and integrate the technology - or shut it down altogether. One thing is certain, Instagram's co-founders have now joined the leagues of the super-rich. Both are Stanford graduates, yet did not meet at university. Instead, their paths crossed after Systromm, who had worked for Google's Gmail and a start-up that went on to become Twitter, created a photo sharing app called Burbn. Krieger was an early Burbn user and reached out to the creator. As the CEO, Systrom is the more vocal of the duo, appearing as the face of the company to laud the application's simplicity and sociability. Popular: Instagram is a photo-sharing application that allows users to crop images and give them different filters .

Three Queens sailed out of Southampton port last night as their departure heralded the end of the spectacular Diamond Jubilee four-day weekend of celebrations. Cruise company Cunard had sailed its three ships into port together for the first time yesterday morning as a special tribute to the Queen's 60 year reign. Queen Victoria, Queen Mary 2 and Queen Elizabeth sailed in single file into Southampton, Hampshire, shortly after dawn with a fire tug and a flotilla of small boats welcoming them in. Off with a bang: Fireworks over the three Queens, Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary 2 and Queen Victoria as they set sail from Southampton for far shores . All aboard: Cunards Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth sailed in to Southampton docks yesterday morning in tribute the the Queens Diamond Jubilee celebrations . Stunning view: The huge fireworks display last night illuminates the sky near the three lit-up ships . As Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria took a bow-to-bow position close to City Terminal, Queen Mary 2 passed each ship in turn, creating a three-bow formation, as flag-waving crew lined the foredecks, and the ships' whistles sounded in salute. The nautical show kicked off a day of celebrations in the city to celebrate the Queen's 60 years on the throne with live bands and entertainment. The Red Arrows were due to give their first ever display over the city yesterday evening but bad weather meant the show had to be cancelled. But, despite the rain, there was still a spectacular fireworks show in the run-up to the ships leaving port at 11pm. Three works of art: Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria and .

On the high seas: Queen Mary 2 passed the Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria moored close to Southampton City Terminal to create a three-bow formation . Rare sight: It was the first time Cunards Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth had ever sailed into port together . Sight for sore eyes: The huge ships Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth dominated the scene at Southampton port yesterday morning . 'Cunard is proud of its association with Her Majesty and we are delighted to be able to honour her on this special day.

It was a really special moment.' The finale to the celebrations comes as one million people descended on a rainy London to watch the Royal Family acknowledge their affection from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The Queen emerged to a deafening roar flanked by Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Camilla and Prince Charles. The only senior member of the Firm missing was Prince Philip, who is in hospital. Flying the flag: Flag-waving crew lined the foredecks of the Cunards Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth as the ships' whistles sounded in salute . Warm welcome: The Cunards Queen Mary 2, Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth were greeted by patriotic crowds and boat lovers who wanted to catch a glimpse of the maneuvers .

To the strains of Land Of Hope And Glory, led by a military brass band, the patriotic crowd gathered in anticipation before she and the rest of the Royal Family emerged for the military fly past and feu de joie gun salute. In a nod to the typical British weather, the masses gave a rendition of Singing In The Rain and shouts of 'We want the Queen' rang out. The Jubilee well-wishers surged along The Mall led by police on horseback in an extraordinary scene, and as ever, the drizzle did little to dampen their spirits. If anybody was in any doubt that Britain’s love for the monarchy had waned, this national outpouring of pride would soon dispel that belief, in a week that witnessed a huge surge in popularity for the Royals, and particularly the Queen.",Cunard brings three liners to Southampton to mark 60th anniversary .

Access Hollywood: Christopher Chaney, from Florida, is facing 60 years in jail after hacking celebrities' email accounts . A computer hacker who admitted accessing Scarlett Johansson's emails and leaking nude photographs of her online has boasted about how easy it was to do. Christopher Chaney, 35, faces up to 60 years in prison and a $2.2million fine for the stunt which also saw him hacking into the email accounts of singer Christina Aguilera and actress Mila Kunis. He explained that to get into star's emails had been relatively easy - using Google and the 'I forgot my password' button. After trying out combinations of A-listers' names to find working email addresses, he reset account passwords by researching pet names, where they were born and went to school. Chaney told GQ: 'You feel like you've seen something that the rest of the world wanted to see. But you're the only one that's seen it.' He added: 'I don't want to compare it to throwing a touchdown pass... but it was a rush.' Chaney, of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested last October as part of a year-long investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi'. He was tracked down by federal agents with a battering ram to his run-down brick home home which he had once shared with his late grandmother. The depth of his hacking - which kept unemployed Chaney glued to his computer screen for days at a time - saw him access exchanges between celebrities and other famous people, along with their family members, partners, producers and doctors. In all he had accessed the private information of around 50 stars including actresses Busy Phillips and Ali Larter  - which he unearthed with virtually no technical computer training. Laid bare: Scarlett Johansson, pictured in this D&G advert, said the nude photos of her that Chaney accessed were intended for her now ex-husband Ryan Reynolds . He also hijacked a forwarding feature so a copy of every email a . celebrity received was sent to an account he controlled, according to . court documents. Chaney . claimed to have photos of Christina Aguilera wearing only her underwear . and pictures of a well-known actress in her 'mid-to-late forties' naked. The 35-year-old also admitted to being privy to information . about male stars who were hiding the fact they were gay for the . sake of their careers. Prosecutors said Chaney illegally . accessed the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment . industry between November 2010 and October 2011. Nude photos Johansson had taken of . herself were later posted on the Internet. Johansson told Vanity Fair in . its December issue that the photos were meant for Ryan Reynolds, now . her ex-husband. A-list targets: Mila Kunis (pictured left) and Christina Aguilera (right) were also hacked by Chaney . However Chaney claimed that he had . not hacked the email accounts to make money but for 'personal' reasons . because he was simply a movie fanatic. He said that female stars were . not even his preferred targets but location scouts, producers and industry . insiders as he became more and more obsessed with the process of making films. Many images were forwarded to two gossip websites and another hacker, but there was not any evidence that he profited from his scheme, authorities said. Chaney pleaded guilty to nine counts involving hacking last month. He has been jailed until sentencing on July 23 after it was discovered that he had continued to hack into celebrity email accounts even after he was interviewed by FBI agents and confessed to his scheme.","Christopher Chaney, 35, faces 60 years in jail after accessing emails of stars including Mila Kunis and Christina Aguilera ."

It is a mystery that has perplexed historians for more than 400 years - what ever became of the 120 settlers who tried to establish England's first colony on the north-east coast of America? Queen Elizabeth I and famed explorer Sir Walter Raleigh had hoped the expedition in the 1580s would create a capital in the New World, but something went terribly wrong. The men, women and children simply . vanished - possibly massacred by native American Indians - any evidence . of a settlement disappeared and the infamous 'lost colony' became rooted . in American folklore. But solving the centuries-old mystery . may have come a step closer this week after experts identified a . tantalising clue hidden in a map drawn by a man on that fateful voyage. Riddle in invisible ink: The map (left) of Roanoke Island in North America drawn by John White during an attempt to create England's first colony reveals a hidden possible location for the settlement when it was illuminated from underneath (right) in recent tests. The colony disappeared in mysterious circumstances in the 1580s . Shedding new light: In this close-up of the patch at the centre of the map, a lozenge, the symbol for a fort, can clearly be seen. The symbol was drawn in invisible ink and further concealed with a piece of paper glued on top . Showing the way: This image shows the hidden marking under ultraviolet light. Historians hope to excavate the site in the hope it will uncover more clues to the fate of the settlers . Tests have found a hint at the possible location of what may have been intended as the colony's capital near Roanoke Island, apparently drawn in invisible ink. The 'x-marks-the-spot' is shown in the form of a lozenge, the symbol for a fort, on the map drawn by John White, who accompanied Raleigh's first attempt to establish the colony and who led the settlers on their quest to set up the 'Cittie of Raleigh'. The ink, which is also disguised by a . piece of paper glued to it, was likely put together using milk, citrus . juice or urine, as was common at the time. Its use during the 'lost colony expedition' also sheds light on an era of political suspicion at the time. Location, location, location: Roanake Island is located just off what is now the state of North Carolina. White's maps have been praised for being particularly accurate . Journey back in time: A modern-day map of the colony's location on the north-east coast of North America . Were they slaughtered? This painting by White shows native North Americans dancing in a religious ceremony during an expedition in 1585. Many believe the 'lost colony' were massacre by American Indians . Folklore: John White returns to Roanake Island in 1590 to find the settlers have quite simply vanished after he had gone back to England to fetch more supplies . Among the most popular forms of invisible ink is lemon juice, but others have included urine and milk. The acid from the citrus juice weakens the paper and can then be shown with the application of heat. Invisible ink dates as far back as the first century, when Roman officer Pliny the Elder explained how the milk of the thithymallus plant could be used. During the American Revolution, British and American spies used a mixture of ferrous sulfate and water for a similar effect. During the late 19th and early 20th century, carbon copies were used for secret writing. The CIA used a paper that contained a special chemical that would be invisibly transferred to a second sheet of paper. The message could then be developed by using water or heat. Plotters were attempting to place . Catholic Mary Queen of Scots on the throne and there were concerns the . map may be found by court spies. Now farmland, the site will be excavated, it was expected to be announced today. Professor . Brent Lane, from the University of North Carolina and a director of the . First Colony Foundation, who made a request for tests to be carried out . on the map, said he delighted with the findings. 'I marvelled at it,' he told The Independent. 'It was as if Sir Walter Raleigh had sent me an email saying ""This was my... capital""'. White drew the map - in pen, brown ink and watercolour - after setting out on the voyage in the 1580s. A notable artist, his map is considerably accurate and his other works are held in the British Museum. Having landed in North America, the settlers realised they had insufficient supplies, so White went back home to get more. But when new stocks arrived, they had completely disappeared. Expansion plans: Famed explorer Sir Walter Raleigh (left) and Queen Elizabeth I (right) had hoped the expedition would create a capital in the New World called the 'Cittie of Raleigh' By the time they landed in 1587, it was too late to plant crops for the season, so White returned to England for supplies. However, White arrived in England to find his country at war with Spain. Constant . sea battles closed the Atlantic to nonmilitary vessels and prevented . his return to the coast of North Carolina until 1590. He found that the settlers he had left behind on Roanoke Island had completely disappeared. It is believed they may have re-located to Croatoan Island (now Hatteras Island), but this has never been proved. In 1607, after several failed attempts, Jamestown in the Colony of Virginia became the first permanent settlement in what is now known as the United States. It would serve as capital of the colony for 83 years.","Settlers who tried to establish England's first colony simply vanished .

Mystery surrounds a savage attack on the wife of a top marine biologist after she apparently blamed her husband for the beating and then told police she had no memory of the assault. Svetlana Guggenheim, who is married to David Guggenheim, was left with a a fractured skull and still cannot open her left eye six weeks after the attack in their Washington apartment. During early stages of her recovery, nurses' notes allegedly show how the 46-year-old Russian translator implicating her husband and asking for protection from him. The apparent claim led police to consider Mr Guggenheim, who claims he returned home from Philadelphia to find her bloodied and twitching hurt but nothing stolen, as the only suspect. Struggle recovering: Svetlana Guggenheim still cannot form words and cannot remember what happened to her when she was attacked in early April . But now Mrs Guggenheim says that she has no memory of making such a request, the Washington Post reports. She has also asked to see her ocean expert spouse, who has appeared on the 60 Minutes TV show with Anderson Cooper. She is said to have smiled and reached for his hand when he was finally allowed to visit last Friday, while accompanied by Washington Post reporter Paul Duggan. She also says she doesn't remember the days leading up to the assault, when she returned to the apartment while her husband was out of town, nor the attacker's identity or how attack took place. What police do know is that on the afternoon of Thursday April 5, Mrs Guggenheim had been texting Anna Pavlichenko, 25, her daughter from a previous relationship, who now lives in Florida. While messaging back and forth, they decided to speak later that night. But Miss Pavlichenko's calls went unanswered. Miss Pavlichenko then alerted her mother's husband of 18 years the following day while he was in Philadelphia, and he became concerned as well. The 53-year-old says he arrived to their second-floor apartment Kalorama neighbourhood - and found the door dead-bolted - on the morning of Saturday April 7. Happier times: Svetlana, pictured before the brutal attack, and her husband of 18 years, David, pictured by the sea while doing his job as a marine biologist. They met in her home country of the then-Soviet Union in 1991 . One of the few certain facts is that Mr Guggenheim called police after the discovery of his wife lying on the floor beside their bed, wearing only a blouse and surrounded by blood and with a black eye. Mrs Guggenheim, who met her husband in her home country of the Soviet Union in 1991, was treated for a subdural hemotoma from the attack and is recovering from brain surgery. Though her husband was initially allowed to sit at her bedside at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, police later barred him after seeing a note that a nurse wrote saying that she had requested protection. The only other family she has is Miss Pavlichenko, who has visited twice from Florida over the past six weeks that her mother has been in the hospital. Miss Pavlichenko made a video - posted on YouTube by Mr Guggenheim - where she asks her bed-ridden mother if she wants her husband to be able to visit. Mrs Guggenheim, who can barely speak and has breathing and feeding tubes connected, nods and mouths 'yes'. Work: Mr Guggenheim, an advocate for oceans, claims he has receipts to prove he was traveling when his wife was allegedly attacked . Famous: Mr Guggenheim being interviewed during a reef dive by 60 Minutes host Anderson Cooper . Continued effort: Svetlana had brain surgery and remains at MedStar Washington Hospital Center following the attack six weeks ago . Only her right eye is open as her left eye is still so swollen from a fracture that it remains shut. She is also recovering from a skull fracture and severe bruises on her upper arms, which doctors took as an implication that she was grabbed at some point during the attack. When she feels able, Mrs Guggenheim communicates by notes, or, as was the case when she was formally questioned by police and an assistant U.S. attorney, a laptop. So far, those notes mostly make mentions of her feelings about the attack ('Sheer horror! Sheer horror!' read one) and messages to her husband ('They are supposedly keeping me safe from you' she wrote in another after the ban was lifted). The only other clue that remains is a cryptic message that Svetlana wrote to her daughter during one visit, where she implied that her attacker was an acquaintance. The exact wording of the message is unknown, and she did not identify the individual, but Miss Pavlichenko is said to have brought it to the attention of the U.S. attorney's office. While investigators would like to think that note is the smoking gun of the case, their hopes have been thwarted as she now does not remember the person she mentioned. The case continues, and since the ban has been lifted by the police, her husband is at her side.","Svetlana Guggenheim 'told nurses that ocean expert husband David left her with fractured skull and other injuries'

These are the ‘designer’ twins - genetically engineered by doctors so their mother could give birth without miscarrying. Doctors discovered that both Julia Eynon and her husband Stuart had abnormal chromosomes which were being passed to their unborn babies, causing them to be miscarried. She had tragically lost two sets of twins before doctors made the heartbreaking discovery. Julia Enyon with 'designer' twins Aaron and Holly who were born last year thanks to a new technique which eliminates faulty chromosomes . She underwent a special ‘designer’ technique where doctors selected embryos which were free from the abnormal chromosomes that were causing her to miscarry. It meant that her twins Holly and Aaron were able to be born safely in March last year. Mrs Eynon, 37, said: ‘The doctors had told me it was unlikely that I could ever give birth to a baby alive, it was heartbreaking. ‘We both had faulty chromosomes that meant that when I fell pregnant, the baby would either miscarry or die at full term, before I could give birth. ‘I thought I would never be a mum - . but now my twins have been born safely due to this wonderful technique. It seems like a miracle. The couple, who live in Bridgend, South Wales, started trying for a family after they got married in 2005. After two miscarriages and another two failed IVF attempts the couple tried Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis where doctors selected embryos which were free from the abnormal chromosomes that were causing her to miscarry . Mrs Eynon said: ‘I thought it would happen straight away. I came off the pill and expected to fall pregnant within a few months. ‘But nothing happened, so I went to see my GP who told me to be patient and that it can take a while and not to worry. But by Christmas the following year Mrs Eynon still hadn’t fallen pregnant so she went for a scan and doctors discovered she had polycystic ovaries. She was put on the fertility drug Clomid for a further 12 months, but still nothing happened, so the couple were referred for IVF treatment. Julia pictured with husband Stuart holding Holly and Aaron at the hospital in March 2011 . They underwent their first cycle at IVF Wales in Cardiff in January 2008 and it was a success. Doctors put two embryos back into her womb, but then at six weeks she miscarried both the twins. Mrs Eynon, a health visitor, said: ‘We were absolutely devastated. We had thought that after the years of trying, we were finally going to be parents. When they told me I was pregnant I was overjoyed. ‘So to lose both the babies at six weeks was heartbreaking.’ The couple underwent a second IVF attempt in October 2008, but that failed. A third attempt in March 2009 proved a success and Mrs Eynon once more fell pregnant with twins. She said: ‘I was worried in case anything went wrong, but we were so excited, and were convinced that we couldn’t be as unlucky this time.’ But again at six weeks she miscarried and lost both babies. Devastated, she asked the doctors to carry out tests to see why she had lost both sets of twins. The tests showed that both Mrs Eynon and her husband Stuart, 39, a supplies coordinator for St Johns ambulance, were carriers of abnormal chromosomes -  one which caused early miscarriage, and the other which causes the baby to die at full term. Mrs Eynon said: ‘We were both devastated when we were told the news. It meant it was unlikely that I would ever be able to give birth to a baby that was still alive. It was heartbreaking to think that it had caused me to lose both sets of twins.’ Despite being born prematurely at 27 weeks both the twins are happy and healthy and 'coming on in leaps and bounds' Then the doctors told the couple about a technique called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) - a technique that allows doctors to check for genetic disorders in an embryo so that an unaffected embryo can be implanted into the mother’s womb. It means that they could test for the two abnormal chromosomes in the embryos and make sure only ones unaffected would be used. Mrs Eynon said: ‘We had never heard of the technique before, but it meant that we could have a baby without these abnormalities, so we decided to go ahead. It was our only chance at being parents.’ The couple underwent their fourth cycle of IVF in June 2010 and this time all the embryos were tested, but they were all found to have the genetic fault. In September 2010 they had a fifth attempt and this time seven of the 15 embryos were found to be free of the defective chromosomes. Two were put back into Mrs Eynon’s womb and were successful. She said: ‘I was so thrilled when I found out I was pregnant, and now this time I knew that the babies had a much better chance of developing normally.’ Her pregnancy went smoothly until 27 weeks when she went into premature labour. She was rushed into the Singleton Hospital in Swansea and the couple were terrified that they were going to lose the twins. Mrs Eynon said: ‘After everything we had been through to have the twins, we really thought that they were going to die. It was devastating.’ Doctors gave her steroid injections to develop the babies lungs whilst they were still in the womb and Holly was born first weighing just 2Ib, followed by Aaron at 2Ib4. Mrs Eynon said: ‘They were so fragile and tiny. Holly had a perforated bowel and Aaron had a brain haemorrhage. ‘But they were both real little fighters and hung on. We just had to pray that after everything they had been through they would be alright.’ The twins were finally allowed home after three months and are now coming on in leaps and bounds. Mrs Eynon added: ‘They are doing so well now. They both have great appetites and they are getting much stronger. ‘We feel so lucky to have them, and we are just so grateful for the ‘designer’ technique that allowed them to be born.’","Julia and husband Stuart both carried abnormal chromosomes causing her to miscarry.

Despairing killer: Marco Turrini, 41, who threw his two children - 14-month-old Benedetta and four-year-old Samuele - off a balcony in Brescia . This is the Italian father who threw his two children to their deaths from his sixth-floor balcony and then leapt himself while in despair about losing his advertising job. Marco Turrini, 41, was killed instantly and his 14-month-old daughter Benedetta and four-year-old son Samuele died in hospital following the plunge in Brescia. Mr Turrini had been unemployed for 18 months after the advertising firm where he worked was hit by the economic crisis. He had grown increasingly depressed as he struggled to find a new job, his neighbours in the northern Italian town said. His wife Elena More was in the flat at the time and had been heard arguing with Mr Turrini before he grabbed Samuele and Benedetta. She was yesterday being treated for shock. Later Mr Turrini's cousin Maurizio said: ‘I can’t believe it. I knew he wasn’t working but I didn’t think things were this bad. 'What did the children have to do with this?' Mr Turrini, who had no history of violence nor a criminal record, is understood to have feared losing his wife and his home as the family's situation worsened. A neighour, Elisabetta, who witnessed the horror unfold, said she heard the screaming and then rushed down to the street to see what had happened. Tragic: The body of Marco Turrini is taken away after he killed his two children and then himself in Brescia . When she saw the children, 'I felt I was still breathing. I tried to feel the heartbeat of the baby, but it was already very weak,' she told the Giornale di Brescia newspaper. Mr Turrini's cousin Maurizio revealed that the man's father had committed suicide a year ago by hanging himself. The tragedy is thought to be the latest in a string of suicides by people who have been hit by the downturn in the economy and the ongoing eurozone crisis which has increased unemployment. The case is also chilling echo of Briton John Hogan, 37, who shoved his daughter Mia, two, and son Liam, six, off a hotel Balcony in Greece after a row with his wife Natasha. Sickening: Turrini, whose body is seen being taken away in a coffin, lost his job 18 months ago, was said to be despairing about money when he threw his two children from a sixth floor balcony . Barely concealed: Turrini's body covered by a blanket while police officers stand by it . He and Mia survived with broken bones but tragic Liam died from head injuries after the fourth-floor death plunge in Crete in 2006. A coroner originally ruled Liam's death unlawful but this was overturned by the High Court because evidence suggesting Hogan was insane at the time of the killing was ignored. Madness: Turrini, whose body was later shielded from view, has been arging with his wife before snapping . Height: The apartment block where the tragedy happened . Chilling echo: John Hogan, left, threw his son Liam and daughter Mia off a hotel balcony in Crete before leaping off after a row with his then wife Natasha . But a second inquest last November backed the original decision after hearing bombshell new testimony from a British forensic psychiatrist who claimed the father would not have been insane when he jumped. However, Hogan has yet to face charges over the deaths.","Marco Turrini, 41, pushed 14-month-old Benedetta and Samuele, four, to their deaths after row with wife .

One of the Colombian escorts embattled in the Secret Service scandal in Cartagena broke her silence today and spilled some sordid details of the night several of President Obama’s men became embroiled with scandal. Dania Suarez, 24, spoke in an exclusive interview to W Radio in Colombia, and told listeners in Spanish that one of the agents, identified as Arthur Huntington, was ‘heavily intoxicated.’ Huntington has since left the Secret Service. Scroll down for video . Prostitute Dania Suarez spoke out onW Radio and Caracol TV, in Madrid, Spain on Friday, her first public interview . Secret Service agents paid nine women after they took them back to their Colombian hotel rooms, including Dania, who was almost denied her fee entirely . The young single mother appeared in the studio looking tan, with her long, dark hair tumbling down her back. While she denies being a ‘prostitute,’ she said she requested ‘a little present’ of $800. She said that the luggage and documents in the suitcase in his hotel room were left out in the open, and could easily have been taken, if she were a spy, according to ABC News. Suarez also said she never would have complained about not being paid had she known the agent was part of Mr Obama’s security detail. She said she fled the country after the scandal broke for fear of retribution, and spent time in Dubai with a person she had met in Cartagena. She said in the interview that she will gladly sell her story and has contracted one of Colombia’s top lawyers, according to the interview. When asked whether or not she and Huntington had sex, she responded: ‘If I answer this, you will know what happened.’ However, she said that Huntington . ‘did not feel he got what he was being asked to pay for,’ which led to . the now-infamous feud and the scandal breaking out. Suarez said she considers herself an escort, because prostitutes ‘are lower class and live in brothels.’ A government report published earlier this week tells how the . Secret Service agents involved in the Colombian prostitution scandal . paid nine of the 12 women that they took home from the bar on that wild . evening. Hotel: The agent allegedly took the prostitute to his room in Cartagena's Hotel Caribe . The Secret Service submitted a . detailed report about what exactly happened on the night that a dozen . agents were partying at a bar in Cartagena while in the country to . protect the President. The report confirms that nine of the . women who went back to the Hotel Caribe with the agents were paid . thought their identities were not publicly revealed. The Washington Post says that the . 24-page report was submitted to the relevant congressional committees . who are investigating the scandal, and those officials will not release . the full extent of their findings. Investigators from the Secret Service . are continuing their hunt for more information about the evening, and so . far they have only spoken with those nine women. They are still looking . to talk to the remaining three women. So far, they have done background . checks on the first nine and have reported that none of them have . connections to terrorist organizations or drug cartels, which was a . major concern at the beginning of the scandal since they had access to . the Secret Service agent's hotel rooms.

The . embarrassing prostitution scandal has resulted in the Secret Service . sending about 100 of its agents on an ethics training course. The agents will take part in two days of training this week from professors at Johns Hopkins University near Washington. The Secret Service has originally scheduled training for just 20 agents. But following the scandal, it expanded the course to include about 100. The university has previously worked with the Secret Service and so was deemed a good choice. Some of the new guidelines include: . The report also details the staff ranks of some of the dozen agents involved with the women in Cartagena, Colombia. Two were supervisory criminal investigators, three were snipers, three were part of a counterassault team. Nine of the 12 agents submitted to polygraph exams, while three chose not to cooperate. One of the three that did not submit . to a test was the man who initially caused the whole fiasco by refusing . to pay his prostitute in full. That man, identified as Arthur Huntington, would not pay the $800 he initially agreed to pay prostitute Diana Suarez. Huntington's wife, Jolie, told . relatives she will ‘make the marriage work’ with Arthur Huntington, her . husband of nearly 20 years. Friends and family of the couple say that he would never have intentionally hurt her. Huntington has left the agency since . the incident earlier this month, but the circumstances of his departure . are unclear. His home in Severna Park, Maryland reportedly went on sale . last week.

Secret Service investigation which involved 12 agents and another 12 . members of the military and which overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to . the Summit of the Americas.

A British winemaker has accused the French of trying to pass off their wine as British by wrapping it in a Union Jack. Bob Lindo has written to Home Secretary Theresa May to vent his anger over the scam to trick foreigners into buying a ‘British’ souvenir when they come to watch the Olympics or Queen’s Jubilee celebrations. Mr Lindo, who owns the Camel Valley vineyard at Wadebridge, Cornwall, forced the World Duty Free shop at Gatwick Airport to remove a sign heralding French champagne as the ‘Best of British’ following an incident on Tuesday night. Scam: Winemaker Bob Lindo, right, wrote to the Home Secretary and Defra to complain after spotting this display of French Lanson champagne at Gatwick Airport, left . The Lanson champagne bottles were wrapped in Union flags which Mr Lindo says is ‘unacceptable’. In his letter to May, who is one of his customers, Mr Lindo wrote: 'I had to insist on the Best of British sign being removed from the Lanson display stand in the duty free shop at Gatwick airport. They removed the sign after I refused to leave until they did. 'This is clearly an attempt to con visitors for the Olympics and the Jubilee into taking home a ""British"" souvenir. We have a lot of red tape to deal with within the UK wine industry, often involving the tiniest or irrelevant detail, but we get on with it. 'Meanwhile this outrageous attempt to pass off an inferior champagne (It came 89th in a recent blind tasting, behind 85 English sparkling wines and three other sparkling wines) as British, is left to happen by those same regulatory bodies that police us with such efficiency. 'I don’t believe that wrapping a French wine in the Union Flag is remotely acceptable.' 'Unacceptable': Mr Lindo stands amid the vines at his Camel Valley vineyard at Wadebridge, Cornwall. He called Lanson's marketing ploy a 'con' Mr Lindo wrote to Defra, the Food Standards Agency and his association members and also to Lanson International saying they have breached wine standards. He said in his letter to Lanson: 'On behalf of English Wine producers I wish to formally and most strongly state our objections to a promotion being carried by Champagne Lanson of which they are very clearly passing off and purporting to ""Best of British"".' Mr Lindo said: 'It made my blood boil when I saw that sign - it was a deliberate attempt to pass the champagne off as British when it is most certainly not. 'If anyone dares to call their wines champagne, the French go mad and start suing people.' Lanson, who created the limited edition Union Flag bottle costing about £31 to celebrate the Jubilee, has now agreed to remove the Best of British signs, said Mr Lindo.","Bob Lindo has written to the Home Secretary Theresa May .

"By . Sophie Borland and Eleanor Harding . PUBLISHED: . 14:23 EST, 23 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:30 EST, 25 May 2012 . A grandmother fighting for her life in hospital with rabies failed to tell doctors that she had recently visited India – or that she had been bitten by a dog there, it has emerged. The woman, who is in her 50s and of Asian origin, caught the deadly virus two months ago while on the trip with her husband, but only began to develop symptoms recently. Yesterday it was reported she had initially been sent home three times after going to a GP and A&E complaining of sickness. Investigation: Five members of staff at Darent Valley Hospital have been vaccinated after coming into contact with the woman . Each time she was sent home because doctors believed her symptoms were ‘vague’. Now hospital staff claim the diagnosis was hampered because she failed to mention her trip or the dog bite. Had she done so ‘alarm bells would have rung immediately’, staff said. The victim, who lives in London, is being treated in an isolation unit at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases at University College Hospital, London. The Health Protection Agency has insisted members of the public are not at risk. Twenty people who have been in contact with the patient, including relatives, a GP and hospital staff have been offered vaccines as a precaution. The woman first visited her GP ten days ago complaining of sickness. Two days later she went to the A&E unit at Darent Valley hospital in Dartford, Kent, only to be sent home. Specialist treatment: The patient is in an isolation room at University College Hospital, London (above) after developing symptoms within the last fortnight . She returned the next day but the hospital refused to admit her believing she was suffering from a mild illness. A source at the hospital said: ‘Had the staff been properly informed about this woman’s trip to India, and especially that she had been bitten by a dog there, alarm bells would have rung immediately and the whole approach to her treatment would have been totally different to what happened.’ It was only when she visited her GP again last Friday – four days after the first appointment – rabies was suspected. Deadly: The grandmother's illness is the first case of rabies in England in almost seven years. The last occurred in July 2005 when a woman died after contracting it from a dog bite during a holiday in the Indian resort of Goa, pictured . Rare: Naturalist David McRae (pictured) became the first person in Britain to die of the disease for 100 years after he was bitten on the hand by a rabid bat in 2002 . Hospital staff have admitted she is unlikely to survive. But even if she had been diagnosed sooner it is unlikely her chances of recovery would have been any higher. Once the symptoms of rabies develop – including sickness, aggression and hallucinations – the virus has spread to the brain and is nearly always fatal. Professor Tom Solomon, of the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool, said the mortality rate is ‘almost 100 per cent’. ‘Almost everyone who gets bitten but doesn’t seek help will die within a few weeks of the symptoms starting to show,’ he said. Although no one has caught rabies in this country since the early 1900s, several have become infected while travelling abroad. The last case in England was in 2005 when a Manchester woman died after contracting the virus from a dog bite in Goa, India. Killer: Rabies viruses showing their characteristic bullet shape. The disease has an extremely low survival rate once symptoms have developed . Vaccination programme: Although all but eradicated in the UK rabies is still common in developing countries . Lethal: There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide each year. Half of all rabies cases occur in India, the Taj Mahal is pictured . Rabies is a viral infection which targets the nervous system and the brain. It is only spread by infected animals to humans, most often through the animal biting or scratching the person. It can also be spread by an animal's saliva being in contact with a graze or cut on a human's skin. The majority of rabies cases result from being bitten by an infected dog. The symptoms of the illness include high temperatures, numbness at the area where the bite occurred and hallucinations. Some victims also have hydrophobia, which is a fear of water. There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide each year with most cases occurring in Africa and Asia. But half of all rabies cases occur in India. The grandmother's illness is the first case of rabies in England in almost seven years. The last occurred in July 2005 when a woman from Manchester died after contracting it from a dog bite during a holiday in the Indian resort of Goa. Most cases of rabies in the UK occur from people infected abroad or from quarantined animals. Since 1946, 24 people have died who have been infected with rabies abroad. A total of four of these have occurred since 2000. In 2003, it was discovered that UK bats may be carrying a rabies-like virus. A bat handler died after contracting the virus in Scotland.","The woman, in her 50s, was bitten by a puppy while on holiday in India. She is said to be unlikely to survive .

In a show of breathtaking contempt and defiance, the man behind the Srebrenica massacre taunted  survivors and the families of  victims with a chilling cut-throat gesture yesterday. At the opening of his war crimes  trial in The Hague, Ratko Mladic  stared at Muslims in the packed  public gallery and ran his hand  across his throat. The 70-year-old former Bosnian Serb  general, dubbed the Butcher of Bosnia,  is accused of orchestrating the worst  massacre in Europe since the Second World War. He faces life imprisonment for the slaughter of 8,000 unarmed Muslim boys and men in 1995. Scroll down for footage from inside the court room .

Discovered: Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic, who was arrested in Serbia after years in hiding. Picture from May 26, 2011 . On arriving at court yesterday he gave a thumbs up and clapped. And after the cut-throat sign, the judge was forced to halt proceeding briefly to order an end to ‘inappropriate interactions’. Prosecutor Dermot Groome told the court that Mladic and other Bosnian Serbs divided the territory of the former Yugoslavia along ethnic lines and implemented a plan to exterminate non-Serbs. He said that by the time they had ‘killed thousands in Srebrenica’, they were ‘well-rehearsed in the craft of murder’.

Wanted men: These posters were released by the U.S. State Department in 2000 . And he said Mladic was part of a ‘joint criminal enterprise to eliminate the Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica by killing the men and boys... and forcibly removing the women, young children and some elderly men’. Video footage shot at the time and shown to the court showed Mladic mingling with Muslim prisoners. Shortly afterwards, the men and boys were separated from the women, stripped of identification and shot. The dead were bulldozed into mass graves, then later dug up and hauled away in trucks to more remote areas to be better hidden. Referring to an earlier massacre, Mr Groome said: ‘The world watched in disbelief that in neighbourhoods and villages within Europe a genocide appeared to  be in progress.’ He added that there was ‘no doubt’ that Mladic was also responsible for the siege and bombardment of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, which prosecutors said was intended to ‘spread terror among the civilian population’. Mladic had promised that the city would shake, he said.Mladic is the last of the main protagonists in the Balkan wars of the 1990s to go on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. He was the Serb military commander in the Bosnian war of 1992-95. His former political leader Radovan Karadzic is about half way through his trial on similar charges. Mladic, who was arrested in a Serbian village last May after 16 years on the run, has dismissed the charges as ‘monstrous’ and says he is too ill to stand trial. He has pleaded not guilty.

Allies: Leader of the Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic (left), Ratko Mladic (centre) and Goran Hadzic, President of the Serbian Krajina Republic (right) It took 17 years to bring Mladic to trial in what observers say is a testament to the loyalty he inspired among Serbs and the power of their nationalist cause. But as Serbia's goal of integration with Europe overtook its defiance, he lost his comfortable protection. And by the end he was reduced to sheltering, penniless and sick, in a cousin's farmhouse. The son of a World War Two partisan fighter killed in 1945, Mladic was an officer in the old communist Yugoslav Federal Army (JNA) when Yugoslavia's disintegration began in 1991. When Serbs rose up in 1992 against Bosnia's Muslim-led secession, he was picked to command the army that swiftly overran 70 per cent of the country. It was a model of ruthlessness, daring and brutality in the Serb warrior tradition once prized in the life-or-death struggle against Nazi Germany. But NATO officers who dealt soldier-to-soldier with Mladic when UN evenhandedness was official policy later came to regret shaking his hand.

Ali Hasan flashes the victory sign after being released from prison ahead of his trial on June 20 . An 11-year-old boy arrested for allegedly taking part in anti-government protests has been freed ahead of his trial. Ali Hasan says he was playing in the streets near his him in  al-Bilad al-Qadeem, a suburb of the Bahrain capital, Manama, with two other children his age when he was arrested for 'joining an illegal gathering' and other claims. Protests have been held in Sadad calling for his release for the last month, and that finally happened on Monday evening according to his lawyer, Mohsen al-Alawi. The sixth-grade student sat his exams while in prison and is among the youngest suspects detained in crackdowns on protests led by Bahrain's Shiite majority which seeks a greater political voice from the ruling Sunni dynasty. He will appear before the court again on June 20. Hasan said the two boys he was playing with ran off after being approached by plain clothes police officers in a car. One of the officers ordered him to stop or he would shoot if he tried to get away and he was later ordered to identify other boys where he lived. Among the accusations the 11-year-old faces is the allegation that he blocked a road with a rubbish skip, but his lawyer, Shahzalan Khamees, said this was impossible because 'you would need two grown men to lift it'. He was moved to different police stations for the first four hours of his detention, according to the Independent, in order to disorientate him. Mrs Khamees said: 'He . is very sad all the time. All he says is ""I want to . go home. I want my mother"". He is frightened and says they are going to . punish him. He is only a child.' It is not the first time that the . Bahrain authorities have been accused of targeting school children - . three teenage school girls said they were beaten in custody by the . police there in May last year. More than 50 people have died in Bahrain since unrest began in February and martial law was imposed after mass rallies. His arrest provoked protests from women and children along with human rights activist Zainab al-Khawaja, right . Khadija Habib, right, kisses her son after his release from prison where he was detained for 'joining an illegal gathering' Martial law was declared after rallies of up to 200,000 people took place. The monarchy set about crushing demonstrations by calling in troops from  Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last November, an international inquiry into the brutal crackdown found that ‘excessive and unnecessary force’ had been used and that detainees suffered electric shocks, and beatings with rubber hoses and wires. There are continued reports of arrests and torture at the hands of the Sunni authorities. In March this year, the UN asked for the Bahrain government to investigate allegations that tear gas, rubber bullets and birdshot pellets were being used against protesters. Eight opposition leaders have been sentenced to life in prison and a Bahrain policewoman is currently on trial for torturing a French TV journalist who was taken into custody. Earlier this week, Nabeel Rajab, head of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, was arrested after tweeting a comment that criticised the Gulf nation’s ruling caste.

A man who went on the run after a bank mistakenly deposited millions of dollars into his account has pleaded guilty to multiple charges of theft. Hui 'Leo' Gao was dubbed the 'accidental millionaire' after Westpac bank mistakenly gave the petrol station owner a credit line of 10 million New Zealand dollars ($7.7 million) in 2009, which was 100 times his approved limit. Gao and partner Kara Hurring then transferred millions of dollars into other accounts and left for China. Mistake: Hui 'Leo' Gao went on the run with his partner after Westpac bank mistakenly deposited millions of dollars into his account. He has pleaded guilty to multiple charges of theft. His local bank in Rotorua, New Zealand, is pictured . Hong Kong police arrested the 31-year-old Gao last year and New Zealand authorities extradited him. Ms Hurring returned voluntarily after having a baby and was last month found guilty of theft, attempted fraud and money laundering. Gao today pleaded guilty . to seven counts of theft. In April 2009 Gao was living with his . girlfriend Kara Hurring in the tourist town of Rotorua, known for its . geysers and boiling mud pools. They ran a gas station that Gao jointly . owned with his mother. Gao successfully applied for a temporary credit . line from Westpac, which the bank inadvertently multiplied by 100. When the cash-strapped gas station owner went online to check his bank account, he suddenly yelled out to his girlfriend that he was rich: 'I've got a million dollars.' Blunder: Gao ran this petrol station with his girlfriend Kara Hurring when the bank accidentally deposited millions of dollars in his account . After discovering the mistake, Gao didn't waste any time. 'As soon as he realised the error made by Westpac, the accused set about planning how he could transfer funds now available to him offshore,' court documents state. That set in motion a complicated series of transactions. Money went in and out of various accounts and companies, with some ending up in Chinese bank accounts, including accounts owned by Gao's mother. Other money ended up in various player accounts at a casino in Macau. The players included Gao's father and Hurring. By late April, Gao had left for Hong Kong and so had his parents. Error: Gao successfully applied for a temporary credit line from Westpac, which the bank inadvertently multiplied by 100 . Hurring, who'd filed an urgent application for a replacement passport, followed soon after. The couple then vanished into mainland China as an international manhunt got under way. Hurring, 33, returned voluntarily to New Zealand early last year after having a child. In September, Gao was arrested by Hong Kong police as he tried to cross into the city from mainland China. Authorities extradited Gao to New Zealand three months after that. A jury convicted a tearful Hurring last month of theft, attempted fraud and money laundering. Both Gao and Hurring are scheduled to be sentenced in August. Gao's parents have not been charged. A summary of facts presented to the . Rotorua District Court by prosecutors, which hasn't been challenged by . defence lawyers, indicates Gao stole NZ$6.8 million before the bank . realised its mistake. The bank managed to get back about . NZ$3 million by reversing some of the transfers but has never been able . to recover the final NZ$3.8 million. Gao has maintained his silence to police about the missing money and everything else to do with the case. Gao's lawyer Ron Mansfield declined to comment today. Prosecutor Fletcher Pilditch said it was an unusual crime and one unlikely to be repeated any time soon due to better banking safeguards. 'I think everyone in the banking industry has learned a few lessons from this.' he said.","Westpac bank mistakenly gave Hui 'Leo' Gao 10 million New Zealand dollars .

Furious: Michael Green, pictured, was told he could not ride a theme park's roller coasters because he does not have any hands . Furious, he went to the theme park's customer service department but was told he could not ride anything at the park. The incident follows the death last year of an amputee Iraq war veteran who died after falling from a roller coaster at Darien Lake Theme Park & Resort, near New York. Speaking to 9news.com, Mr Green said: 'I always get stared at a lot, but I never get discriminated, people telling me that I can't do something when they don't even know what I can do,' he said. Unhappy: Mr Green queued for an hour at Six Flags Over Texas theme park in Arlington, Texas, so that he could ride the Texas Giant. But he was refused entry . Mr Green lost both of his hands following a fire at his home when he was just 15 months old. But despite this, he still manages to live as normal a life as possible.He says he can cook, drive, clean and type on a computer. He also told park staff that he had been to Six Flags Over Texas many times in his childhood and had never been refused entry onto a ride before. But the theme park in Arlington, Texas would not budge. Mr Green said: 'I thought I was normal, and then I get treated like I am not, like I'm an outsider again - and that's the worst feeling in the world, to feel like an outsider,' he said. A spokesman for Six Flags Over Texas said its policies are customised by each individual ride and developed for the safety of its guests. He added: 'Our policies and procedures are reviewed and adjusted from time to time to ensure we continue to accommodate the needs of our guests while simultaneously maintaining a safe environment.' Controversial: After being turned away from the Texas Giant, pictured, Mr Green went to the theme park's customer service department but was told he could not ride anything at the park . According to Disability Rights Texas, safety can be a reason to prevent somebody from taking part on a ride. However, the group said each case must be judged separately.

Mrs Tebbutt realised the men wanted a ransom when she asked them where they were taking her. She said: 'This person was rubbing his thumb and fingers saying, ""Money, money, money"". 'I thought, ""OK, I’m being kidnapped for money. That’s OK, they will ask for money. It will be paid and I will go home"".' She did not go into detail about her time as a hostage or describe how or when she realised her husband was dead. Mr Tebbutt’s body was discovered in the couple’s bedroom after her abduction.

The father of two, who was arrested . in the days after the kidnapping, has previously admitted helping lead . the gunmen to the Tebbutts' bedroom on the night of the attack, but . claims he did so only after they forced him at gunpoint. Mrs Tebbutt told the court she had . not seen him on the night of her abduction but said the gang of five . pirates had told her a sixth man was involved. She said: 'Since my return from . captivity, I have seen pictures on the internet in the presence of my . son Oliver of a black male in a green T-shirt who was obviously . handcuffed and detained in Kenya in relation to the death of David.' She added: 'David was grappling with . someone I could not see, so there could have been other people in the . banda I am unaware of.' Earlier Mrs Tebbutt had told how  she . and her husband, whom she had know for 32 years, had been driven in a . golf buggy from a landing strip to the hotel, where they realised after . lunch they were alone apart from staff. Grappled with intruder: David Tebbutt, pictured, fought with his wife's kidnappers but was shot dead . She said: 'I was beginning to get this very strange feeling that something didn't feel right and I didn't feel comfortable.' Mrs Tebbutt, who wore a white blouse . and black suit as she gave evidence, described how the couple were led . along the beach to their grass-woven grass hut bedroom 'banda'. She felt uneasy when she realised the . couple's room had no doors or windows, but said her husband tried to . put her mind at ease by saying they would have a 'Robinson Crusoe . experience'. Mrs Tebbutt said: 'David and I . entered the banda, which was absolutely huge. I remember saying to . David, ""I'm not sure about this, because there's no doors or windows"". 'He replied ""No, this is going to be a Robinson Crusoe experience"". 'I remember thinking to myself that I was not sure if I liked a Robinson Crusoe experience. 'I wanted somewhere I could lock and again, it just didn't feel right, it didn't feel comfortable, but that was just a feeling.' Mrs Tebbutt recalled how the bedroom's front door was simply a roller blind. She described the inside of the . massive room, saying it had hammocks, a bookcase, sleeping and dressing . areas and a bathroom with twin sinks. A shower was located in an outside area backed by trees. She said: 'I thought ""I've never been anywhere like this before"", but it appeared very nice and very luxurious.' Mrs Tebbutt said she and her husband . were on the second week of their holiday when they arrived at the Kiwayu . Safari Village, having spent a week in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve. The couple walked along the beach to . have a meal of fish and potatoes in the restaurant and Mrs Tebbutt said . it suddenly struck her that they should put their valuables in the hotel . safe. Paradise lost: Two seats on the beach at the Kiwayu Safari Village complex, where the Tebbutts were staying . Secluded: A Kenyan policeman near the Kiwayu Safari Village complex where David Tebbutt was murdered and his wife Judith Tebbutt was kidnapped . The Tebbutts later enjoyed some gin and tonics while chatting to the hotel owner in the bar and then returned to their bedroom. Mrs Tebbutt put her jewellery in a wooden box in the bedroom. She said: 'When I say jewellery I mean it was my earrings, three Tiffany bangles and my watch which operates my hearing aids.' On the first night of their Kiwayu stay, Mrs Tebbutt described how she and her husband held hands as they drifted off to sleep. 'We just got straight into bed and when we slept, we normally started off sleeping holding hands - we always did that.' And the next thing she knew, her seven-month ordeal was just beginnning. Kololo has been held in custody since . his arrest and was present to hear Mrs Tebbutt's evidence, which was . shown on a television screen in a courtroom on the Kenyan island of . Lamu. The widow spent two hours slowly reading her statement, which was translated into the suspect's native Swahili. Suspect: Ali Babitu Kololo (right) cross-examined Judith Tebbutt in court . Kololo was then given the chance to cross-examine the witness and asked her two questions to confirm she had not seen him at the hotel and did not know him. Mrs Tebbutt also gave descriptions of the kidnappers she had seen - none of which have been arrested and are thought to be in Somalia. It is thought the widow's release came after her family arranged to pay a £800,000 ransom to the gang. Her son Oliver flew to Kenya's capital Nairobi to meet her after she was freed in March. Kololo was remanded again in custody following yesterday's hearing, which also heard evidence from Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Neil Hibberd. The officer, who works for Scotland Yard's counter-terror unit, was one of a team of detectives who flew to Kenya to help probe the tragedy last September. He told the court that footprints found on the beach following Mrs Tebbutt's abduction appeared to match the brand of shoe that Kololo was wearing when he was arrested. The officer added that a trail of footprints suggested the gang had peered into other banda huts before targeting the Tebbutts. Several other Metropolitan officers are also believed to have returned to Lamu and are expected to give evidence when the trial resumes today.","Mother-of-one, 56, gives evidence in kidnapping case of Ali Babitu Kololo .

A life in pictures: Kenneth Clayton . Kenneth Laurie Clayton was born in 1922 and was a well-known photographer based in London. His . first job was as a messenger boy for Fox Photos, the famous press . agency in Fleet Street for whom his brother, Bertram, worked. He was called up to the RAF in 1940 - and in 1945 bought a 5X4 Speed Graphic for £90 from an American airman returning home. Kenneth Clayton was commissioned by artist Margaret Lindsay Williams to take a series of images for the Royal family. He is seen above with Princess Anne and Prince Charles. He even held the little Princess's hand - a move which could have flouted royal protocol . It was always his proud boast that he was the first photographer in Fleet Street to have such a camera. In 1945, he and his brother went into partnership and started Feature Press Photo Agency, covering press, commercial and all other aspects of photography. The siblings won their . contract with the BBC in the early 1950s to photograph live productions on a regular basis. Following their success there, the Claytons took over Wedlake . Studio, a turn-of-the-century studio in Forest Gate, where they . were still taking pictures on 12 x 10 plate cameras and using magnesium . powder for their flash guns. One of Kenneth Clayton's proudest moments came when he was commissioned by artist Margaret Lindsay .

Stand-off: Police and rioters face eachother as another car is torched in no-man's-land in Belfast yesterday evening . Embattled: PSNI officers are hit with a petrol bomb thrown by Nationalist youths in Ardyone, Belfast, following the loyalist Orange Order parade . Danger: Onlookers escaped injury when a huge eleventh night bonfire at Sandy Row in Belfast, held as part of the annual Orange Order parades, unexpectedly toppled over and crashed to the ground . The chairman of the Northern Ireland Parades Commission today defended the decision to allow to rival parades to go ahead within two hours of each other in North Belfast which ended with serious public disorder and dissident republican gunmen opening fire on police. Politicians on all sides, including Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson, had criticised Parades Commission decisions which meant the Orangemen having to return early from the main Twelfth of July rally in the city - and allowing a parade by local residents to go ahead in the same place two hours later. Dissident republicans, many of them from outside the area, were among the crowds. The Commission was established to adjudicate on contentious marches, and even though there has been major trouble at this particular Catholic/Protestant flashpoint every year for over a decade, the chairman Peter Osborne said given the circumstances, the rulings were correct. He also hit out at people whom he claimed stood on the sidelines criticising their work. The language and comments in the days leading up to the parades had heightened tensions and were not helpful. Violence: This image shows the huge police presence during the disturbances . Worrying: Violent clashes took place on the streets of Belfast last night following an Orange Order parade which resulted in a number of police officers being left injured . Confrontation: The loyal order march through the Ardoyne sectarian interface was peaceful but trouble flared nearby with crowds of several hundred confronting lines of riot police . Mr Osborne told BBC Radio Ulster: 'It is complete and utter nonsense to blame the Parades Commission for the violence last night. There has been violence in this location for many, many years now. 'It is time for politicians to take ownership of contentious parades... that’s the way forward.' A republican march through the same area shortly afterwards prompted an exchange of missiles between loyalists and nationalists. Water cannon vehicles were used extensively and one non-lethal baton round fired. Police Service of Northern Ireland Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said: 'Unfortunately, police are now dealing with significant disorder in the Brompton Park and Balhom Road area. Dangerous: A Nationalist youth launches a projectile at police in Ardoyne as Nationalist youths clash with police . Battle: A man is left half-naked man as he is wrestled to the ground and arrested by police . Caught: One of several men is arrested during disturbances and dragged to a police van . Trouble: Fireworks, petrol bombs, stones, bricks and bottles were hurled at police lines and a burning silver BMW was driven at officers . 'Water cannon has again been deployed and four officers have been injured. Their injuries are not believed to be life- threatening. 'I am urging all individuals and communities affected to respond to developing events in a calm and responsible manner. Violence has serious and unwanted consequences for us all and we will robustly investigate all incidents of disorder.' A token parade by around 15 Orangemen through Ardoyne passed in silence just before 4pm. A residents' protest supported by Sinn Fein was peaceful. Democratic Unionist MP Nigel Dodds said the second march by nationalists was linked to dissident republicans. He criticised the Parades Commission's decision to allow the republican parade. 'The Parades Commission pandered to this outfit. They are incapable of reaching a resolution because they only want violence, they don't want settlement, they just want to derail the peace process,' he said. Police appealed for calm in the area. Anger: A youth throws a brick over a burning car towards police officers . Difficult night: Water cannon vehicles were used extensively and one non-lethal baton round fired. In total, four police officers were left injured following the clashes . The Protestant Orange Order is marking the Twelfth of July culmination of its summer marching season, with many parades across the region. It celebrates the victory of Protestant King William over Catholic King James. It has traditionally polarised Catholics and Protestants but violence has been confined to isolated pockets. Ardoyne has been the scene for trouble on this date for many years and has become a byword for inter-communal strife on that date, despite most people from the area disagreeing with violence. There was also violence in Londonderry’s nationalist Bogside, where petrol bombs were thrown at police and a car set alight. In south and east Belfast there were five arrests for a variety of offences including disorderly behaviour. Tussle: Police officers can be seen grabbing hold of a rioter . Held: The man is detained by police officers . Fury: Masked youths can be seen throwing objects at the police as the water cannon tried to disperse them . Rest: Tired riot police sit and reflect on a night of violence that left 20 of their colleagues injured . There has been trouble annually at Ardoyne in recent years following Orange parades through the area. This year around 15 Orangemen with banners paraded in silence through the residential area of red brick terraced housing in a token demonstration. There was a separate parade by republicans as well as protests by nationalist residents and loyalists in the area. Six men, aged 34, 28, 21, 19, 19 and 18, are to to appear at Belfast Magistrates’ Court later today charged with various public disorder offences.

A neighbourhood watch volunteer who helped police arrest a gang of drug addicts was today jailed for stealing a pensioner's £60,000 life savings to feed his secret cocaine habit. Paul Collins, 55, was a well-respected member of his local community in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. He even won a government grant to create a community garden there. But he was stealing money from an 89-year-old woman he had befriended to fund his drug habit. Collins exploited his position with . Home Watch and as head of a residents group to gain his victim’s trust . before persuading her to hand over her bank cards. He then drained up to £60,000 from her bank accounts to pay for cocaine, a car and a computer. Collins . even managed to get the vulnerable, housebound pensioner to sign him up . as power of attorney, putting him in charge of all her financial . affairs. The alarm was . raised in May 2011 when a social worker visited the elderly lady and was . told Collins had a key to her flat and access to her credit cards. Collins pleaded guilty  to one charge of fraud and one count of theft and was today jailed for 28 months at Bolton Crown Court. He met his victim in early 2010 as part of his involvement  in the Home Watch scheme, police said. He . was well-known for helping other elderly and disabled neighbours on the . Prestwich estate, where he was also head of the residents’ group. After initially running small errands for his victim, Collins offered to look after her financial interests and funeral plans. She gave him her bank cards, PIN numbers and other documentation for three bank accounts. Fall from grace: Collins, 55, was a well-respected member of his local community in Prestwich, Greater Manchester . Guilty: Collins admitted one charge of fraud and one count of theft and was today jailed for 28 months at Bolton Crown Court (pictured) In August 2010, her will was amended to make Collins executor and sole beneficiary of her estate in the event of her death. Towards the end of 2010, she was hospitalised for a few months. It was in February 2011, while she remained in hospital, that the . Lasting Power of Attorney Document was stamped and authorised, allowing . Collins to act on her behalf over her property and financial affairs. The . court heard £27,000 had been transferred directly to Collins’ bank . account using five separate cheques, signed by his unwitting victim. Another . £12,000 was taken from cash machines to buy a car for his daughter, . while a cheque for £4,000 was used to hire a car and buy a computer. Collins met his victim in early 2010 as part of his involvement in the Home Watch scheme . He spent just £6,000 on the victim. In . January 2010, her three bank accounts holding her life savings totalled . £61,205.67. By July 2011, there was just £554.79 left. A . victim impact statement read in court said the pensioner had been left . 'distressed’ and in poor health as she had regarded Collins as a trusted . friend. Keith Harrison, . defending, said Collins had not initially befriended the woman to steal . from her but later gave in to temptation because he was 'in the grip of . an addiction to cocaine'. The . court was told that Collins was previously a well-regarded community . volunteer who had helped police tackle anti-social behaviour committed by drug addicts. WPC Heather Jackson, speaking outside court today, described Collins' action as 'a calculated fraud'. She said: 'This . resulted in the loss of the life savings of a vulnerable 89-year-old . woman who believed Collins was a good friend who had her best interests . at heart. 'He has blown her life savings and left her penniless. This . despicable breach of trust has had a significant and detrimental impact . on her health and I hope she finds some comfort now he has been . jailed.' Chief .

An automatic block to protect children from internet porn has been ruled out by ministers, according to a leaked email. It says that internet firms have been privately assured they will not have to bring in stringent filtering systems. The revelation makes a farce of a consultation paper that was launched earlier this week asking for views on dealing with adult material. Campaign: The Daily Mail is calling for a robust automatic block to filter out porn by default . The email says ministers ‘wholeheartedly support active choice’ in which parents would have to say yes or no to adult material when setting up an internet connection. The Daily Mail is calling for a similar, but more robust, automatic block or ‘active choice plus’ system. Porn would be filtered out by default with users having to opt in to see it. The campaign has been backed by Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz and Sara Payne, the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah. Support: David Cameron last month said there was . a clear case for looking at default blocks on explicit sites. The . Mail's campaign has been backed by Sara Payne, right, the mother of . murdered schoolgirl Sarah . Last month David Cameron conceded there was a clear case for looking at default blocks. But this has been ruled out according to . the email sent on Thursday by Andrew Kernahan of the Internet Service . Providers’ Association to 200 members including BT, Virgin, Sky, AOL and . Cable & Wireless. ‘I spoke to the Department for Education this morning about the consultation and they made it clear that UKCCIS (the UK Council for Child Internet Safety), ministers and the relevant departments wholeheartedly support active choice and not default filtering or the so-called active choice plus solution,’ he wrote. ‘The only reason they are consulting on this is because No 10 told the Daily Mail that they would consult and listen to all views. Proposals: The Government launched a consultation paper an on 'opt-in' system, under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available . ‘This is in line with what we’ve been told throughout – that government supports active choice.’ John . Carr, who sits on the board of UKCCIS, said: ‘I am astounded by the . contents of this leaked email. It reflects a degree of cynicism which . does not fit with my expectations of this Government in this area. ‘Potentially, it means this whole consultation is a sham with the outcome already pre-determined.’ Helen Goodman, who is Labour’s media . spokesman, said: ‘This email is explosive. It is very important we have a . proper consultation which gives parents and children’s organisations . the chance to say why they want to put children first. It is time . ministers stood up for ordinary people rather than big business.’ The consultation, which was launched by children’s minister Tim Loughton last week, includes an option for ‘active choice plus’, which is favoured by child safety campaigners and many MPs. This option is being resisted by internet companies, which make millions from adverts for pornographic websites. In his email, Mr Kernahan, who is public affairs manager at the ISPA, described the ten-week consultation exercise as ‘essentially a questionnaire’. Last night he said: ‘This was a private email sent to our members. 'It was my take on where we are, which is that the Government and UKCCIS support active choice. ‘The point of the consultation is to get more evidence and views. 'I don’t think this is a foregone conclusion. I was stating the current position. ‘This issue is out to consultation and our members will be making their views known. We do support active choice as the most sensible solution.’ But Mr Carr, who is also secretary of the UK Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘There is growing evidence of the damage being done to children by unrestricted access to hardcore porn. 'We have never said there should be no porn on the internet. But if you want to have access to it, you should have to prove you are old enough to access it.’ Tory MP Claire Perry said: ‘This is exactly what I would expect from ISPA who have been constantly resistant to the idea of changing anything. ‘This issue matters to millions of parents and ordinary people across the country. 'This is even more reason why they should make their views heard in the consultation.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It is simply not true that ministers have already made up their minds, regardless of what one official may have said. 'The reported comments do not in any way reflect government policy. We are seeking views and evidence from everybody.’ Officials yesterday shut down the consultation exercise website following a security blunder. Site visitors were able to see other people’s confidential responses and personal details – including passwords and email addresses.","Leaked email says internet firms have been assured they will not face stringent filtering systems .

Five railway industry workers have been jailed for stealing £1.5million worth of track to sell for scrap. The 'industrial scale' thefts from Network Rail projects, including an upgrade of the West Coast Main Line in the Rugby area, saw lorry-loads of used rails diverted to unauthorised scrapyards. A judge sitting at Birmingham Crown Court today jailed John Burtenshaw, 53, Terence Doherty, 48, Stuart Amphlett, 33, Paul Tandon, 47, and 41-year-old Neil Jones for conspiracy to steal. Sentenced: Nicky Halloren, left, admitted conspiracy to steal and was given a one year suspended sentence. Roy Skinner, right, was given a nine month suspended sentence . Two other men - Nicky Halloran, 27, and 43-year-old Roy Skinner - were given suspended sentences after admitting respective charges of conspiracy to steal and theft. Doherty, a Jarvis rail firm sub-contractor, conspired with Burtenshaw, a Jarvis plant manager, to steal metal and sleepers which should have been taken to authorised recyclers. Network Rail would then have received the value of the scrap, the court heard. But Doherty and Burtenshaw used their positions to steal up to 3,500 tonnes of rail, their trial at Warwick Crown Court heard. The offences first came to light in August 2008 when a scrap dealer check in Staffordshire revealed 208 tonnes of rail had been removed from the Rugby upgrade project. Fraud: The men stole tracks as the West Coast mainline works was being carried out at Rugby, Warwickshire, the court heard . Jones and Tandon, who worked as supervisors for a sub-contractor, and Amphlett, a logistics manager for another firm, all subsequently became implicated in the scam. Detective Sergeant Chris Hearn said: 'Using various techniques we were able to track the movement of some of the stolen rail to scrap dealers in Birmingham, Bedfordshire and Liverpool. 'Inquiries at these dealers revealed more than 500 tonnes of rail had been moved by the conspirators, who were paid more than £71,500. 'Further investigation revealed a total of 3,500 tonnes of rail and other metal equipment from the Rugby project was unaccounted for, with a potential value of almost £1.5 million. 'There is no doubt that the actions of this organised group deprived Network Rail and, in turn rail users across the country, of valuable finance which could have been put towards maintenance and improvements.' Detective Sergeant Hearn said the men did a bad job of covering up their crime. Det Sgt Hearn said: 'I think these individuals felt it was like a secondary income - they felt they were entitled to steal off their employer. 'They felt they could steal from the railway and because they were so up front they left reasonable evidence trails.' Probe: Detective Sergeant Chris Hearn said the potential value of the theft was £1.5million . Neil Henry, Network Rail’s head of operations and performance, said the value of the material stolen could have been spent on improving passenger facilities at stations. 'I hope the sentences today make others stop and think before they consider stealing vital equipment from the railway,' he said. Doherty, from Warrington, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal from the West Coast Main Line and Manchester Metrolink and was sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment. Burtenshaw, from, Stoke Hammond, Buckinghamshire, was jailed for two years and nine months, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to steal from the West Coast Main Line. Halloran, from West Bromwich, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal from the West Coast Main Line and was sentenced to 12 months’ jail, suspended for 18 months. He was also ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work and given a three-month curfew.

Former Oakland Raiders defensive end Anthony Wayne Smith, whose murder trial stemming from a 2008 shooting death ended in a hung jury, was charged this week with three more Los Angeles County slayings from several years earlier. The new criminal complaint, filed on Monday, charges Smith, 43, with a total of four counts of first-degree murder, incorporating the original case against him and the kidnap-killings of three other men - one in 1999 and two in 2001. Special allegations listed in the complaint say the three earlier victims were tortured before being killed. Murder charges: Former NFL Defensive end for the Oakland Raiders Anthony Smith has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder . An arraignment has been set for July 17 on the new charges, and Smith remains held without bond, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, Sandi Gibbons, said on Thursday. Smith's lawyer, Michael Evans, said his client would plead not guilty to all the charges and that the new criminal complaint came as a 'surprise to all of us.' Smith, a first-round 1990 draft pick of the Raiders, then based in Los Angeles, and an 11th pick overall for the National Football League that year, played all seven seasons of his NFL career for the Raiders, first in Los Angeles and then in Oakland. Evans said he was informed of the new charges just 45 minutes before jury selection was set to begin on Monday in the retrial of the original case charging Smith with murder in the October 2008 slaying of an associate named Maurilio Ponce. Piling on: The charges against the former athlete, pictured in 1992, incorporate an original murder case dropped against him and the kidnap-killings of three other men - one in 1999 and two in 2001 . The first jury deadlocked 8-to-4 in favour of a guilty verdict, leading to a mistrial. The latest felony complaint charges Smith with three additional counts of first-degree murder in connection with the November 1999 slayings of brothers Kevin and Ricky Nettles, and the June 2001 killing of Dennis Henderson. According to Gibbons, the Nettles brothers were abducted from a car wash in Los Angeles by two individuals posing as police officers and were found shot to death the next day. About 19 months later, Henderson and another man, Terry Ware, were kidnapped in Los Angeles by several armed suspects, placed in separate cars and driven away. Ware was freed but Henderson's body was found in the back of a rental car the next day. He had been beaten and stabbed to death, Gibbons said. Pleas: Smith, pictured during his first murder charge that was dropped, plans to plead not guilty to all four counts against him . Gibbons said she had no further information about a possible motive or circumstances behind the killings. She said prosecutors would decide later whether to seek the death penalty against Smith. Homicide detectives assigned to the case were not immediately available for comment. Smith was charged in February 2011 along with two other men in connection with the slaying of Ponce, who was found shot to death on a remote roadside in Lancaster, California, north of Los Angeles, on Oct. 7, 2008. The defense has acknowledged that Smith and Ponce were once involved together in a cargo theft, and that Smith was seen driving Ponce's car a month after he was slain. But Evans has insisted that his client had nothing to do with Ponce's murder and argued during the trial that police lacked any physical evidence, such as DNA, fingerprints or gunpowder residue, linking him to the crime. He said Ponce had given Smith his car when Ponce stopped being able to make payments on it. Evans said he could not comment in detail about the three additional slayings because he had not yet seen evidence that prosecutors will be required to share with him.","Anthony Wayne Smith charged with four counts of first-degree murder .

An Alaskan resident has been arrested and charged in the 1985 killings of an elderly Washington state couple. Ricky Riffe, 53, was charged with first degree murder, kidnapping and other counts in the deaths of 81-year-old Edward Maurin and his 83-year-old wife, Wilhelmina Maurin. He was arrested on Sunday and yesterday he declined to waive extradition proceedings telling a judge in Anchorage during a hearing in a jailhouse courtroom 'Not at this time.' Waived: Ricky Riffe, an Alaskan resident charged in the 1985 killings of an elderly Washington state couple has declined to waive extradition proceedings . The couple died from shotgun blasts, and their bodies were found at the end of a road in Chehalis, Wash., five days after their family reported them missing. The Lewis County Sheriff's office says Riffe, of King Salmon, Alaska, and his brother, John Riffe, were the primary suspects all along , but probable cause for their arrest was not developed until much later when additional evidence was uncovered and witnesses came forward. 'Detectives feel many witnesses did not come forward during the time of the initial investigation due to being fearful of the Riffe brothers and possible retaliation for speaking out,' Lewis County Sheriff Steve Mansfield said in a statement earlier this week. Tragic: Edward Maurin, 81, and his wife, Wilhelmina Maurin, 83 died from shotgun blasts, and their bodies were found at the end of a road in Chehalis, Wash., five days after their family reported them missing . The brothers moved to Alaska in 1987. John Riffe died just before the sheriff's office bought tickets to Alaska to arrest both men. Washington investigators attended the brief hearing Wednesday and declined to comment afterward. So did Paul Miovas, an assistant attorney general for the state of Alaska. During the hearing, Miovas told the judge that the Washington authorities were present and 'they are interested in talking (Riffe) back to Washington.' Ricky Riffe is being held on $5 million bail. He told District Court Judge Alex Swiderski yesterday that he was in the process of hiring a lawyer. 'I don't want a public defender,' Riffe said. The bespectacled Riffe, who has silver hair and a long gray beard, wore yellow prison garb. According to authorities, the Riffe brothers kidnapped the couple then drove their car to a bank and forced them to withdraw $8,500. The couple was then shot inside their vehicle and their bodies were dragged to a wooded area, authorities said. On Dec. 19, 1985, Maurin relatives reported that the couple was not home as expected for a family Christmas party, Mansfield said. When their car was found, there were large blood stains inside and the keys were in the ignition. Mansfield said authorities are seeking to bring Riffe back to Lewis County to stand trial. In Alaska, Riffe is charged with being a fugitive from justice. An affidavit signed by an Alaska State Trooper shows the trooper assisted Lewis County investigators in the arrest.","Ricky Riffe is charged in the deaths of 81-year-old Edward Maurin, 81,  and his wife, Wilhelmina Maurin, 83 .

Pensioners who continue to work should pay National Insurance which could then be passed on as tax breaks to firms who employ young workers, a Tory MP said today. Therese Coffey said the extra revenue could also be passed on directly to young low-paid workers in the form of a National Insurance holiday. With the removal of the default retirement age, more people are expected to work for longer but those over 65 who continue in employment do not currently pay National Insurance on their earnings. Extra revenue: Pensioners who continue to work should pay NI which could then be passed on as tax breaks to firms who employ young workers, a Tory MP said . According to Treasury estimates, up to £2billion could be raised by changing the rules so pensioners pay NI. Ms Coffey said the extra revenue could be passed on to under-25s on less than £20,000-a-year. She said it could be worth an extra £375-a-year to an 18-year-old on the minimum wage of £4.98-an-hour, while saving their employer £450. For a 21-year-old, it would be £675 more per year and save the employer £800. The backbench MP for Suffolk Coastal said she was hopeful the idea could be adopted, particularly if the Chancellor George Osborne merges Income Tax and National Insurance. Ms Coffey said: 'For those who chose to continue working they are doing the same job and then get a pay rise when they turn 65. Proposal: Tory MP Therese Coffey claims up to £2billion could be raised by changing the rules so pensioners pay NI . 'One of the things I have found from . talking to employers is that they are not so keen to take on young . people and this would make it more attractive. 'When they take on somebody with 20 years of experience they are already really productive. 'I think in this challenging climate they are more likely to go for somebody with experience rather than somebody who is fresh.' Last month, a report by the respected Institute of Fiscal Studies found pensioners have enjoyed the fasting-rising incomes over the past decade. At the same time, it said, they will shoulder less of the burden of the coalition Government's tax and benefit changes than working age people. It found while pensioners' incomes have risen by 29.4 per cent since 1999, those of non-pensioners' have risen by just 26 per cent. Ms Coffey made the suggestion as part of a paper called Policy Bites, which has put forward seven proposals the Government could adopt to help businesses grow. Other ideas include building a third and fourth runway at Heathrow Airport, a suggestion from Tory MP Kwasi Kwarteng. Both Mr Kwarteng and Ms Coffey are members of the Free Enterprise Group, which has published the report. It is made up of 39 Tory MPs, mainly from the 2010 parliamentary intake, who are particularly interested in the Government's efforts to stimulate economic growth.",Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey said extra revenue could be passed on directly to young low-paid workers in form of a National Insurance holiday .

If Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has any ambitions to run for president, she is keeping them under tight wraps - and even her husband doesn’t know of her plans. 'I have no earthly idea what she'll decide to do,' her husband, former President Bill Clinton, said on CBS television's 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. Although Hillary Clinton went down to defeat to President Obama in a close primary contest in 2008, she has stayed in the public eye as the president's top diplomat. Power couple: Bill Clinton says he has 'no earthly idea' of whether his wife Hillary will seek the top office in 2016 . In that role, Clinton, who had been a U.S. Senator from New York, has built a reputation as a capable stateswoman and a loyal lieutenant to the president. She is frequently rated as the most popular member of Obama's cabinet. Clinton has said she will step down from her current job whether the president wins re-election to another four-year term on November 6 or not. 'She wants to take some time off, kind of regroup. Write a book,' her husband said. Presidential: Hillary Clinton has built a reputation as a capable stateswoman and a loyal lieutenant to President Obama . However, she is likely to remain an influential voice and questions about her political future will persist. Clinton's support among Dems is firm, and some had hoped Obama would boost his re-election chances by replacing the gaffe-prone Vice President Joseph Biden with her as his No. 2. While she has remained generally outside the political fray during this election season, her husband has seized a prominent role in campaigning for the president's re-election. Even so, Hillary Clinton, who was first lady when her husband was president from 1993-2001, is herself known as one of the Democratic Party's most influential and best-networked insiders.

Texas Governor Rick Perry's embarrassing inability to remember a government department he would eliminate if he became president, perhaps the biggest gaffe of the 2012 election campaign, was due to chronic lack of sleep, a new book has revealed. 'Oops' - a diary of covering the Perry campaign by Texas Tribune correspondent Jay Root - says Perry suffered from insomnia for weeks before the gaffe. The blunder occurred during a Republican presidential debate in Rochester, Michigan on November 9 last year. Scroll down for video . Stumbled: Governor Rick Perry's embarrassing gaffe during a Republican debate in December was down to insomnia, a new report has revealed . Trying to recall the three government departments he would eliminate if he became president, Perry said: 'I would do away with the Education, the, uh, Commerce, and, let's see. I can't. The third one I can't. Sorry. Oops.' He paused for an agonizing 53 seconds before conceding that he could not remember the Energy department, the third agency he would close. Root, who covered the Perry presidential campaign from the summer of 2011 to its end in early 2012, said Perry had battled insomnia most of the campaign. Perry stumbled in several debates and at one debate in Orlando, Florida, one of his answers was almost incoherent. Errors: Perry was unable to name the third federal department that he planned to do away with during a debate . 'Perry had kept in touch with his medical team, and by early October, days after the Florida fiasco, the campaign had urgently consulted sleep specialists, bringing them in to investigate. Sleep apnea causes the sufferer to have one or more pauses in breathing while asleep. These can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour. The condition is typically chronic and causes the breathing to become shallow, moving from deep sleep into light sleep. Sleep apnea often leaves the sufferer tired during the day because of poor quality of sleep at night. It can often go undiagnosed as the sufferer is unaware it is happening. Obstructive sleep apnea, where the airway collapses, is the most common. Anyone can be affected by this condition although it is more common in overweight people. 'After conducting overnight tests on Perry, they produced a rather startling diagnosis: He had sleep apnea, and it had gone undetected for years, probably decades,' Root said. Perry's unraveling began in earnest after back surgery in mid-June, 2011. The Texas governor took pain killers for a few weeks after the surgery but refused to continue them because he said he wanted to be mentally sharp for the campaign. By October, Perry was diagnosed with sleep apnea, a chronic condition in which a patient sleeps so lightly that he is constantly waking and breathing can stop for a moment. Perry was given a machine that helps breathing become more regular during sleep. But at the same time he complained of pain in his leg and foot that might have been a result of the surgery. This kept him from sleeping, Root says. A request for comment from the governor's office on Saturday did not receive an immediate response. On the campaign trail: Perry, speaking in South Carolina in January, left the race to be Republican candidate in January .",Texas governor tried for 53 seconds to remember the energy department at debate in Michigan .

He allegedly fired the gun in the store and struggled with an employee who tried to disarm him. Witnesses reported Anderson fleeing the store while threatening to commit suicide, only to be reported 20 minutes later at the Adams Bank on East Cheyenne Mountain Blvd. After making off with an unspecified amount of cash from the bank, less than five minutes later he was reported at the UMB Bank on the same boulevard, but was thwarted by a security guard and employees who wouldn't let him inside.

When I turned up on set for my new ITV1 hidden camera series Fool Britannia, I thought someone was playing a joke on me. There were 25 crew waiting to get started, compared to the five of us who made Trigger Happy TV back in 2000. How can you secretly film people with 25 crew hanging about, I thought? It soon became apparent, however, that these people were going to make my life a whole lot easier so I could concentrate on what I was good at: approaching strangers as different characters and causing mayhem. The cameramen used all sorts of methods to conceal themselves. We even had a ‘pram-cam’, with a camera inside instead of a baby. At first it looked a bit weird with a beefy bloke pretending to play with his baby for hours on end, so we provided him with a female member of the production team to look like his wife and it all appeared a bit less suspicious. We also used workmen’s tents. We’d set these up in the middle of a square, and it was incredible how no one paid them a blind bit of notice. The idea was to film stuff all over Britain... and we did just that. It was mostly a very easy and happy shoot, but when you’re dealing with the general public you never quite know what’s going to happen. We were filming in the Cotswolds at Bourton-On-The-Water with me as a vicar who can’t help behaving badly, and I had just pretended to spray a cyclist (the vicar loathes cyclists) with Mace. The cyclist then crashes into the river. Normally passers-by just watch whatever scene is being acted out and do that very British thing of not wanting to get involved. This time, however, an angry man announced he was going to headbutt me. Hidden fear: Dom Joly had to stop filming his new series in Spain after he was threatened by a man claiming to be a member of the local mafia . But I stood my ground, as I presumed most people who headbutt people don’t announce the fact in advance. This was very nearly a big mistake, as at least four times he pulled his head back as if to strike. He calmed down when he learned it was for TV and found it very funny . . . until he remembered that the lady he was with was not his wife and quickly refused all consent for us to show it. This turned out to be a common theme while we were filming. You’d be amazed at the number of people who aren’t with the person they’re supposed to be with. We also spent a week targeting British tourists in Benidorm, which is where I nearly came to sticky end. I was playing a Spanish lothario, with tight leather pants and flowing locks, and was about to approach some English ‘ladeeez’ on the beach. Out of the blue, a huge Italian appeared and squared up to me. It turned out he was convinced I’d been driving a car that had knocked him off his motorbike. To make things worse, I was told in terrified, hushed whispers that he was ‘local mafia’. An executive decision was taken and I was bundled into a van and driven back to the hotel, where I spent the rest of the day in the pool as it was considered too dangerous to film. Nice work if you can get it! Fool Britannia, ITV1 Saturdays, 6.55pm.",Comedian Dom Joly tells all about the scares of filming with hidden cameras .

A 'nervous, happy and desperate to get on with it' Nick Grimshaw made his debut as the new host of the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show today. The Oldham-native, 28, took to the microphone at 6.30am for his first day, kicking off the show with Kanye West and Jay-Z's duet N***** In Paris. Before his first track, Nick introduced himself: 'So this is happening, it's actually happening. Good morning Britain, I'm Nick Grimshaw. Scroll down for video . New boy: Nick Grimshaw looks contemplative on his first day hosting the Radio 1 Breakfast Show . 'It's time to follow in the footsteps . of people I like, like Chris Moyles and Sara Cox. I'm nervous, happy . and desperate to get on with it. 'It's . time to start the difficult job of talking between records. I've been . dreaming about this since I was a little boy. Let's do it.' Nick's appointment in the role comes after previous breakfast show host Chris Moyles left following eight and half years. Nick himself had previously hosted a late night show before his new role was announced in July. Support: Fellow Radio 1 DJs (L-R) Scott Mills, Fearne Cotton, Dev, Zane Lowe and Huw Stephens came to visit . Although Nick played the radio edit . of the foul-mouthed Jay-Z and Kanye track, he joked if he had played the . unedited version it would have been 'the world's shortest stint on the Radio 1 breakfast show - three and a half minutes'. Among . the celebrity guests on the show were his good friend Harry Styles, who . talked about One Direction's new video and album on the phone, and a . pre-recorded interview with Justin Bieber. Nick ended up teasing a mumbling Harry by playing a brief bit of the wrong track instead of One Direction's new song Live While We're Young, joking: 'Sorry, my finger slipped.' After fellow Radio 1 DJ Fearne Cotton later noted Harry didn't sound too happy by Nick's 'slip-up', the new breakfast show host replied: 'After he said Radio 1 instead of Capital Radio by mistake at the Brit Awards, he needs us - where else is he going to go? ""Oh I’m just popping into Heart"" – I don’t think so!' Time to get up! Nick was greeted by people in chicken costumes for his first morning on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show . Ahead of his arrival at the Radio 1 studios in central London, Nick was greeted outside the building by two people in chicken costumes, who gave him a year's supply of Kenco coffee to help him get up in the morning. Speaking to Radio 1’s Newsbeat after the show, he said: “It feels weird, I feel a relief now, the first day is done and it was the first show. Obviously a lot of people were waiting to hear it and there was a lot of anticipation of what the show would sound like, so yes it’s good to get the first one done. 'Today I guess was a lot like an introduction and repeating myself, saying my name a lot. Tomorrow I can do a more regular show and tell a few more stories.' On his own: Nick is the main star of the show, in contrast to Chris Moyles's 'zoo' format . 'In between the celeb guests, Nick was funny, cool, collected, and played actual - gasp - music.' Now magazine . 'Grimmy’s first show was fast-paced, full of celebrity banter and, most importantly, fun.' Daily Mirror . 'A promising start – and a clear break from what went before. It was out with dad rock, cynicism and bloatedly self-indulgent banter; in with dance beats, youthful energy and enthusiasm for new music... The show has swapped one who prefers music to the sound of his own voice; one much more in touch with its target audience of teens and twentysomethings.' Daily Telegraph . 'The message in the opening show – which was a likeable mix of music, self-deprecating chat, interaction on social media, interviews, silly features and funny, often quite bitchy quips – was that the power here has shifted and lies squarely in the music... A very promising, refreshing start that politely suggested the over-30s might like to retune.' The Guardian . The T4 presenter's new role on the breakfast show is a bid to lower Radio 1's demographic after a report by the BBC Trust found the station needed to work harder to attract younger listeners. In research published last November, it was claimed the average Radio 1 listener was 32 and went up to 33 for 38-year-old Moyles' breakfast show. In a bid to attract younger listeners, the music policy seems a lot younger, with a heavier dance influence than had been broadcast on Moyles' show. Nick will aim to play between eight to 10 songs an hour - double the amount played on Moyles' show. Instead of Moyles' 'zoo' format of his production team, the Grimes show will mostly feature his voice with more phone-ins from the audience. Nick previously admitted he had problems . getting up in the morning and told his listeners he had bought a . wake-up light that gradually uses light and bird song to wake him up . gently in the morning. Showing . there was no hard feelings, Chris actually sent a good luck gift to . Nick, who read out the card live on air: 'Good luck with the new show, . enjoy it see you soon, from Chris, former owner of the breakfast show.' Nick told his listeners: 'Ahh! I texted him on holiday and said ""Thank you for being nice to me in the paper."" 'Chris replied, ""You'll be great, but not as great as me."" 'And . now he's sent me some cakes, thank you Christopher, very nice. No . pressure. And weird to not listen to him in the morning! I used to be . able to tell how late I was based on which feature.' Friendly face: Nick's close friend Pixie Geldof and her dog paid a visit to the Radio 1 studios . One of his biggest cheerleaders was close friend Pixie Geldof, who woke up early to listen to her pal, before heading in to visit him at the studio at the end of his shift. She . wrote on Twitter: 'Up early for @grimmers !!!!! So proud!!! Epic music . at the beginning of the radio one breakfast show with NICK GRIMSHAW! '@grimmers obsessed with when they say ""radio 1 breakfast show with nick grimshaw"" so emo.' Among those to give him praise were veteran DJ Simon Mayo, who presented the R1 morning show from 1987-1993. Simon tweeted: 'Nick Grimshaw sounding a lot less terrified and a lot more organised than I did. In 1987.'

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 13:31 EST, 8 January 2012 . As the world marks the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s demise at the end of 1991, the U.S.-Russian effort to lock up nuclear weapons and avoid a doomsday scenario has been revealed. Soviet nukes falling into the hands of rogue states or terrorists has, as far as is known, remained fiction, despite occasional doubts about whether the system was airtight. The vast nuclear arsenal, scattered among several newly independent nations, was secured because Russian military officers acted with professionalism and honesty, Moscow and Washington shared clear priorities, and the U.S. taxpayer coughed up billions of dollars, former top officials who dealt with the Soviet nuclear legacy say. Destroyed missiles: A worker cuts a Soviet-made aviation cruise missile X-22, able to carry nuclear charge, on the military base Ozerne in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, in 2002, it was one of the first to be destroyed . There's the Russian scientist who perhaps went to work for Iran's nuclear program, an old claim that portable nuclear devices went astray, the seizures of smuggled fissile material in the 1990s. But difficult though it is to prove a nuclear negative, U.S. and Russian officials insist in interviews with The Associated Press that the fears of the 1990s have not become a reality, even though the challenges of safeguarding Soviet nukes were daunting at the time. ‘Twenty years on it's pretty hard to believe that not a single nuclear weapon has shown up loose,’ said Graham Allison, who played a key role in the effort as an assistant secretary of defense under President Bill Clinton and now heads Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. A quick U.S.-sponsored deal had Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan handing all their nukes over to Russia, and American cash helped safeguard the weapons at a time when the new governments couldn't even afford to pay military wages on time. Additional U.S. incentives offered jobs to disgruntled nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union, many of whom were courted by nations like Iran. There have been gnawing fears that a few Soviet nukes still might have gone missing, but experts with inside knowledge say that if it were true the world would already know. ‘If somebody or a terrorist group got hold of a nuclear weapon, they would probably use it as quickly as possible,’ said Steven Pifer, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, held other senior State Department posts and is now director of the Brookings Institution's Arms Control Initiative. A Ukrainian army officer looks at the destroyed SS-24 missile silo near the town of Pervomaisk in Ukraine's Nikolayev region in 2001 . ‘So the fact that you haven't seen a nuclear detonation ... reflects the fact that the nuclear weapons have been maintained in a secure way.’ That was no mean achievement given the enormous proliferation risks posed by the Soviet breakup. The economic meltdown of the early 1990s forced many officers of the once-proud Soviet Army to moonlight as security guards or even cab drivers. And with the wars and ethnic clashes triggered by the Soviet collapse came strong incentives to steal weapons for the black market. The immediate task for the Russian military was to quickly remove thousands of battlefield weapons such as nuclear artillery shells and land mines from other Soviet nations. These relatively compact arms posed the biggest proliferation risk and often were stored close to areas of conflict. ‘The military officers who did the job were the unknown heroes,’ said Alexander Golts, a Russian independent analyst. ‘It's hard to imagine what might have happened if the tactical nuclear weapons had remained on the territories of the states involved in military conflicts.’ A museum employee in the Russian Federal Nuclear Centre, pictured in 1997, showing the first Soviet nuclear bomb, that was tested for the first time in 1949 . The next goal, strongly backed by Washington, was to remove strategic nuclear weapons from Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The first two agreed quickly, but Ukraine, which had inherited enough of the Soviet arsenal to be the world's third largest nuclear power, balked at the plan, setting the stage for years of diplomatic battles. A war for custody of nukes? ‘All this was quite terrifying,’ said Allison. Pifer said that some Ukrainian officials longed to keep them, but around 1992 concluded their country had neither the money nor the expertise to remain a nuclear power. Also, the world's worst nuclear disaster had happened in 1986 at Chernobyl, in Ukraine, and public opinion wasn't keen on keeping nukes. Still, Ukraine bargained for years for compensation in tough talks that sometimes made even seasoned diplomats lose their temper. ‘There was a lot of pressure, they threatened us with all kinds of economic sanctions, they wanted to get this issue over with fast,’ Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's then president, told the AP. Ukraine insisted the U.S. provide hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for safeguarding and dismantling the arsenal. From Russia it demanded nuclear fuel as compensation for the highly enriched uranium in the warheads. And it wanted security guarantees from all the nuclear powers. ‘We didn't want to get naked for free,’ Kravchuk said. The world's worst nuclear disaster had happened in 1986 at Chernobyl (pictured in 1998), in Ukraine, and public opinion wasn't keen on keeping nukes . Tensions over which country military officers in Ukraine should swear allegiance to — Russia or Ukraine — also stoked tensions. In February, 1992 an entire squadron of combat jets flew from Ukraine to Russia after their pilots refused to take the oath. Ukraine eventually got the money and security guarantees it was seeking, but the Russians had other obstacles to overcome. For instance, the economy was so bad that the military struggled to pay wages on time, and top brass were reduced to struggling to give the strategic nuclear forces personnel better rations, said Maj.-Gen. (Ret.) Vladimir Dvorkin, a nuclear weapons expert in the Russian Defense Ministry in the early 1990s. Control over the security of nuclear weapons never slackened, Dvorkin said. ‘People realised their responsibility because they were fully aware of the dangers.’ Nuclear arsenals surrendered by former Soviet republics had to be safely transported long distances to centralized storage sites and secured. Dismantling missiles, bombers and submarines as required by the 1991 START treaty with the U.S. also required huge funds. ‘Russia badly needed assistance,’ Dvorkin said, and the U.S. responded quickly with the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program initiated by Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, which provided billions of dollars in equipment and know-how to help Russia and its neighbours deal with the Soviet nuclear legacy. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton speaking in Moscow in 1998, Clinton played a key role in the efforts between the U.S. and Russia to protect the weapons . ‘It seems to me that Nunn-Lugar was one of the smartest uses of defense dollars we ever made,’ Pifer said. Under the program, the U.S. provided reinforced rail cars to carry nuclear warheads, high-tech security systems for storage sites and dismantling mothballed nuclear subs. ‘The program provided colossal support,’ Dvorkin said. Building on their cooperation in securing the Soviet nuclear arsenals, Moscow and Washington moved later to reduce the number of nuclear weapons held by both sides, most recently with the New START deal signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev that took effect last year. But while Dvorkin says the military in Russia and other ex-Soviet nations kept tight control over atomic weapons, numerous civilian agencies were far less diligent in keeping track of nuclear materials at their disposal. ‘Fissile materials at nuclear power plants were controlled by one agency, and research reactors were in the hands of another one,’ he said. Oversight at civilian structures was less stringent than in the military, creating conditions for a steady string of thefts of radioactive materials in the early 1990s, which were later seized by police in Germany and other European nations. ‘There were such cases, but they didn't entail catastrophic consequences,’ Dvorkin said, noting that the amounts of uranium and plutonium seized in Germany and elsewhere were extremely small, each measuring just a few grams. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (left) and US President Barack Obama at a ceremony to sign a new Russian-US (START) nuclear arms reduction treaty in Prague in 2010 . Another major worry for the West was that scientists with nuclear know-how would be hired by unfriendly forces. The U.S. responded quickly by setting up research centers that distributed grants to scientists ‘so that they can do civilian research and do it in Russia and avoid the temptations perhaps to go to countries such as North Korea and Iran,’ Pifer said. ‘Thousands of scientists participated in this project in Russia and Ukraine, so we know of thousands of people who stayed behind,’ he said. ‘Whether we got everybody, I don't know.’ Iran was working actively to attract scientists from Russia and other ex-Soviet lands, and the International Atomic Energy Agency in a report released in November said a foreign expert helped Iran on some of its alleged weapons-related experiments by working on ways to set off a nuclear blast through a sophisticated multipoint explosives trigger. Diplomats identified him as former Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko, who worked in Iran for several years. Despite the assurances from Russian and U.S. officials that no Soviet nukes got lost in the chaos of the post-Soviet years, allegations occasionally surfaced that some of the weapons went missing. Gen. Alexander Lebed, who headed Russia's Security Council for several months in 1996, made the most stunning of such claims in 1997, saying the military lost track of dozens of suitcase-sized portable nuclear devices. Lebed issued several contradictory statements about the number missing, and Russian officials rejected his claim. Dvorkin said Lebed, who died in a helicopter crash in 2002, didn't know what he was talking about. ‘I personally know people who were counting the weapons at centralised depots, and they have confirmed that nothing was stolen,’ he said. ‘They did the check after Lebed's statements and made sure that everything was in place.’","U.S. incentives offered jobs to disgruntled nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union .

They spent the Christmas holidays slogging across the seas - and were left without fresh water for two of the seven-and-a-half gruelling weeks they rowed across the Atlantic. But six injured British servicemen, including four amputees, showed off their sheer mental and physical strength by arriving in Barbados' Port St Charles yesterday. The ocean conquering heroes, who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, were greeted by cheering crowds as they completed their 3,000 mile challenge to raise £1million for wounded comrades. Scroll down for video... Arrived: Six British servicemen, including four amputees, showed off their sheer mental and physical strength by completing a row across the Atlantic by arriving in Barbados' Port St Charles . Heroes: The ocean champions were greeted by cheering crowds as they completed their 3,000 mile challenge to raise £1million for wounded comrades . They endured no running water, comfortable bed or toilet - and all have sores from exposure to sea salt and claw hand - the almost-arthritic effect of gripping the oars so tightly. But life on the boat was remarkably similar to that experienced while on tour, said amputee Lt Will Dixon, platoon commander with Third Battalion, The Rifles. He said: 'We've all been on operations in Iraq or Afghanistan and you go through the same things that you miss. 'It's always clean running water, clean fresh bedsheets, hot showers and you always promise yourself you won't take those things for granted. Proud: The crew endured no running water, comfortable bed or toilet - and all now have sores from exposure to sea salt and claw hand - the almost-arthritic effect of gripping the oars so tightly . Greeted: The crew were welcomed into Barbados by former servicemen . 'Then you find that you start to, until you're back in that situation.' Dixon, who had to learn to walk again with a prosthetic limb after losing his left leg below the knee when an IED detonated under his vehicle in Afghanistan in December 2009, said men slept in shifts, eating 800-calorie freeze-dried meals. But when the boat's desalinator broke, three weeks after they set off from La Gomera in the Canary Islands, they had no way to make fresh water to add to their food and so had to ration themselves. They ate 'snack packs' made up of sweets, cereal bars, fruit and nuts, and energy drinks for 14 days. Dixon added: 'That kind of thing affects the crew in different ways. Working hard: The crew endured miserable conditions aboard the boat, with no fresh water for 14 days when they had to eat snack packs to keep going . Somewhere in the Atlantic: The crew paused for a seasonal pose on Christmas Day - pictured front row (left to right) Will Dixon, Neil Heritage, Rory Mackenzie. Back row (left to right) Carl Anstey, Ed Janvrin, Alex Mackenzie . 'I came into this row pretty much overweight so for me the calories has not been as important but I really struggled when we were low on water. 'I seem to have lost a lot of weight, about two stone. But a couple of members of the crew could have done with my rolls of fat, they've been very hungry at times.' And when it came to relieving themselves, he said it was time for the crew to go back to nature. Ready to go: Servicemen (left to right) Alex Mackenzie, Rory Mackenzie, Neil Heritage, Will Dixon, Carl Anstey, Ed Janvrin as the group of British servicemen prepared to embark on their gruelling challenge . 'Essentially we squatted over the edge . of the boat, so it's straight into the sea. But if the waves were . going, at least you got a bit of a bidet effect.' Thousands of miles across tempestuous seas from one continent to another, the Atlantic Challenge is considered one of the toughest trials on the planet. Travelling along the route fabled to have been taken by Christopher Columbus more than 500 years ago, teams cover nearly 3,000 miles on the journey between La Gomera in the Canary Islands and Port St Charles, Barbados. Setting off in December to avoid coinciding with the end of the hurricane season, teams aim to get the maximum benefit from the easterly trade winds and Atlantic currents. In 1966 Sir Chay Blyth and John Ridgeway performed their legendary open-boat row across the Atlantic Ocean in English Rose III. The trip took 92 days and it laid the foundation for the Atlantic Challenge. Since then more and more people have tried it - this year's Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge began on December 4 with 17 teams. Boats are 23ft long and 6ft 6in wide, with only a small cabin for protection against storms. Three . other members of the crew are also amputees, including corporal Neil . Heritage, 31, who had a double above-knee amputation after being blown . up in Iraq in November 2004. Corporal Rory Mackenzie, 30, lost his right leg in a roadside bombing in Basra City in January 2007. And Lance Corporal Carl Anstey, 26, needs a leg brace to walk after a blast from a rocket-propelled grenade in Afghanistan in January 2009. The team, dubbed Row2Recovery, was completed by able-bodied ex-captains Janvrin and Mackenzie, 32 and 33. Writing on the team's blog yesterday, Cpl Heritage said: 'I've got some tough moments ahead, like mastering the art of walking again on my prosthetics after losing a lot of muscle on my stumps as a result of being sat down for extended periods, but it will have been worth it.' Dixon added: 'I think it's going to be similar for all the amputees. 'I have lost a lot of weight around my stump. 'I row in a prosthetic and had to pad that out with socks and have to keep adding socks each time I lose weight. 'It's fine for sitting and rowing but I think it might be difficult when I try to walk.' Queen Elizabeth II sent a message of support to the team. Her Majesty said: 'Please convey my warm thanks to all the members of the Row2Recovery team on the occasion of them reaching the end of their row across the Atlantic, in aid of injured soldiers and their families. 'I heard of the trials and tribulations on your journey and, in return, I send my good wishes to you all for the successful completion of the challenge.' The crew were one of 17 teams from across the world crossing the Atlantic as part of the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge. Money they raise is to be distributed between three military charities: Help for Heroes, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) and ABF, The Soldiers' Charity.","Row2Recovery team arrived in Port St Charles .

But the cookery writer has now added a sprinkling of extra detail, admitting: ‘Seriously I wouldn’t dream of making filo pastry because it would take me a long time. ‘And Paul doesn’t make it either. It’s very thin. I made it at college and know the principles. 'It was an excellent challenge to have on the programme because it is something really difficult and they had the time, but if I’m at home I’m very, very busy, I have other things to do. ‘I can buy it for £2 in a packet and buy a good one.

So perhaps it is only natural she should fall for a dashing stunt pilot. The former Countdown presenter, 51, has started dating a former Red Arrows Squadron Leader 14 years her junior. On set: Carol Voderman and her new boyfriend Red Arrows pilot Graham Duff out and about at Knebworth House . It is thought she met 37-year-old  Graham Duff – a separated father of one – at a Red Arrows charity ball. Miss Vorderman has for a long time been a supporter of the elite squadron, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team. It is not known whether Mr Duff has given her flying lessons. A friend of the TV presenter said: ‘Carol and Graham started dating very recently. Everyone knows him as Duffy, he’s a nice guy and going through a divorce. He separated and moved to London a while ago. ‘Obviously they are in the v . ery early stages of a relationship, and it may or may not work out for them, but they seem fond of each other.’ Miss Vorderman invited Mr Duff to . join her on the set of Food, Glorious Food, a cooking talent show which . she presents, on Saturday.

Mr Duff looked on proudly as she filmed the fifth audition round of the show in the grounds of Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, and seemed delighted to be introduced to some of her friends between takes. Miss Vorderman, a mother of two, recently revealed she hopes to pass her private pilot’s licence this year. She said: ‘Once I’ve got the licence, I plan to start training in aerobatics. It’s the showing off bit of flying. It takes years to master, but I’m keen to learn.’ Mr Duff joined the Red Arrows in 2008 and until recently lived in Scothern, near the squadron’s Lincolnshire base. The former RAF pilot has flown fighter jets in Iraq and last year climbed Mount Everest, raising almost £20,000 for charity. He left the Red Arrows in 2010 and has set up a business developing mobile phone apps. Ace job: Stunt pilot Mr Duff steps inside the cockpit of his Red Arrows plane .

"By . Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 05:22 EST, 26 September 2012 . In the latest string of shocking sex assault allegations in the military, eight female Marines stationed at one of the country’s most prestigious bases filed a lawsuit today claiming U.S. military officers tolerate a ‘staggering’ level of sexual assaults. Lt Ariana Klay and Lt Elle Helmer both claim they were raped at the U.S. Marine Barracks in Washington D.C., one of the most prestigious bases in the country. They said that in addition to being raped with little or no justice following the alleged incidents, their fellow Marines ridiculed them for being ‘sluts’ and ‘walking mattresses.’ Scroll down for video . No justice: Lt Elle Helmer, left, and Lt Ariana Klay, right, both claim they were raped in the Washington, D.C. barracks, and were later mocked by fellow Marines, who called them 'sluts' Prestigious: The Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. are regarded as one of the best in the nation . Death threat: Lt Klay alleged that the men threatened to kill her, then began raping her. The lawsuit accuses the military of a having a 'high tolerance for sexual predators in their ranks' One of the plaintiffs in the case is Lt Ariana Klay, who graduated with honours from the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marine Corps, and went on to serve in Iraq, claims that her rapists threatened to kill her and said they wanted to humiliate her. The lawsuit claims that once Lt Klay began serving at the Marine Barracks in Washington, she encountered an atmosphere of ‘harassment and abuse that culminated in Lt Klay being gang-raped at her private residence one block away from the base’ in August 2010. The document alleges that several senior officers made verbal sexual advances toward her, and the sexual assault culminated when her civilian boss and her commanding officer allegedly entered her residence. Lt Klay told the Today show: ‘They threatened me with death and raped me.’ She added: ‘(My commanding officer) said that I had humiliated him in front of his junior Marines and he wanted to humiliate me back.’ Elle Helmer, who was the former Barracks public information officer and a lieutenant, said she was also raped by a superior officer back in March 2006, the Today show reported. Lt Helmer told the Today show that a Marine Barracks officer ‘grabbed my shoulder and pushed me against the wall and tried to kiss me.’ Mocked: The lawsuit alleges that aside from their rapists facing no charges, the female Marines faced ridicule from their peers, who called them 'walking mattresses' and 'sluts' Farce: One Marine in charge of filing complains posted a supposedly-satirical 'Hurt Feelings Report' to their Facebook page, with reasons for filing including 'I am a cry baby' and 'I want my mommy' Service: Lt Klay, who graduated with honours from the U.S. Naval Academy, joined the Marine Corps, and went on to serve in Iraq, claims that her rapists threatened to kill her and said they wanted to humiliate her . When she tried to flee, she said the officer ‘slammed the door on my arm and pulled me back in.’ After that moment, Lt Helmer said she lost consciousness, but is sure of what happened. ‘I have zero doubt that my company commander raped me the night of March 16,’ she said. However, officials at the Marine Barracks said the allegations were ‘thoroughly investigated’ and found to be uncorroborated, the Today show said. The . Department of Defence estimates that more than 19,000 military men and . women were sexually assaulted by fellow troops in 2010 alone while . serving in the U.S. armed forces. At . least 20 per cent of servicewomen and one per cent of men - an . estimated 500,000 troops - have experienced sexual trauma while serving. In most cases, a rape . victim’s only judicial recourse is to report the attack to his or her . commander, even if it was the officer who attacked them, and it is the . officer’s decision whether or not to investigate and prosecute. The lawsuit says that the men in question were in no way punished. Beyond that, he was featured on a nationally televised recruitment commercial while under investigation. However, after Lt Klay reported the rapes, the Marine Corps said she must have welcomed the assaults because she wore make up and skirts – which were part of her regulated uniform – and exercised in running shorts, the lawsuit claims. Lt Helmer was recruited from The Basic School to server as Public Affairs Officer at the barracks. In a statement, she said that a photograph of her was required as part of the application, and that she was selected because the Marine Barracks wanted an attractive female to serve as a ‘poster child.’ She alleges that after a mandatory night of drinking with fellow officers, a Marine Major attempted to kiss her back at the Barracks. Lt Helmer resisted, and awoke the next morning in his office, wearing his shorts. Despite reporting to a senior officer that she had been raped, the lawsuit alleges that little was done immediately after to investigate. NCIS conducted a short investigation with inconclusive results, and the Marine Corps ‘lost’ her rape kit. Happier times: Lt Klay, far left, pictured with her brother David. After Lt Klay reported the rapes, the Marine Corps said she must have welcomed the assaults because she wore make up and skirts . The lawsuit is the latest in an alarming number of sexual assault allegations and estimation by secretary of Defence Leon Panetta that more than 19,000 assaults annually occur within the ranks. The lawsuit also brings forward a ‘Hurt Feelings report’ posted by a female officer in charge of Marine barracks protocol. The report, intended to be satirical, brutally mocks those making the complaints, with some reasons for filing the report being ‘I am a little b*tch,’ ‘I am a cry baby,’ and ‘I want my mommy,’ the Today show said. Lt Klay and Lt Helmer first spoke publically about their stories in The Invisible War, a documentary slated to be released this spring that looks into the alarming amount of sexual assaults and rapes within ranks.

"By . Rebecca Seales . UPDATED: . 09:14 EST, 3 February 2012 . Fantasist: Menachem Youlus pleaded guilty to fraud after he obtained almost $1 million by inventing Indiana Jones-style adventures . A Jewish charity founder who claimed he travelled the world as a 'Jewish Indiana Jones' to rescue holy scrolls has admitted he was a $1 million fraudster. Menachem Youlus told the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, New York he lied about making risky trips to obtain vintage Torah scrolls in Europe and Israel for six years. The texts are sacred to the Jewish faith, and followers believe they contain the rules that God intended mankind to live by. Among the fantastical tales Youlus invented were detailed accounts of recovering Torah lost or hidden during the Holocaust, including at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland and the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Youlus, 50, who owns the Jewish . Bookstore in Wheaton, Maryland, allegedly boasted that he had been . 'beaten up, thrown in jail, and gone $175,000 into debt, to bring these . holy scrolls out of less-than-friendly places, back to safety and a new . life.' The court heard he had fabricated . various exploits between 2004 and 2010 in order to obtain funds from his . Save a Torah charity and some of its contributors. 'I know what I did was wrong, and I deeply regret my conduct,' Youlus said yesterday. Prosecutors . claim the would-be adventurer defrauded his charity and its donors out . of $862,000 (£544,000), and are calling for him to serve up to five . years and three months in prison. During his guilty plea, Youlus said his lies included telling prospective buyers that he had personally retrieved parts of one scroll from a metal box at Auschwitz, which he located and unearthed using a metal detector. A buyer who believed this tale paid about $32,000 (£20,000) directly to Youlus' bookstore to buy the Auschwitz Torah, then donated it to a Manhattan synagogue which staged a large ceremony to honour its resettlement. Youlus also falsely claimed to have discovered a Torah in 2002 that had been hidden under the floor of a barracks at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany during World War II. This lie was debunked by a historian at the Bergen-Belsen Memorial Museum, who told prosecutors the bookseller's 'rescue' was impossible because the barracks was completely destroyed by the British Army after the camp's liberation. Priceless: Torah scrolls contain Jewish religious teachings, and are items of huge significance in the Jewish faith. Many were destroyed and desecrated by the Nazis during the Second World War . U.S. Postal Inspector Greg Ghiozzi, who prepared the criminal complaint against Youlus, said he told the president of his charity that he had borrowed over $150,000 (£94,000) and over $200,000 (£126,000) on his credit cards and against his home to acquire and repair 15 Torah that were facing rapid deterioration or destruction, including 10 from an unspecified Russian general and five from a monastery in Kiev, Ukraine. The complaint said Youlus had distributed Torah he bought from American dealers to synagogues and congregations across the country, sometimes at inflated rates. It said he put nearly a third of the $1.2 million (£760,000) collected by the charity into his personal accounts, spending $90,000 (£56,000) on private school tuition for his children and on personal expenses, including meals and healthcare. Fictional adventurer: Harrison Ford played action hero Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and relic-hunter, in George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's cult film franchise . The publicly-stated mission of the charity was to locate and acquire Torah that survived the Holocaust or had been taken from Jewish communities worldwide and repair them so they could be used in communities that need them. But authorities said Youlus rarely left the U.S. during the years he had claimed to be unearthing Torah. Youlus apparently dubbed himself 'the Jewish Indiana Jones' at a Torah dedication in 2004, referencing the treasure-hunting adventure hero played by Harrison Ford in the 1981 Stephen Spielberg film 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said of Youlus: 'He chose poorly in allegedly exploiting an excruciating chapter in Jewish and international history to perpetrate a brazen fraud that played on the heartstrings of the people for whom the painful memories of that period will never die.' Youlus' lawyer Benjamin Brafman has said he will seek leniency at the bookseller's sentence hearing on 21 June, describing him as 'a good man with the best of intentions who ultimately strayed into fraudulent conduct that he now accepts full responsibility for'. The Torah is the first part of the Jewish bible, the most important document in Judaism. It is made up of five books, which Jews believe were dictated by God to the prophet Moses on Mount Sinai. The ten commandments are among the writings contained in the texts, which in Judaism provide a guide to God's laws. Torah scrolls are handwritten in Hebrew on parchment from a kosher animal, usually a cow. The teachings are so sacred that it is said that if a scroll is accidentally dropped in the synagogue, the whole congregation must fast for 40 days. Persecuted Jewish communities have often gone to great lengths to preserve the Torah, which are items of huge symbolic and physical importance to the faith. Strict Jewish law forbids the sale of Torah scrolls unless the seller uses the proceeds to marry or to study Torah - and even then, they must have nothing else to sell.","Claimed he was 'beaten up, thrown in jail, and [went] $175,000 into debt' to rescue relics .

Christmas at Sandringham. The Queen gave a reading during the 45-minute service. Her reading was followed by hymns and prayers which were played over a public address system to the crowd outside. Royal family: Sophie, Countess of Wessex and the Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex both attended the service . Safety: The public who turned up to catch a glimpse of the royal family were searched by police officers before entering the Sandringham estate . The Duke was the first to leave the church and exchanged a few short New Year greetings with the public before walking back to the house alone, ahead of the rest of the royal party. The Queen collected flowers from about 40 children while the Earl and Countess of Wessex chatted to the crowd. The Duke missed Christmas Day at Sandringham and the traditional Boxing Day shoot, which he normally leads. He was admitted to Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, on December 23 where doctors discovered a blocked artery. On returning to Sandringham after a four night hospital stay, the Sunday Mirror reported the Duke was told to he must . 'take things easy.' The newspaper reported that staff were informed that the Duke now exclusive use of a £1million lift at Sandringham so he can avoid climbing the steep staircases. It was installed last year after the . Queen found the stairs difficult due to knee pain, but it was mainly by . servants to move luggage up to the bedrooms of the 270 room mansion. A courtier told the newspaper: 'It’s only been working for a few weeks and this is the first Christmas it’s been available. Back to the staircase: Staff at Sandringham were reportedly informed that the Duke now exclusive use of a £1million lift at Sandringham so he can avoid climbing the steep staircases . 'The Queen made it clear that as she and the Duke got older, she did not want to be ferried around on a stairlift, which she considered to be undignified. 'There was a small luggage lift at Sandringham, which was used by the staff to take bags up to rooms, but it could carry only one person at a time. The shaft was widened and the new lift can now carry eight people.' 'It cost around £1million but the royals consider it money well spent,' said the courtier. 'The only down side is that there is a sign in it saying ‘not for staff’ so the poor old porters now have to lug everything up the stairs.' Prince Philip spent four nights in hospital after he was airlifted to Papworth Hospital from Sandringham complaining of chest pains. Following tests, doctors discovered a blocked artery and inserted a small surgical stent to open it up and restore the blood flow to his heart. Although the procedure is relatively common and considered ‘minimally invasive’, doctors were taking no chances given his age and kept the prince in hospital for four nights – much to the notoriously grumpy royal’s displeasure. The incident is the most serious health scare suffered by the duke since he was hospitalised with a serious chest infection in 2008. On 27 December he was discharged from Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire shortly before 9.30am in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover and was driven back to Sandringham. The Queen and Prince Philip normally stay at Sandringham until after 6 February each year – the anniversary of the death of the Queen's father, George VI, who died there in 1952 at the age of 56 after a day's shooting on the estate. It is not clear yet whether any decisions had been made about his future engagements in what will be a busy year as the Queen celebrates her diamond jubilee with events across Britain during the spring and summer.",A crowd of 300 people waited outside the church to welcome the Duke who walked to the service .

But archaeologist Mick Aston has walked out of Time Team after 19 years – after producers hired a former model as the programme’s co-presenter. Usually clad in a loud jumper, with his white hair blowing in the wind, Professor Aston was the show’s site director who chose where to dig for the next historical discovery. In: Tony Robinson's Cambridge masters graduate co-presenter on Time Team, Mary-Ann Ochota . But the professor, 65, said that changes to the programme – which have led to the introduction of co-presenter Mary-Ann Ochota and the dropping of some archaeologists – had left him ‘really angry’. He compared them to the reshuffle at the BBC’s Countryfile in 2008, which introduced younger presenters and, he said, reduced it to ‘cliché-ridden pap’. Miss Ochota, 30, holds a master’s degree in archaeology and anthropology from Cambridge University. After graduation she did some modelling, including shoots for Special K. She was the anthropologist on the BBC’s Castaway Exposed and has presented a number of other programmes using her expertise. In an interview with the magazine British Archaeology, Professor Aston said he was responding to changes first proposed by producers at Channel 4 in late 2010 – before the filming of the series that is currently being aired. They included a new presenter to join Tony Robinson and decisions to ‘drop some archaeologists’ and ‘cut down the informative stuff about the archaeology’. The meeting was followed by an email to archaeologists last year from Wildfire Television, which makes the programme. Out: Professor Mick Aston, pictured right on Time Team with Tony Robinson at Buckingham Palace in 2006 . It said it was seeking a female co-presenter who ‘does not have to be overly experienced or knowledgeable as we have plenty of expertise within the existing team’. However, they added: ‘Intelligence, natural curiosity and a passion for archaeology is a must.’ Though Professor Aston appears with the new recruits in the current series, he will not join the 20th series, which starts filming in April and is due to be shown this year. He said: ‘The time had come to leave. I never made any money out of it, but a lot of my soul went into it. I feel really, really angry about it. ‘Whatever happened, we’d all thought, we’ll complete the 20th series. It feels very sad that I shan’t do that. I’m not proud of Time Team, it hasn’t worked.’ A former academic at Bristol and Oxford universities, he has worked tirelessly to bring archaeology to a wider audience. Executive producer Philip Clarke said the current series had introduced Miss Ochota and archaeologist Alex Langlands. Long-serving archaeologists Helen Geake and Stewart Ainsworth would appear less often. He said: ‘We were very sorry to see Mick go, and he leaves an extraordinary legacy. Not everyone takes change happily.’","Mick Aston, 65, quits historical show after it hires Cambridge graduate Mary-Ann Ochota, 30 .

But Christine Lagarde has said that women cannot have it all when it comes to juggling career and family life. The head of the International Monetary Fund – the first woman to hold the post – said that anybody attempting to balance motherhood and a career should accept there would be ‘failures’. She also admitted that despite her position men still talk to her in a patronising way, and that she is forced to 'grit her teeth' and get on with it. Lagarde's comments are surprising as if there is one woman among world leaders who has apparently had it all - and with ease - it would be her. As head of the IMF the 56-year-old is in charge of negotiations to save the Euro and bailout Greece. But she is also famous for her life outside of work and has been profiled in Vogue magazine and sat in the front row for Paris fashion shows.

The only casualty along Lagarde's path to success appears to have been her marriage - she is divorced but is living with her new partner in Washington.

The house where a British expatriate is believed to have been murdered before disappearing in mysterious circumstances has been burgled, French police revealed . Patricia Wilson, 58, has not been for more than a month since bloodstains were found at her ‘dream’ cottage in the picturesque village of Vabre-Tizac, north of Toulouse. Yet last week up to two intruders are said to have broken into the isolated property in the middle of the night. Very little was taken, with detectives now trying to establish if they may have been linked to Ms Wilson’s disappearance. It came as her alleged killer and ex-lover, 50-year-old Jean-Louis Cayrou, a French gardener, continued to insist he is innocent of any wrong-doing. He is on remand in prison, but last week also visited the house, along with the instructing judge who is leading the investigation. ""The judge wanted him to retrieve some clothes which could be crucial to the enquiry"" said a police source. Mr Cayrou insists that he is innocent of any wrong-doing, and expressly denies having anything to do with the victim’s disappearance, let alone her murder.’ Confirming the burglary, the source said that it was 'amateur in nature’ and that the perpetrators did not seem to be after valuables. This raises the possibility that they may have been trying to interfere with evidence, or indeed remove it, said the source. Isolated: Patricia Wilson's home where large quantities of blood found inside. Crime scene: What appears to be blood marks found by the back door . The house, which is worth around . £250,000 and set well away from neighbouring properties, is now empty . and unguarded, with Ms Wilson’s two cats the only occupants. Despite a search of surrounding water, including a lake at the bottom of the garden, police are no nearer finding Ms Wilson. In recent days the hunt has . ‘downscaled’ towards the land around the cottage – increasing the . likelihood that those responsible for attacking Ms Wilson may want to . interfere with the crime scene. French detectives launched a murder investigation after bloodstains were found in the cottage and a car belonging to Cayrou. Later they confirmed that blood found in Cayrou’s Renault saloon was from Ms Wilson. The forensic evidence supports prosecutors’ claims that Ms Wilson was killed by Cayrou in her house. Murder Hunt: French forensic officers search blood splattered cottage for clues . Cordon: Burglars ignored police tape to break into unguarded home . The pair had a relationship that Ms Wilson ended around two months ago, prompting Cayrou to allegedly try to strangle her. He is then thought to have planned her murder, waiting for her in bushes as she returned from a trip home to England on August 17. Detectives had hoped the DNA results would ‘persuade’ Cayrou to lead them to Ms Wilson’s corpse, but he insists they spent so much time together that it would be ‘normal’ to find traces of her DNA and indeed blood in his car. He has also told prosecutors that any traces of her blood would have been mixed with that of animals that he hunted. More...

However, the couple’s relationship became strained and they separated after Mr Marcus returned to England for an operation last November.

The mother of a 12-year-old boy, who accidentally hanged himself trying the 'choking game', has slammed internet site YouTube for showing videos encouraging the dangerous activity. Erik Rogg, a promising student and former boy scout from Randolph, Nebraska, died two years ago trying the 'game' which as been going on for decades. His mother Judy, who discovered him dead in his bedroom, has since become a campaigner touring schools in a bid to create awareness of the dangers of the fad. Tragic: Judy Rogg is campaigning for greater awareness of the dangers of the so-called 'choking game' after her 12-year-old son Erik died trying the dangerous pastime . But Judy fears it is seeing a resurgence in popularity partly because youngsters are posting videos of themselves doing it on YouTube and similar websites. She told ABC's Nightline: 'A lot of kids make it look fun. 'They're laughing.They don't realise the kid's on the floor twitching because he's having a seizure. 'A lot of kids say ""Well at least we're not doing drugs"" 'They think it's an alternative and they don't understand they're killing themselves.'' '[Youtube is] making access to an incredibly dangerous practice .' In 2006 more than 100 teens are believed to have died playing the dangerous game. The numbers decreased in recent years, but experts warn they may be on the rise. Also known as the fainting game, tap out, hangman, elevator, and blackout it is often played by groups of teens who partner up and cause each other to lose consciousness, but it can also be played alone. Derek Gall, a High School Sophmore, also from Randolph, smashed his head on a concrete floor when he tried it at school having seen a video on YouTube that claimed to show a 'safe' way to pass out. His 12-year-old sister Maggie said it was popular with children in her a year and blamed YouTube for its popularity. She said: 'If Kids are doing stuff on the Internet that is teaching these other kids to do really bad thins to themselves, then YouTube should take off those videos and not allow them on anymore.' A spokesman for YouTube said: 'The safety of our users is important to us, and as such YouTube's community guidelines prohibit videos intended to encourage dangerous activities that risk serious physical harm.

Facebook and YouTube could be to blame . for the spread of the mystery Tourrette’s-like illness that is . blighting a town in upstate New York.

They argue that when other people in . the town of LeRoy view the videos, they are unconsciously mimicking what . they see and spreading it around. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lori Brownell, 16, posted a video on YouTube showing the Tourettes-like . symptoms she has suffered since August. She is one of 15 at LeRoy High . School in New York State who have developed the mystery condition . The true cause of the illness is still . a mystery and there no formal suggestion that Facebook or any of the . other social networking websites are to blame. But David Lichter, professor of . neurology at the University of Buffalo, who has treated several of the . patients, said he might now understand how it has affected so many . people. He told MSNBC: ‘It's remarkable to see . how one individual posts something, and then the next person who posts . something not only are the movements bizarre and not consistent with . known movement disorders, but it's the same kind of movements. ‘This mimicry goes on with Facebook or YouTube exposure. This is the modern way that symptomology could be spread.’ In total 19 patients have come forward . with Tourette’s like symptoms since last Fall, which include . uncontrollable facial and body twitching. Trying to understand: Thera Sanchez, 17, has had . the mysterious symptoms for months and all of the treatments he has . received have not helped to clarify any options for her or her family . They include 14 girls aged between 13 . and 18 and this week the first adult victim, 36-year-old nurse . practitioner Marge Fitzsimmons. Among those who have taken an interest in the case is environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich. She has suggested that a chemical . spill from a train derailment in the 1970s near the site of the girls’ school may be the cause. Researchers have also come up with a . string of theories and believe teenagers may have been struck down by . paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, or PANS, which is a . kind of OCD linked to strep throat. Other believe that Morgellons could be to blame, which is a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores. Mystery: Fifteen Le Roy High School students reported a mysterious outbreak of spasms, tics and seizures which may be caused by a brain infection . Some doctors have also suggested it . could be a mass psychogenic illness which can be triggered by stress and . is spread from unconscious mimicry of one another. Dr. Laszlo Mechtler, chief of . neurology at the Dent Neurologic Institute in Buffalo, said: ‘When one . has a symptom, it can be reinforced and magnified with other individuals . with similar symptoms. ‘That's what's going on with these . girls. They are in a segregated small rural town in New York state. They . are a cohesive group. And this wildfire of symptoms takes control.’ During an angry meeting on Saturday . parents berated LeRoy schools officials and asked why the soil around . natural gas well which had been dug on school ground had not been tested . for contamination.

"By . Quentin Letts . UPDATED: . 02:28 EST, 6 July 2011 . Company, atten-SHUN! Labour MPs leapt to attention in the Commons yesterday afternoon when it came to a Standing Order 24 motion on the Murdoch newspapers’ alleged nefarious doings. Any Sergeant Major would have been proud to call that lot his platoon. One minute they were on their bottoms. The next they were ramrod straight on their pins. A rare parliamentary procedure, the SO 24. It calls for MPs to indicate their approval for an urgent debate by standing, rather than the usual shouting or voting in a lobby. The charge: A private detective working for the News of the World is accused of hacking into Milly Dowler's voicemail after she went missing . The Opposition benches were almost full. The Government side was largely empty. A few Tory backbenchers stood, some of them hesitantly because, perhaps, they were unused to the procedure. Zac Goldsmith (Con, Richmond Park) was one of those supporting the motion. Rich Zac is one of the few MPs to be unafraid of Mr Murdoch. Until yesterday, at least. But yesterday a lot more joined him. Group bravery has kicked in. Nick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister, used the word ‘grotesque’ to describe the hacking of the late Milly Dowler’s telephone. ‘If this is true it is simply beneath contempt,’ said Mr Clegg. ‘Grotesque, heart-rending,’ he added. Harriet Harman managed to put aside her well-known admiration for the red-top press (you know how Harriet does love a page 3 girl) and cried: ‘We must clean up the British press.’ Is she turning into Jonathan Aitken? This from a woman who happily tolerated the Murdochites back in the Blair and Brown governments when organs such as The Sun and The Times urged readers to vote Labour. Ben Bradshaw (Lab, Exeter) indicated his approval. Mr Bradshaw was Culture Secretary in the last government. Miss Harman and others wanted a public inquiry. Mr Clegg argued that that could get in the way of any chance of prosecutions. The Standing Order 24 motion was moved by Chris Bryant (Lab, Rhondda), who long ago had his political prospects bruised by press coverage (you may recall a marvellously fetching photograph of him in his tidy smalls). Mr Bryant, who is one of the ablest parliamentarians in this Commons, came up with a memorable phrase. He accused News of the World grunts of ‘playing God with a family’s emotions’ in the Milly Dowler case. Much to consider: Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International - owned by Rupert Murdoch - has been urged to 'consider her position' by Labour leader Ed Miliband . This had an echo, perhaps, of the comment once made by a Press Council chairman that certain newspapers ‘dabbled in people’s souls’. The Dowler allegations are much more potent than previous phone-hacking complaints, which seemed to have more to do with the injured pride of politicians and celebrities. While the matter remained only about John Prescott, no one was likely to become too fussed. This time, however, there is genuine astonishment and affront. This time the reported offence is palpably nasty. Mr Bryant read his short speech off a page of tightly-typed script. It focused as much on police ‘lies’ as it did on Grub Street’s misdemeanours. The Government front bench and, oddly, the Lib Dem benches, remained seated when the standing vote on Mr Bryant’s motion was taken. They were abstaining. The debate will occur today, after Prime Minister’s Questions. Political bravery being in large part a question of fashion, it would be a surprise to hear anyone today stand up for the Murdoch organisation, or indeed for the printed press. The Prime Minister piled in yesterday from Afghanistan. Mr Clegg was saying his stuff at the despatch box. Ed Miliband was attacking Murdoch from a filmed venue somewhere in London – maybe an adenoid clinic, for all we know. Suddenly they were all at it. Down with Murdoch. Down with pesky journalists. Though the anger about Milly Dowler is genuine, there is also a faint whiff of a political elite exacting revenge on a media which has repeatedly shown MPs to be swindlers and hypocrites. What a toxic carry-on. At this rate we’ll have old Rupe himself summoned to the Commons Chamber and told to prostrate himself like some disgraced Japanese industrialist. Speaker Bercow would love that.",Battle between Parliamentarians and the Press is usually knockabout stuff. But this time there is genuine outrage among MPs at the idea that a murdered girl's phone was hacked .

Against plans: Bernard Jenkin said BAE should not be sold to the French and Germans, to protect national security . Britain’s biggest defence company should not be sold to the French and Germans in order to protect national security, a senior Tory MP said yesterday. Bernard Jenkin, the chairman of the Public Administration Select Committee, warned that government support for merging BAE with Franco-German aviation firm EADS will undermine Britain’s status as a ‘major military power’ and waste taxpayers’ money. The former shadow defence secretary warned that giving the French and German governments, who own parts of EADS, access to our military secrets would undermine the UK’s vital intelligence sharing with the United States. And he said it would also undermine Britain’s ability to build submarines and make urgent changes to equipment in situations of national peril like the Falklands War. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Mr Jenkin said if the company must be sold off it should join forces with an American firm instead. ‘The question of ownership with respect . to BAE’s key UK assets is about whom the UK can trust, and to which . country’s influence the UK should choose to submit,’ he writes. Concerns: Mr Jenkin warned that foreign ownership of BAE would make it more difficult to hold the company to account for procurement delays and overruns . ‘A US takeover of BAE would be better: for British security, for access to technology; and for economic resilience. ‘Better still, the UK should retain ownership of its defence supply chain, not only as the best guarantee that our Armed Forces will have what they need in a crisis, but so our defence industries can be Atlanticist and European. It might not suit the shareholders, but it is in our national interest.’ And Mr Jenkin also took aim at Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, who has encouraged David Cameron to back the deal on commercial grounds. Sir Jeremy previously worked at Morgan Stanley, the merchant bank which is advising BAE in the deal. Mr Jenkin questioned whether Sir Jeremy might seek to return to the bank. ‘Who knows where Sir Jeremy may work when he retires?’ He asked. ‘Is this a potential conflict of interest?’ The Cabinet Office insists Sir Jeremy has behaved properly and it is his job to be involved in government discussion of the deal. Positive: David Cameron, pictured yesterday in New York, is backing the deal but has sought reassurances about national security and the relationship with the US . David Cameron is backing the BAE deal but has sought reassurances about national security and the relationship with the US. But Mr Jenkin argued that American spy chiefs will be concerned that BAE’s relationship with the GCHQ listening post in Cheltenham, which works closely with the National Security Agency in the US, could undermine signals intelligence. 'A US takeover of BAE would be better: for British security, for access to technology; and for economic resilience' Bernard JenkinPublic Administration Select Committee chairman . ‘BAE supports operations at GCHQ through its security subsidiary, Detica. How would the US feel if the EADS equivalent, Cassidian, gained access to Detica’s intellectual property and even to sensitive intelligence itself?’ Mr Jenkin writes. ‘Anyone who says this is “Europhobia” simply betrays their own anti-US, pro-EU prejudice. Mr Jenkin warns that the newly merged company, which will be at least 60 per cent controlled by EADS, could shut down key defence installations in the UK. ‘BAE’s Astute nuclear-powered submarines, built in Barrow, are possibly the best in the world. Barrow is due to build the next generation of Trident submarines, on which the future of Britain’s nuclear deterrent depends. ‘No assurance could guarantee that EADS will sustain nuclear submarine design and construction in both the UK and France.’ Fears: Mr Jenkin argues that selling off BAE would rob Britain of 'on shore capability' - the ability to adapt defence equipment at home in times of crisis . Mr Jenkin said undermining submarine capability would also undercut the special relationship. ‘Submarines underline our closeness with the US. British subs use US facilities for battle-gaming and training. Our sub crews’ readiness is certified by the US Navy, and the Royal Navy certifies theirs. 'No assurance could guarantee that EADS will sustain nuclear submarine design and construction in both the UK and France' Bernard JenkinPublic Administration Select Committee chairman . ‘Neither France nor Germany is trusted by the US, as they trust us. Franco-German ownership of Barrow would be bound to change the atmosphere of co-operation.’ Mr Jenkin argues that selling off BAE would rob Britain of ‘on shore capability’ - the ability to adapt defence equipment at home in times of crisis. ‘We could not have recovered the Falkland Islands in 1982 without on-shore capability. Harland and Woolf converted a roll-on/roll-off ferry into a helicopter platform and hospital ship in a matter of weeks,’ he explained. ‘The Sea Harriers were fitted with air-to-air refuelling in a matter of days. Lack of on-shore capability can leave us hostage to foreign interests.’ He also warned that foreign ownership of BAE would make it more difficult to hold the company to account for procurement delays and overruns that have cost the taxpayer billions in the past. ‘A foreign-owned BAE will be even harder to shame for its failures,’ he said.","Comments made by former shadow defence secretary .

A mother-of-two fears she may never walk again after falling 10ft down a concrete hole while on a dream in holiday in Mexico. Marie Honey, 48, from Ormskirk, Lancashire, was knocked unconscious, suffered cuts and bruises, damaged her coccyx and fractured her spine in three places. The nurse was on the last day of a holiday in Mexico for her niece's wedding last year when the accident happened. Terrifying: Marie Honey, 48, fell 10ft down a concrete hole while on a dream holiday in Mexico . She was walking over a hole which had been covered by a piece of wood at the when it suddenly gave way and she plummeted 10ft to the concrete-lined surface below. Marie suspects the sheet of wood, which had been painted green, collapsed because it was rotten. She spent the next three nights in a Mexican hospital terrified because she had no idea what injuries she had suffered and very few staff spoke English. After being flown home in a fully reclined position she had to wear a back brace for three months. Almost a year later, Marie is still unable to walk properly. She has had to undergo surgery to her back and still needs crutches to help her with day-to-day tasks. She said: 'We had all been so . excited for our holiday in Mexico and to see my niece Kerrie get . married. 'It was beautiful and the wedding day was perfect but the . memories have been ruined forever by what happened on my last day out . there.' Ruined: Marie, pictured between her daughters Kate, 24, and Rosie, 21, had been enjoying her niece's wedding in Mexico when the she fell down a 10ft concrete hole in the grounds of her hotel (right) 'I didn’t even notice the hole cover . because it was painted green presumably to be concealed within the grass . and it gave way before I even realised what I was standing on. 'It was only afterwards that I saw that the cover was not only just a sheet of wood but it also looked like it was rotten. Frightening: Marie fears she may never walk again after having surgery on her back . 'I banged my head in the fall and I . think that I was knocked out.' 'When I came round I started screaming . because of the pain but the only way to get out of the hole was to climb . a ladder that the hotel lowered down. 'It took every ounce of energy in my body to do it and I was in agony. 'I couldn’t understand what was going . on in the hospital because not many people spoke English and I was . terrified that I would never walk again. 'I was eventually allowed to fly home but under strict conditions that I was to be fully reclined . throughout and that I sought immediate follow up care upon my return. 'Thankfully, the medics in the UK have . been fantastic but I still have a long way to go and I am still not . sure what my future holds.' Joseph Dawson, a specialist lawyer in . accidents abroad at Irwin Mitchell, is representing Marie against the . tour operator TUI UK Ltd. He said: 'This is a horrendous case that . has left a woman who was very dedicated to her profession and caring . for others, unable to work and virtually housebound. 'The terrible injuries she sustained are likely to affect her life forever. Nightmare: Marie's horrendous injuries included a damaged coccyx and a fractured spine in three places . 'We are pleased to hear the hotel has apparently since taken measures to ensure the area is safe. 'At this stage liability has not yet been admitted by TUI UK Ltd and I understand that they are investigating the circumstances of the accident with the hotel management. 'I hope, however, that the tour operator will work with us swiftly to ensure that Marie has access to the best support and rehabilitation services possible so she can try and rebuild her life and get some freedom back.'","Marie Honey, 48, fell down hole on last day of dream holiday in Mexico .

No other way to obey: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said she supports calls for a Press regulator . Labour will back statutory regulation of the press deputy leader Harriet Harman reveals today. In an interview with The Spectator magazine, Miss Harman said the opposition supports calls for a law to set up a press regulator, arguing there is no other way of ensuring papers agree to obey the rules. The intervention puts Labour at odds with some senior Tories, including the Prime Minister, who has warned that he would prefer to avoid statutory regulation since that could lead future generations of MPs to meddle with press freedom. Miss Harman has made clear Labour opposes political interference in the content of papers, and any attempt to police the division between fact and comment - proposals examined by Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into the media. But she rejected a proposal drawn up by Lord Black and Lord Hunt on behalf of the existing regulator the Press Complaints Commission which would have seen papers sign a binding contract with the regulator to stick to the rules with punitive fines when they are broken. That plan would avoid the need for a new law, but Miss Harman said that would not be tough enough since it may lack the teeth to force proprietors like Richard Desmond of the Daily Express - who withdrew from the PCC. Miss Harman said: ‘The big challenge is how you make sure that we get a proper press complaints system,’ arguing that previous failures ‘gave the press a sense of impunity’. ‘In terms of the press complaints the fundamental issue is not having a situation where people decide not to opt into a press complaints system. ‘Any press complaints system has got to deal with the problem of impunity. It has got to apply to all the newspapers not just those who chose to have it apply to them. Apply to all: Miss Harman said the challenge will be getting a 'proper press complaints system' and that it must apply to all newspapers, 'not just those who chose to have it apply to them' ‘For all that Guy Black and Lord Hunt think that people are going to sign binding contracts, Richard Desmond has already said he might not, so I think there will need to be a statutory underpinning’ of the new organisation ‘independent from Parliament, politicians and government’. She added: ‘It’s hard to see how you can otherwise have something which applies to all newspapers but which does not gave that power. However else could it be done?’ The way is now paved for a political row over the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson, who is expected to propose some sort of statutory regime when he reports next month. Nick Clegg has said the Lib Dems will back Leveson, and if necessary a statutory code as long as his proposals are ‘proportionate’. Will back it: Nick Clegg said the Lib Dems will back Leveson, and if necessary a statutory code as long as his proposals are 'proportionate' She also insisted that newspaper websites should be covered by the same press code of conduct as their papers - despite claims from editors that this puts them at a commercial disadvantage relative to other internet media outlets. ‘It’s the newspapers’ own code so it’s quite invidious of them to argue that it’ s oppressive for them to abide by it when they’ve said that is the code they themselves have adopted. ‘The papers remain very influential particularly in setting the whole agenda for the rest of the media so having accountability is very important.’ She said it would be ‘difficult’ to draw up a new regulator for internet publications but would merely ask some web-based media outlets to ‘opt-in’ to the new organisation. ‘You could certainly have a position which applies to all newspapers but allows them to opt-in even if they’re offshore.’","Labour will back statutory regulation of the press .
