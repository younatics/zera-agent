"Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has admitted she previously had a 'big problem' with alcohol - and has revealed that since she went teetotal a fortnight ago she has lost 10lbs. The Ultimo founder previously revealed that she drank up to a bottle of wine a day during her 2012 marriage break-up, which ended up costing her £24 million. Ms Mone, 43, gave up alcohol at the start of the New Year and today announced on Twitter she has already lost more than half a stone - but not all of her fans thought it was healthy to lose so much weight in such a short time. Scroll down for video . Michelle Mone has admitted she once had a 'big problem' with alcohol. Pictured, Ms Mone in a 2010 lingerie shoot for her underwear brand Ultimo - she had recently lost six stone . Ms Mone shared this picture of her on holiday with her 861,000 followers on Twitter with the caption: '11 days no booze,7Ib off&on my way to best body ever!6Ib to go till I'm the size of this picture.Are u doing well?' After sharing various pictures of herself looking healthy and slim, she today told her 861,000 followers on Twitter she is aware she is looking good. 'Yes I had BIG problem with booze 15 days off, lost 10Ib, body like a rock. Skin&eyes crystal clear, not showing off, I look like an Ultimo model,' she tweeted. She also revealed since she went teetotal a fortnight ago, she has lost 10lbs . Some of her followers were shocked by the announcement. Angela McDermott wrote: 'You must have been doing some drinking to lose that much weight', while former BBC Apprentice candidate Simon Smith said: 'I haven't had an alcoholic drink for almost three years. Best decision I ever made for my own wellbeing #sober'. But Maureen Kerr added: 'As much as I admire you & your achievements 10lb weight loss is not healthy within a short period of time. #sobriety' Last year Ms Mone admitted she was 'amazed' she had not suffered a nervous breakdown over the traumatic experiences she had faced in the last few years. Ms Mone, whose autobiography Fight To The Top is due out in March, has sold the lion share of the Ultimo underwear company that she founded with her now ex husband Michael. She created the company with the help of the Princes Trust after failing to find a bra that gave her the support she needed. Ms Mone, a self-confessed workaholic who claims to need only four house of sleep a night, recently announced that instead of putting her feet up she is planning to pursue more TV work, on top of buying out her partners in her UTan beauty company. She also plans to buy a house in Los Angeles to add to her homes in London and Scotland. The businesswoman, who has not only gone through a marriage break-up and launched a major international brand from nothing but has undergone skin cancer treatment, says Fight to the Top will cover the break-down of her marriage. She shared this picture last week with the caption: 'Smashed it!Not that long ago I couldn't run 200yards without getting out of breath.Healthy mind&body =control in Biz' Mr Mone has set up a rival lingerie firm, with Ultimo's former chief designer, Samantha Bunn. The Mones split in Christmas 2011, reportedly over Mr Mone's relationship with Ms Bunn. The couple had been married for 19 years and have three children. Mone grew up in relative poverty in Glasgow before finding work as a model. After running a sales and marketing team for the Labatt's brewing company, she made the decision to create a range of support bras after wearing an uncomfortable bra during a dinner party.","Lingerie tycoon admitted on Twitter she had previously had a 'big problem'

"Scientists may have hit upon a new way of extending the lifespan of living organisms - by activating a gene that destroys unhealthy cells. Researchers at the University of Bern found they were able to help flies live up to 60% longer by increasing the activity of a gene that targets damaged cells. If this could be transferred to humans, it could extend the average lifespan of people in developed countries like the US and the UK to beyond 120 years old. The scientists found that a gene called ahuizotl, or 'azot' acts like a sort of cellular quality control, helping to weed out unhealthy or malfunctioning cells. Fruit flies, like the one pictured, were given an extra copy of this gene that targets unhealthy cells. During tests the flies lived 60% longer lives . The scientists found that a gene called ahuizotl, or 'azot' acts like a sort of cellular quality control, helping to weed out unhealthy or malfunctioning cells. It is thought to help protect crucial organs like the brain or the gut from a build up of potentially harmful unhealthy cells. Archaeologists found bottles beneath a hotel construction site in New York that once contained medicinal remedies including one called the 'Elixir of Long Life'. The bottle included a list of ingredients and a method for making the remedy. Ingredients . Aloes - 0.46 ounces (13 grams) Rhubarb - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Gentian - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Zedoary (also known as white turmeric) - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Spanish saffron - 0.08 ounces (2.3 grams) Water - four fluid ounces (114 millilitres) Grain alcohol (vodka, gin) - 12 fluid ounces (240 millilitres) Method . Squeeze out the liquid from the aloes. Crush the rhubarb, gentian and saffron together and then mix them with the aloe liquid. Then let the mixture sit for three days but shake it every so often. It will then need to be filtered before it can be served. When the scientists gave fruit flies an extra copy of this gene, they found the insects' tissues became healthier and aged slower. Humans are known to also have the azot gene, opening up the possibility that it could be used to create new anti-ageing treatments. Dr Christa Rhiner, a lecturer in cell biology at the University of Bern who took part in the study, said: 'Our flies had median lifespans 50 to 60 per cent longer than normal flies.' For centuries, humans have been seeking ways to extend their lives. In the Old Testament, Methuselah was said to have lived for 969 years. Medieval Knights went on quests to search for the Holy Grail, which was said to bestow powers including extended life. Alchemists also dedicated themselves to producing the Elixir of Life. Some scientists have speculated that the human lifespan could be extended to up to 200 years. Currently the oldest person in the world is Leandra Becerra Lumbreras, a Mexican woman who claims to be 127 years old, although she has apparently not got any evidence to support when she was born. However, this latest research is still some way from being tested in mammals. The scientists were able to extend the lifespan of fruit flies by  genetically engineering them to have three copies of the azot gene. There are normally two copies of this gene in each cell. The gene is named after a mythological Aztec creature that selectively targets fishing boats to protect the fish population of lakes. Eduardo Moreno, who led the work at the Institute of Cell Biology from the University of Bern, said: 'Our bodies are composed of several trillion cells and during aging those cells accumulate random errors due to stress or external insults, like UV-light from the sun. In the Old Testament, Methuselah was said to have lived for 969 years. While, Medieval knights were reported as going on quests to search for the Holy Grail (seen above in this stained glass window). The Holy Grail was said to bestow powers including extended life . 'Because some cells are more affected than others, we reasoned that selecting the less affected cells and eliminating the damaged ones could be a good strategy to maintain tissue health and therefore delay aging and prolong lifespan.' Dr Aubrey de Grey, a leading researcher on gerontology and the Chief Science Officer of the SENS Research Foundation, which aims to use regenerative medicine to extend human lifespan, said it remained to be seen if the approach had any therapeutic applications. But, he added: 'The lifespan results reported here provide good reasons to explore that possibility further. 'This study significantly advances our understanding of a mechanism of cellular quality control that detects relative, rather than absolute, cell health. 'Preserving the healthier cells in a particular tissue and culling the sicker ones irrespective of the whole tissue's average health is a strategy that evidently works well in many circumstances, since it also exists in mammals.'","Swiss researchers gave fruit flies an extra copy of a gene known as 'azot'

"Will Hayden, former star of the reality TV show Sons of Guns, has pleaded not guilty to the second of two rape charges filed against him in Louisiana . Will Hayden, former star of the reality TV show Sons of Guns, has pleaded not guilty to the second of two rape charges filed against him in Louisiana. The 49-year-old is accused of sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl, and attacking another victim 20 years ago in Livingston Parish. Hayden entered the plea Thursday, according to The Times-Picayune. Last week, Hayden, founder of Red Jacket Firearms, pleaded not guilty to one count of aggravated rape in Baton Rouge. In that incident, he's accused of raping a young girl multiple times between March 2013 and August 2014. Frank Holthaus, Hayden's lawyer, told reporters last week the allegations against his client were untrue and that Hayden is ready to fight the claims made against him. Sons of Guns began airing in 2011 and followed Hayden's family-owned custom firearms business. Episodes often showed Hayden and his adult daughter, Stephanie, helping customers find weapons, including rifles. Other scenes showed the process of making the guns, images from firing ranges, and ammunition tips. Hayden was arrested on August 27 last year. After the arrest, The Discovery Channel canceled the show, citing 'the serious and horrific nature of the charges' against the star.

"A farmer set himself ablaze in the middle of a busy street after local government officials went back on a promise to pay him for land they had appropriated to build a new highway. Qiang Yuan, 45, squatted down just outside the council building, poured fuel on himself and then set it alight - turning himself into a human fireball in front of horrified shoppers. Incredibly, he remained seated even as the flames blackened his skin. Farmer Qiang Yuan, 45, set himself alight in front of local government offices in China . His wife said she had no idea he was going to take such drastic action when he left the house that day . Shocked shopper Wen Ko said: 'I was just about to go into a store when I heard people start screaming. 'I turned round and saw this huge ball of fire. 'I then realised it was a man sitting on the ground. He toppled over as a security guard ran over to extinguish the flames, but then he sat back up again and continued squatting there despite the fact his skin was blackened and charred.' Yuan had been promised cash in return for his land, after officials told him it was needed for the new road. But months after giving it away, the farmer still hadn't been paid - and his calls were being ignored. At his wits end, Yuan bought petrol from a local shop, walked up to the front of the council buildings and poured it over his head before striking a match. He is now in hospital in a critical condition, with doctors crediting the quick actions of a security guard who extinguished the flames . After the flames were extinguished, he was rushed to hospital, where he is in a critical condition. A hospital spokesman said: 'He has severe burns across 70 per cent of his body and is very lucky to be alive thanks to the quick reactions of the security guard.' Qiang's wife Ling Cheng, 40, said: 'He was very angry and upset and kept saying that he had been cheated. 'We aren't rich and we really need that money as we have lost a large amount of our earnings from the land. 'He said he was gong to try and meet someone to find out what was happening. 'I had no idea he was going to do something like this.' Local government officials have yet to comment, but said they would release a full statement once an investigation had been completed.","Shocked shoppers described the moment Qiang Yuan set himself on fire .

"More first-year students from China have enrolled at UK universities than those from the whole of the EU put together. Last year, 58,810 Chinese undergraduates started their study here, while students from the continent, excluding those from the UK itself, totalled 57,190. However numbers of students from India and Pakistan have dropped by more than a thousand, official figures show, suggesting the Government's attempts to restrict student visas has put undergraduates off studying in Britain. More first-year students from China have enrolled at UK universities than the whole of the EU put together (file picture) The number of Chinese first-years coming to the UK has increased by 59 per cent since 2009/10, when 36,950 new students enrolled, figures revealed by the Higher Educations Statistics Agency show. There is a culture of studying abroad for Chinese students, who are often attracted to the UK because of its top universities, with nine British institutions in the world's top 100. The number of non-EU students in the UK rose to 310,195 - up three per cent in a year - but education experts were concerned with the fall in students from India and Pakistan. Gordon Slaven, director of higher education at the British Council, said: 'It is very pleasing that the overall figures for non-EU students coming to the UK has increased by three per cent. 'But this headline figure does disguise one worrying trend: the decrease of students coming from India by 12 per cent and Pakistan by seven per cent, while demographic trends suggest these should be sources of growth for the UK. 'While the UK sector can be pleased that the overall numbers have increased, our competitor countries such as the USA and Australia have shown much more significant increases. The number of international students coming to the UK has risen to 310,915 - up three per cent - despite restrictions on student visas (file picture) Students coming to the UK from countries such as India and Pakistan have dropped by more than a thousand (file picture) 'This highlights the need for the UK to take a much more proactive and united approach to attracting highly talented students from around the world to reduce the risk of losing our share of the international student market.' Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of vice-chancellors' group Universities UK, told the Independent: 'Problems remain with recruitment from India. There is growing demand for quality higher education around the world, so the UK should be capitalising on this, rather than seeing the stagnation of the past few years.' Total number of non-EU students: 310,195 (up three per cent). Total number of EU students*: 125,300 (no change). Total number of Chinese students: 87,895 (up four per cent).

The latest official figures also show that  a record numbers of students graduated with a first-class degree last summer, with one in five achieving top honours. Around 79,440 students got a first last year, nearly 10,000 more than did so in 2013. A decade ago only one in 10 graduates left with a first. Meanwhile 70 per cent of students graduated with a first or a 2:1, sparking concerns the classification system is out of date. Graduate recruitment expert Martin Birchall, of High Fliers Research, said: 'With ever higher numbers of school-leavers going to university, employers are increasingly insisting that students applying for graduate jobs have at least a 2.1. 'As the proportion of candidates with these top degree classifications goes up, it's making it harder and harder for employers to distinguish between candidates. 'Most employers now look well beyond students' academic qualifications when they're assessing applications for their graduate vacancies and rather than rely on degree classifications, many resort to putting candidates through their own battery of tests to find out who are the brightest graduates.'","More first-year Chinese students in the UK than from the whole of the EU .

"She's a swimwear model and fashion muse known for her lithe figure but Abbey Clancy maintains that she does 'zero exercise' to stay in shape. The Strictly Come Dancing champion - who has three-year-old daughter Sophia Ruby with husband Peter Crouch - claims she doesn't have to work out a lot to maintain her enviable figure. She does, however, admit that she's been taking yoga classes since becoming pregnant with their second child. Abbey Clancy, who is three months pregnant with her second child, says she does 'zero' exercise to maintain her petite frame . Quizzed on the secrets behind her bikini body, she told The Telegraph: 'Zero exercise. Everyone in my family is slim and tall. My mother bounced back after kids, my brother's skinny - so I think my genes are a huge part of it. 'When I did Strictly, it didn't feel like exercise but it was super intense, and I saw my body really change - I lost my boobs completely. But now I've gone back to nothing, and a more flabby body.' The 29-year-old confessed that along with no exercising - apart from pregnancy yoga to strengthen her 'pelvic floor and lower back' before the baby arrives - she also has no rules about what she can and can't eat. She added: 'I live with a footballer, so we tend to eat healthily. But I'm so relaxed about it - we don't deny ourselves of anything. If I want a Chinese or a McDonald's, I'll have one.' Abbey says that Strictly was 'super intense' and she's gone back to 'nothing and a more flabby body' Abbey follows a healthy eating regime but doesn't deny herself  treats and will eat takeaways if she wants one . Abbey has a number of beauty products she swears by, revealing: 'I love Charlotte Tilbury's foundation in Light Wonder, number six. It's so sheer but still gives good coverage. 'I love Bare Minerals concealer, and I can't live without Lancôme mascara. I love all my lotions and potions and I'm lucky to be sent lots of things, but the truth is I've used the same stuff for years really.' Abbey certainly inherited her good genes from her 54-year-old mother, Karen, who shows off her timeless look in JD Williams' new fashion campaign. Karen, a single mother to four children, was tapped by the high street brand to front a new campaign styled by former iD fashion editor, Caryn Franklin.

"He used to be one of best-looking comedians of the seventies and eighties, and often played the romantic lead, as he did with Goldie Hawn in the 1978 hit film Foul Play.

"Apple hasn’t had the best track record in terms of security on iCloud recently - and now the tech giant is suggesting storing fingerprints on the online service. A patent awarded earlier this week reveals plans to let Apple users store their fingerprints in the cloud, which could then be used on other devices with biometric sensors. As the files revealed, after the prints are stored online, the user could press the TouchID scanner on any Apple device to sign into accounts and make payments. Scroll down for video . The patent (pictured) was filed by the Californian tech giant in July 2013 and awarded yesterday. The files detail a system that would let users store their fingerprints on iCloud, which could then be downloaded and used when touching a biometric sensor on another device . The benefit of doing this would mean people wouldn’t have to record their fingerprints across multiple devices, which Apple described in the patent as ‘cumbersome.’ But, it would mean the fingerprints would be much easier, potentially, to be accessed by hackers. In theory, hackers would be limited with what they could do with a file of a fingerprint, but last month a team of security researchers was able to recreate a physical print using just a high-resolution photo - highlighting the dangers. According to the ‘Finger biometric sensor data synchronization via a cloud computing device and related methods’ patent: ‘A common approach to fingerprint identification involves scanning a sample fingerprint or an image, and storing the image. Once a fingerprint is stored online, each time the user tries to use a TouchID sensor on any Apple device, the prints would be matched. And to allay potential privacy concerns, Apple explained that a user would have to validate their Apple ID account before registering their prints . To verify an account and fingerprint, the user would need to enter a username, password and pass code. The fingerprints would then be encrypted and sent to iCloud. To verify the print on the second device, the user would equally need to be signed into iCloud, and the prints would need to match . ‘The characteristics of a sample fingerprint may be compared to information for reference or enrolled fingerprints already in a database to determine proper identification of a person, such as for verification purposes. ‘Despite the existence of such fingerprint matching techniques, enrollment may become cumbersome for users in some instances, such as when multiple fingerprints, users, and devices are used.’ With this in mind, Apple proposes an electronic system that uses a biometric sensor and a so-called ‘first processor’. The processor collects biometric data from a sensor. The system would then include a cloud computing device that would upload and store the data. Last year, Apple’s iCloud fell victim to hackers who  stole photos from a number of its celebrity users including  Jennifer Lawrence (pictured) Last year, Apple’s iCloud fell victim to hackers who broke into the online service and stole photos from a number of its celebrity users. These photos, including some that were nude selfies uploaded by celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence, were then posted online. Following the news, Apple said it was 'outraged' by the attacks, and said they were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. It advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification. The hackers are believed to have used iCloud's password reset function to gain access to accounts. This allows users to reset their password by entering their username, date of birth and correctly answering two security questions. Experts said this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities. Last year, Apple’s iCloud fell victim to hackers who broke into the online service and stole photos from a number of its celebrity users. These photos, including some that were nude selfies, were then posted online. Following the news, Apple said it was 'outraged' by the attacks, and were the result of 'a very targeted attack' Last month, a team of security researchers was able to recreate a physical print using a photo. Starbug, whose real name is Jan Krissler, told attendees of the Chaos Computer Club’s (CCC) 31st annual congress in Hamburg, Germany, how he achieved the hack. Mr Krissler obtained a high-resolution photograph of the politician’s thumb using a ‘standard photo camera’ during a press conference. He also used other 'good quality' photos of the politician, taken from a variety of angles. From these images, he reconstructed an accurate thumbprint using the VeriFinger software. This software is good enough, according to CCC, to fool fingerprint security systems. A second phone, with a second biometric sensor, and a second processor would ‘collect to-be matched finger biometric data’ from the second device, and download data from the cloud. The fingerprint data collected by the second sensor would be matched with the encrypted online data, and access would be granted. Put simply, once a fingerprint is stored online, each time the user tries to use a TouchID sensor on any Apple device, the prints would be compared and matched. And to allay potential privacy concerns, Apple explained that a user would have to validate their Apple ID account before registering their prints. This would require the username, password and pass code. The fingerprints would be encrypted and sent to iCloud. To verify the print on the second device, the user would equally need to be signed into iCloud, and the prints would need to match. As well as a phone or tablet, the ‘second device’ could be fingerprint scanners in shops that work with Apple Pay. However, David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab told MailOnline: 'If implemented, this would give Apple a further way of trying to establish the iPhone as a payment mechanism. 'On the face of it, this would appear to present no greater risk than the storage of password hashes on a provider’s site. 'However, there is one key difference. If my password is compromised, I can create a new one for the compromised account. 'Unfortunately, I’m unable to change my biometric data. So if such data isn’t stored securely - and there’s no such thing as 100 per cent security- the risks could be far greater than the theft of a single password.'","The patent was filed in July 2013 but only awarded yesterday .

"British holidaymakers who are looking to cash in on the strength of the pound should look to Europe for an affordable getaway in 2015, new research has revealed. European resorts and cities are this year’s best-value holiday hotspots, claiming eight of the top ten places in an annual study by Post Office Travel Money, and five are destinations that have the euro. With the euro and other currencies looking increasingly fragile against the pound, the cheapest destination for UK tourists (excluding the price of flights and accommodation) is Prague, followed by the Algarve in Portugal and Sunny Beach in Bulgaria. Prague was the cheapest of 46 destinations included in a recent Post Office Travel Money study . Eight typical items purchased by British holidaymakers, including water and beer, cost £35.29 in Prague . Based on the average total cost of eight items typically purchased by British tourists: . Prague, Czech Republic (£35.29) Algarve, Portugal (£36.04) Sunny Beach, Bulgaria (£36.14) Costa del Sol, Spain (£36.80) Kuta, Bali (£38.09) Budapest, Hungary (£40.87) Crete, Greece (£41.74) Cape Town, South Africa (£42.96) Paphos, Cyprus (£43.71) Marmaris, Turkey (£46.15) Based on the average total cost of eight items typically purchased by British tourists: . Singapore (£149.65) Dubai (£144.50) Auckland, New Zealand (£126.70) Muscat, Oman (£120.13) English Harbour, Antigua (£117.39) St James, Barbados (£104.59) Darwin, Australia (£103.34) Penang, Malaysia (£93.32) Vancouver, Canada (£91.24) Beijing, China (£89.26) Post Office Travel Money ranked 46 popular destinations based on the average total price of eight typical purchases by British tourists: a cup of coffee, bottle of beer, a can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, a glass of wine, a 1.5-litre bottle of mineral water, sun cream, a pack of cigarettes and a three-course evening meal for two with a bottle of house wine. In Prague, the average total for all eight items is just £35.29, with the evening meal and house wine accounting for most of the cost (£21.28). For those same items tourists would spend £36.04 in the Algarve (the cheapest beach resort on the list and last year’s runner-up), £36.14 in Sunny Beach, Bulgaria, £36.80 in Spain’s Costa del Sol, and £38.09 in Kuta, Bali, last year’s No 1 and the only non-European destination in this year’s top five. For the second year in a row the Algarve is second on the list and Europe's cheapest beach getaway . The remainder of the top ten is occupied by four European destinations – Budapest in Hungary, Crete in Greece, Paphos in Cyprus and Marmaris, Turkey – plus Cape Town, South Africa. At £41.74, Crete had the biggest price drop (19 per cent) out of all 46 destinations, and Post Office Travel Money said the exchange rates are likely to prove ‘game changers’ when it comes to holiday choice this year. And given the current rates UK tourists will have more cash to spend everywhere in Europe, except Turkey, compared with a year ago, according to the ‘worldwide holiday costs barometer’ study. The cost of the eight tourist staples has fallen in two-thirds of the European countries surveyed. Kuta, Bali, last year's No 1, was the only non-European destination to crack the top five . In Europe, the largest increase was found in Marmaris, Turkey, where a 13 per cent rise in costs didn’t prevent it from cracking the top ten. Bali remains the best value long-haul resort, although it experienced a 21 per cent increase in its barometer basket. Costa Rica has become increasingly affordable with a 37 per cent drop in the Northern Pacific town of Tamarindo (£54.51). The most expensive of the 46 destinations are Singapore (£149.65), Dubai (£144.50), Auckland, New Zealand (£126.70), Muscat, Oman (£120.13) and English Harbour on the Caribbean island of Antigua (£117.39). A glass of wine, for example, costs 95p in Budapest, £1.58 in Prague and £9.35 in Dubai. Singapore was the most expensive of the 46 destinations, followed by Dubai, Auckland and Muscat, Oman . Post Office Travel Money ranked Costa Rica as one of its 2015 hotspots (pictured: a three-toed sloth) The report also listed its top ten hotspots for 2015: the Caribbean islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Dubai, Eastern Europe, Mauritius, Mexico, Greece, Iceland and Japan, with a special mention for Cuba. Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: ‘Holidaymakers travelling to Europe in the coming year can look forward to better value-for-money, although they should still do their homework to ensure they don’t miss out on the best deals. ‘There is currently little difference in resort costs between the Algarve, Sunny Beach and the Costa del Sol, which are cheapest in Europe, but keep an eye on Crete and Cyprus where falls in the cost of eating out make these islands better value than ever before.’","Cost of eight typical items, including beer, in Prague amounts to £35.29 .

"Whether it’s streaming countless episodes of The Walking Dead, or uploading super high-resolution photos, our desire for faster internet grows daily. But despite the many benefits it can bring, experts are predicting a darker side to having superfast connections. By 2025, as speeds soar, we could see the rise of holographic work colleagues, dubbed ‘cloud immigrants’, operating systems built inside the body, hackers causing havoc in the home, and precognition apps. By 2025, as speeds soar, experts predict we could see the rise of holographic work colleagues, dubbed ‘cloud immigrants’ (pictured), that could increase competition for jobs. They also expect operating systems to be built inside the body, hackers to cause havoc in the home, and precognition apps . The predictions were made as part of Pew Research Centre’s Killer Apps in the Gigabit Age report. It was commissioned to mark last year's 25th anniversary of the creation of the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The report covers expert views about what impacts faster bandwidth speeds could have on the world, economies, work life and more. ‘Over the past few decades people have been sharing and accessing magnitudes more information online annually,’ explained the report. ‘In 2014, Google and Verizon were among the innovators announcing that they are testing the capabilities for currently installed networks to carry data even more efficiently - at 10 gigabits per second - to businesses that handle large amounts of Internet traffic. ‘To explore the possibilities of the next leap in connectivity we asked thousands of experts to share their thoughts about likely new activities and applications that might emerge in the gigabit age. Gigabit connectivity (1,000 Mbps) is still limited globally, and although average speeds vary greatly, gigabit connections are 50-100 times faster than the average fixed high-speed connection. These speeds will advance current technologies, such as prediction apps like Google Now and Osito (pictured) ‘One interesting area of cognitive research is precognition, or things that lead to our responses or decisions before we act on them, even in the space of a nanosecond’ explained Annette Liska, director of design at a research firm. Google Now's predictive analysis already carries out a similar task . ‘The expectation of most of the more than 1,460 people who participated in this canvassing of experts is that as this connectivity becomes more common, online life will be significantly changed.’ For example, as Marcel Bullinga, a technology futures speaker and futurist, explained: ‘No doubt the killer app will be real-life holograms operating in real time: for instance, as doctors, as surgeons, as coworkers. ‘It will change the workplace. Not only will it diminish the need for business travel, it will also increase competition. ‘Whereas before you had to compete with fellow humans in the same physical area, immigrants for example, in the future you have to compete with ‘cloud immigrants’ - coworkers appearing in their work as a hologram.’ LeapFrog’s learning designer Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos told MailOnline she believes in the future, pen and paper will be replaced with tablets, and apps will project onto a shared screen. Every student will be given wearables to monitor and promote physical activity throughout the day, and send stats to parents . LeapFrog’s learning designer Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos told MailOnline she believes in the future, pen and paper in classrooms will be replaced with tablets, and apps will project onto shared screens. Every student will be given wearables to monitor and promote physical activity throughout the day, and these will send stats to parents and teachers. Family web portals for close communication between parents and teachers, as well as between students, will develop further. Students will be able to collaborate on homework, and parents will be able to talk to each other about workload and behaviour. Dr Levos also thinks that students will soon be able to video conference with other classes around the world. This could lead to foreign exchange trips become virtual. And voice recognition technology will be fitted in tablets and ebook readers to help children pronounce vocabulary and support second-language learning. ‘Teachers often struggle to deliver instruction at the right level for everyone in their class, given class sizes and varying competencies within their student population,’ explained Dr Levos. ‘Educational games can provide students with the concepts they need to learn, presented in fun and compelling ways, and with the types of support they need when they need it. She said there is an emerging focus on skills that go beyond the core curriculum, including skills such as collaboration, grit and perseverance, music and creativity, and problem solving skills. ‘Technology can encourage and support numerous child development and educational objectives, such as physical activity and health. ‘And there is a body of research supporting the notion that children learn best when they’re having fun. ‘Simultaneously, there is a movement growing to ensure that children have access to, and understand how to, play.’ Judith Perrolle, a professor at Northeastern University, based in Boston, added: ‘The Internet of Things will take an ugly turn as hackers, cyber security swat teams, advertisers, and terrorists run amok through citizens' and nations' refrigerators, heating systems, power grids, and pacemakers.’ She predicts that this will see lawyers becoming specifically qualified to deal with product liability, and in turn switching the fault from the manufacturer to the machine. ‘Problems with rogue nanobots and genetically engineered diseases will dwarf concerns about the internet,’ she continued. Design research consultant Anita Salem said: ‘The operating system will be integrated into the human body. I predict killer apps that control objects through thought.' She also believes such operating systems could lead to ‘super powers’ including X-ray vision, super hearing and mind control (X-Men's Professor X pictured) Ms Liska continued that superfast speeds will help develop a tool that intelligently recognises 'our choices and behaviours'. She believes this will likely use sensors implanted in the body, that are only turned on when needed. This image shows the various parts that make up the MC10 electronic tattoo called the Biostamp . In 2013, former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski issued a Gigabit City Challenge, urging all 50 US states to have at least one community with gigabit internet access by 2015 this year. Gigabit connectivity (1,000 Mbps) is still limited globally, and although average speeds vary greatly, gigabit connections are 50 to 100 times faster than the average fixed high-speed connection. These speeds will help advance current technologies, such as prediction apps like Google Now, Osito and Grokr. ‘One interesting area of cognitive research is precognition, or things that lead to our responses or decisions before we act on them, even in the space of a nanosecond,’ explained Annette Liska, director of unnnamed design firm in the report. ‘A tool that intelligently recognises our likely choices and behaviours, without overloading with information, then allows us to modify our choices based on a predictive outcome of those choices could play a key role in self-awareness, self-development, empathy, creativity, and our fundamental desire to feel connection to others’. The experts did predict positive changes in terms of medicine and education to be brought about by superfast broadband. In particular, health monitoring will be ‘cheaper and more convenient’, and will be done at home rather than at hospitals. And robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace (illustrated) There is already a trend being seen for this, with doctors carrying out Skype consultations (pictured) She believes this will likely use sensors implanted in the body, that are only turned on when needed. This is a prediction shared, somewhat, by design research consultant Anita Salem: ‘The operating system will be integrated into the human body. ‘I predict killer apps that control objects through thought - drug implants, virus detectors, stimulants and narcotics, virtual reality games, privacy and identity hiding tools, virtual pornography, robotic pets, robotic personal helpers, virtual wars, forced sterilizations, or birth control. Futurist Peter Cochrane recently said he believes  technology is easing people away from ‘mass medicine and treatment’ into a more focused world of personalised medicine targeted at the individual, whether that be at home or in public hospitals. Sensors will soon be able to relief pain, as well as detect cancer and other chemical inbalances in the body. Material, food, water and energy waste will be reduced thanks to the so-called Clouds of Things, where everything is tracked, has sensors, and can communicate with each other. And within 25 years, Mr Cochrane said jobs such as bankers, receptionists, call centre and warehouse operatives, will become redundant, with occupations such as 'cyborg engineers' and 'crime predictors' becoming common. She also believes that human operating systems could lead to ‘super powers’ including X-ray vision, super hearing and mind control. The experts did also predict positive changes in terms of medicine and education that will be brought about by superfast broadband. In particular, health monitoring will be ‘cheaper and more convenient’, and will be done at home rather than at hospitals, explained Hal Varian, chief economist at Google. ‘Indeed, the home security system will include health monitoring as a matter of course, [and] robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace.’ There is already a trend emerging, with doctors carrying out Skype consultations. The experts also said that diets and treatments tailored to individuals based on their DNA, analysed on superfast computers with vast amounts of data being processed all the time, will revolutionise treatments and save lives. Breanne Thomlison, founder and president of BTx2 Communications wrote: Tools will monitor us from birth and predict sickness and heal us faster. ‘Genetics will be patented and evolve to have cures to current and new disease that will arise. All of this will happen rapidly.’ She added that people will be able to connect with others who share similar DNA and experience a ‘personal connection to focus on prevention versus treatment’. And, when it comes to education, she said there will be an app for every child's learning ability or disability: ‘Children will be learning and tracking 24/7, while sharing their experience with selected-in peers and networks. 'Everyone will be the media and a newsmaker. Journalism will be more personal and targeted.’","Pew Research Centre interviewed 1,460 experts about the next ‘killer apps’

"The U.S. Navy has rejected the Navy Cross for Lt. Thomas Michael Conway, a 'heroic' chaplain who died while ministering to sailors . The U.S. Navy has rejected the Navy Cross for a 'heroic' chaplain who died while ministering to sailors in shark-infested waters after their ship was torpedoed during World War II. Lt. Thomas Michael Conway, a Catholic priest from Buffalo, New York, reportedly spent three nights praying with those aboard the USS Indianapolis in the Philippine Sea until he drowned aged 37. A Veterans Memorial Committee in Waterbury, where Conway was born, appealed to the Navy last year in a bid to get his actions recognized but the case has now been denied. The board  submitted testimonies from survivors, letters from Conway's family and other materials. Frank J. Centazzo, a survivor of the USS Indianapolis who is now deceased, previously described Conway as a 'respected' and 'loved' man. Recalling the chaplain's final hours, Centazzo wrote: 'I was in the group with Father Conway. I saw him go from one small group to another getting the shipmates to join in prayer and asking them not to give up hope of being rescued. 'He kept working until he was exhausted. I remember on the third day late in the afternoon when he approached me and Paul McGiness. 'He was thrashing the water and Paul and I held him so he could rest a few hours. 'Later, he managed to get away from us and we never saw him again.' The Navy refuted some of the documentation submitted by the Waterbury Veterans Memorial Committee and cited Navy regulations requiring those nominating sailors for awards to be of higher rank than the nominee. No survivors of the USS Indianapolis torpedoed in 1945 meet that requirement. Bob Dorr of the Waterbury Veterans Memorial Committee said he is disappointed by the recent decision. He says enlisted men appear to be precluded from making award recommendations. Lost at sea: Conway, a Catholic priest from Buffalo, New York, reportedly spent three nights praying with those aboard the USS Indianapolis (pictured above) in the Philippine Sea until he drowned aged 37 . More than 900 men died on 31 July 1945 when the USS Indianapolis was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine, I-58. Conway passed on August 2 1945 after spending several days swimming to the aid of his shipmates. He served with the navy for three years and was reportedly the last Catholic chaplain to die in WWII.

"The wife of the Al Qaeda chief who radicalised the Charlie Hebdo killers has claimed he is a ‘victim’. Sylvie Beghal, 45, who lives on benefits in Leicester, declared her husband Djamel Beghal a ‘hostage’ after he was put in solitary confinement following the terror attacks. She moaned that French officers broke his prison television and spilled his coffee while investigating his connection to the massacre. Sylvie Beghal, 45, who lives on benefits in Leicester, left, claims her husband, Djamel Beghal, right was a hostage after he was placed into solitary confinement following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris last week . Beghal, right, is believed to have radicalised Paris killers Amedy Coulibaly and Cherif Kouachi . Djamel Beghal – one of Al Qaeda’s top recruiters in Europe – is said to have radicalised Paris killers Amedy Coulibaly and Chérif Kouachi in a French prison and organised crossbow training for Hayat Boumeddiene, now the world’s most wanted woman. His wife, meanwhile, is believed to have cost British taxpayers more than a quarter of a million pounds in handouts since moving to the UK for its ‘Islamic environment’. ‘Djamel is under huge amounts of pressure,’ she complained after the Paris attacks. ‘They turned the cell upside down, wasted all of his supplies, mixing up all his sugar, pasta and coffee on the floor. They opened up the TV in a hateful and vengeful manner. ‘Yes, he is a victim of French injustice. And yes, he’s a French hostage.’ Mrs Beghal’s comments are likely to horrify the families and friends of those murdered in Paris last week. The Mail revealed Mrs Beghal’s disturbing comments as it also emerged: . ■ She is living on benefits with her four children in a four-bedroom home in the Midlands; . ■ She has previously taken legal action to try to have her terrorist husband moved from France to the UK; . ■ She claims she does not work because of ‘media pressure’; . ■ She has a conviction of her own related to her husband, which she is fighting at the Supreme Court, at huge cost to the taxpayer. Beghal, 49, who is regarded as one of Europe’s top terror recruiters, used to live in the UK but is now banned on grounds of national security. Born in Algeria, he moved when he was 22 to France, where he married in 1990. He became a French citizen, allowing the couple to relocate in 1998 to the UK. Though living in Leicester, he travelled to London, where he became a regular at Finsbury Park Mosque and was allegedly radicalised under the influence of Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada. French police released surveillance  photographs of Djamel Beghal, left and Paris killer Cherif Kouachi, right . Beghal, left, was also filmed meeting Amedy Coulibaly, right, who attacked a Jewish deli in Paris . Apparently keen to be trained by Al Qaeda, Beghal moved his family to Afghanistan in November 2000. A few months later and just weeks before the 9/11 attacks, he was arrested at Abu Dhabi airport, suspected of trying to return to Europe to lead Osama bin Laden’s war on the West. In 2005, he was sentenced in France to ten years behind bars after confessing to a bomb plot. While in jail, Beghal is believed to have radicalised Amedy Coulibaly, inspiring him to kill a policewoman and four shoppers last week. There, he also met Chérif Kouachi, one of the brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Around the same time, he also hosted crossbow training sessions for Hayat Boumeddiene, now the world’s most wanted woman, before he was imprisoned again. Beghal is previously thought to have helped recruit to Al Qaeda shoebomber Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, the suspected 20th 9/11 hijacker. Despite her husband’s damning links to Al Qaeda and the Paris terror attacks, Mrs Beghal has been allowed to live in Britain on benefits. She said in an earlier interview that the family chose Britain because: ‘I wanted to educate my children surrounded by Muslim brothers and sisters.’ According to the Government’s benefits calculator, she would be entitled to an estimated £20,900 a year in welfare. This assumes she is not claiming for any disabilities. Her two sons at university are likely to be receiving almost £35,000 a year in loans and grants. She has taken a conviction for failing to disclose information to police as far as the Supreme Court. Leicester Council said it could not discuss the ‘personal details’ of Mrs Beghal’s benefits. She refused to comment.","Sylvie Beghal believes her husband Djamel is a victim after Paris killings .

"Aid target: Mark Lowcock, Permanent Secretary of the Department for International Development, was given the handout last year . The head of Britain’s foreign aid department was handed a bonus of almost £20,000 as it met a target to spend billions more on overseas development. Mark Lowcock, Permanent Secretary of the Department for International Development, was given the handout last year, the ministry’s annual report for 2013/14 shows. Despite concerns over whether millions of pounds of aid money were being spent effectively, he received the bonus of between £15,000 and £20,000 on top of his salary of almost £165,000. Critics last night said the bonus was yet another example of the aid department’s profligacy. It comes after the damning conclusion of auditors that DfID splurged £1billion in only eight weeks at the end of 2013 in order to meet the Coalition commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid. The National Audit Office said the fact that the funds were spent so quickly raised serious questions about whether value for money was achieved. The Coalition commitment to the 0.7 per cent target meant that DfID had to spend £11.46billion on aid projects in 2013. In June 2013, DfID officials forecast that they would have to spend £2.7billion in November and December to hit the target. However, months later – under the leadership of Mr Lowcock – the department found it had to spend an extra £1billion on top of this to hit the 0.7 per cent target. This extra money was then allocated to different schemes over a period of only eight weeks. The NAO report tops a series of failings at the department. Two months ago an independent report found that DfID programmes were making corruption worse in Nigeria and Nepal. The department’s annual report for 2013/14 also shows that DfID’s director general Richard Calvert received a bonus of between £10,000 and £15,000 in addition to his £130,000 pay. DfID said the payments to Mr Lowcock and Mr Calvert were based on objectives reached in the year 2012/13. Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘People will be pretty surprised in my constituency to hear about this bonus payment. £20,000 is more than many people in Wellingborough earn in a year, and many of them have had to endure pay freezes. ‘Now we have criticism from the NAO saying that they gave away lots of money at the end of the year to meet the 0.7 per cent target, raising questions about value for money.’ The DfID report shows that as well as his large bonus, Mr Lowcock has amassed a pension pot of almost £1million, entitling him to an annual payment of almost £60,000 when he retires. Auditors concluded DfID splurged £1billion in only eight weeks at the end of 2013 in order to meet the Coalition commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid . The report reveals that the number of staff at DfID has risen by 7.3 per cent in the past year to 2,972, despite David Cameron’s pledge to cut the cost of government. The wage bill soared 8.8 per cent to £145.7million last year. At the same time, other departments’ budgets were reduced. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘DfID looks like a black hole for taxpayers’ cash. ‘Each penny of foreign aid should go to the world’s poorest, and the arbitrary way in which the department spends at the minute isn’t contributing enough to freedom, health or safety in the developing world.’ A DfID spokesman said: ‘The payments in question related to staff performance in the 2012/13 financial year, not 2013/14 when the UK first achieved the 0.7 per cent aid target. 'Furthermore, these salaries and performance payments are funded from the core administration budget which is entirely separate from the budget which is used to finance overseas aid programmes. 'They are paid in line with standard Civil Service rules and an independently-chaired Remuneration Committee advises on all pay and bonus awards for Permanent Secretaries.' He said DfID has reduced its admin budget by a third, reduced spending on admin consultants in DfID by 90 per cent, clamped down on the travel policy for staff and reformed aid spending.","Head of Britain’s foreign aid department was handed a bonus  as it met target to spend billions more on overseas development .

"The Oscars have been plunged into a race row over the fact that all the nominees in the four acting categories are white. American civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton said yesterday: ‘The movie industry is like the Rocky Mountains – the higher you get, the whiter it gets.’ Sharpton, 60, a critic of the lack of diversity in the US movie industry, added: ‘I have called an emergency meeting early next week in Hollywood … to discuss possible action around the Academy Awards.’ Scroll down for video and full list of nominations . Reverend Al Sharpton has said the Oscar nominations are 'appallingly insulting' and compared Hollywood to the Rocky Mountains, saying the higher you get 'the whiter it gets' Rev Sharpton  said David Oyelowo, left, should have been nominated for his performance as the late Reverend Martin Luther King, and the movie's director, Ava DuVernay, should have also received a nomination . The civil rights film Selma, based on Dr Martin Luther King’s marches, has been nominated for best picture – but its British star David Oyelowo, who plays King, did not make the shortlist for best actor. Selma’s director, Ava Duvernay, had been tipped to be the first black woman ever nominated for best director, after she was shortlisted for last weekend’s Golden Globes. But she, too, was locked out of Oscar contention in another all-white category. Sharpton said: ‘The lack of diversity in the Oscar nominations is appalling and while it is good that Selma was nominated for best picture, it’s ironic that they nominated a story about the racial shut-out around voting while there is a racial shut-out around the Oscar nominations. ‘With all of the talent in Selma and other black movies this year, it is hard to believe that we have less diversity in the nominations today than in recent history.’ The lack of ethnic variety prompted campaigners to take to social networking site Twitter and create the online trend #OscarsSoWhite. Best Picture nomination: Birdman received nine nods in total, one for Best Picture, it was announced on Thursday morning by the Academy Of Motion Pictures Arts And Sciences . On the list: The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes, also got a nod . Selma, starring Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, André Holland and Stephan James, was produced by Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment and Oprah Winfrey . The 2011 Oscars also featured an exclusively white crop of 20 acting nominees, the first time that had happened since 1998. But award watchers claim this is ‘the whitest Oscars’ in years and a reminder of the slow pace of change in Hollywood, even after what looked like progress for black actors and filmmakers last year stemming from the best picture winner, 12 Years A Slave. All 20 actors nominated in the four acting categories this year are white and no women are nominated for either best director or screenwriter. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has some 6,000 members. Tom O’Neil, founder of awards tracker Gold Derby, said: ‘The Academy is about 90 per cent white and 70 per cent male and we’re seeing the sad result of that in voting.’ Best Picture .

As studios have focused more and more on easily marketed blockbusters, Oscar season increasingly exists apart from the regular business of the movies, in its own highfalutin, red-carpeted realm. Ratings are on the rise. Last year's Oscars, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, drew 43 million viewers, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast in a decade. 12 Years a Slave took best picture. This year's ceremony will be hosted by Neil Patrick Harris. Shortly after the announcement, the host shared a video on his Twitter page. He told his 12.9million followers: 'The Oscar nominations just came out this morning and that can only mean one thing – I just lost 20 bucks.' Neil then turned to his four-year-old daughter Harper and handed her the cash, claiming he had bet on who would be up for Best Credit Design Of A Foreign Language Film – a made up category.

This is why people go out pinching and shoplifting because they can't live on [benefits]. 'If they got enough benefits they wouldn't need to go out and do things like that.' Robert Kerrigan, Rose's nephew, spends a significant portion of his benefits on buying himself designer trainers and maintaining his three mopeds. None of Robert and Adam Kerrigan and their friend Carl, who spends most of his time with the Kerrigans, have a job . The 24-year-old has four children but considers himself a father figure to seven. He said: 'I think it's all right for me really. My benefits pay my maintenance for my kids. I treat my girlfriend with clothes and trainers and that. 'I wouldn't be bothered if I had holes in my shoes so long as my kids look nice and are healthy. At the end of the day it's my money. If I skint myself then that's up to me.' Despite this claim, Robert still finds hundreds of pounds a year to spend on Adidas and Nike shoes. 'In the last year I've spent £600 on trainers. The most I've ever spent on a pair is about £130,' he said. With none of the family working, their days appear to be spent caring for their children, doing weekly volunteer work at a food bank, and drinking. The young mothers of the group, Carol Kerrigan (right) and Bethany, Adam Kerrigan's girlfriend, both live on benefits and live in council houses . Carl, an honorary Kerrigan who is friends with the family and spends most of his time with them, is seen downing apple schnapps as he explains how he drifts from day to day. 'Every day is the same day. When it's the weekend it's the same day. Sometimes I don't even know if it's the weekend,' he says. Mother-of-three Carol Kerrigan, 24, who has never held a job other than work experience and is on jobseekers' allowance, says she would work if someone gave her a job. She has recently moved back into her mother's council house. She said: 'Everybody would struggle without benefits. It's not just the Kerrigans - everyone is on benefits. 'It's not our problem if there's no jobs. We're not saying we won't work. We will work. Just give us a job and we'll do it. 'Too many people are coming from different areas and taking our jobs, obviously.'

"Jamie Schanbaum was 19 when she fell ill with what seemed like flu. Within weeks she had lost both legs and all her fingers to meningococcal disease - a meningitis-related illness. But six years later, staring stoically into the camera, she is now the star of a striking series of photographs honoring survivors. Scroll down for video . Beautiful: Jamie, 25, posing atop Helen of Troy, was 19 when she fell ill with what seemed like a nasty flu . Survivors: Julio, 15, from Brazil, lost both his legs to meningococcal disease - a meningitis-related illness . Moving series: Australian photographer Anne Geddes said she wanted to present the children, including Benjamen (pictured) as beautiful pillars of strength, having overcome the often fatal disease . The 25-year-old is one of fifteen young adults and children to pose for the revered photographer Anne Geddes. In her case, she was fashioned as a Helen Of Troy character. One young boy decided he was going to do a yoga pose for his portrait. And a set of twins embraced lovingly - one having lost her limbs, the other unaffected. Traumatic: Nine-year-old Ellie-May is embraced by her twin Sophie, who did not contract the disease . As well as empowering the children, such as Harvey (pictured), Geddes hopes to inform parents of the disease . Life-changing: Ambers, five, was two when she almost died of meningitis and doctors had to amputate her legs . Princess-like: Bernadette was struck by the disease just days before her third birthday, Geddes explained . Open: Mackenzie, nine, said he wanted to pick his own pose, before putting his injuries together for the camera . Battling through: Danielle, 20, contracted the disease six years ago but still rides horses . The project started as part of a campaign being jointly run by charities including Meningitis Now and the Meningitides Research Foundation. It has since grown, however, into a what Geddes sees as her best work to date. 'I've been photographing for 30 years and I think this would be the most significant project that I've ever done,' the Australian photographer told CBS. 'I wanted the images to be timeless. The vast majority of the 15 survivors [photographed] don't have legs. 'So I had to find a way to portray them, to give them a sense of strength and their own sense of individuality.' The disease is caused by an infection of the meninges cells in the brain and spinal cord which can lead to blood poisoning. The disease, which affected Elias (pictured), is caused by an infection of the meninges cells in the brain and spinal cord which leads to blood poisoning. Viral meningitis, the other type, is more common but less serious .

In an interview with the Daily Mail last year, Geddes said: ‘As a mother and passionate advocate of children, I want to empower parents to understand meningitis and know how best to protect their children. ‘You only need to look at Amber, Ellie and Harvey to understand the impact of this devastating disease. It really would be your worst nightmare to see any child go through such an ordeal. ‘But at the same time, these children and their families are overcoming huge obstacles to rebuild their lives and these beautiful pictures capture their strength in the face of adversity.’ Behind the lens: Geddes is best-known for her photographs of cherub-like babies among flower beds .

"He made headlines the world over by coming out last year, and then even more by kissing his boyfriend on live TV. Now Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL, has taken another leap of confidence - and likely controversy - by proposing to his longtime love from what is renowned as one of the holiest Catholic sites. Sam confirmed his engagement to college sweetheart Vito Cammisano on Twitter on Friday and posted a photo of himself getting on bended knee at St. Peters Basilica - one of the largest church's in the world - in Vatican City. The move is yet another step the 25-year-old has taken into uncharted territory and is sure to anger church officials and their strict opposition to gay marriage. The announcement coincided with a visit  to the Philippines by Pope Francis, who said in a speech today: 'The family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage.' Big question/statement: Micahel Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, got down on one knee for boyfriend Vito Cammisano from the top of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City . 'I said yes': The former Missouri linebacker, who was cut by the Rams and Cowboys this past season, officially announced his engagement to Vito Cammisano (pictured) on Twitter on Friday . Here come the grooms: Michael Sam - who celebrated his 25th birthday in Rome. The pair shared this picture from Italy on Instagram last week . TMZ first announced last week that Sam and Cammisano were engaged after rumors surfaced on social media. Sam posted the photo of the proposal with the message: 'Thankyou for saying yes.' Sam is thought to have popped the question on his 25th birthday on January 7. He and Cammisano were on a European vacation together in Italy, having spent New Years in Spain. At Christmas, Sam also posted a photo to his Instagram of a ring, where he thanked his boyfriend for 'a great Christmas gift'. The couple met when Sam was a freshman at the University of Missouri, during one of his first college parties. It was a lingerie party and Cammisano was dressed as a rabbit, complete with a tail, which Sam told Out magazine he remembered because Cammisano - a star swimmer from 2009 to 2012 - was drunkenly vomiting over a railing from a second-story deck. 'I went up to him to ask if he was OK, and he started cursing at me, screaming, ''F--- off — do you know who I am?'' ' Sam told the mag. 'I told him I didn't care who he was. We didn't speak again for two years.' Wrong finger: At Christmas Sam posted a photo of a ring his boyfriend had given him, which he appears to be wearing on his right hand in this shot . Nice ring: Sam posted this photo to Instagram at Chrismas, thanking Cammisano for the amazing gift . When Cammisano came out to his swim team in 2011, they started dating, however it was secret, because Sam was closeted. 'Early on, it was awesome,' Sam said during a recent documentary on his life produced by the OWN network. 'And then bad things started to happen.' 'When Vito came to my house, he had to sneak through in and out of the window. 'Vito was getting really tired of that.' The pair broke up for a few months, until the holidays, when Cammisano realized Sam didn't have anywhere for Christmas. 'So Mickey came to Kansas City for Christmas and that's when (we realized) we missed this,' Cammisano said in the doco. 'It really was Christmas that brought us back together.' Controversial: Many viewers erupted in anger after a televised kiss was shown on ESPN in May as Sam was drafted by the St. Louis Rams . The pair have been together since, but were not captured in public together until earlier this year. They hit international headlines in May, when Sam - who  had come out in February - made history as the first openly gay NFL draft pick. The moment he was told he had been drafted by the St. Louis Rams was televised live on ESPN, and an emotional Sam kissed Cammisano in celebration. The unprecedented moment was met with reactions of joy by most but dismay, anger and even hate by others. Some online postings deplored the kiss as inappropriate for family viewing. Sam and Cammisano shared another public kiss last month when Sam accepted a GQ Man of the Year award. Sealed with a kiss: NFL player Michael Sam kisses his boyfriend Vito Cammisano after being named GQ Man of the Year 2014 in West Hollywood last month . Happy couple: Sam was nominated for the award along with Chris Pratt, Steve Carell, Dave Chappelle, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley and featured on a joint cover of GQ magazine in December . Sam recently told Oprah Winfrey that while the aftermath of the moment was surprising, he would do it again. 'Absolutely. I came out so I wouldn't have to hide myself,' he said in the interview. 'That was me. What you saw was me. It wasn't staged. I was very emotional. 'And when I got that phone call it was one of the happiest moments of my life. 'It was three long days, coming close to the end of that, almost not being drafted. 'I wanted to share a moment with the one who had spent the same three days, I wanted to share a moment with him. 'I'm not a pretender anymore.' Sam was cut from the St. Louis Rams and then, in October, was dropped by the Dallas Cowboys. 'While this is disappointing, I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday,' he wrote on Twitter at the time.","Sam Tweeted a photo of himself Friday proposing at St. Peter's Basilica .

"A furious row erupted in Italy today over claims the government paid Islamic extremists a £9million ransom to free two aid workers held  in Syria. Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, flew back to Rome this morning after they were captured by militants believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August. News of their return was applauded in Parliament, but also drew heavy criticism from opposition politicians after Arab media reports suggested a ransom of 12 million euros (£9m) had been paid. European governments including Italy have long tolerated or facilitated ransom payments to secure the release of hostages although the practice has frequently been denied officially. The leader of the Northern League party, Matteo Salvini, said on Twitter: 'If the government really paid a ransom of 12million euros to free the two friends of the Syrians, it would be disgusting!' Scroll down for video . Enjoying their freedom: Italian aid workers Greta Ramelli (left) and Vanessa Marzullo arrive in Rome after being abducted by Islamic militants in Syria last summer . The pair were seen in a video (above) in December showing them dressed in black robes and headscarves and urging the Italian government to do everything it could to bring them home . Lucio Malan, a senior member of the centre-right Forza Italia party, said the government should explain whether a ransom had been paid. If it were paid 'to save two valuable lives, then thousands of others -- equally valuable -- would be put at risk,' Malan said in a statement. A ransom payment 'would encourage terrorists, illegitimate entities like the so-called caliphate and simple criminals to take Italians hostage, wherever they may be,' he added. Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni dismissed the claims as 'baseless', but did not deny directly that a payment had take place. He told the lower house that Italy is 'against payment of ransom' and follows 'the rules and behaviours' shared by the international community. But he added: 'When it comes to Italians taken hostage, our priority is focused on saving their lives and the physical integrity of our compatriots.' The issue has taken on unusual prominence after Islamist gunmen killed 17 people in Paris and a day after Belgian police killed two men during a raid on an apparently separate Islamist group. The pair are welcomed by Italy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni (left) at Ciampino airport in Rome. The foreign ministry said yesterday their release was the result of 'intense work by team Italy' but officials have not revealed whether a ransom was paid or exactly how they came to be freed. A report in the New York Times last year said Al Qaeda and its affiliates had made at least $125 million from kidnap ransoms since 2008, most from European governments making payments through proxies. The women, from Lombardy in northern Italy, disappeared on July 31 near Aleppo in northern Syria three days after they arrived from Turkey. They were captured by militants believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August while distributing aid in Aleppo. Wearing faint smiles and with their heads bowed, the women were rushed into the airport hall without a word or even a nod towards the press. The pair were to be taken to hospital for a check-up and then to see Rome's anti-terrorist prosecution office, which has opened an investigation into their abduction. 'I'm feeling such enormous joy: this is the news I have been waiting for for a long time,' Salvatore Marzullo, father of Vanessa, said from his restaurant in Verdello near Bergamo in northern Italy, after news of their release. 'I am so, so happy,' he told the AGI news agency. The women were captured by militants believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August while distributing aid in Aleppo . On Twitter, Interior Minister Angelino Alfano welcomed the news 'with great joy and a huge sigh of relief.' Ramelli and Marzullo were captured by gunmen in Aleppo province while working for the aid group Horryaty, which specialises in health and clean water projects. They were last heard of on December 31 when a video was posted online showing them dressed in black robes and headscarves and urging the Italian government to do everything it could to bring them home. The posting on YouTube was entitled 'Al-Nusra Front detains two Italian employees because of their government's participation in the coalition against it.' But the video was not posted on any official accounts belonging to Al-Nusra, which is Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. Italy's foreign ministry has given little away about who it thought was holding the women but had denied reports they were prisoners of the Islamic State group. The liberation of the two women leaves two Italians unaccounted for in conflict zones overseas. Jesuit priest Paolo Dall'Oglio was kidnapped in Syria in July 2013 and aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto disappeared in the tribal zones between Pakistan and Afghanistan in January 2012. Both men are feared dead. Italy last year secured the release of two construction workers held in Libya and the country has a track record of paying ransoms to get its citizens home safely. That approach has been controversial with some of its NATO allies, chiefly Britain and the United States, who argue that handing over cash only encourages further abductions and can end up funding terror attacks. In theory, Italy signed up to not paying ransoms at a NATO summit in September 2014 but media reports suggested money changed hands in the Libya cases. Italian officials were able to portray the Libya kidnappings as essentially criminally motivated rather than being the work of hardened terrorists. But that stance may be harder to maintain if it emerges that the two women had been in the grasp of either Al-Nusra or Islamic State.","Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, were captured in July last year .

"A concept for the ‘Concorde of the tunnelling world’ has been revealed. And if it ever becomes a reality, it could make high speed train travel from the UK to the US a reality. The idea for the transport system of the future, was proposed in a competition run by think tank in a bid to boost business between Manchester and New York. The future? A concept for a transatlantic train in a vacuum tunnel (illustrated) dubbed the ‘Concorde of the tunnelling world,’ has been proposed in a competition . The proposal, which was seen by IPPR North, claims that technological advantages could make the dream of a transatlantic train journey a reality and transform the economy in the north of England. The train would be contained within a tube underneath the Atlantic Ocean, with a service running in a perfect vacuum. ‘The train is levitated in mid-air using electric magnets,’ said Simon Horton, a young professional who submitted the idea with several colleagues. The proposal  claims that  a transatlantic train journey would transform the economy in the north of England, together with the region's own 'Hyperloop' (pictured) which would connect city airports . ‘This reduces nearly all causes of friction and drag, enabling both huge speeds and a completely smooth (and silent) journey.’ Based on calculations by entrepreneur Elon Musk, who came up with the idea of a train that travels inside a vacuum tube, a journey between Manchester and New York City could take just four hours, if a maximum speed of 800mph (1,287kph) was achievable. Paul Batty, another competition entrant under the age of 25, proposed a 'northern hyperloop,' which has much in common with Elon Musk’s designs for a Hyperloop vacuum train, only instead of connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco, the northern English version would link airports to a ‘superhub’. Inside the tubes of Elon Musk's design, Hyperloop, pods are mounted on thin skis made out of inconel,an alloy already used by his SpaceX firm that can withstand high pressure and heat. Air is pumped into the skis via small holes to make an air cushion, and each pod has air inlets at the front. An electric turbo compressor compresses air from the nose and routes it to the skis and to the cabin. Magnets on the skis, plus an electromagnetic pulse give the pod its initial thrust; reboosting motors along the route would keep the pod moving at just below the speed of sound so the system does not produce sonic booms. Under the plans, individual airports would act as terminals within a single rapidly connected local, national and international rail and air network. The English design also builds on Mr Musk’s vacuum tunnel concept by adding a propeller to the front of the train to force any remaining air resistance back. Cities such as Manchester could also see other futuristic changes to their transport systems. Sections of the road could be replaced by solar panels to generate power for the national grid, according to a group of students, or electricity could be generated by energy-capturing technology to convert noise energy to electricity intended to power electric cars, for example. In another futuristic vision, the region’s roads would be equipped with wind-capturing technology, which would convert wind energy to electricity, made available to electric car drivers via vehicles charging points. The transport system would reap benefits including a reduced reliance on fossil fuels and greater availability of renewable energy, the think tank said. Under the plans, individual airports would act as terminals within a single rapidly connected local, national and international rail and air network. A train could run from Manchester (pictured left) to New York (right) The design has much in common with Elon Musk’s plans for a vacuum train called the Hyperloop (illustrated), only instead of connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Northern English version would link airports to a ‘superhub’ A 15-year plan called One North, submitted on behalf of the cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield already features an interconnected transport system across air, roads, ports and rail, including the high-speed east–west rail route dubbed HS3. It also includes a potential new tunnel through the Pennines to increase rail capacity. Environmentally-friendly developments feature heavily in future plans with ideas for ‘green cities’, a carbon free north and even the creation of a Pennines National Park. The park would span the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Parks to include the Pennines range, attracting tourism and jobs by playing on the heightened ‘status’. It is the brainchild of Professor Ian Wray, who believes parts of the moors should be considered potential World Heritage Sites arguing they are ‘particularly rich in industrial archaeology’. ‘Some of these moors were the birthplace of a system of “proto-industrialism” which lit the fuse for the industrial revolution in Manchester and Yorkshire,’ he said. The proposal, which was seen by IPPR North, claims that technological advantages could make the dream of a transatlantic train journey a reality, between Manchester and New York (both marked on the map) One day, sections of road could be replaced by solar panels (illustrated with a concept image) to generate power for the national grid, or electricity could be generated by energy-capturing technology to convert noise energy to electricity intended to power electric cars, for example . Billionaire inventor Elon Musk has revealed he plans to build a test track for Hyperloop - a futuristic type of transport that would shoot capsules of passengers along a tube at around the speed of sound. Mr Musk claims his solar-powered 'Hyperloop' could herald a revolution in travel - and is building the test facility to prove it. He believes it would take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles (613km) from Los Angeles to San Francisco – half the time it takes in a plane – and likened the passenger experience to Disneyland's rocket ride Space Mountain. Elon Musk's Hyperloop (an conceptual image is shown) could take just 30 minutes to travel the 381 miles (613 km) from Los Angeles to San Francisco – half the time it takes in a plane. He has likened the passenger experience to Disneyland's rocket ride Space Mountain . Now, the plans are beginning to take shape. Mr Musk tweeted: 'Will be building a Hyperloop test track for companies and student teams to test out their pods. Most likely in Texas.' A new firm, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, is developing plans to makes the tubes a reality - and it has recruited experts from around the world. The crowdsourced firm has around 100 engineers on the projects, and nearly all of them have day jobs at companies like Boeing, Nasa, Yahoo!, Airbus, SpaceX, and Salesforce. Mr Musk's idea is based on the pneumatic tubes that fire capsules of paperwork between floors in offices. In this case, the capsules would carry people – even cars – in low-pressure tubes to minimise turbulence and maximise speed. On top of pylons is a hovering capsule inside a low-pressurized tube, which can reach speeds of up to 760 mph. 'The only resistance would be the air in front of the capsule, which we moved to the back by using a compressor,' Hyperloop CEO Dirk Ahlborn said. At its launch, Musk described the Hyperloop design as looking like a shotgun, with the tubes running side-by-side for most of the journey, then closing at either end to form a loop. Trains of capsules would shoot through the almost air-free tube at up to 760mph (1,223kph), accelerated by magnets which would also keep each pod on a steady course. Each capsule would float on a cushion of air it creates as it speeds along – similar to an air hockey table. While trains travelling through vacuum tubes could one day connect major US cities (illustrated), for now, a test track will be uilt to test the idea - most likely in Texas, according to a tweet . Capsules carrying six to eight people would depart every 30 seconds, with tickets costing around £13 ($20) each way. In his proposal released online, Musk wrote: 'Short of figuring out real teleportation, which would of course be awesome (someone please do this), the only option for super-fast travel is to build a tube over or under the ground that contains a special environment.' The proposed route of the first Hyperloop follows Interstate 5, which runs through the agriculture-rich Central Valley in California. It would take seven to ten years to build. Musk put the price tag at around £4billion ($2.6billion).","The transatlantic train idea was one of the ideas were proposed in a competition run by Manchester-based think tank, IPPR North .

"A 5-year-old boy who swallowed a battery when he was just a toddler is finally able to speak and breathe on his own again. Emmett Rauch of Peoria, Arizona had to undergo 65 surgeries over the course of four years, but after all that he is finally living the life of every other kid his age. This after Emmett ingested the lithium battery from a DVD remote which shut off his airway and burned his esophagus. Scroll down for video . Emmett Rauch (above) who swallowed a battery when he was just a toddler is finally able to speak and breathe on his own again . Rauch had to undergo 65 surgeries over the course of four years . NBC 4 reports that Emmett had his tracheotomy tube removed in December, after a long battle that at times seemed impossible. 'I mean he can go and be a little boy and not have this thing sticking out of his neck,' said his mother Karla. 'He is relearning how to swallow and can almost eat a whole piece of pizza.' And now, after all they have gone through, Emmett's parents have teamed with Safe Kids and National Poison Control to raise awareness about the dangers presented by batteries. Emmett had four inches of his esophagus removed after the acid from the battery burned two holes through it. He has also suffered multiple cases of collapsed lung and had close to 200 X-rays before he was even 2-years-old. The batteries are so dangerous because they don't have as much casing as an AA battery. 'He is relearning how to swallow and can almost eat a whole piece of pizza,' said his mother Karla (above) Emmett's parents (father above) have teamed with Safe Kids and National Poison Control to raise awareness about the dangers presented by batteries . A nurse who cared for Emmett, Michelle Chacon, said she has seen several cases of children swallowing batteries and that more should be done to make families aware of the household danger. The nurse has helped the Rauch family set up a charity to raise awareness about the tiny batteries which are used in everyday objects like clocks, cameras and calculators. Ms Chacon said: 'You talk about childproofing your home and covering your outlets, and this needs to be a part of that.' According to the National Capital Poison Center, each year in the U.S. more than 3,500 people swallow miniature disc or button batteries.","Emmett Rauch, who swallowed a battery when he was just a toddler, is finally able to speak and breathe on his own again .

"This shocking footage captures the moment a mass brawl and gunfight erupted at a Moscow strip club after a Russian gangster flirted with an attractive girl who arrived with a rival group. Terrified club-goers and semi-naked strippers ran for cover as mobsters violently clashed in terrifying scenes described as being 'like the Wild West'. The fight, which left 15 people in hospital, started after a girl who was with one of the gangs joined strippers on stage for a dance. Scroll down for video . Confrontation: Two men grapple with each other at a strip club in Moscow while behind them a topless woman dances over a man sitting in a chair . When one gangster 'tried moving in on her' - a rival thug attacked one of the flirtatious mobster's friends before pulling out a gun and shooting him the stomach. The violence then escalated as members of both gangs charged into each other, smashing chairs over each other's heads and firing more shots. In the CCTV footage, the men are seen wildly punching and kicking at their rivals as a terror-stricken stripper cowers on the floor by a chair. A regular at the strip club, Vladlen Uspensky, 45, said: 'It was absolutely terrifying. 'I've been going to these clubs for years and although you sometimes get a little trouble because people have had too much to drink, I have never seen anything like this. All calm: A female stripper was seen standing over a club-goer surrounded by empty seats in CCTV footage . 'It was like something out of the Wild West. 'There were gunshots, fist fights, chairs being thrown, it was mental.' The club's owner Andrei Bolshakov nicknamed 'Mi Mi' said: 'The incident involved 15 people.

"With a single fist in the air, this is how mourners chose to say a final farewell to Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier at his funeral in Paris today. Surviving cartoonist Renald 'Luz' Luzier, who drew this week's cover featuring the Prophet Mohammed, bowed his head and wept as he raised his tattooed wrist aloft. The defiant gesture is a fitting send-off for Charbonnier, a man who dedicated his life to living in opposition and once declared: 'I would rather die standing than live on my knees'. Scroll down for video . Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Renald 'Luz' Luzier, who drew this week's cover illustration featuring the Prophet Mohammed, raises his fist in the air during a funeral service for editor Stephane Charbonnier today . Several hundred mourners crowded into the community center in Charbonnier's childhood home of Pontoise, a district of Paris synonymous with impressionist art, to wish him a final goodbye . Stephane Charbonnier, known to friends and fans as Charb, was killed on Wednesday last week after fanatical jihadi gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi opened fire inside the Charlie Hebdo offices . Charbonnier - known to his friends and fans as Charb - was born in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a small district of north-western Paris, huddled up against the Seine. The son of a postal worker father and secretary mother, he grew up in Pontoise, an historic arrondissement several miles to the north of his birthplace, and synonymous with impressionist art. At one time Van Gogh, Cezanne, Pissarro and Gauguin, all either lived or worked in the picturesque district, and painted its landscape. During the service tributes were read to the man who helped revive Charlie Hebdo in 1992 along with Jean Cabut, who was also killed last week . The prestigious heritage certainly rubbed off on Charbonnier, who drew from a young age. His first drawings were published in a student magazine when he was just 14. He went to study at the Lycée Camille Pissarro, a art college close to his home which counted the impressionist among its patrons when it opened in 1959. After graduating he went on to study advertising, but broke off that career when he was invited to work on satirical magazine La Grosse Bertha - which translates as Big Bertha, named after the formidable First World War German artillery piece. He joined the magazine in 1991, and made his debut as Charb with a cartoon opposing the first Gulf War. He served just a year on Grosse Bertha's staff before a row over the magazine's political content caused several senior staff to walk, including renown cartoonist Jean 'Cabu' Cabut. Cabu convinced Charbonnier to leave with him, and together the pair revived Charlie Hebdo, which was originally founded in 1970, but went out of print in 1981. Cabu was one of the nine staff killed alongside Charbonnier when bloodthirsty jihadis Said and Cherif Koauchi bust into their offices last Wednesday and opened fire. Operating now without restrictions, Charbonnier and Cabut quickly established a reputation for pushing the boundaries of taste, while staunchly defending the right to freedom of expression. Charbonnier was at the centre of the 2006 decision to reprint cartoons of Mohammed by Dutch illustrator Kurt Westergaard which caused international outrage. Emotional: Clutching a drink in one hand and a friend in the other, Renald Luzier weeps as Charbonnier's casket is carried away from his funeral service in Paris . Defiant: The raised fist gesture was a fitting send off for a man who lived his life in opposition, and once declared 'I would rather die standing than live on my knees' Sombre: Pallbearers take the coffin of Stephane 'Charb' Charbonnier into the community centre in Pontoise, Paris, at his funeral service earlier today . After Philippe Val, another former Grosse Bertha contributor, left the magazine in 2009 it was Charbonnier who stepped in to take his place. Ensuring the publication remained as controversial as ever, he put together an issue in which the magazine was renamed 'Sahria Hebdo', which claimed to be guest edited by Mohammed, and carried the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die laughing'. That lead to the magazine's offices being firebombed in 2011, though at the time of that attack they were empty. The target was instead believed to be the publication's computer system. Charbonnier was placed under police guard after death threats flooded in, and Charlie Hebdo relocated to its new premises on Rue Nicolas-Appert, where the attacks took place last week. A mourner wearing a T-shirt bearing the Je Suis Charlie slogan, a defiant rallying cry that spread around the world in the days after the Paris attacks, arrives to pay his respects . Respect: A band play their instruments as Charbonnier's coffin is taken away from the service to be buried . Packed: Mourners unable to find a space inside the community centre watch tributes being paid to Charbonnier on large TV screens outside . Refusing to bow to the threats, he published several subsequent editions featuring Mohammed including him being pushed around by a Rabbi while in a wheelchair - which he drew himself. His defiant stance lead to several fatwas being issued against him, and in 2013 he was placed on Al Qaeda's hit-list of nine men wanted 'for crimes against Islam'. He died last week aged 47 during the massacre at the magazine's office. Witness reports said he was the main target of the attack, and his name was called before he was shot. He was murdered alongside Jean Cabut, 76, Elsa Cayat, 54, Philippe Honoré, 74, Bernard Maris, 68, Mustapha Ourrad, 60, Michel Renaud, 69, Bernard Verlhac, 57, and Georges Wolinski, 80. Several hundred people attended his emotional funeral service in Pontoise today, the day after services took place for Verlhac, Wolinski, Cayat, and Franck Brinsolaro, the police protection officer assigned to look after Charbonnier. John Kerry was also in Paris today to pay his respects, and visited the Charlie Hebdo offices where tributes to those killed, including Charbonnier, have been attached to the walls .","Stephane Charbonnier laid to rest in childhood home of Pontoise, Paris .

"The body of a missing AIG executive, last seen at a Californian hotel on Thursday, was discovered in the nearby desert. Omar Arce Meza, 33, from Los Angeles, was last seen at around 11pm at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort in Palm Desert. The cause of death is still unknown. Omar Arce Meza, 33, from Los Angeles (pictured with his wife, Diane), was last seen at around 11pm at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort in Palm Desert . Investigation: Police divers had searched the pond at the Marriott Hotel in Palm Desert (pictured) but to no avail, though they have found Mr Meza's jacket and wallet on the golf course . Mystery: Mr Meza was last seen on Thursday at the luxury Marriott resort in California . 'We are with heavy hearts tonight as we announce the passing of Omar Meza. He was a very loved son, husband, brother & friend. We would like to take this time to grieve his passing and ask that everyone please respect our privacy at this time,' said his family in a Facebook statement. 'We would like to thank all of the supporters this past week. It brings tears to our eyes to see how well loved Omar was, he will be missed by many.' His wife Diane described how she spoke to him at around 11.20pm on January 8. He told her that he would call her from his hotel room to say goodnight. Diane, who had been married to Mr Meza for five years, told The Los Angeles Times: ‘I never got that call, and I already fell asleep.’ She said the fact that he didn’t call didn’t unduly alarm her. Diane, along with family and friends, had set up a Facebook page containing photographs and information about Mr Meza to aid the search effort. Meza, a vice president for AIG Financial Distributors, had business meetings scheduled for Friday that he didn’t show up for. Baffling: Meza was last seen walking out of the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort wearing gray pants and a white T-shirt . Mr Meza has short term memory loss caused by a traffic accident last year - but it's not known if that is linked to his disappearance . He hadn’t used his credit card since Thursday and CCTV footage showed him exiting the hotel on foot wearing gray pants and a white T-shirt, and walking near a parking lot before moving out of shot. The ‘Find Omar’ Facebook page says that he may have been disorientated. He suffered from short-term memory loss, caused by a road traffic accident, but it’s not known if this is a factor in his disappearance. Diane told Kesq.com: 'I'm holding onto that he suffered trauma and doesn't know who he is.'

"A 22-year-old waitress whose legs were severed by a train has also lost most of her fingers to frostbite - but managed a smile as she was reunited with her beloved dog in her hospital bed. Sarah Stott  was walking across a set of tracks on her way home in Verdun near Montreal on December 8 when the train struck her. She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and suffered hypothermia - causing her to lose large parts of her fingers - as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures. But her friends and family say she is in 'good spirits' despite the prospect of a painful rehabilitation for the rest of her life. After two weeks in hospital she was also bought steak, her favorite meal, and told those around her: 'This is a good day'. Treatment: Sarah Stott, 22, shares a moment with her beloved dog following a two week stay in hospital. Her legs were severed by a train at the end of December and she has since lost most of her fingers to frostbite . Miss Stott uploaded a picture to her Facebook of her kissing her dog with an oven glove on her right hand. On her bandaged left hand, you can see a number of fingers have been removed up to the knuckle. Em Whyte, the organised of Miss Stott's GoFundMe page which has so far raised $50,000 towards her medical bills, wrote:  I saw Sarah this past weekend. She is in such good spirits and she looks and is acting like her beautiful self. 'Unfortunately Sarah's hands didn't fully recover from the frostbite, portions of all of her fingers had to be amputated. 'She has most of her index fingers and thumbs but all of her other fingers were removed around the first knuckle. 'Fortunately we were able to let Sarah and her dog visit for a few minutes this weekend and they were both so happy. In the past week Sarah has been able to eat food without an intervenes for the first time in a month so we brought her a steak dinner (her favourite) she had lots of company, was enjoying herself and said: ""this was a good day"". 'Although Sarah is such a strong person and putting on a brave face she is in a lot of pain, she has phantom pains in her feet and a lot to get use to. 'If all goes as planned Sarah will be well enough to be moved to Ottawa at the end of February to start her rehabilitation near her family and friends. Once Sarah is moved is when she will really begin to incur financial expenses. Severe: The waitress was making her way across a set of tracks on her way to her home in Verdun near Montreal when a train struck her in December . Debiltating: She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and she also risks losing her fingertips after suffering hypothermia as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures . Horrifying: Her mother said Miss Stott saw her severed legs laying on the tracks next to her so she tried to crawl towards them. She lay in the freezing cold for three hours before she was taken to hospital . 'To mention a few costs, Sarah will need: a wheelchair, prosthetic legs and fingers. Alterations to everyday things will also be necessary. Although some costs will be covered it seems to be the bare minimum and Sarah's dreams are not minimal. 'Please help her reach them! Help us reach this goal for Sarah!! No donation is to small, every dollar counts. Thank you to everyone who has donated, offered services, advise, console and concern. Miss Stott had planned to visit a friend following her shift at the Irish Embassy Pub and Grill in downtown Montreal on Monday December 8. She got a taxi to her house but when she realized no one was at home, she left on foot and headed home. As a short cut, she made her way over the CN Rail Tracks near Victoria Bridge, an area which has become popular with people crossing despite being unauthorized. Miss Stott noticed there was a stopped train on one side of the tracks, however she did not spot the second coming the other way. It's not known how fast the train was travelling at the time. Her mother told CBC that Miss Stott could see her severed legs beside her on the tracks, so tried to crawl towards them. She then lay on the ground in the cold for three hours before she saw another train approaching, waved it down and got them to help. Positive: Despite the double amputation, her friends and family however say she is in good spirits and a crowd-funding campaign has so far raised more than $50,000 towards her medical bills . Miss Stott was then admitted to Montreal hospital trauma unit and has undergone 15 surgeries since her arrival. Her mother Shelley said: 'It’s a miracle that she’s alive. Every day with her is an absolute blessing. She has an extremely strong spirit and will to live. She was left there for three, four hours with her legs severed, in the cold. She was still conscious. She was hypothermic.' Despite the severity of her injuries her mother added that she still had a sense of humor. Mrs Stott added: 'I walked into the room one day and she was awake, and she lifted her leg and said, ""Look Mom, I have no legs!"" And I said, ""Yes sweetheart, you’re going to get a brand new one.'"" 'She said, 'Yes I am! It’ll be firm forever — and I want it tanned,'"" Her mother now plans to take her back to the family home in Ottawa so she can care for her. With a long road ahead of her, a GoFundMe page has been set up and has already attracted hundreds of anonymous bids. 'It’s very overwhelming,' Mrs Stott added. 'I always believed people have a good heart, but for the amount that was raised in such little time. 'I’m speechless. I’m overwhelmed. I’m full of gratitude.'","Sarah Stott was crossing a train yard near Montreal on December 8 .

"Security was dramatically stepped up for police officers and the Jewish community in Britain yesterday amid fears of a terror attack. Intelligence chiefs are worried that Islamist fanatics could try to copy the atrocities in France last week that cost 17 lives. Four Jewish people and three police officers were among the dead. Scroll down for video . Heavily armed police officers have been deployed in greater numbers because of the ISIS terror threat . Fears of similar carnage in the UK intensified on Thursday after commandos in Belgium killed Islamic State fanatics who wanted to behead a policeman or a judge. The plot held chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich. In other developments: . The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly been given enhanced security on a public appearance. Mark Rowley, the UK’s senior counter-terrorism officer, said: ‘The global picture of terrorist activity does give us heightened concern about the risk to the Jewish community.’ The Met assistant commissioner said the murders at a kosher supermarket in Paris, coupled with a rise in anti-semitic rhetoric from extremists, justified more patrols in areas with large Jewish populations, including London, Leeds and Manchester. Some 263,000 people in Britain describe themselves as Jewish. The country’s 70 Jewish schools have been put on high alert. The Community Security Trust, which advises Jewish institutions and groups on safety, said: ‘We spend an inordinate amount of money on security, particularly on our schools – as we should. Obviously there’s a change in the threat level because there could be people who might be perversely inspired by what they saw happen [in Paris].’ Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, pictured, confirmed that extra officers would be available to protect high-risk locations such as Jewish schools as well as potential threats against police . Mr Rowley added: ‘We are also considering what further measures we might put in place to enhance the security of police officers, given some of the deliberate targeting of the police we have seen in a number of countries across Europe and the world.’ He said the authorities were also looking at the safety of other minority communities. Speaking after talks with President Obama at the White House, Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s very important to learn the lessons from anything happening elsewhere in Europe. ‘Could that happen here? What steps should be taken? So the police have announced today that they’ll be stepping up patrols, particularly to protect the Jewish community. ‘We have to be incredibly vigilant and look at all of these risks, particularly risks to police officers themselves and take every action that we can.’ The Prime Minister used the talks to press for tougher action to require internet firms to join the fight against terror by alerting authorities to suspicious exchanges online. An official report last year concluded that Facebook failed to pass on information that could have prevented the murder of Fusilier Rigby and the site was a ‘safe haven for terrorists’. Investigators across Europe are working around the clock to target returning Islamic State fighters. The UK security services believe around 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the so-called jihad, with around half now back home. Counter-terror chiefs fear they may carry out ‘lone wolf’ attacks. Professor Michael Clarke, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think-tank, said the chance of marauding attacks by armed gunmen was ‘likely to increase’. Last year 3,934 potential extremists were referred to a Government deradicalisation programme and 777 were assessed as such a danger that they needed to take part. We can't monitor all 300 fanatics say deluged security chiefs . ANALYSIS BY JAMES SLACK . Top of the list of EU countries whose citizens have travelled to fight in Syria and Iraq stand France, Britain and Belgium. In the past week, two of those have witnessed terrifying scenes as jihadis swearing allegiance to Islamic State fought gun battles with the police. So is Britain next? According to the security services, 600 extremists have travelled from the UK to fight in Syria. This compares with around 700 from France and 400-plus from Belgium. Edward Snowden, pictured, inflicted huge damage on the capability of the security services to track fanatics . Of the 600 Britons, half are now back home. Thirty have been arrested and charged. It is not practically possible for MI5 to monitor the rest round-the-clock. More than 200 are known to be living in and around London. A surveillance operation of this level requires 30 officers per suspect, plus manpower to monitor their electronic communications. Such resources do not exist. David Cameron recently announced an extra £130million for the intelligence agencies, but it takes up to two years to train an MI5 agent. Case managers will have to make hugely difficult decisions over which to watch most closely. In the majority of cases, they will get the judgment right. At least four major plots have been foiled in the past year and since July 2005 there has been only one successful attack – the gruesome murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Inevitably, MI5, like its counterparts in France and elsewhere, will sometimes call it wrong. Fusilier Rigby’s killers had appeared repeatedly on the Security Service radar but weren’t considered a priority. So had the 7/7 bombers. And Mohammed Ahmed and Yusuf Sarwar, both 22 and serving 12 years in jail for terror offences, were arrested on their return to the UK from Syria only after Sarwar’s mother had reported them to the police. Terrorists are increasingly aware of how to avoid the attentions of the various international security services . The threat from the jihadis takes two forms. Some remain in contact with Islamic State and Al Qaeda leaders in Syria who are directing their attacks. These groups are believed to be planning ‘spectacular’ mass-casualty attacks, such as bringing down an airliner or a Mumbai-style bomb or gun attack. The second type of threat is far more crude and likely to be attempted by a lone individual or a pair who will have either returned from Syria or been inspired by jihadi propaganda. Attack methods could include a hit-and-run, the beheading of a ‘high-value’ target or a mass-stabbing. The Lee Rigby-style scenario is the one that security officials consider most likely. Already, one plot has been foiled and is before the courts. Such attacks are fiendishly hard to detect. Trying to buy explosives or an automatic rifle is likely to alert the security services. Grabbing a kitchen knife from a drawer will not. In these instances, the best hope of foiling such a plot is if the protagonists talk about their intentions online. However, in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations, fanatics increasingly know how to avoid giving their secrets away on the internet. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a worse time for Snowden – now hiding in Russia – to inflict such huge damage on the capabilities of the security services.","Jewish community buildings will receive extra police protection after Paris .

"Two fraternities that threatened to defy the University of Virginia's efforts to impose new regulations governing their parties say they will sign the agreement after all. The university wanted stricter rules on alcohol and security at the parties following a Rolling Stone article that described a culture of campus sexual violence heavily intertwined with fraternity parties. While much of the article has been discredited, U.Va. maintained the suspension of its fraternities and pushed ahead with the new rules. Two fraternities that threatened to defy the University of Virginia's efforts to impose new regulations governing their parties say they will sign the agreement after all . Kappa Alpha and Alpha Tau Omega had said the agreement was unnecessary and their local chapters wouldn't sign it. On Friday, the fraternities' national organizations said in a statement that the chapters would sign the agreement before Friday night's deadline because the university would otherwise not lift their suspension. The article about the issue of sexual assault at UVA starts with the horrifying account of one student who claims to have been gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago. The university wanted stricter rules on alcohol and security at the parties following a now widely discredited Rolling Stone article that described a culture of campus sexual violence heavily intertwined with fraternity parties . Anonymous: The UVA junior who accused the fraternity of gang rape, identified as Jackie, has had her story discredited in several reports . But after several holes in the victim's story were brought to light, and a police investigation found no evidence the crime ever happened, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity was taken off suspension this week and are set to start their new remember recruitment - known as Rush - tonight. Phi Psi president Stephen Scipione, a 21-year-old junior from Richmond, Virginia, spoke with the Washington Post and described the night in November when he and his brothers huddled around and read the damning article. 'Some people actually had to leave the room while they were reading it because they were so upset,' Scipione said. Details of the story were so distressing and cruel that it sparked mass protests on campus, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life. All fraternities and sororities were suspended for the rest of the semester while the university and local police investigated. Just hours after the story came out, the Phi Psi house was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!' and the brothers say bricks were thrown through the windows. Fearing their safety, most of them fled the house, booking hotel rooms. Rumors of the Rolling Stone article started in September, when an executive from the nationals office was dispatched to the campus to question them about a story line the reporter chasing surrounding an incident at the fraternity in the fall of 2012. Breaking their silence: Phi Kappa Psi President Stephen Scipione, left, and fraternity brother David Fontenot, right, spoke out this week to detail how their fraternity responded to the allegations in the now-discredited Rolling Stone article which named the house as the location of a gang rape in fall 2012 . 'He basically asked if, one, we knew about [the allegations] and, two, if we had committed it,' said Scipione. 'The look around the table was complete shock and awe.' Reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely sent Scipione an email with three questions before publishing the article, but would not say when the alleged gang rape happened or reveal any other details that would help him give her a detailed answer. The reaction after reading the article when it was finally published, was shock and then confusion. Details of the article didn't add up to the brothers who were members of the fraternity when the alleged incident happened. 'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said David Fontenot, 22, a senior from McLean, Virginia. Vilified: Above, some of the gratified that tagged the house after the rolling Stone article was published in November . The brothers checked old emails, bank accounts and other fraternity records and discovered that they did not hold a party at the house the weekend of September 28, 2012 - and that no one in their fraternity matched the description of the primary attacker, a junior who worked at the university pool. They also staunchly denied the suggestion that the incident was an initiation ritual for new members, as details of the attack suggested. 'We vehemently deny that it would be plausible as a ritualistic tradition to join our fraternity,' Scipione said.","Kappa Alpha and Alpha Tau Omega initially said the agreement was unnecessary and their local chapters wouldn't sign it .

"A mother and daughter were found dead in their Orlando home Thursday after four men broke into their house following a crime spree. Four suspects were arrested Friday for the crime spree that started with a pawn shop robbery, led to a shootout with a police officer, and ended with the killings of Patricia Moran, 72, and her 51-year-old daughter, Deborah Royal. Michael Gordon, 34, was charged Friday with two counts of first-degree murder. He also was charged with armed robbery and attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, along with 22-year-old Devonere McCune, 25-year-old Jovan Lamb and 29-year-old Terrell Williams.

Detectives were still determining if there was a prior relationship between the suspect and the two murder victims. 'We don't know yet,' Polk County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Carrie Horstman said in an email. Grady Judd, Polk County sheriff, did not give details of how the women were killed in a news conference Friday but said they were 'viciously murdered' in a manner 'much too graphic to describe,' ABC News reports. The crime spree began Thursday evening with a robbery at an Auburndale pawn shop. Witnesses reported that three men wearing hoodies robbed the store while one man waited outside in a red GMC Jimmy.

'It was designed to create the maximum terrorism of the people in the store.,' Judd said in a news conference Friday. 'It was created to obtain not only their cooperation but take away any chance that they may fight back.' An officer in nearby Haines City spotted the culprits' vehicle and attempted to pull it over as the suspects opened fire through the windows. The officer was not injured. The vehicle eventually became stuck in some sand and all four men ran. Authorities caught up with McCune when he was bitten by a Sheriff's Office K-9. Crime Spree: The crime spree began Thursday evening with a robbery at an Auburndale pawn shop . Robbery: Witnesses reported that three men wearing hoodies robbed the store while one man waited outside in a red GMC Jimmy . A short time later, officers learned from a resident about suspicious activity at a neighbor's house. The neighbor told authorities that she heard women screaming 'no' repeatedly from inside the home, the Orlando Sentinel reports. When authorities surrounded the house, a blue car came barreling out of the garage, straight at them. Judd said officers fired 'many times.'

Before all the suspects were taken into custody, deputies were knocking on doors in the neighborhood, checking on residents and urging them to call 911 if they saw anything suspicious. 'Don't start shooting through your front door,' Judd said at a late night news conference. 'That wouldn't be good.' All of the men have long criminal histories, the Sentinel reports, with each racking up multiple charges ranging from armed robbery to drug possession and, now, murder or attempted murder. The Polk County Sheriff's Office, the Auburndale Police Department, and the Haines City Police Department are investigating the crime spree. The Daily Ridge reports that authorities were called to a vacant house in reference to a shooting that may have involved the four men just minutes before the pawn shop robbery.","Patricia Moran, 72, and her 51-year-old daughter, Deborah Royal were found dead in their Orlando home Thursday after four men broke into their house following a crime spree .

"Hamsters can carry almost half their body weight in their cheeks, and now this impressive feat has been caught on camera in an unprecedented way. Using X-rays, researchers from the BBC filmed a Syrian hamster in cage storing nuts and pieces of fruit in its cheeks. And when filmed from above, the X-ray footage revealed that the cheeks expand as far back as the animal’s hip bones. Scroll down for video . The show explores the ‘wide side of playful pets’, and also reveals why hamsters love to run on a wheel, how dogs pick up the rules of the pack and how kittens learn to be solitary hunters . The footage will appear on the BBC’s ‘Pets - Wild at Heart’ series, which airs in the UK on BBC One on Wednesday 21 January. The show explores the ‘wide side of playful pets’, and also reveals why hamsters love to run on a wheel, how dogs pick up the rules of the pack, and how kittens learn to be solitary hunters. There are five popular species of hamster, including Syrian, Campbell, Chinese, Roborovski and Winter White. In addition to using the pouches to store food, these species can also use them to transport their pups - and the pouches can stretch to double the width of the animal’s head. This is used to protect the pup from predators, for example. But, hamsters have been known to cause suffocation when the infants are kept in the cheeks too long. The skin is relatively delicate too, and in the same way a balloon becomes thinner as it expands, the hamster’s cheek pouches can be easily pierced by sharp objects. In addition to the X-ray footage, other shots include plunge-diving dogs and a cat outwitted by his prey. The latest science also reveals why budgies talk, how a cat scales a vertical wall with the help of a special claw, and the real meaning behind a rabbit's hop. ‘Our pets are also given a chance to explore their wild side as we join the free-roaming pet dogs of Cusco Peru, pet rabbits living in a natural warren and the wild-living inhabitants of Cat Island, Japan,’ explained the BBC. ‘A range of innovative techniques such as moving X-rays, thermal imagery, minicam-carrying dogs and revelatory slow-motion photography shows why our pets play and how their true wild nature is just a whisker away.’ There are five popular species of hamster, including Syrian, Campbell, Chinese, Roborovski and Winter White.

"A spearfisherman has been bitten by a shark at a popular holiday destination on the New South Wales south coast. Sam Smith, 17, was fishing off Mollymook Beach with his friend Luke Sisinni when he was attacked by the 1.5 metre long shark after he 'went down to film it', according to the Milton Ulladulla Times.

"Islamist terror group Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of women and children at a school following a massive attack on the town of Baga earlier this month, according to an eyewitness. Kaltuma Wari, who was released by the fanatics earlier this week, claimed in a phone call that 'there were over 500 women and hundreds of children' held by the militants. While some were released after four days, hundreds of others - mainly young women - were still in the hands of the bloodthirsty murderers with no immediate news of their condition available. The terror group shocked the world last year when its fighters kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from a boarding school in the town of Chibok, in Nigeria's north-east. Dozens escaped, but 219 remain missing. Their disappearance prompted a social media campaign with #bringbackourgirls, which was supported by Michelle Obama, First Lady of the USA. Scroll down for video . Innocent victims: Kidnapped schoolgirls are seen at an unknown location in this image taken from a video released by Boko Haram. The girls went missing in April 2014. Support: Michelle Obama backed the #bringbackourgirls campaign after the kidnap by Boko Haram . Wari, 40, said Boko Haram fighters took her to a girls' boarding school in Baga after she went into the streets to look for her husband and six of her nine children. The women and children were kept in dormitories, classrooms and in the open, despite the cold weather caused by the seasonal winds, she said. She added: 'They didn't touch any woman but they paid more attention to young women. They kept watch on them and they were always accompanied by gunmen wherever they went, even to the bathroom.' During her time at the school, Wari was forced to cook for the militants. Many of the women refused to eat out of worry for their loved ones, and she added: 'Some of us turned hysterical and I was one of them. 'They got fed up with us and (on Wednesday) around 2pm (1300 GMT) they singled us out and asked us to leave the town. 'We were around 100, all of us mothers. They would never allow any young woman to leave.' 'Boko Haram took around 300 women and kept us in a school in Baga', one unnamed woman was quoted as saying by Amnesty International in a statement. 'They released the older women, mothers and most of the children after four days but are still keeping the younger women.' The news comes after aerial shots emerged yesterday of the towns taken a day before the attack and a day after, showing the massive scale of destruction after the massacre. Before: Infra-red images show the densely populated village of Doron Baga on January 2 - before the attack . After: This image taken on January 7, following Boko Haram's assault, shows the village transformed by death and destruction . The president addressed the crowd and told them that all areas of Nigeria under the control of Boko Haram would be recaptured soon . Around 5,000 people are currently living in a camp after their towns were completely destroyed in the deadly attack . Today, there was no independent confirmation of the exact figure or indication of how many were still being held, but another  survivor who escaped also said hundreds of women and girls were held. Civilian vigilante Yanaye Grema, who escaped after hiding for three days in the town, said he met four women, including one with a baby on her back, as he fled through the bush following the attack last week. 'They told me they were among hundreds of women that were abducted by Boko Haram and detained,' he told news agency AFP. Meanwhile, Nigeria's president has made a surprise visit to the heartland of the Boko Haram movement to meet survivors of the massacre which saw an estimated 2,500 people slaughtered by Islamist militants. Goodluck Jonathan spent three hours in Maidugri, capital of Borno State, and addressed 5,000 people who have been sheltering in a camp since the attack by the terror group earlier this month. The president's visit comes just a day after new images obtained by Amnesty International show the devastation of the assault - with more than 3,700 structures including houses and schools completely destroyed in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga . One witness of the attack described how the ruthless terror group were shooting indiscriminately, killing even small children and a woman who was in labour. During his visit to the camp, Mr Jonathan promised that all areas of Nigeria under the control of Boko Haram would be recaptured soon. He told the crowd of displaced people: 'I want to assure you that you will soon go back to your houses.' The president's visit to Maiduguri - his first since March 2013 - was shrouded in secrecy and came after a previous trip to the region in May last year was cancelled at the last minute. President Goodluck Jonathan, dressed in a grey shirt and dark hat, meets survivors of the Boko Haram massacre in Nigeria, which is thought to have killed 2,500 people . The president's visit to the Boko Haram heartland was the first since March 2013 and was shrouded in secrecy . Mr Jonathan takes a salute from soldiers of the Nigerian Army fighting Boko Haram. The Nigerian leader has come under fire for his failure to crush the terror group. Nigeria's leader has come under fierce criticism for his failure to crush Boko Haram's bid to establish a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria. The shocking satellite images that revealed the extent of the damage were released by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, who said the images suggested 'devastation of catastrophic proportions'. They added that 11 per cent of Baga and 57 percent of Doron Baga was flattened, most likely by fire. Human Rights Watch said the exact death toll was unknown and quoted one local resident as saying: 'No one stayed back to count the bodies. People were forced to queue up to take refuge inside a 'Teachers Village' in Maiduguri after their homes were destroyed in the Boko Haram attack . Children play on the ground outside the refuge. More than 3,700 structures including houses and schools were completely destroyed in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga . 'We were all running to get out of town ahead of Boko Haram fighters who have since taken over the area.' Meanwhile, Amnesty cited reports of women being rounded up and detained at a school. They added: 'The deliberate killing of civilians and destruction of their property by Boko Haram are war crimes and crimes against humanity and must be duly investigated.' It comes as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Islamist insurgents of a 'crime against humanity'. He described Boko Haram as a 'serious threat to all of our values' during a visit to Bulgaria with British foreign secretary Philip Hammond.

Cameroon also announced that neighbouring Chad will send troops to aid their country's fight against Boko Haram, though no date for the deployment or size of the contingent was given. Meanwhile Gordon Brown, UN special envoy for education, urged the world to condemn the use of young girls as suicide bombers by Boko Haram, calling it 'barbaric.' At least 19 people were killed on Saturday when a young girl, thought to be aged about 10, blew herself up at a crowded market in the northeast Nigerian city of Maiduguri, the Red Cross and local vigilantes said. Boko Haram also drew international condemnation when its fighters kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from a boarding school in north-east Chibok last year.

"It is impossible to keep people 100 per cent safe from terror attacks in an 'open and free society', David Cameron warned today as police increased protection for officers. Scotland Yard's Mark Rowley announced he is also in talks with Jewish leaders offering their community great protection including more patrols in key areas. It comes after officers were 'deliberately targeted' by gunmen in Paris and the attack on a kosher supermarket in the French capital . Prime Minister David Cameron warned that it is impossible to keep people 100 per cent safe from terror attacks in an 'open and free society'. Scotland Yard's Mark Rowley announced protection for officers would be stepped up . Increased numbers of armed police have been stationed across London since the attacks in Paris last week . Armed police and sniffer dogs were also seen patrolling on London Bridge today, with the threat level still set at severe . Fanatical gunman Amedy Coulibaly last week murdered four shoppers before being killed by armed police in a siege in the quiet residential area of Vincennes in Paris. Earlier Coulibaly had shot dead a policewoman, apparently inspired by the killing spree of Said and Cherif Kouachi who stormed the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The brothers killed 12 people, including two police officers. In response, British security services have stepped up surveillance and David Cameron ordered new training exercises to reflect a Paris-style attack which lasted for several days and spread over a large area. However, the deliberate targeting of police in the Paris attack has also raised fears about the dangers faced by frontline staff in Britain. It raises the prospect of more armed police on the streets and greater use of bullet proof vests and armour. David Cameron, speaking in Washington where he was meeting Barack Obama at the White House, said: 'It's very important to learn the lessons from anything happening elsewhere in Europe. Could that happen here? What steps should be taken? 'So the police have announced today that they'll be stepping up patrols particularly to protect the Jewish community. 'The government has a very strong relationship with the Jewish community, it talks to them regularly about these issues. 'We have to be incredibly vigilant and look at all of these risks, particularly risks to police officers themselves and take every action that we can.; . He said he would not give a 'running commentary' on specific threats but security was being stepped up. Posters advertising a Holocaust memorial event have been daubed with graffiti including the words 'liars' and 'killers', it emerged. The Metropolitan Police said the incidents, which took place in Stratford, east London, were being listed as a 'hate crime', and said officers in Newham were investigating. Newham Council received pictures of the offences - involving three posters publicising the council's Holocaust memorial day event - through social media. Three police officers died in the Paris terror attacks. Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing Franck Brinsolaro (left), who was guarding the magazine's editor Stephane Charbonnier, before killing Ahmed Merabet (centre) in the street outside. The next day Clarissa Jean-Philippe (right) was shot dead by Amedy Coulibaly, who went on to kill four people in a siege in a Jewish supermarket . French President Francois Hollande attends a ceremony to pay tribute to the three murdered police officers . In the hours after the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices, extra armed police were deployed across London, including in Westminster and at St Pancras train station. Armed police and sniffer dogs were also seen patrolling on London Bridge today, with the threat level still set at severe. The Association of Chief Police Officers has been reviewing its security measures following the devastating attacks in Paris last week. Mr Rowley, a Met assistant commissioner, said in a statement: 'The global picture of terrorist activity does give us heightened concern about the risk to the Jewish community in the UK. 'We are seeing continuing anti-Semitic rhetoric from extremists and attacks on this community in France and elsewhere. 'In addition to our existing security measures, we are in dialogue with Jewish Community leaders about further actions that we will be taking, including more patrols in key areas. 'We remain alert to the vulnerabilities of other communities. Where we do have particular concerns, we make these known to those involved.' The increased security in Britain comes after the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris last week, after gunman Amedy Coulibaly took more than a dozen peopple hostage . CCTV footage shows hostages inside the Hyper Cacher mart huddle together near the checkouts after watching four of their fellow shoppers murdered in cold blood . Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, 32, is pictured wearing a bullet proof vest as a member of staff from the kosher deli he attacked in Paris puts his hands against a wall four hours before police stormed in . He stressed that the police are aware of people trying to exploit the current tensions to create 'fear' in Muslim communities. He added: 'We are also considering what further measures we might put in place to enhance the security of police officers, given some of the deliberate targeting of the police we have seen in a number of countries across Europe and the world. 'Chief constables across the country are reviewing how to strengthen the protection of their officers from such attacks. 'Our men and women on the frontline are used to confronting risk and danger and are well-trained in how to protect the public and themselves.'","Scotland Yard's Mark Rowley reveals response to heightened threat .

"Two Pakistani-Americans on trial for terrorism-related charges  allegedly tried to kill two US Marshals as they made an attempt to flee a courthouse in Miami. The incident took place last April in the Miami court complex where the men, brothers Raees, 30, and Sheheryar Qazi, 22, were being tried. The Department of Justice has alleged that two men looked up at the ceiling together, distracting the deputy marshals escorting them, who they then punched, ABC news reported. Sheheryar Alam Qazi, left, and brother Raees Alam Qazi struggled  as they allegedly tried to use 'potentially lethal force' in the courtroom . The men then struggled with the marshals and tried to use 'potentially lethal force' on them while calling out 'Allahu Akbar' in Arabic which translates to 'God is Great'. The US Justice Department has now slapped an attempted murder charge on the men who were on trial on charges of materially supporting the al Qaeda terrorist organisation. One of the brothers was allegedly planning to plant a bomb in New York City and both were indicted in late 2012. The Qazis are naturalized US citizens who emigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan. During the past two weeks, terror has been in the spotlight following attacks in the French capital, Paris, that led to the death of 17 people. Most recently two members of a Belgian terror cell were gunned down by armed officers in Verviers overnight, while a third was overpowered after being wounded.","Two brothers were on trial in Miami last year on terror-related charges .

"One of Europe's largest Jewish associations has written a letter to EU ministers asking for gun laws to be relaxed to allow Jews to arm themselves to protect against terror attacks. Rabbi Menachem Margolin, the head of the European Jewish Association, made the request in the wake of the Paris attacks in which four Jews were killed inside a deli in the French capital. In the letter, dated January 13, he asks for permission for 'people in the Jewish communities and institutions to own weapons' to protect against 'anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance'. Rabbi Menachem Margolin warned that 'anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance' were threatening Jews in Europe while calling for relaxed gun laws (pictured, French soldiers guard Jewish quarter of Paris) Mr Margolin, who is also the head of the Rabbinical Centre of Europe, speaks of the need 'stop talking and start acting' while seeking to reassure ministers by saying the guns will be for 'self-protection only'. The letter speaks about the need for protection after Islamist Amedy Coulibaly gunned down four Jewish shoppers in cold blood in a Paris deli last Friday before he was shot by armed police. The fanatic said he had deliberately chosen a Jewish shop, claiming his victims were legitimate targets in revenge for the deaths of Muslims in Palestine. Police later found he had maps showing the locations of Jewish schools in Paris. Hundreds of armed police have been dispatched to guard Jewish schools around France since the attacks last week, with military units standing in reserve. The letter also comes amid warnings of a tide of antisemitism across France as a Jewish emigration agency warned a record 15,000 Jews are expected to flee the country for Israel this year. In 2014 a total of 7,086 Jews emigrated from France to Israel, the highest number in the world, up from 3,293 in 2013. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set up committee to look at ways of boosting Jewish immigration from France and other EU countries 'which are being hit by terrible anti-Semitism'. His letter comes after Amedy Coulibaly attacked a Jewish deli, killing four. A letter was found justifying Jews as legitimate targets for attacks, along with a map marking Jewish schools in Paris . Netanyahu's said that every Jew who wanted to move to Israel would be 'welcomed with a warm heart and open arms.' In Britain, a survey also found that half of Britons believed at least one antisemetic value to be 'definitely or probably true' when presented with a list of statements. One in eight believed Jews talked about the Holocaust to get sympathy, one in four believed Jewish people 'chase money more than others', while one in six felt Jews thought they were better than other people. Nobody from the European Council of Ministers was immediately available for comment on the letter when contacted by Mail Online this afternoon. Mr Margolin was also unavailable to speak with Mail Online, but told the Washington Beacon: 'We demanded from the European governments some time ago that action should be taken [and] were not surprised to see the results in Paris. 'Many people today are not coming to synagogue because of the issue and they’d be more comfortable if they knew people were trained to react in an emergency.'","Rabbi Menachem Margolin said it is 'time to stop talking and start acting'

"For those who have ever wondered what fireworks look like when lit from underwater - this video is for you. In this clip, from Sweden, a man lights off a rocket under a frozen lake while a friend films nearby. Not only did the fish get a massive shock, but the adrenaline junkies themselves were likewise pleasantly surprised by the explosive results. A man in Sweden, Nils Bremer, experimented with a unique form of fishing - and recorded it for all to see . First of all, Nils poked several holes in the thick layer of ice at a local lake while standing on the dock . Uploaded to Youtube by Nils Bremer from Tranas, Sweden, he also stars in the video. It begins with Nils holding up a rocket - fixed to a long wooden stick - to the camera. Standing on a dock, he then kneels down and uses the end of a broom to crack the thick layer of ice covering the lake in several spots. He then figured out how to carefully insert a firework - fixed to a long stick - into the icy cold water . He carefully lit the rocket and quickly dropped it into the lake, while his friend looked on and recorded . Surprisingly, the rocket took off like a shot, barrelling along the water's surface just under the icy layer . Once it reached the middle of the lake, the fireworks surfaced with a massive explosion . Nils and his friend laugh in amusement as they are showered with ice shards, courtesy of the big bang . Using a lighter, he illuminates the rocket firework and inserts it under the ice. It quickly takes off - shooting along the water before surfacing several feet away with an impressive bang. Thrilled with the results, the videographer - and Nils - laugh as broken ice pieces shower down on them from the centre of the lake.","Nils Bremer, from Tranas, Sweden, found a new way to go ice fishing .

"'I would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of New York's skyline,' Ayn Rand gushed in The Fountainhead. With these breathtaking photographs, she won't be the only one. Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Vincent Laforet hung out a helicopter at 7,500 feet above the city at night. And the results are mesmerizing. Scroll down for video . Bright lights, big city: Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Vincent Laforet hung out a helicopter at 7,500 feet to capture New York City . Mesmerizing: His shots, designed to make the streets mirror brain synapses, dwarf Manhattan's towering monuments in Times Square . Colorful: Having waited years for technology to make the project possible, Laforet shot the WTC (left) and Broadway (right) in an hour . The panning shots, which took just one hour, capture the oft-fawned-over lights against the ebony-black water. 'This was quite scary,' he told ABC News. 'Your imagination starts to take over but I kept focusing on the pictures.' It was a project, Laforet explained, to illustrate a Men's Health article on psychology. The grid-like streets filled with ever-moving channels of light are like brain synapses, he told his editors. Scared: Laforet said he was petrified of falling out the helicopter as he soared over New York's Midtown taking the photographs . Toy-like: The glittering landscape often resembled a glowing Lego set with Laforet's clever use of tilt-shift . Captivating waters: The bright lights shine against the dark East River with the bridges across it into Brooklyn .

It is a project Laforet has dreamed of completing for years but technology has never afforded him the right exposure to capture the landscape at night. Finally, however, he felt it would be possible. 'The real scary part was that there's just simply nothing quite like leaning out of that chopper over the sea of darkness and light, held in only by a full-body harness' he said. 'There is no chance that you will fall - the harness is tried and true. But you DO think about the fall.'

"Ministers are set to use the controversial secret courts law in the case of a Libyan man who is suing the government over his rendition into the hands of Colonel Gaddafi’s torturers. Abdel Hakim Belhadj and his wife were kidnapped and flown to Libya where he was horrifically mistreated. He accuses the Security Services and former foreign secretary Jack Straw of serving him up to his torturers and is demanding compensation and an apology. Accusations: Abdel Hakim Belhadj and his wife were kidnapped and flown to Libya where he was mistreated . At a court hearing yesterday, government lawyers said ministers were ‘likely’ to ask for intelligence and other secret documents to be considered under the new rules. This could mean vast swathes of the case being held behind closed doors, with only State-approved lawyers allowed to hear the secret evidence. The new law, which is due to come into force later this year, was bitterly opposed by civil liberties campaigners because of its extension of secret justice. If the judge accepts the need for so-called ‘closed material proceedings’ it would likely be the first case in which the new rules are used. It could mean Mr Belhadj and his lawyers being told little if anything about the evidence brought into play by the Government and used against him. Instead, when the court doors were closed, he would be represented by a security-cleared special advocate. Rory Phillips, QC for the Government, . told the High Court it was ‘likely’ that an application for closed . proceedings would be made. Claims: Mr Belhadj accuses the Security Services and former foreign secretary Jack Straw (pictured) of serving him up to his torturers and is demanding compensation and an apology . ‘It is likely that, subject to ministerial consideration, that an application... will be made,’ he said. He also told the court the defendants, who include Mr Straw and former MI6 spymaster Sir Mark Allen, were still keen to settle the case. He said: ‘They would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under this case. '(The defendants) would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under this case' Rory Phillips, QC for the Government . ‘The defendants for their part would like to reiterate...their willingness to sit down with Mr Belhadj and his representatives face to face.’ Richard Hermer QC for Mr Belhadj and his wife said the defendants were accused of false imprisonment, conspiracy to injure and misfeasance in public office. The case revolves around whether ‘the defendants involved themselves in the rendition of the claimants to Libya and if so does that give rise to a private law course of action.’ Mr Belhadj has said he will drop the case for just £1 in return for an apology and admission of liability. He claims he was snatched by the US in Bangkok in 2004, and held in a secret CIA ‘black site’. He and his wife were blindfolded and she was chained to the wall despite being visibly pregnant. Handshake: The rendition took place around the time of the infamous 'deal in the desert' between Colonel Gaddafi (right) and former prime minister Tony Blair (left) They were then flown to Tripoli where he was held for four years and tortured. The rendition took place around the time of the infamous ‘deal in the desert’ between Colonel Gaddafi and former prime minister  Tony Blair. After his release he became a key figure in the uprising against the Gaddafi regime and is now a prominent Libyan politician. After the fall of the regime, a document was found in the offices of Musa Kusa, Gaddafi’s spy chief which indicated Britain’s role. In it, Sir Mark appeared to take credit for the operation. Describing Mr Belhadj by a pseudonym, he wrote: ‘This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years. I am so glad. ‘The intelligence on Abu Abd Allah was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this. Another Libyan dissident, Sami al Saadi, 45, who was dispatched with his wife and four young children back to Libya where he was imprisoned and maltreated, settled his case for £2.2million earlier this year. The Justice and Security Act, which contains the new secret court rules, gained Royal Assent earlier this year. The new rules are likely to come into force in October. The preliminary hearing before Mr Justice Simon was adjourned. The case will return to court later this year.","Abdel Hakim Belhadj and wife were kidnapped and flown to Libya .

"A British farmer who has spent a quarter of his life, £130,000 and been held at gunpoint last night vowed to continue to hunt for Second World War Spitfires he believes are buried in Burma. David Cundall, 62, of Lincolnshire, even suffered a health scare when he fell ill in his hotel in Burma’s former capital Rangoon, after an unsuccessful £1million excavation was called off on Friday. The grandfather of five, who has now visited Burma 18 times, believes that 36 spitfires were shipped there from Solihull, West Midlands, but arrived in August 1945, after the Japanese had surrendered. Determined: David Cundall (left) fell ill in his hotel in Burma's former capital Rangoon after a failed dig. Here, he is pictured looking at ground scans with two of his team of British archeologists . The story goes that because the crates . arrived too late, they were buried underground in unmarked graves - and . in any event were never required for the Cold War, reported the Sunday . Telegraph. Mr Cundall got the information in 1996 . from Jim Pearce, then 67, a ‘warbird’ finder from Worthing, West . Sussex, who had spoken two decades earlier to an American he met in . Jacksonville, Florida. According to the Sunday Telegraph, the . US Construction Battalion member had told Mr Pearce:  ‘We did some . pretty silly things. But the silliest was burying some of your . Spitfires.’ Mr Cundall wanted to find out more and . got a response to an advert placed in an aircraft magazine from Stan . Coombe, 70, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, who had fought in Burma during . the war. Excavation: Heavy diggers were brought in to help with the search for the buried Spitfires but archaeologists now believe there is no evidence support the claim that the rare aircraft are buried there . He claimed to have seen 20 Americans . gently lowering six 30ft crates into a ditch near Mingaladon - and asked . an airman what they were. He claimed the man responded: 'Would you . believe, Spitfires?' 'I believe the Spitfires are here and I’m not going to give up. Spitfires are held in very high regard. They saved our necks in the Battle of Britain and are very precious' David Cundall . But despite various attempts, Mr Cundall has still found nothing in his digs - 7,000 miles from home. Last week the farmer and aviation . enthusiast, who has dedicated 16 years of his life searching for the . ‘lost’ aircraft, was taken to hospital, treated for high blood pressure . and advised not to fly. But last night he was preparing to . board a plane to travel 900 miles to the civil-war-torn city of Myitkina . in the north of Burma, where he plans to begin a second dig almost . single-handedly. Precious: Up to 136 Spitfires, worth up to £1.5million each, are rumoured to have been buried in crates in three locations around Burma at the end of the Second World War (file photo) He had worked in searing 95F heat at . the Rangoon excavation site, an old British airfield, before the project . was declared a failure after archaeologists with him concluded there . was nothing to find.

"A 27-year-old Catholic charity worker has been killed after she was hit by a piece of scaffolding during a visit to the Philippines by Pope Francis. Kristel Padasas was volunteering at a mass officiated by the Pope near Tacloban's airport today when a scaffolding reportedly holding huge speakers was blown over by strong winds. She suffered a fractured skull and was taken to St Paul's Hospital in Tacloban City, shortly after the leader of the Catholic church departed, where she was pronounced dead, according to reports. Kristel Padasas, 27, was killed when she was hit by a piece of scaffolding supporting huge speakers during Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines today . Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi said the Pope was informed of the woman's death after returning to Manila. He asked his aides 'to investigate how he could show his own suffering in solidarity with the (woman's) family', Mr Lombardi said. Ms Padasas, from Manila, was based in the Samar province of the island where she was working on a recovery project for typhoon Haiyan with charity, Catholic Relief Services (CRS).

"Shocking: Martin Winter has revealed Ed Miliband's bombshell confession in his explosive new memoir . It's a devastating indictment of the Labour leader by the man who made him an MP. Fallout, the forthcoming book by Martin Winter, a former Labour Mayor of Doncaster, serialised here, reveals a portrait of the young Ed Miliband that would be funny were it not so shocking. For in nine and half weeks between March and May 2005, when the Winter family took Miliband into their home and orchestrated his election as MP for Doncaster North, we see the future leader almost set himself alight, buy a prayer mat to cover scorch marks to his office carpet and be out-negotiated by the Winters’ three young children. But amid the farce there is a bombshell confession: Miliband tells Winter that Ed Balls backed a snap General Election in 2007 because ‘the economy is going to fall off a cliff and this is our best chance of winning an Election’. It is a revelation that Winter has no doubt will infuriate the Labour high command, but last night he vowed to face down any attempt by ‘Labour attack dogs’ to undermine his explosive revelations. Winter said he expected Miliband’s allies to condemn him for revealing the private conversations. But he had no regrets about speaking out. ‘People are entitled to know the truth about a man who wants to be Prime Minister,’ he said. ‘My partner Carolyne and I know him better than most Labour MPs – he lived with us and we made him an MP. ‘We also know that he cannot be trusted. In 2007, he told both of us in our sitting room that the economy was going to “fall off a cliff” a year before it did – and that Labour had cynically planned an early General Election for that reason. On the stump: Miliband and Winter meet people in Doncaster after his selection as Labour candidate in 2005 . ‘Labour attack dogs may try to deny it – just like they did when in 2008 Alistair Darling was Chancellor and said the crash was coming. But they are wasting their time. Carolyne was present with me when Ed Miliband said it and she has been a card-carrying member of the party since she was 18.’ Winter, 52, was feted by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown after he rescued the last Labour Government’s flagship scheme to introduce US-style directly elected mayors. Blair believed they would root out town hall corruption – and nowhere was it worse than Labour-run Doncaster. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, more than 20 councillors were convicted of fraud and half a dozen were jailed in the ‘Donnygate’ scandal, one of the widest-reaching incidents of town hall corruption in British history. Feted: Mr Winter, left, Local Government Minister Phil Woolas and Tony Blair at a town hall reform summit in 2006 . In 2002, former rugby league player Winter stood for election as mayor on an anti-corruption manifesto – and won. He was invited to Downing Street and sat next to Blair at a Cabinet-style summit to reform local government. In March 2005, then Chancellor Gordon Brown asked him to help Ed Miliband, his chief economic adviser, win Doncaster North when the sitting MP fell ill. At a secret meeting in the Treasury, Winter promised Brown he would secure the safe Labour seat for Miliband. During the campaign, Miliband moved in with the Winter family and used their home as his base for nine and a half weeks. Miliband won with Winter’s help, going on to become Labour leader five years later. Having been re-elected as mayor, Winter left the Labour Party and then stepped down in 2009 due to renewed infighting and a series of social services scandals in which seven children known to the council died within three years. Family: Martin Winter, with his wife Carolyn, and children, left to right, Marcey, Joss and Beth in 1999 . An Audit Commission report said Labour councillors spent more time ‘pursuing long-term political antagonisms’ than improving services. The book Winter has now written tells how he was recruited by Labour chiefs to end corruption and feuding in Doncaster – and his success in boosting the town’s economic growth with a dynamic regeneration portfolio. The second half tells the story of his falling out with Labour as Winter’s enemies ‘tried to destroy me despite all my loyalty to the party – and to Miliband’. A day after their first phone call on March 2, 2005, Ed Miliband moved in with Mr Winter, his partner Carolyne Hunter and their three children at their home in Doncaster. He lived there for a month and carried on using the office in their garden until the 2005 General Election on May 5. He was elected the MP for Doncaster North and said farewell two days later, posting a ‘How Sweet Is Victory’ thank-you note through Winter’s letterbox. Campaign base: This is where Ed Miliband worked - and nearly poisoned himself - while campaigning to become an MP . It brought an end to 66 days – nearly nine and half weeks – spent as a temporary member of Mr Winter’s politically extended family. At the time, the couple’s children, Marcey, Joss and Beth, were aged ten, 11 and 14 respectively. Miliband slept in the bottom bunk in Joss’s Manchester United-themed bedroom, with Joss moving to another room. Ms Hunter then converted the children’s yellow and green playroom into a bedroom for their special guest. The couple also bought him a wardrobe and a bed. After a month, Miliband rented a house nearby to comply with Election rules, but he continued to use Mr Winter’s garden office as his campaign base.","Martin Winter's new memoir is a devastating indictment of Labour leader .

"She had just completed a six-month jail term. So when this inmate - known only as Jones - bragged on Facebook that she had reoffended, it sparked an immediate police investigation. 'Just a pic of a souvenir I picked up on my 6 month vacation,' the woman wrote - with a picture of a spork. Not so fast! A former inmate was tracked down after boasting on Facebook about stealing a spork from jail . 'It wasn't easy to get out with me....that's for sure!!!' she adds. The $0.02 plastic spoon-fork hybrid was apparently taken from the canteen in Manatee County Jail, Florida. Springing into action, Detective Todd Zink pursued the case. After finally tracking down the item two weeks later, it was destroyed as a 'bio-hazard'. Detective Zink wrote in his police report read by Smoking Gun: 'On 12/24/14 I was browsing Facebook and saw a post and picture in the news feed from [the inmate] of a spork that she had stole from the jail when she was released.' He then called the former inmate's mother, who did not answer. Eventually, the woman returned his voicemail message and confessed that she had indeed stolen a spork. Investigation: A detective at Manatee County Jail spotted the Facebook post and immediately sprung into action . She apologized for her actions and agreed to accept the necessary ramifications. Luckily for the former inmate, Detective Zink was willing to strike a deal. 'I asked her if she would return it in exchange for not filing charges. 'She did so on 1/6/15, leaving it at the Guard Shack as I requested.' Explaining his subsequent precautions, Detective Zink wrote: 'Since it is unknown how [the inmate] transported the spork out of the jail, I marked it as a ""biohazard"" and put it into Property and Evidence to be destroyed.'","A woman posted a picture on Facebook of a spork she stole from jail .

"Alan Dershowitz (above)  said the allegations against him are 'totally made up' and 'provably untrue' A Harvard law professor named alongside Prince Andrew in his 'sex slave' case has said he is 'fighting back' against his accusers and is confident any success will help clear the royal's name. Alan Dershowitz was named in court documents by a woman who says she was forced to have sex with friends of U.S. billionaire and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, including the Duke of York. Professor Dershowitz has today said the allegations against him are 'not only totally made up' but also 'provably untrue' and is now challenging the claims with 'all the resources he can muster'. He said the prince is not able to make the same kind of public defence as being a member of the Royal Family limits his freedom to pursue legal action. But he added that any legal success he has against the woman - named by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts - will work in the prince's favour as it will establish his accuser lacks credibility. He has previously urged the Duke of York to fight back against claims the woman made that she was forced to have sex with the royal while she was a minor in the state of Florida. She claims she had sex with the Prince, a former friend of Epstein, in New York, London and the U.S.Virgin Islands while she was a 'sex slave'. Buckingham Palace has denied all allegations. Writing in The Times today, Professor Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', sets out the accusations levelled against him, offering his alibi for each alleged encounter. In each instance, he explains what he was doing at the same time Jane Doe #3 - who was 17 at the time, making her a minor - has accused him of having a sexual encounter with her. He pointed out that the woman claims they had sex on Epstein's Caribbean Island and at his New Mexico ranch, but Dershowitz said he had only ever been there briefly with his wife and daughter. In a third - when he is accused of having sex with Jane Doe #3 on a private plane - he said flight manifests would prove he was never on a private plane with her or any other under-age women. Again, Dershowitz, who represented Epstein against sex crime charges, denies any sexual encounter with any under-age person. These claims are included in a sworn statement filed by Dershowitz in a Florida court - one of a number of legal filings he has made in an attempt to publicly clear his name. Dershowitz is not currently a target of the latest proceedings but is seeking to intervene in order to defend himself. Buckingham Palace officials have denied the allegations against Prince Andrew. Dershowitz said any legal success he has against the woman - named by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts (pictured with the prince) - will work in the royal's favour as it will discredit his accuser . Last week, Dershowitz filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on the lawyers' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same. In them, he said the allegation against him was a 'deliberate lie.' He has also challenged his accuser and her lawyers to sign sworn statements repeating their charges. Also last week, Dershowitz filed a motion in federal court to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them. The court has yet to decide whether to grant his motion. The two lawyers representing Jane Doe #3, former federal judge Paul Cassell and Florida plaintiffs attorney Bradley Edwards, have now filed counter-defamation charges against Dershowitz. Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied . In his article today, he explained that this will subject them and their client to sworn depositions. If they repeat the charges under oath, and if they are untrue, they will be subject to prosecution for perjury. Finally, Dershowitz has also challenged his accuser to file formal rape charges against him. If she were to file a false rape charge, she would be committing a crime. She has not done so. The lawyer said the prince's decision to pursue legal action - he has the right to sue his accuser - will depend on whether the Palace is willing to subject him to depositions about his private life. But Dershowitz said his extensive legal action would be beneficial to Prince Andrew as it would serve to discredit his accuser. Jane Doe #3 claims she had sex with the Prince, a former friend of Epstein, in New York, London and the U.S.Virgin Islands. Buckingham Palace has denied all allegations. Above, Epstein and the prince in 2011 . It comes just days after Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson slammed reports that he had sex with an underage girl as 'salacious lies' and defended him as a 'humongously good man'. In a passionate rebuttal on the Today show on Tuesday, the Duchess of York said that she was standing by 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever' amid the allegations. Prince Andrew has come under fire over his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with the underage girl. In a strongly-worded statement, a palace spokesman said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. 'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Alan Dershowitz named alongside Prince Andrew in 'sex slave' case .

"A man suspected of shooting two Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers on Saturday has been found dead. The officers were gravely wounded in the attack at a casino in the central Alberta city of St Albert at 3am. Following a city-wide manhunt spanning seven hours, police found the suspect, a white man aged 25-35, dead. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Marlin Degrand said one officer is in 'very grave condition' and the other is in 'serious but stable condition' at a local hospital. Officials have not yet released their names as the RCMP is still in the process of contacting  family members. Police search for a suspect in the shooting of two RCMP officers in St. Albert, Alberta, Canada . Police search for a suspect in the shooting of two RCMP officers in St. Albert, Alberta, Canada . Degrand said a routine investigation into a suspicious vehicle led the two officers to the Apex Casino in an industrial area around 3 a.m. Saturday. The officers determined the vehicle had been stolen, and went inside the casino to look for suspects,  quickly coming under fire. The officers were hit before they had a chance to fire back at the suspect, who fled the scene, Degrand said. Police tracked the suspect — described as a white male, aged 25 to 35 — to an area southeast of the Sturgeon Valley Golf, not far from the casino,  several hours later, not far from the casino. Mounties blocked off several roads to a large wooded area near the golf course, while a helicopter flew overhead. 'This incident serves to remind us all of the dangers that our front-line responders everywhere face in the performance of their duties,' Degrand said. St. Albert is an affluent community of about 60,000 bordering Edmonton's city limits to the northwest where the national RCMP force handles policing. RCMP said they cannot release information on the number of witnesses at the scene or the number of shots fired, as the shootings remain part of an active investigation. Prime Minister Stephen Harper released a statement on Twitter expressing his concern over the shooting. 'Canada's thoughts & prayers are with RCMP Alberta officers today as they deal with an ongoing shooting investigation in the St. Albert area,' Harper's tweet read. In June, a man used a semi-automatic rifle to fatally shoot three RCMP officers and wound two others in Moncton, New Brunswick. Justin Bourque, 24, was sentenced to life in prison with no chance for parole for 75 years. In a videotaped statement to police, Bourque said he wanted to encourage people to rise up against the ""soldiers"" that defend federal institutions and protect the rich from the poor.  He was found mentally fit to stand trial. Bourque's sentence was the harshest in Canada since its last executions in 1962. The deadly attack on the national police force, a vaunted Canadian institution, shook the country. It was the deadliest attack on the RCMP since four officers were killed by a gunman in Alberta in 2005. That attack remains the deadliest on Canadian police officers in 120 years.","Two Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers were seriously wounded after they were shot at a casino in the central Alberta city of St. Albert .

The 77-year-old comedian is facing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He's denied the allegations through his lawyer and has never been charged. Finished? Bill Cosby isn't backing down in the face of  protests at his performances . Protesting: Eric Verlo stands on Union Avenue in front of Memorial Hall in Pueblo, Colorado to protest an appearance by Bill Cosby. A group of about 25 people gathered before the show with signs and chanting . Bill Cosby released this statement to The Denver Post: 'Dear Fans: I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful. 'I'm ready!... I thank you, the theatre staff, the event organizers and the Colorado Community for your continued support and coming to experience family, fun entertainment.... 'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.' Cosby is slated for two Saturday shows in Denver, where protesters are expected to gather outside the downtown venue. Cosby released a statement Thursday thanking his ""courageous"" fans and saying he's ready to perform. He finished his statement with references to his ""Fat Albert"" character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special — ""Hey, Hey, Hey — I'm Far From Finished."" In the most recent allegation, a model claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008. Chloe Goins met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges against the comedian over the incident almost seven years ago. More than 15 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, including several who say the comedian drugged and raped them in incidents dating back at least four decades. Prosecutors rejected filing charges against Cosby based on allegations by Judy Huth, a Riverside County resident who is suing the comedian, alleging he abused her in the early 1970s when she was 15 years old. Huth's lawsuit states the abuse happened at the Playboy Mansion. Speaking up: Rayla Riddick holds up a light to a sign during a protest of a Bill Cosby. The Bill Cosby show, ""Far From Finished"", was nearly sold out on Friday  evening -- but that didn’t stop dozens of protesters from coming out . Show must go on: The organizer of the protest, Rae Carnevale, said the message she's trying to convey is personal.  The show went on despite sexual assault accusations against Cosby by a number of women . Los Angeles police Commander Andrew Smith said that he could not confirm any investigation into Cosby and that sex abuse cases are 'extremely confidential'. Neither Smith nor Kuvin would speculate on what charges Cosby might face, and both noted that the statute of limitations for sex offenses are complex and depend on the facts of a case. Cosby's attorney has denied some of the accusations against the comedian, saying they have been discredited or come from discredited accusers. Cosby joked about the allegations against him at a recent show in Canada. 'We hope that the people that are paying to attend Mr. Cosby's shows understand that these victimized women have broken their silence now and they will not remain quiet any longer,' Kuvin said. 'Mr. Cosby should, and will be held accountable for what he's done.' He said women reporting abuse 'should be encouraged and not joked about'. Rumours: More than a dozen women have accused Cosby of sexually assaulting and drugging them. Cosby, however, denies the allegations and hasn't been charged . Meanwhile, the door is firmly shut to Bill Cosby's return to NBC, the network's top entertainment executive said Friday. 'That's safe to say,' NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said Friday when asked if the network would ever again do a project with Cosby, who 30 years ago was the sitcom king with the network's 'The Cosby Show.' The network said late last year it was dropping plans to develop a 'classic' family sitcom with him. The series was announced in mid-2014, before a rising tide of accusations against Cosby by women who say he drugged and assaulted them. During a question and answer session with the Television Critics Association, Greenblatt was asked to explain what tipped the network against working with Cosby, who was publicly fending off allegations from two women a decade ago. 'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of,' Greenblatt said. Although Cosby hasn't been proven guilty of anything, 'when that many people come out and have such similar complaints, it became a tainted situation' and the network didn't want to proceed with the sitcom. He's glad NBC 'is out from under that,' Greenblatt said. Pressed to say precisely what number of accusers is seen as critical mass, Greenblatt replied: 'Fifteen, yes, two no.'","The comedian thanked his 'courageous' fans and before performing in Pueblo on Friday .

Several men try to contain a 1.5 metre sea lion which sneaked inside St Clair Hot Salt Water Pool on Saturday . About 100 members of the public were evacuated when the sprightly animal waddled into the lap pool . A crowd of swimmers can be seen watching intently as the sea lion, believed to be about three-years-old, glides joyously through the water. The animal had been sunbaking outside a café next to the pool, before it managed to slip inside the venue undetected. St Clair Hot Salt Water Pool supervisor Paul Swanson said 'she waddled right through reception and went into the pool.' Ms Swanson said swimmers were not perturbed by the interruption to their day, instead taking the chance to grab some photographs of the cheeky critter.

"Darren Sweeby, pictured, was jailed for two years for orchestrating the parking scam which cost Great Yarmouth Borough Council and estimated £34,000 . Three parking wardens who switched off pay and display machines and wrote out handwritten tickets to holiday makers have been jailed after their scam was exposed. The trio are believed to have stolen £34,000 from visitors to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, since January 2009. Norwich Crown Court heard that the three men, one of whom was a parking supervisor, switched off the machines and told motorists that they were broken, before issuing handwritten tickets. The men then kept the money. Parking supervisor Darren Sweeby, 43,  and his two accomplices Garry Greensmith, 52, and Antony Crooks, 54, moved around various carparks in Great Yarmouth on bank holidays. Prosecutor said the men kept the money and were only discovered when a whistleblower approached the council who observed the trio on CCTV. Sweeby, of Gorleston, a supervisor who was in charge of keys to switch ticket machines on and off, was jailed for two years at Norwich Crown Court. Greensmith, of Blundeston, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, was received 12 months. Crooks, of Gorleston, went to jail for four months. Mr Shaw said footage showed Greensmith and Crooks patrolling North Drive car park, Yarmouth, in May 2013, when father-of-three Sweeby was their manager. Greensmith was seen opening the ticket machine and switching it off. He sold handwritten tickets for cash together with Crooks before switching the machine back on and leaving an hour later. The pair then moved to nearby St Nicholas car park where they did the same. The three men were arrested in July 2013 and had their computers and mobile phones seized. Crooks told police that he and Greensmith were told by Sweeby to act 'when crowds built up on bank holidays', said Mr Shaw. Sweeby and his accomplices switched off the pay-and-display machines in public carparks, pictured . Judge Nicholas Coleman, sitting in Norwich Crown Court, pictured, said the men had been guilty of 'calculated dishonesty' claiming they 'were expected to protect public revenue, not steal it' He said the council believed they'd been operating the racket since January 2009 - when Sweeby was promoted to supervisor. The authority believe the men stole about £34,200 based on comparable takings. Honest parking wardens have been subjected to more 'abuse and aggression' from the public, who said they were 'lining their own pockets', since the truth emerged. All three men admitted conspiracy to steal. Michael Clare, defending Sweeby, said he had worked for the council for 14 years, had three young children and hoped to get work on a wind farm. Andrew Oliver, representing Crooks, said he was not involved until 2012, showed genuine remorse and it was 'out of character' for him. John Morgans, defending Greensmith, said he was not in good health and was 'remorseful'. Mr Morgans insisted Greensmith and Crooks were mere 'footsoldiers' while Sweeby was the 'ringleader'. Judge Nicholas Coleman said they'd all been guilty of 'calculated dishonesty'. The judge told them as he put them all behind bars: 'You were employed as civil enforcement officers and you were the public face of the local authority. 'You were expected to protect public revenue, not steal it. 'You were in positions with a high level of trust.' Last night Great Yarmouth Borough Council said it had sacked all three disgraced wardens and reviewed procedures after the astonishing scam. A council spokesman said: 'The borough council welcomes the outcome of this court hearing, which proves that those who conspire to steal from the public cannot escape justice. 'The borough council always conducts the appropriate checks of anyone it recruits, and takes seriously any breaches of the law and the officers' code of conduct. 'After the borough council became aware, in June 2013, of potential issues within its parking services operation, officers were suspended pending a full two-month internal investigation, which culminated in dismissal at a disciplinary hearing. 'The police conducted a separate investigation. 'The borough council has now tightened up its procedures and training to significantly reduce the risk of this happening again.'","Parking supervisor Darren Sweeby, 43, was the ringleader of the scam .

"A Tongan volcano has created a substantial new island since it began erupting last month and spewing out huge volumes of rock and dense ash. The volcano, about 65 kilometres north west of the South Pacific nation's capital Nuku'alofa, rumbled to life on December 20 for the first time in five years, the Lands and Natural Resources Ministry said. It said the volcano was erupting from two vents, one on the uninhabited island of Hunga Ha'apai and the other underwater about 100 metres offshore. Scroll down for video . A new island has formed from an ongoing volcanic eruption about 65 kilometres north west of Tonga's capital . The ministry said experts took a boat trip to view the eruption on Thursday and confirmed it had transformed the local landscape. 'The new island is more than one kilometre wide, two kilometres long and about 100 metres high,' it said in a statement. 'During our observations the volcano was erupting about every five minutes to a height of about 400 metres, accompanied by some large rocks... as the ash is very wet, most is being deposited close to the vent, building up the new island.' It said ash and acidic rain was deluging an area 10 kilometres around the volcano and killing of nearby vegetation, adding: 'Leaves on trees on Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai have died, probably caused by volcanic ash and gases.' The new island is more than one kilometre wide, two kilometres long and about 100 metres high . Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (marked) sits beneath the ocean 65km northwest of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa. The volcano gets its name from the two islands it is situated between - Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai . A number of international flights were cancelled earlier this week amid concerns about the volcano's ash plume, which reached heights of more than 4,500 metres. However they resumed on Wednesday, with authorities saying debris from the eruption was not being thrown high into the atmosphere. The underwater volcano was also responsible for causing a so-called red tide., also known as an algal bloom, in which the surrounding ocean turned the colour of blood. An algal bloom occurs when there is a sudden increase in the amount of algae in water. It is said to be part of the volcanic Pacific Ring of Fire and was one of a 36 undersea volcanoes locally . When levels of nitrogen and phosphorus rise, which can be caused by underwater eruptions such as the one off the coast of Tonga, algae can multiply. Typically, this causes water to turn green, but the effect also causes reds and yellows to be released. In particular, a bloom of dinoflagellate algae causes water to turn blood red in colour. Tonga, which is almost 2,000 kilometres northeast of New Zealand, lies on the  Pacific 'Ring of Fire', where continental plates collide causing frequent volcanic and seismic activity. These natural-colour images from 29 December and 31 December show the waters around Tonga, Hunga Tonga, and Hunga Ha'apai. They were taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) on Nasa's Terra satellite. Dense cloud cover prevented other remote observations for several days .

"A schoolgirl was ‘groomed’ by a suspected paedophile as she sat in class using a taxpayer-funded iPad given to her by her teachers. The underage girl watched live footage on the device of the man performing an obscene sex act while she was in a lesson. According to the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, teachers were just yards away from her as the man then told her to go to the lavatory to make an intimate film of herself. The alleged incident came to light after one of the girl’s friends told teachers that the teenager had been contacting the man, believed to be in this 20s, using Skype. Teachers then informed the girl’s parents. The girl was ‘groomed’ by a suspected paedophile while in class using a taxpayer-funded iPad. File photo . The school, Honywood Community Science School in Coggeshall, Essex, was criticised when it spent nearly £500,000 on iPads for each of its 1,200 pupils. The school’s head teacher has admitted letting the girl down. He has begun an investigation and police are involved. Last night the girl’s mother said police had not yet interviewed their daughter, a week after the incident came to light, potentially leaving other children at risk. She also complained about the school’s lax internet security and said its ‘independent learning’ approach allowed pupils to study on their own using their computer tablets, creating an environment in which abuse was possible. The mother said: ‘I feel my child was groomed at the school. This didn’t just happen in the playground. This happened in the classroom over a number of days. It would still be happening now if my daughter’s friend hadn’t told a teacher.’ 'Minimal teaching': Honywood School was criticised when it spent nearly £500,000 on iPads for each of its 1,200 pupils . The girl's mother complained about the school’s (pictured) lax internet security and said its ‘independent learning’ approach allowed pupils to study on their own . The girl told The Mail on Sunday that she had first had a conversation with the man on an adult social networking website, which she claimed was easy to access, while she was staying with a member of her family over the Christmas holidays. She first told the man she was 16 when in fact she was under 16, and within a few days they had swapped naked photos of themselves. The girl said that when she later admitted she was not 16 he told her he didn’t care and continued to groom her. She said she continued to have explicit conversations with the man ‘daily’ during a number of classes after she returned to school. Breaching school rules, she spoke with the man through Skype, which allows people to talk to and see each other via an internet connection. The traumatised girl said the incident in which the man performed a sex act occurred during a lesson in January. Another incident happened as she watched a friend at a school activity a few days earlier. This was witnessed by two other pupils, the girl claimed. Despite the school’s ban on the use of social networking sites, the girl’s parents claim pupils are not monitored and can easily bypass the school’s ‘parental’ internet controls. Inquiry: Headmaster Simon Mason has admitted letting the girl down . The parents said that while their daughter had initiated the contact with the man outside of school, Honywood’s internet and safeguarding policies had failed. They said they would be withdrawing their daughter from the school and were considering legal action. The mother said: ‘All we asked is that she was safe, protected and educated, and the school failed.’ Honywood’s ‘independent learning’ ethos means pupils are given minimal teaching and encouraged to learn though computers. They are set tasks by adults the school describes as ‘facilitators’. There is minimal teaching, with pupils encouraged to research and learn through the iPads. A 2013 Ofsted inspection of the school rated it as good overall and outstanding for ‘behaviour and safety of pupils’. The girl’s mother met head teacher and deputy head teacher on Wednesday. The head of year, the parents, the police and the girl are due to meet to discuss the issue. Last night, head teacher Simon Mason said he accepted the school had failed. He said: ‘I hold the responsibility for what has happened to this learner. ‘When families send their youngsters to school, they can reasonably expect that our ability to protect youngsters from those who wish to exploit them is absolute. ‘The sad reality is that a determined young person, encouraged by an exploitative adult, can find ways around any system created by any school. Fortunately in this recent case, we were able to intervene before any physical harm came to the youngster.’ Mr Mason said that teachers did walk around during lessons and monitored pupils using their iPads. It is understood the school is investigating whether the iPads’ security system, that should prevent pupils accessing banned websites, was not working because it had not been updated. The school is to inform parents about the incident in a newsletter this week. Essex Police declined to comment.","She watched live footage of the man performing sex act while in a lesson .

"Top Gear's executive producer Andy Wilman (pictured) has admitted the BBC no longer trusts the controversial show following a number of gaffes . Top Gear's executive producer has admitted that BBC bosses no longer trust the controversial show following a number of high profile gaffes. Andy Wilman said last year was 'an annus horribilis' for the motoring show after it came under fire over claims of racism and caused a near-riot while filming in Argentina. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson had to apologise when unscreened footage emerged of him mumbling the n-word while reciting the children's nursery rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe' to choose between two cars. The show was also censured by Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules after Clarkson used a 'racial' term during the programme's Burma special. In the March 2014 show he said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards them on their makeshift bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. At the time, viewers complained about the use of the word 'slope', which is considered a derogatory term for people of Asian descent. Ofcom launched an investigation into the Burma TV special and ruled in July that the presenter had 'deliberately employed the offensive word to refer to the Asian person'. The regulator decided there was 'insufficient context to justify the broadcast of this material' and that the BBC did not apply generally accepted standards to protect viewers from offensive material. Mr Wilman apologised for the use of the term, saying it had been intended as a 'light-hearted word-play joke' and that the team had been unaware the term was considered offensive. He told Broadcast Magazine's Talking TV podcast: 'We're knackered after last year because last year was a horrible year. Top Gear presenters (pictured left to right) James May,  Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond . 'I think it was a, what did the Queen say, an annus horribilis, I think it was.' The Queen famously used the phrase in a 1992 speech after the fire at Windsor Castle. Mr Wilman, who was in Argentina when trouble erupted, also criticised the country's ambassador to the UK who has demanded an apology from the BBC. He said: 'She had every right to protect her country's good name, but she really now needs to have a good think about the accusations she is throwing around.' Asked if he thought the BBC trusted the programme's makers, he said: 'Sometimes yes, sometime no'. He added: 'Sometimes I feel they don't trust us at heart and actually apart from the very odd occasion we can be trusted'. The year ended with the motoring show's crew forced to flee Argentina after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some suggested could refer to the Falklands conflict of 1982. Protests were organised by Argentinian veterans and stones were thrown at vehicles being used by cast and crew. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson  was forced to apologise  when he was given a formal warning by the BBC . The Top Gear team were in Argentina as part of their mission to reach the bottom of South America in V8 sports cars, build a 'stadium' from shipping containers and play a game of 'car football'. In the wake of the Top Gear's visit to South America, leading Argentine daily newspaper, Clarin, has accused Clarkson of continuing to strain the relationship between Britain and Argentina. It dubbed the BBC's Top Gear special 'the programme of controversy.' And another newspaper, La Nacion - referring to the diplomatic row the programme generated and referring to the Falklands by their Spanish name - blasted: 'The BBC broadcast the Top Gear programme that poked fun at Argentinians over the Malvinas.' Argentine news channel TN also headlined its coverage by saying: 'They broadcast the controversial programme.' It added: 'Despite the Argentine government's protests, the BBC broadcast the second part of the Top Gear programme filmed in Patagonia. 'They showed the team fleeing after the provocation over the Malvinas.' It was the latest controversy to hit Clarkson, who was forced to apologise earlier this year when he was given a formal warning by the BBC about his conduct. Mr Wilman said the team behind the show were in talks with the corporation about signing a new deal. The latest series of the show starts on BBC2 on January 25.","Top Gear producer Andy Wilman admitted bosses no longer trust show .

"Protests against Charlie Hebdo's front cover have seen thousands more take to the streets - with students in Somalia declaring 'Je Suis Muslim - and I love my Prophet'. Students marched through Mogadishu on Saturday morning, three days after the commemorative edition of the satirical magazine went on sale. The magazine features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohamed shedding a tear underneath the words 'All is forgiven', after 12 of Charlie Hebdo's staff were killed in a massacre earlier this month. But the use of the Prophets image has angered many Muslims around the world, with protests taking place from Somalia to Niger, and Pakistan to Jordan. Scroll down for video . Students marched through Mogadishu on Saturday morning after a cartoon of the Prophet Mohamed was published on the cover of Charlie Hebdo . The students carried signs which aped the 'Je Suis Charlie' posters which became synonymous with the Western peace rallies . But their signs said 'Je Suis Muslim' - with 'I love my Prophet' written underneath . People took to the streets all across the western world in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo and Jewish supermarket massacres, which left 12 dead . In Somalia, students had aped the catchphrase of Western marches 'Je Suis Charlie' - meant to show solidarity with the magazine - to 'Je Suis Muslim, et j'aime mon Prophete'. Translated, the sign means 'I am Muslim, and I love my Prophet'. The distinctive white writing was set against a black background with a white border, just like the Je Suis Charlie placards. Meanwhile, lawyers in Pakistan burnt an effegy of French President Francois Hollande in protest at the image, which they see as an attack on their religion. But while westerners were shocked by the attack on free speech, Muslims feel any image of the Prophet Mohamed is an attack on their religion . In Pakistan, lawyers burned an effigy of French president Francois Hollande, who today said those taking part in the protests 'did not understand our attachment to freedom of speech' The march of the lawyers was a continuation of marches which took place around Pakistan on Friday . The lawyers, dressed in smart suits, were out in force on Saturday morning, as Pakistani activists from Tanzeem-e-Islami lined the streets with signs declaring 'We condemn anti-Islam acts'. These protests a day after Pakistani authorities had to use tear gas, batons and water cannons to disperse angry crowds. The crowds were said to be trying to force their way into the French consulate. French flags have been burnt in the northwest city of Peshawar and central Multan and rallies have also been held in the capital Islamabad and the eastern city of Lahore. On Thursday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had led parliament in condemning the cartoons published by the magazine whose officers were attacked last week, resulting in the deaths of 12 people. Religious leaders had also called for the magazine's journalists to be hanged and urged their followers to join the protests. Pakistani activists from Tanzeem-e-Islami gather during a protest on Saturday . In Niger - a day after five people were killed in Niger in protests over the cartoons - protesters in Niamey attacked a police station and burned at least two police cars near the main mosque after authorities banned a meeting called by local Muslim lead . There had also been protests in Senegal, Mali, Muaritania and Algeria after Friday prayers, as well as in Jordan, where clashes broke out between security forces and about 2,000 protesters organised by the Muslim Brotherhood. But French President Francois Hollande dismissed the protests, saying anti-Charlie Hebdo protesters in other countries do not understand France's attachment to freedom of speech. Protesters burned represenations of French flags as Pakisatani officials tried to get them under control using tear gas, batons and water cannons . Demonstration: Thousands gathered after Friday prayers in Zinder, Niger, to vent their anger . Pakistani protesters shout slogans against the printing of images of the Prophet Muhammed in Lahore . 'There are tensions abroad where people don't understand our attachment to the freedom of speech,' Hollande said. 'We've seen the protests, and I would say that in France all beliefs are respected.' He added France had supported 'these countries' in the fight against terrorism. 'I still want to express my solidarity (towards them), but at the same time France has principles and values, in particular freedom of expression,' he said. Hollande's country has been left in shock after the three days of violence, which started with the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices, in which 12 died, including the editor. A young police officer was shot dead in the street the next day, while four more people were killed when they were taken hostage in a Jewish supermarket on the final day, last Friday. Three of the gunmen were killed in shoot outs with police: brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, who carried out the magazine attack, and Amedy Coulibaly, who was in the supermarket. A lawyer for one of the brothers said the man had been buried in the eastern city of Reims in an unmarked grave so as not to attract admirers. A number of anti-terror raids have been carried out across Europe in response to the attacks - including one in Belgium where two suspected jihadists were thought to be planning their own Charlie Hebdo-style attack. Both were killed in a firefight with officers.","Protests after magazine puts picture of Prophet Mohamed on front cover .

"A Sydney financial director who allegedly stole more than $7 million from his company has finally run out of luck. Jason Graham Boatwright is accused of swindling millions from his former employers, online payment service epay while based in Sydney, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The 38-year-old had been on the run for three years, but thanks to the perseverance of NSW Police, the FBI and Fraud Risk Management Service he was arrested in Los Angeles last week. It all allegedly began when Boatwright fraudulently deposited epay cheques worth nearly $150,000 in February 2011. Police allege he then allegedly took a total of $7,120,769 by moving it to his personal bank account in five instalments between May and October that same year. Online betting agency Centrebet accounts allegedly showed Boatwright gambled and lost more than $5 million of this. The police claim he carried out the crime by having an authorised signatory to approve the payment of accounts to regular suppliers. After losing millions gambling Boatwright transferred $300,000 from his ANZ account to the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas . Court documents allege Mr Boatwright began his stealing spree by writing three epay Australia company cheques to the value of $138,475. He then deposited the cheques into his personal Westpac bank account without detection. After this he transferred $9,865  through the company's payroll system straight into his regular bank account. Boatwright is also wanted in Britain for allegedly defrauding Red Bull while he worked for them in London . Police will allege these thefts were just for starters as Boatwright went back to the company's coffers for a multimillion-dollar feast. Court documents allege the former employee organised for five fraudulent electronic transfers totalling $7,120,769 to go into his personal bank account. Online betting agency Centrebet documents allegedly showed that Boatwright gambled away and lost more than $5 million between June 7 and November 5, 2011. It is alleged that Boatwright fled to Las Vegas after transferring money there from Australia . Police allege that Boatwright panicked after losing these millions and transferred $300,000 from his ANZ account to the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 15, 2011. The following day he did not show up for work and immigration records confirm he flew out of Sydney to the US. On Saturday morning he arrived back in Australia and was escorted from Sydney International Airport by two police officers. Boatwright is accused of swindling millions from his former employers, online payment service epay . Boatwright was refused bail before Parramatta Bail Court later that day after being charged with nine counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception. He is also wanted in Britain to face claims of fraud against Red Bull for whom he worked in London. He is next expected to appear before Central Local Court in late January. Epay provides an electronic payment service to more than 23,000 Australian retailers. It's unknown how much money Boatwright lost in Las Vegas, but in Australia he allegedly gambled away $5 million .

"A former soldier has filed a $4 million lawsuit against his ex-wife, who he claims obsessively stalked him and tried to 'ruin his life' following their messy divorce. Jacob C. Ivancev, 44, who served in Iraq in 2007 and was discharged from the Army in 2012, met Roe Garrido at a gym in New York's Upper East Side in 1999. Garrido, 48, is a former body builder and martial artist. The pair were married in the Bahamas, but Ivancev filed for divorce in Manhattan in 2011, which is when he says things became crazy. The ex-Special Forces officer says Garrido followed him from New York to Colorado in 2012, The New York Post reported. Jacob C. Ivancev, 44, who served in Iraq in 2007, says his ex-wife is out for revenge after their messy divorce settlement, and even followed him from New York to Colorado, and has filed a lawsuit in Manhattan's Supreme Court (pictured) Roe Garrido (above ) is being sued by  Ivancev for 4 million dollars . His lawsuit states that she pretended to be a FedEx messenger in order to get into his home. Garrido was unhappy with their divorce settlement and sought revenge, Ivancev said. She even got a job at the Reebok Sports Club where he worked out. Ivancev also claims Garrido filed multiple fake complaints against him with police, one of which had his pistol license suspended and affected his job as a security guard. However Garrido tells a much different story. She told The Post their marriage ended because Ivancev was having multiple affairs. She said he twice threatened to shoot her. Garrido admits to following Ivancev to the the Fort Carson army base in Colorado Springs, however she said she went there to tell him she was pregnant. 'I knew that if he saw me he wouldn't let me in so I picked up a FedEx package that was on the floor for one of his neighbors and I knocked,' says Garrido . 'I knew that if he saw me he wouldn't let me in so I picked up a FedEx package that was on the floor for one of his neighbors and I knocked,' Garrido told The Post. 'I said, 'FedEx,' and when he opened the door he tried to shut the door on me. I pushed my way in.' Garrido claims the two then had a physical assault and she miscarried as a result. Ivancev and his attorney have not commented on their claim, but are asking for $4 million in damages. The lawsuit says the money is a payout for the damage Garrido has caused to his life. 'She says he’s gay, she’s been telling everyone that, she told the CIA and FBI he was a spy, she told the Army he was a male prostitute,' Ivancev's roommate told The New York Daily News. This woman is doing more damage to him than when he was in Iraq. And now he can’t get a job. 'When he was serving in Iraq and his buddies were getting cut to pieces, she was living on the Upper East Side off his hazardous duty pay.'","Jacob C.

"Vermont Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy has set off on the first congressional mission to Cuba following Obama's announcement on Dec. 17 that Washington would start normalizing ties with its old Cold War foe. Leahy is heading a group of four Democratic senators and two Democratic representatives, all of whom have visited Cuba in the past and who strongly support Obama's policy, a statement from his office said. Their three-day trip aims to get an idea from Cuban government officials of how they see the normalization process and convey a sense of what Americans expect.

Leahy of Vermont (R), next to representatives Debbie Stabenow of Michigan (C), Chris Van Hollen of Maryland (L), Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island (2-L) and Peter Welch of Vermont (2-R), talk to the media upon their arrival to a hotel in Havana, Cuba, . Politico quotes the Senator: 'We have all been to Cuba before, and we strongly support the president’s new direction for our policy toward Cuba. We are going this time to discuss our expectations, and the Cubans’ expectations, for the normalization of relations.' Sen. Claire McCaskill says she will also visit the country, with a schedule still undecided.

"A maths student who died after an allergic reaction enjoying a meal at a burger bar with friends is thought to have told staff of her intolerances before eating, an inquest heard. Shahida Shahid, 18, was taken to intensive care when she collapsed in Manchester city centre after eating at trendy eatery restaurant Almost Famous last Friday night. She died three days later. Initial tests revealed the cause of death was brain damage caused by a severe allergic reaction. Reaction: Shahida Shahid, 18, (pictured) was taken to intensive care after she collapsed in Manchester city centre after eating at trendy eatery restaurant Almost Famous last Friday night. She died three days later . Miss Shahid, who had a number of food allergies and was asthmatic, told staff of her dietary requirements and they advised her that a chicken dish would be appropriate, police understand. But the dish is thought to have contained, or was cooked in, one of the ingredients to which she was allergic, DI Chris Flint, of Greater Manchester Police, told the inquest yesterday. Miss Shahid, a first-year student at the University of Manchester, collapsed at 8.30pm on Friday. Unlike many allergic reactions, however, Miss Shahid did not suffer from symptoms immediately. She and friends ate in the city's Great Northern Warehouse shopping centre and paramedics were only called when she reached The Printworks, another shopping centre half a mile away. Manchester Coroner's Court heard how Miss Shahid, from Salford, Manchester, suffered 'irreversible and unsurvivable' brain damage and died three days later. DI Flint said: 'We understand, although it is not entirely clear, that she indicated to waiting staff what her allergies were and what meal would be appropriate for her. Symptoms: Miss Shahid, above, who had a number of food allergies as well as being asthmatic, started to feel unwell shortly after finishing the meal . 'She was advised that a particular chicken dish would be appropriate and that was ordered and consumed.' 'It is understood the dish did contain or was cooked in one of the ingredients she was allergic to.' Miss Shahid, who had a number of food allergies as well as being asthmatic, started to feel unwell near The Printworks shortly after finishing the meal, the inquest heard. When it became apparent she may have eaten something she was allergic to, she used her inhaler and her epi-pen, which gives a shot of adrenaline to treat severe allergic reactions. But they had no effect and she collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. An ambulance was called shortly after 8pm and she was taken to the A&E at Manchester Royal Infirmary before being transferred to the intensive care unit. She died on Monday. The post-mortem examination revealed the provisional cause of death was hypoxic encephalopathy (damage caused to the brain by oxygen starvation) due to anaphylaxis - a severe allergic reaction. DI Flint told the inquest that the force had launched a joint-investigation into the incident with the Food Standards Agency. He said laws surrounding information that businesses have to provide to people with allergies had changed last month - and Almost Famous was 'aware' of this. Coroner Nigel Meadows said the investigation into Shahida's death, despite being in its early stages, was a 'timely reminder' to the food industry about the significance of providing information to customers with food allergies. He added: 'The law has relatively recently changed and new regulations came into force in August and more new EU regulations in December. 'This case clearly serves as a timely reminder to the food industry regarding these requirements.' Friends of Shahida, who attended the local Walkden High School and Winstanley College, paid tribute to the teenager on social media, describing her as 'beautiful, brilliant and kind'. Miss Shahid, who had a number of food allergies and was asthmatic, told staff at Almost Famous (above) of her dietary requirements and they advised her that a chicken dish would be appropriate, police understand . Her devastated cousin, Farjana Alam, wrote on Facebook the day before Shahida died that she was in intensive care with brain damage. 'Everyone please keep my cousin in your prayers,' she wrote. 'She is in the ICU, has gotten brain damage, and she isn't being responsive - every prayer counts xx.' Following the death, Farjana posted: 'To God we belong and to God we return. My beautiful, brilliant, kind, loving cousin has passed away. 'Please everyone keep her in your prayers - I still cannot believe she's gone and my heart aches with pain that she has left the world. 'May Allah grant her mercy and take her to the highest of Jannah - everyone please pray for her and her family's strength.' Others paid tribute to the teenager on social media. Just a month ago the FSA launched new EU rules on how customers should be told about allergens in outlets which don't usually label food, such as restaurants and sandwich bars. Restaurants must now label 14 main substances which can cause an allergic reaction on their menus. They are gluten, fish, shellfish, egg, peanuts, other nuts, soy beans, milk, celery, mustard, sesame seed, sulphur dioxide, lupin and molluscs. Marie Carter, company director of Almost Famous, said: 'We're absolutely devastated to hear the tragic news that this young lady has passed away. Our thoughts are with her family and friends. 'As the authorities are conducting investigations it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'","Shahida Shahid, 18, collapsed in Manchester city centre last Friday .

"Ed Miliband was left red faced after a party member quizzed him about a ban from talking to voters about the economy . Ed Miliband was left red face when a party activist revealed they had been warned from mentioning public money to voters, it has been reported. Retired party member Cecil Jenkins said the directive had been issued by Labour bigwigs in London because 'it's not our strong point.' The latest embarrassment comes just months after Ed Miliband forgot to mention the budget deficit during his party conference speech. Mr Jenkins, aged in his 80s, quizzed Mr Miliband on the ban after the Labour leader addressed the Fabian Society conference, the Telegraph reported. The newspaper said the pensioner from Hampstead, North London, asked: 'We have been told by London region not to talk too much about the economy because it is not one of our strengths. 'Can this conceivably be true?' A bewildered Mr Miliband was forced to deny members had been barred from talking about the economy. 'We should talk about the economy as much as possible between now and general election, because they have failed,' Mr  Miliband reportedly responded. Back in September the Labour leader faced criticism when he forgot to mention the Britain's budget deficit and immigration during his speech at the Labour Party conference. One shadow minister said the meandering, 68-minute address was ‘the worst speech by a Labour leader I have ever seen’, . Cecil Jenkins made the revelation as Miliband took questions after addressing the Fabian Society conference . Then, he blamed the embarrassing omission on ‘one of the perils’ of speaking without notes. ‘If I did the speech again today, I would do it differently,’ he said.","Labour activists reportedly warned not to discuss economy with voters .

"French National Front leader Marine Le Pen is set to be the latest in a string of controversial far-right figures to take the podium at the Oxford Union. Ms Le Pen -whose party has been accused of stoking Islamophobia in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre - will be speaking at the prestigious venue on February 6. But disgusted campaigners have promised to protest outside of the Oxford Union if the talk goes ahead, especially in light of the Front Nationale's antagonistic comments following last week's attacks in Paris. Marie Le Pen - whose party was accused of stoking Islamophobia after the Charlie Hebdo attacks - has been invited to speak at the Oxford Union in February . Weyman Bennett, the joint national secretary of Unite Against Fascism, told the MailOnline: 'We will organise a counter-protest made up of elements of our society which want to stay together.' Ms Le Pen took over from her father Jean Marie as the Front Nationale in 2011, in which time she has worked to move the party away from Mr Le Pen's more extreme views. It led to Mr Le Pen she had turned it into a 'bizarre' conformist party. However, the Front Nationale is still seen as extremely right wing - and only this week Ms Le Pen called for surveillance in mosques, as well as the reintroduction of national service for boys and girls. In her comments - made in response to last week's massacres at the Charlie Hebdo office and a Jewish supermarket - she also called for the 'immediate' suspension of Europe's border-free travel accord. But Mr Bennett - who described Ms Le Pen as a 'euro-fascist' trying to create divisions in society - says it is comments like this which mean she should not be allowed to talk at the Union. 'Only yesterday a man was stabbed 17 times by an Islamophobe,' he said. 'I believe the  language used by Marine Le Pen has contributed to an atmosphere where there is a dangerous backlash against Muslims in our society.' Mr Bennett added: 'Her father once described the Holocaust as a small detail in history. 'I believe it is an insult to the millions of people who died that we see the reinvention of a party  aiming to benefit politically out of the terrible tragedy that took place inside France.' Ms Le Pen is not the first controversial figure to speak at the Oxford Union. Ms Le Pen is not the first controversial figure to be invited to speak at the Union - a scuffle broke out when the BNP's Nick Griffin spoke in 2007 . Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson and the British National Party’s Nick Griffin have previously given talks. Mr Griffin has been invited to speak twice: the first time, in 2007, a scuffle broke out between protesters and organisers and security staff, while the invitation was withdrawn in 2013. Ms Le Pen insists she has ‘de-demonised’  the French National Front and insists that her father was 'misunderstood.' She ranks as one of France's most popular politicians, with a 46 per cent approval rating, and has backed state-run energy, health, education, transport and even financial services. She has also championed retirement at 60, regarded as an almost inalienable right in France. This term, people invited to speak at the Union include Tea Party pin-up Sarah Palin, hated Eurocrat Herman van Rompuy and American pop star Nick Jonas. Lisa Wehden, this term's Union president, explained: 'An invitation from the Union is not an endorsement of any particular agenda. 'The Union believes in the principle of freedom of speech and we would encourage all members who disagree with an invited speakers view to attend the event and question the speaker. 'We allow our members to meet people face to face and make their own minds up.'","Ms Le Pen will be speaking at the famous venue in February .

"A young girl who is planning her upcoming wedding to her father is opening up about their taboo relationship. The unnamed 18-year-old is revealing all the details of her two year relationship with her father in an interview with Science of Us, from how they fell in love and the first time they had sex to what their plans are for the future. Speaking of their first time she said; 'There’s a reason I lost my virginity to him - because I’d never felt comfortable with any other man.' Scroll down for video . An unnamed 18-year-old is sharing her story about how she plans to marry and have children with her father (not pictured above) The woman, who hails from the Great Lakes region, reconnected with her father when she was 16, this after 12 years of estrangement. Her parents got pregnant on Prom night, and she grew up with her mother, who the young girl claims is bipolar. Her father reached out to her on Facebook when she was in high school, and after the two met up she went to go stay with him for a week. They had sex that week, her first time, and were soon dating. 'It lasted for about an hour and there was a lot of foreplay,' she says. 'We both had orgasms. We are so similar, so it’s so easy to sexually please each other. For example, we both love neck-biting. I’ve never been in a more passionate, loving, fulfilling situation.' The two are not even hiding their situation, with many around them aware of what is going on between them. 'Everyone on my mom’s side of the family sees us as father and daughter,' she explains. 'Those who know that he’s my dad, and that we are engaged, include my father’s parents (they can see we are happy together and they can’t wait for us to have babies  they treat us just like any other couple), the woman we live with, and my best friend.' The wedding has already been planned, and she will be telling her mother - after the two make the moved to New Jersey. 'We plan to move to New Jersey where we can be safe under the law, since adult incest isn’t illegal there, and once I’m there I’ll tell everyone,' she says. 'I’ll call my mom and let her know that we are in love and we are having children. If she wants to see her grandkids we’ll send her money and she can drive to see us.' And while many people, and science, may argue that having a child with a family member can lead to genetic problems, she scoffs at this notion. 'Everybody thinks that kids born in incestuous relationships will definitely have genetic problems, but that’s not true,' she explains. 'That happens when there’s years of inbreeding, like with the royal family. Incest has been around as long as humans have.' That being said, she says her children will never learn how mommy and daddy first met. 'I don’t want to give them any problems,' she says.","An 18-year-old girl is revealing in a new interview that she has been dating her father for two years .

"It might not be his traditional attire but as storms lashed the city of Tacloban in the Philippines, Pope Francis seemed thankful for a yellow rain poncho to keep him dry. The leader of the Catholic Church travelled to the area to meet with survivors of the devastating Typhoon Haiyan - but was forced to cut his own trip short because of another approaching storm. Arriving at a cathedral in the city of Palo today, without the usual ceremony and procession, he told a surprised crowd that he would have to leave four hours ahead of schedule. Scroll down for video . Big smiles: Pope Francis looked happy as he waved to the hundreds of thousands of people who turned out in strong winds and rains today . Waiting: People donned plastic rain ponchos in a bid to keep dry as they lined the streets on Palo in the Philippines waiting for Pope Francis . 'I apologise to all of you,' he said, speaking in Italian through a translator. 'I am sad about this, truly saddened.' The Pope said the pilots of the Philippine Airlines jet told him the weather would worsen, adding: 'We barely have time to get to the plane.' Meanwhile a private jet carrying several Philippine cabinet officials who accompanied Francis to Leyte blew its front tyres during take-off following the Pope's plane and veered off the runway. There were no injuries and ambulances evacuated the passengers, police said, while the Pope's plane apparently left without incident. The storms also ended in tragedy for a 27-year-old volunteer who was killed when a scaffolding holding huge speakers was blown over by the wind, Leyte health officials said. Kristel Padasas was volunteering with charity Catholic Relief Services at a mass today when she suffered a fractured skull and was rushed to hospital, where she died. Earlier, Francis had addressed 150,000 Catholic faithful gathered in an open field near the airport in Tacloban, the city hit hardest by Typhoon Haiyan. He told them: 'So many of you have lost everything. I don't know what to say to you, but the Lord does know what to say to you. Some of you lost part of your families. All I can do is keep silent. And I walk with you all with my silent heart.' Procession: The Pope stood in solidarity with the faithful as he wore the same yellow rain poncho as tropical storm Mekkhala hit .

Colourful rain coats: Filipino typhoon victims wear plastic ponchos at a mass at the airport which was severely damaged by Typhoon Haiyan . Symbolic: A woman holds a religious statute of Mary and rosary beads as she stands with thousands of people in the rain awaiting the Pope . Giving a thumbs up: Pope Francis arrived in Tacloban, Philippines today to greet a rain-drenched but lively crowd to welcome him to the city . Many in the crowd wept as Francis spoke, overcome by the memory of the November 2013 storm that levelled entire villages with ferocious winds and 21ft waves and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing. Tropical Storm Mekkhala was expected to make landfall on nearby Samar Island in the late afternoon or early evening with winds of up to 80mph, the weather bureau said. Francis drew applause when he told the audience that he had decided to visit the city of 200,000 in eastern Leyte province in the days immediately after the storm. 'I wanted to come to be with you. It's a bit late, I have to say, but I am here.' Catching a glimpse: At a mass near the airport, he put aside his prepared homily and delivered a very personal, emotional message of comfort to survivors, who stood amid puddles in mud-soaked fields and along roadsides . Popemobile: He travelled through the streets to greet well-wishers before having to inform people that the storms would cut his trip short . Patience: The Pope told residents he had vowed to make the trip in November 2013 when he saw reports of the devastation Haiyan had caused . Keeping dry: A group of well-wishers in yellow ponchos attempt to keep themselves dry underneath a large sheet of plastic in Tacloban today . Service: Woman clutch their hands together in prayer as they listen to a mass being officiated by Pope Francis at Tacloban airport earlier today . Good spirits: Despite being lashed by rains brought to the island by storm Mekkhala, people kept their spirits up as they wait for the Pope . Soaked through: Undeterred by the weather, people sit on barricades as they wait for Pope Francis to arrive in Tacloban - the city hit hardest by storm Haiyan in November 2013 . The Pope, speaking through an interpreter who translated his comments into English from his native Spanish, said he 'respected the feelings' of those who felt they had been let down by God because of the disaster but implored them to move forward in their faith. Pope Francis told the congregation (right): 'I apologise to all of you,' he said, speaking in Italian through a translator.

It is  a fourth papal visit since 1970 and he is the third pope to visit in 45 years . Francis spoke in his native Spanish, which he reverts to when he wants to speak from the heart. He ditched his prepared homily and instead composed a brief prayer off the cuff that began: 'Thank you, Lord, for sharing our pain. Thank you, Lord, for giving us hope.' As he spoke, the winds whipped the altar cloth and threatened to topple the candlesticks. After the mass, his motorcade took him past cheering crowds and following a quick exchange of gifts, in which Francis received a wood image of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception made from the debris from the typhoon-damaged church, his convoy sped to the airport in Tacloban. The papal delegation was soaked when it boarded the plane, and trip organisers asked the flight crew to turn off the air conditioning to prevent the passengers from catching a cold.

A woman wears a transparent poncho on her head as she joins many of the survivors of Typhoon Haiyan as they wait to see Pope Francis . He asked the crowd to hold a moment of silence and thanked those who helped in the rescue effort after the worst recorded storm ever to make landfall . Ferry services were suspended to Leyte province, stranding thousands of travellers including some who wanted to see the Pope. A police official estimated the crowd at the mass at 150,000 before the Pope's arrival and said tens of thousands more were lined up outside the airport area. Francis blew kisses, waved and flashed the thumbs-up sign to the crowd while riding on a covered popemobile from the airport terminal to the nearby altar. Tomorrow, he is due to celebrate the final mass of the visit in Manila's Rizal Park, where as many as six million people are expected. St John Paul II drew a record five million people to his final mass in Manila in 1995, and organisers say they think Francis could top that record. The papal Mass was accelerated and the remainder of the programme - a visit to a nearby cathedral, lunch with survivors and the blessing of a new centre for the poor - was compacted so he could leave four hours early because of worsening conditions . The Vatican said he blessed the centre from his car and he also stopped briefly at the home of a poor fisherman on his way into Tacloban city after the Mass . Before announcing he was cutting short his visit Saturday to Palo, one of the towns devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Pope Francis told people inside the packed Palo Cathedral that it was the birthday of his No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin and asked to sing Happy Birthday .

"He is the high-flying brain surgeon whose frank memoir moved David Cameron to tears over Christmas. But Henry Marsh, author of Do No Harm, has returned the favour by accusing the Prime Minister of having ‘c**p’ policy ideas and fomenting a ‘permanent revolution’ in the NHS that demoralises staff. Mr Marsh warns that the NHS ‘is seriously running out of money’ and says: ‘Most politicians now, particularly Cameron . . . haven’t got a burning vision.’ Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday this month that Mr Marsh’s book had dominated his reading over the festive period. ‘He writes about some of his own cases, some that went right and some that went wrong. And you are moved to tears by reading this book,’ he said. Leading brain surgeon Henry Marsh (pictured) has accused the Prime Minister of fomenting a 'permanent revolution' in the NHS which is demoralising staff . The Prime Minister told friends he was particularly affected by Mr Marsh’s story of a pregnant mother who feared she would never see her baby because of a brain tumour, but the surgeon managed to remove the tumour just before she gave birth. Now Mr Marsh has responded by arguing that the Government has mishandled the Health Service. In today’s Mail on Sunday (below), he sets out a three-point plan to restore public confidence: admit honestly that queues will continue to lengthen unless the Government pays more for the NHS; scrap the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients in four hours; and bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations. ‘Politicians ought to stand up and say, “I’m sorry, but unless you agree to pay higher taxes, you are going to have to put up with longer queues”,’ he writes. ‘The first few hours [of the day] are often shambolic, spent finding beds for emergency cases. Many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment, as “their” beds are filled by emergencies . . . This has led to a sense of demoralising chaos.’ The surgeon opens Do No Harm by saying: ‘I often have to cut into the brain and it is something I hate doing.’ In today’s Total Politics magazine, he attacks Mr Cameron for pledging to make ‘zero harm a reality in our NHS’ in response to the Mid Staffordshire scandal. ‘Another grouse I have against the present Government is this zero harm c**p. There’s never going to be zero harm. Nothing is perfect,’ he says, adding: ‘Most politicians now, particularly Cameron, are not really ideological. They haven’t got a burning vision . . . This constant permanent cultural revolution in the NHS is very demoralising.’ Mr Marsh is brutally honest about his own mistakes in Do No Harm. He recalls a 15-hour operation in which he tore an artery, leaving his patient in a vegetative state. In Total Politics, he says politicians would benefit from equal frankness. ‘You know from bitter experience that . . . bad results are inevitable,’ he adds. It’s time for a dose of honesty if you want shorter queues you have to PAY, writes leading brain surgeon Henry Marsh . David Cameron's NHS reforms have been 'chaotic', brain surgeon Henry Marsh says . By Henry Marsh . I cannot but feel flattered that the Prime Minister read my memoir of life as an NHS neurosurgeon over Christmas, as revealed by The Mail on Sunday. I am told he was very moved by it. But I wonder whether he skipped the passages about political meddling, the constant lack of beds, and this Government’s and its predecessor’s chaotic reforms. I hope not. Because now, as the NHS struggles through yet another winter crisis, what politicians need more than ever is a good dose of honesty. Rather than exchanging brickbats over the latest weekly A&E figures, they should take a step back, think about what’s really gone wrong, and be straight with the public. They have been talking a lot of late about the need for transparency in the NHS – is it too much to ask the same from them? So, after a 36-year career in the NHS that has seen five Prime Ministers and 15 Health Secretaries, here’s my advice for the current PM. First, come clean and tell voters that queues will get longer unless they are prepared to pay more for the NHS. Second, have the courage to scrap targets – including the sacred cow of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients in four hours. Third, bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations. Why say these heretical things? The fact we have queues in the NHS is a simple fact of economic law. It’s about supply and demand. The NHS is free at the point of delivery – as in my opinion it should be – which means demand is high. But it is in scarce supply. There are never enough doctors and nurses, in other words. Because there is no charge for NHS treatment – and don’t get me wrong, I do not think there should be – we end up with queues. As our population gets bigger and we age as a nation, demand for healthcare is growing. So politicians ought to stand up and say, ‘I’m sorry, but unless you agree to pay higher taxes, you will have to put up with longer queues, particularly for non-urgent treatment.’ I hope Mr Cameron – who like me has a First in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Oxford – understands this. Tony Blair brought in targets in an effort to keep queues for pre-planned operations down by fining hospitals that failed to treat patients in 18 weeks. But this was a bad idea, verging on dishonest, since it implied the problem was just a question of getting staff to work ‘more efficiently’. Yet the NHS has been underfunded relative to other developed countries for decades, and many of these other countries – such as France – are themselves now encountering similar issues. Introducing targets is like trying to square the circle of supply and demand – an impossibility if the NHS is working flat out, as it is. Mr Marsh (pictured) believes the NHS has been underfunded relative to other developed countries for decades . This might all sound rather theoretical. But targets have very real, unintended consequences in hospitals. For instance, because managers are always trying to hit targets for pre-planned operations, the beds are always full. This causes endless problems, especially when we have a run of emergency cases. When I go to work each morning I never know whether I will be able to get anything done, and the first few hours are often shambolic, spent finding beds for emergency cases. Many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment, as ‘their’ beds are filled by emergencies. It’s like a game of musical chairs, which gets faster and faster with each year, with the Government constantly changing the music but not adding beds to keep up with the growing number who need them. Mr Marsh's memoir (pictured) was said to have moved Prime Minister David Cameron to tears . This has led to a sense of demoralising chaos, a feeling that I know is shared by an awful lot of people working in hospitals. In the past, we had long waiting lists for routine surgery. Of course, this wasn’t perfect, but at least it was honest. And it meant doctors could more easily give priority to the emergency cases, as we have to. It’s not just targets for routine operations that have a lot to answer for. There has been a huge fuss in the press over hospitals missing the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients within four hours. But it’s only gone from something like 96 per cent to just under 90 per cent. That’s not bad for an emergency service. Internationally, it’s par for the course. But politicians insist on whacking each other over the head over a few percentage points. What truly matters is that the real emergencies – strokes, heart attacks, serious injuries and in my case brain tumours – are treated promptly. I think the four-hour target has got in the way of that. LESS well known is the target that limits how many people we admit as emergencies. If hospitals admit too many, they are penalised financially, which I find bizarre. Are we supposed not to treat them? I take an intense personal pride in looking after my patients. I did not like having a waiting list for routine cases, but I hate even more having to cancel these cases at the last minute – it’s horrible for the patients. And it’s alarmingly easy to start becoming like a bureaucrat myself, turning the patients away and saying: ‘It’s not my problem.’ So, as much as politicians don’t want to say it and the public probably don’t want to hear it, I think we need to abolish targets and reintroduce waiting lists for non-urgent surgery, if politicians feel it is impossible to put much more money into the NHS. Are they brave enough to admit this as the General Election looms? It was not easy to write my book and admit I have made serious mistakes in my career. Yet I have received hundreds – probably thousands – of messages thanking me for my honesty and saying that my admission of fallibility made readers trust me more, not less. Is there perhaps a moral here for our politicians?","Brain surgeon Henry Marsh has blasted the PM's handling of NHS system .

"Four of the costliest places to live in the world are in Europe, research has revealed. Using figures from the world's largest database of user contributed data about cities and countries worldwide, Switzerland was found to be the the most expensive to live. Norway was a close second, with Venezuela third, Iceland fourth and Denmark in fifth. Switzerland has been named as the costliest place to live in the world using the Consumer Price Index . The positioning of Venezuela in the top five owes much to do with the fluctuating economy that means wages are low while prices of goods continue to rise. Venezuela's tightening financial situation has fanned market anxiety about a default, especially as oil slumps to near six-year lows. President Nicholas Maduro has vowed to pay bondholders and most economists doubt a default is coming in the near-term, but investors are getting skittish as the economic crisis worsens. India comes out as having the lowest cost of living, with poor wages matched by poor living conditions . Venezuela depends on oil for 96 percent of its export revenue. The UK was the 10th costliest place to live, slightly higher than near-neighbour Ireland. There weren't many surprises where it comes to the countries with the lowest cost of living. India topped the pile in this regard, followed in by Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia and Algeria. South America's sole entry in the top 15 cheapest places to live was Colombia, typically another country dependent on the strengths of the oil industry.

"The teenage sweethearts in the midst of a dramatic crime spree across five southern states have been spotted begging on the streets in Florida, police said. Dalton Hayes, 18, and his 13-year-old girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, fled their Kentucky home two weeks ago and have evaded the law to apparently make it at least 600 miles south. Along the way they have allegedly stolen three pickup trucks and two handguns - and police now say they have lost patience with the pair. Scroll down for video . On the run: Dalton Hayes, right, was seen with his 13-year-old girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, left, at a South Carolina Walmart last week. They have since been spotted in Florida . 'Crime spree': Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, are seen on surveillance footage inside a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina on Monday. The young couple has been missing from Kentucky for two weeks . Speaking Friday, the sheriff in their home of Grayson County, Kentucky, described their behavior as 'increasingly brazen and dangerous', and told them to surrender immediately. Norman Chaffins said: 'There's going to come a time when we're not going to see him as an 18-year-old kid. 'We're going to see him as someone who's stolen three vehicles with two handguns in them, and the outcome is not going to be good for either one of them if they don't turn themselves in.' It came after police in Florida told NBC News that the two had made their way into the state, after blazing a trail through Kentucky, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. They did not say which town they had been seen in - reportedly to avoid tipping the runaways off. Hayes's mother said the pair have not been dating long, but are in love. She has also said Phillips portrayed herself as being 19 years old, and that everybody, including her son, believed her. Runaways: Phillips, left, and Hayes, 18, were last seen in Kentucky on January 4 after his mother confronted the girl about her age. Before then, she thought the girl was 19, she said . Rebels: Hayes' mother said her son also believed that 13-year-old Cheyenne was 19 . Spree: The couple has made it from Kentucky down to Florida - a distance of at least 600 miles . Describing the girl's behavior, Tammy Martin said she 'would go in and write checks, and she would come out with cigarettes and stuff, so I didn't have any reason not to believe she wasn't 19.' Speaking Friday, she urged her son to give up and 'face the consequences'. She said: 'I pretty much cry myself to sleep every night worrying about where they are and if a police officer or any random individual tries to pull them over and isn't so nice and hurts them,'. When he hit the road, Hayes was running away from trouble back home. He faces burglary and theft charges in his home county, stemming from an arrest late last year. Their crimes, which authorities say include the alleged vehicle thefts, trespassing and forging checks to get cash, are increasingly worrying. 'Victims': Kathy and Jim McGrew said they arrived home on Sunday to find the teens stealing their truck . Damage: After taking chase with the help of police, they found the damaged truck, pictured, in nearby woods . Chaffins said: 'They're going on people's property, they're forging checks to get money. ... They could have stopped in Kentucky, but they didn't."" Since they have no source of money, he added, 'they're going to get desperate.' Before they left Kentucky, the teens dodged officers there twice. Police said they crashed the first truck they stole and hid in the woods, then later stole another truck nearby. The two were spotted Monday at a Walmart in South Carolina, where the teens are thought to have passed two stolen checks. According to police there, they were driving a car stolen from Kentucky. 'Plot': The teenagers allegedly used two forged checks to get cash back from the cashier at Walmart . Escape: The couple left in this 2006 Toyota Tacoma, which was later found dumped in Georgia . Authorities believe they then headed to Georgia and stole a pickup truck from the driveway of a man's home in Henry County, 30 miles southeast of Atlanta. He awoke Wednesday to find his vehicle was gone, along with two handguns he kept inside, Henry County police said Friday. Hours later, another truck the couple is suspected of having stolen in another state was found nearby. It had been crashed through a fence and abandoned behind a vacant building on neighboring property. Have you seen them? The young couple continue to elude authorities; if you see them, call 911 . Martin said her son texted her a few days after their disappearance to say the couple was in Mississippi. They were spotted soon after that in Kentucky, she said.

"The confident gaze is instantly recognisable, even today. This photograph of a 17-year-old Winston Churchill, seen peering over the railings at Harrow School in 1892, is one of the oldest surviving images of our greatest wartime Prime Minister. He was far from the ideal scholar. Yet he would achieve greatness – and outlive all but two of his classmates. As Allen Packwood from the Churchill Archives Centre says: ‘The great thing is that it captures his rebellious and wilful personality.’ The picture is among 90,000 glass plates recently uncovered in a Gloucestershire barn and restored by digital specialist Save Photo. They will be on display in London later this year. Now, 50 years after Churchill’s death, The Mail on Sunday and historian Lizzie Davies have pieced together what happened to his generation. Many died fighting for their country or from disease. By the time of his greatest triumph in 1945, more than half had perished. Winston Churchill (left) pictured at the age of 17 with former classmate George Philip Gurney Hoare in 1892.

"Video footage has been released of a hot air balloon bursting into flames when it hit power lines in an accident that killed three people. The witness footage shows the balloon coming in to land in a field in Caroline County, Virginia, in May. It is seen descending, then is knocked off course when it hits the power lines, which are concealed by a line of trees. An electrical surge is heard, then a fireball erupts in the basket. The witnesses are heard screaming as they realize what has happened, and telling each other to call 911. Explosion: Footage released by the NTSB shows the hot air balloon catching fire in Caroline County, Virginia . Fatal: The crash last May killed all three people on board - two from falling and a third from the fire . Soaring: This image, taken shortly after the first video, shows the burning hot air balloon soaring into the sky after its fuel caught fire . Pilot Daniel Kirk, 65, and passenger Ginny Doyle, 44, were killed falling from the balloon after it burst into flame. The second passenger, 24-year-old Natalie Lewis, was killed by the fireball itself. The footage shows Kirk, who had around 30 years' ballooning experience, activating the burners to lift the vehicle over the lines. It can be heard firing for about 15 seconds, but the balloon continues to descend, and hits the wires, causing the explosion. Witnesses have said they heard the passengers screaming for help before the explosion, which took place at the end of a trip that was almost cancelled due to heavy fog. Victims: (From left to right) College basketball manager Ginny Doyle, 44, coach Natalie Lewis, 24, center, and pilot Daniel Kirk, 65, were all killed in the accident . Before the crash: The three are pictured here just before taking off. Heavy fog delayed the launch significantly - but the balloon flights still went ahead . The balloon was one of three in the air during the flight - though the other two landed safely. Doyle and Lewis, who both worked in college basketball, were supposed to take their trip in the morning, but it was pushed back because of the weather. Video footage of the accident was released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), alongside a collection of photographs. The images show charred instruments, the burnt-out propane tanks from the flight, an image of the landing field and also the burned and tattered remains of the balloon, which were found in a nearby river. NTSB officials are yet to determine what caused the crash, but are expected to report back in less than a month, according to NBC 12. Wreckage: The NTSB also released photographs of evidence it gathered, including the canvas from the wrecked balloon . Burned: This image shows an instrument from the hot air balloon, which caught fire when it hit power lines .

"David Cameron believes his 'bro-mance' with Barack Obama is so strong it should rank with historic transatlantic pacts forged by Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. The Prime Minister concluded a triumphant visit to Washington by paying tribute to the 'special relationship' between Britain and the US – and his personal connection to the man who calls him 'Bro'. In an interview with American TV, Mr Cameron paid tribute to the 'very strong' bond, adding: 'Whether it was Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, or Churchill and Roosevelt, different relationships have been forged, but the underlying strength of this partnership is there for reasons of not just history, but of values'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron has paid tribute to his 'bro-mance' with Barack Obama after a successful visit to Washington where they are pictured on the West Wing Colonnade of the White House . Thatcher's chemistry with Reagan helped cement the Anglo-American union during the 1980s Cold War. Churchill's alliance with Roosevelt was central to victory in the Second World War. The President used a joint appearance at the White House to lavish praise on the Prime Minister. President Obama, referring to reaction to The Mail on Sunday's disclosure he calls Mr Cameron 'Bro', said: 'Some seemed confused and asked, 'What does Obama mean?' 'So let me put this speculation to rest. Put simply, David is a great friend. He's one of my closest and most trusted partners in the world. On many of the most pressing challenges that we face, we see the world the same way.' And in his interview, broadcast today on CBS's Face The Nation, Mr Cameron described the threat from Islamic extremists as 'a poisonous death cult narrative, the perversion of one of the world's major religions'. The Prime Minister said their relationship was so strong it should rank with historic transatlantic pacts forged by Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill . Mr Cameron said: 'This threat keeps morphing. Whereas the majority of it was coming from the Afghanistan, Pakistan area, now you see more of it coming out of Iraq and Syria. Added to that, you've got 'self-starter' or 'lone-wolf' terrorists, people radicalised because of what they have seen on the internet.' Mr Cameron challenged the Pope, who said, in the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, that people 'cannot insult the faith of others'. The Prime Minister said: 'I'm a Christian; if someone says something offensive about Jesus, I might find that offensive, but I don't have a right to wreak my vengeance upon them.' Asked if he had a nickname for the President, Mr Cameron replied: 'I don't, no. And if I did, I probably wouldn't tell you.'","David Cameron has paid tribute to his 'bro-mance' with Barack Obama .

"The wrecked fuselage of the AirAsia jet at the bottom of the Java Sea is to be raised to the surface with special balloons after rough conditions again prevented divers from searching for trapped bodies on Saturday. It was the third attempt by divers to swim the 30m down to the main body of the aircraft which is believed to contain most of the bodies of the passengers. One more body was recovered from the sea's surface today - bringing the total found to 51 - but experts believe scores of others are still strapped to their seats inside the wreckage. It comes one week after investigators searching for black boxes in the crashed AirAsia plane lifted the tail portion out of the Java Sea on Saturday, two weeks after it went down, killing all 162 people on board. Scroll down for video . National disaster agency officers load debris of the AirAsia flight 8501 onto a truck today in Surabaya, eastern Java island . Disaster agency officers carry a coffin today with the remains of a passenger . The crew of Singapore's MV Swift Rescue observing a minute of silence for the victims of ?AirAsia flight QZ8501 . As officials carried the coffins of victims today, others were preparing to raise the wrecked fuselage of the AirAsia jet to the surface with special balloons . After today's diving failure, caused by strong underwater currents and poor visibility, search officials say they will now attempt to raise the fuselage to the surface using special balloons before it is lifted by cranes onto a ship. 'We got down a little way, but then it became dangerous to continue to dive further,' said Mr Henry Bambang Soelistyo, head of the National Search and Rescue Agency. 'But we did discover more wreckage down there, as well as what looked like passenger seats with bodies in them. 'We have also seen what we suspect is the cockpit and an engine, so there's a lot of work to be done.' Divers have already recovered the vital flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder and experts in Jakarta have started to download the data. The tail portion of of AirAsia Flight 8501 was raised a week afo using the balloons. Here, it floats on the water as Indonesian navy divers conduct search operations for the black boxes of the crashed plane in the Java Sea . The tail section of the crashed AirAsia plane has been surfaced . Recovered wreckage from the AirAsia plane lies on the deck of the Crest Onyx ship today . A helicopter flies over the Crest Onyc ship after it retrieved the tail of the AirAsia Flight 8501 in the Java Sea . The Airbus, with 162 people on board, crashed while flying from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore on December 28. It is believed bad weather caused the crash. Mr Soelistyo said he hoped the task of raising the fuselage could begin within days. But experts have warned it will be a painstaking task, considering the condition of the bodies. After the tail was lifted from the ocean last Saturday, it was not immediately clear if the cockpit voice and flight data recorders were still inside the tail or had been detached when the Airbus A320 plummeted into the sea Dec. 28. Their recovery is essential to finding out why it crashed. The tail was hoisted from a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) using inflatable bags that were attached to the rear of the aircraft and a crane to lift it onto a rescue ship. Investigators searching for black boxes in the crashed AirAsia plane lifted the tail portion out of the Java Sea on Saturday, two weeks ago after it went down, killing all 162 people on board . The tail was hoisted from a depth of 30 metres using inflatable bags . Intermittent underwater ping-like sounds were picked up Friday about a kilometer (half mile) from where the tail was located, but it was unclear if they were coming from the recorders located in the back of the aircraft. It was possible the signals were coming from another source. No metal was detected at the ping location, and Nurcahyo Utomo, a National Commission for Transportation Safety investigator, said the sounds could not be confirmed. Footage recently emerged showing Indonesian military divers investigating the submerged tail of doomed AirAsia flight 8501, as search and rescue teams are hopeful that  the black box from the plane's wreckage has been located. Having located the tail of the plane, search teams began pressing ahead with their efforts to find the black box and retrieve bodies from the wreckage, and on Friday afternoon reported detecting 'pings' from the flight data recorder. But Suyadi Bambang Supriyadi, director of operations of Indonesia's search-and-rescue agency, said pings detected about 1km southwest of the wreckage suggest the black box may be located elsewhere, reports Business Spectator. It was not clear if the black boxes were still inside the tail when it was surfaced from the bottom of the ocean . The underwater searches ended before dusk last Friday, after divers were unable to find the black box. Indonesian authorities have warned that the black box, which is located in the tail in the Airbus A320-200, may have become separated during the crash. Footage released by Indonesian authorities shows divers surrounding the submerged wreck, shining torches into the badly damaged hull, 30 metres under the surface of the Java Sea.

Lifting balloons were loaded onto helicopters in preparation of recovery efforts to lift the tail out of the Java Sea, despite worries that the black box may have been separated from the tail during the crash. The footage was captured by the divers despite poor weather and murky water which has been hampering recovery efforts.

"A South Florida sniping training program has been suspended after police were found to be using mug shots of black teenagers for target practice in a discovery that sparked outrage online. The six pictures, printed out on a single piece of paper and used as targets by North Miami Beach police snipers, were discovered riddled by bullets at a shooting range in Medley in December. They featured a number of former convicts, including Woody Deant, then aged 18, who was arrested in connection to a drag race in 2000 that left two people dead. He was released in 2004. After Florida Army National Guard sergeant Valerie Deant - who coincidentally happens to be Deant's sister - found the targets discarded at the range, she  posted an image of them online. Scroll down for video . Targets: A South Florida sniping training program has been suspended after police were found to be using these mug shots of black men (pictured) for target practice in a discovery that sparked outrage online . The picture sparked anger among the online community, with many condemning the police's use of African-American mug shots at a time when racial relations have been strained across the country. On Friday evening, NMB Police Chief Scott Dennis said that he realized the six images may appear offensive when viewed apart from other targets, such as images of late terrorist Osama Bin Laden. 'For that reason, I immediately suspend the sniper training program,' he said, adding that he was particularly concerned about the use of photos of men who 'would be on the streets' of the city. Chief Dennis said the force is reviewing the materials its snipers use, ordering commercially produced images  instead of mug shots and launching an investigation, the Miami Herald reported. But he said no-one in the sniper team - which  includes minorities - will be disciplined for using the black teenagers' mug shots as targets - an action which did not violate any department policies. Sgt Deant, who plays clarinet with the National Guard’s 13th Army Band, was attending the range after the snipers for annual weapons qualifications training when she discovered the mug shots. Recognition: The six pictures were discovered riddled by bullets at a Medley shooting range in December. They featured a number of former convicts, including Woody Deant (pictured, left, aged 18 and, right, now) Shocked: After Florida Army National Guard sergeant Valerie Deant (pictured) - who coincidentally happens to be Deant's sister - found the targets discarded in a bin at the range, she posted an image of them online . Speaking to NBC, she said she was shocked to recognize her brother in one of the images, particularly because he was arrested 15 years ago and his photo was littered with bullet holes. 'I was like 'why is my brother being used for target practice?' she said. 'There were like gunshots there. And I cried a couple of times.' Following Ms Deant's discovery, she immediately called her brother, who was speechless. Deant then took to his Facebook page to share the image of the targets - including himself - to his friends, writing: 'ATTENTION!!!!! To all my friends, Facebook friends and family. 'I have fallen victim to criminal profiling by the North Miami Beach Police Dept. 'We are targets!!!!' He later told the news station: 'The picture actually has like bullet holes. One in my forehead and one in my eye... I was speechless.' He added: 'I’m a father. I’m a husband. I’m a career man.' In defense of the black mug shots, Major Kathy Katerman said the police force's snipers also shoot at image of white men, saying: 'We have other targets, too. We don’t just shoot at black males.' She added that the snipers find it useful to use lineups with faces that share similar characteristics - and that the targets should have been properly disposed of before the police left the range. Scene: Sgt Deant said she was shocked to recognize her brother in one of the images at the shooting range (pictured) in Medley, particularly because he was arrested 15 years ago and his photo was riddled by bullets . Chief: The targets sparked anger among the online community. On Friday, NMB Police Chief Scott Dennis (pictured) said that he realized the six images may appear offensive when viewed apart from other targets . However, the use of photo lineups for target practice - instead of commercially produced images - does not appear to be a common practice among police departments in the area. Neither Miami-Dade police, nor four other forces, use such photos to practice their marksmanship. H.T. Smith, a prominent local attorney and Army veteran, said his unit never considered shooting at images of real people, saying: 'Of course it's offensive. You shouldn't be shooting at faces anyway.' Retired FBI agent, Alex Vasquez, added: 'The use of those targets doesn’t seem correct. The police have different options for targets. I think they have to be extra careful and sensitive to some issues.' Killed: In recent months, racial tensions in America have made headlines across the world. There have been violent protests over grand jury decisions following the deaths of Michael Brown (left) and Eric Garner (right) In recent months, racial tensions in America have made headlines across the world. In November, a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, chose not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown. The following month, a separate grand jury decided not to indict white officer Daniel Pantaleo over the 'chokehold' killing of 43-year-old father Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. The rulings sparked violent protests in more than 170 US cities.","Mug shots were discovered riddled by bullets at Medley shooting range .

They’ve both had hair transplants – and they have been so open about their procedures that it is now seen as a relatively easy fix for men with receding or thinning hair. It’s a topic that seems to be firmly in the ‘men’s health’ camp – but it is also an option for women and can change their lives in just the same way. According to cosmetic surgery group Transform, women make up a third of hair transplant patients, and there was a 41 per cent rise in inquiries between 2012 and 2013. Scroll down for video . Confidence restored: Mother-of-two Ellie Kidd, 32, was thinning before she had her hair transplant procedure . One of the growing number who have turned to hair transplant technology is Ellie Kidd, 38, who says the treatment has marked a new beginning for her. Ellie, a clerical assistant from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, had a hair transplant in March 2013. The divorcee who has two children, Lewis, 14, and Macey, 11, says: ‘I’ve always had fine hair but it got worse after I’d had Macey and in photographs I’d notice the top of my scalp. 'I’d avoid being in pictures but occasionally something from a party would pop up on Facebook and I’d cringe. Also opted for treatment: Actor James Nesbitt and model Calum Best have both had hair transplants in recent years . I’d comb my hair to try and disguise it but windy days were another big problem. Basically, I had zero confidence.’ Can curly hair turn straight? Jonathan Torch, founder of Toronto’s Curly Hair Institute, says: ‘Yes it can – and go back again. It’s often been observed. But we don’t know why this happens. Curly hair is the result of a flatter hair follicle. Those with straight hair have a rounder follicle. Some say the hormonal changes that often happen during puberty or the menopause affect the muscles at the base of every hair follicle and are responsible for changing its shape, but this has never been proven.’ When she was 32, Ellie’s GP diagnosed her with a deficiency of Vitamin B – essential for healthy hair – and Ellie was given injections of it every 12 weeks. But they were too late to prevent further loss. After her GP told her that the most the NHS could do was provide a wig, she sought help privately. With help from her parents, she  paid for £5,700 transplant surgery herself at a Ziering Hair Restoration Clinic. And she says: ‘It’s one of the best decisions I ever made.’ Ellie hopes that her story will encourage other women who have had transplants to tell theirs, to highlight that it is a suitable treatment. Transplant surgeon Bessam Farjo says: ‘Women and hair loss is still a taboo subject - and we still need to do a lot more to let ladies know surgery can help them in the same way it does men.’ Footballer Wayne Rooney has also had more than one hair transplant procedure . A hair transplant is done under local anaesthetic and involves moving hair roots – usually from the back of the scalp – to the area where there is hair loss. The roots then ‘bed in’ to this new area and within three to four months they start growing normally. There may be some truth in the old wives’ tale that eating a cube of jelly every day helps hair grow. Gelatin is usually derived from animal products, and contains keratin, a protein that makes up 90 per cent of your hair, giving it strength and elasticity. Studies have shown that consuming high doses of gelatin, keratin and Vitamin A can boost hair density in people with hair loss. Many hair supplements contain these. Also found in gelatin is the protein collagen, which gives the skin its firmness. YES PLEASE . Napura T1 Purify Pre Hair Health Treatment .

Until 20 years ago transplants were done with what is called a ‘plug’ or ‘punch’ technique, in which surgeons would take tiny circles of skin containing about 20 hairs from the donor site and reimplanting it in the area of thinning hair. ‘It didn’t look natural,’ says Dr Farjo. Ten years ago a system called Follicular Unit Extraction was introduced in which smaller, individual follicular units just 1mm in diameter are taken from the donor site and immediately implanted into the site of the thinning hair. Some surgeons, including Dr Farjo, now use a robot to help with this process, speeding it up. Dr Farjo estimates that an average female pattern hair loss patient would require six hours’ work for a transplant, costing £6,000. You do need to have enough hair to be able to transplant and if your hair is thin in the original site it will also be thin in the transplanted area. And in about five per cent of cases, the hair graft will not take hold. Ellie’s transplant took place in Bromsgrove, at a hair restoration clinic called Ziering. ‘I was excited rather than nervous,’ she says. Afterwards she was given painkillers and five days later she returned to work. At about two weeks, the surrounding hair at the top of her head fell out. This is a reasonably common side effect with the hair going into ‘shock’ after the rigours of the operation. ‘I lost around a third of my existing hair. It sounds dramatic but I’d been warned it could happen and wore hats,’ says Ellie. ‘It started to grow back after a couple of weeks.’ Four months later she had her shoulder-length bob cut into a flattering short style. ‘The transplanted hair was spiky at first but now blends in with the rest,’ she says. ‘You’d never know to look at it that I’d had surgery.’","Ellie Kidd, from Worcestershire, avoided photos after noticing thinning hair .

"ISIS has almost doubled the land it controls in Syria since the US-led coalition began airstrikes against the extremist group in the summer, a new map has revealed. The extremist group has continued to expand its 'caliphate', despite more than 800 airstrikes hitting targets in ISIS-controlled areas since last summer. The map, created by the Coalition for a Democratic Syria (CDS), shows just how much land has fallen to ISIS - which now has a third of the country under its control. Before the summer, the militants controlled just half that. Scroll down for video .

It is thought a million more Syrians came under their control in the first two months of the bombing campaign, which saw the US-led coalition conduct more than 800 airstrikes in towns like Kobane (pictured) When ISIS takes control of an area, it enforces strict Sharia law - which means executions and amputations for crimes are common . 'Assessing the map, ISIS has almost doubled its territorial control in Syria. But more importantly, the number of people who now live under ISIS control has also increased substantially,' CDS political adviser Mouaz Moustafa told The Daily Beast. It is thought  a million more Syrians came under ISIS's terrifying regime within the first two months of the bombing campaign. But the US and coalition forces have had an 'Iraq first' policy, and have focused their efforts on reducing ISIS's control there. In addition to airstrikes, the US backs forces on the ground - although it does not have any of its soldiers fighting on the ground against the militants. ""We very much see ISIL [ISIS] largely in a defensive posture inside Iraq, that whatever momentum they had been enjoying has been halted, has been blunted.

"The teenage sweethearts in the midst of a dramatic crime spree across five southern states have been spotted begging on the streets in Florida, police said. Dalton Hayes, 18, and his 13-year-old girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, fled their Kentucky home two weeks ago and have evaded the law to apparently make it at least 600 miles south. Along the way they have allegedly stolen three pickup trucks and two handguns - and police now say they have lost patience with the pair. On the run: Dalton Hayes, right, was seen with his 13-year-old girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, left, at a South Carolina Walmart last week. They have since been spotted in Florida . 'Crime spree': Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, are seen on surveillance footage inside a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina on Monday. The young couple has been missing from Kentucky for two weeks . Speaking Friday, the sheriff in their home of Grayson County, Kentucky, described their behavior as 'increasingly brazen and dangerous', and told them to surrender immediately. Norman Chaffins said: 'There's going to come a time when we're not going to see him as an 18-year-old kid. 'We're going to see him as someone who's stolen three vehicles with two handguns in them, and the outcome is not going to be good for either one of them if they don't turn themselves in.' It came after police in Florida told NBC News that the two had made their way into the state, after blazing a trail through Kentucky, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. They did not say which town they had been seen in - reportedly to avoid tipping the runaways off. Hayes's mother said the pair have not been dating long, but are in love. She has also said Phillips portrayed herself as being 19 years old, and that everybody, including her son, believed her. Runaways: Phillips, left, and Hayes, 18, were last seen in Kentucky on January 4 after his mother confronted the girl about her age. Before then, she thought the girl was 19, she said . Rebels: Hayes' mother said her son also believed that 13-year-old Cheyenne was 19 . Describing the girl's behavior, Tammy Martin said she 'would go in and write checks, and she would come out with cigarettes and stuff, so I didn't have any reason not to believe she wasn't 19.' Speaking Friday, she urged her son to give up and 'face the consequences'. She said: 'I pretty much cry myself to sleep every night worrying about where they are and if a police officer or any random individual tries to pull them over and isn't so nice and hurts them,'. When he hit the road, Hayes was running away from trouble back home. He faces burglary and theft charges in his home county, stemming from an arrest late last year. Their crimes, which authorities say include the alleged vehicle thefts, trespassing and forging checks to get cash, are increasingly worrying. 'Victims': Kathy and Jim McGrew said they arrived home on Sunday to find the teens stealing their truck . Damage: After taking chase with the help of police, they found the damaged truck, pictured, in nearby woods . Chaffins said: 'They're going on people's property, they're forging checks to get money. ... They could have stopped in Kentucky, but they didn't."" Since they have no source of money, he added, 'they're going to get desperate.' Before they left Kentucky, the teens dodged officers there twice. Police said they crashed the first truck they stole and hid in the woods, then later stole another truck nearby. The two were spotted Monday at a Walmart in South Carolina, where the teens are thought to have passed two stolen checks. According to police there, they were driving a car stolen from Kentucky. 'Plot': The teenagers allegedly used two forged checks to get cash back from the cashier at Walmart . Escape: The couple left in this 2006 Toyota Tacoma, which was later found dumped in Georgia . Authorities believe they then headed to Georgia and stole a pickup truck from the driveway of a man's home in Henry County, 30 miles southeast of Atlanta. He awoke Wednesday to find his vehicle was gone, along with two handguns he kept inside, Henry County police said Friday. Hours later, another truck the couple is suspected of having stolen in another state was found nearby. It had been crashed through a fence and abandoned behind a vacant building on neighboring property. Have you seen them? The young couple continue to elude authorities; if you see them, call 911 . Martin said her son texted her a few days after their disappearance to say the couple was in Mississippi. They were spotted soon after that in Kentucky, she said. 'He was just trying to throw me off,' she said. 'I'm sure he thought that I would call the police and tell them where he was.' Chaffins said the situation is getting more serious as time passes. He said: 'This is not a game to us. Our biggest fear is that Dalton is not going to stop for the police. He's going to run every time they approach him.' Moms: Phillips's mother Sherry Peters, left, and Dalton's mother Tammy Martin, right, have both begged their children to giver themselves up and come home .","Dalton Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, spotted in a sixth state .

"The former husband of Imran Khan’s new wife is demanding a public apology after she claimed he was violent toward her during their ten-year marriage. Dr Ijaz Rehman has given Reham Khan a week to withdraw allegations of abuse, which she made in an interview soon after marrying the Pakistani politician and cricketing icon. ‘I have asked Reham to apologise for the slur to my good name and character,’ said Dr Rehman, an NHS psychiatrist who lives in Lincolnshire. Scroll down for video . The former husband of Imran Khan’s new wife Reham is demanding a public apology after she claimed he was violent toward her during their ten-year marriage . ‘She knows that what she said is not true and while I do not want to get involved in mudslinging, I will defend myself vigorously if she does not set the record straight.’ Mrs Khan, a former BBC presenter, also claimed Dr Rehman left her penniless after their divorce, leaving her to bring up their three children alone. But Dr Rehman strenuously denied all the allegations, telling The Mail on Sunday that they were attempts by Mrs Khan to win sympathy from a Pakistani public hostile towards her new marriage. As a divorcee, she is mistrusted by religious conservatives in Pakistan, and last week she was condemned over footage of her frying sausages. Muslims are forbidden from eating pork. Dr Ijaz Rehman, NHS psychiatrist in Lincolnshire, wants an  for the slur to his character . ‘What Reham said about domestic violence was in order for her to be seen in good light and come out as an innocent victim to cover her deeds, at my expense,’ Dr Rehman said. ‘I ask her to act honourably and honestly and issue an apology and retract her statement within a week. I have never lifted my hands on anyone and I have never been involved in any kind of domestic violence in any shape or form. ‘As for her claim that I left her penniless, I have always looked after her and my children.’ The doctor met and married Reham in Pakistan, but they lived in Lincolnshire until they split in 2005. Reham eventually moved to East London and went on to work as a weather presenter for regional programme South Today. She returned to her homeland in 2012 and began dating Mr Khan, 62, who was previously married to heiress Jemima Goldsmith. However, their marriage has been condemned by conservatives, who say she is an unsuitable partner for a Right-wing politician who makes much of his Islamic faith. In an interview on Pakistani TV last week, 42-year-old Reham was asked about being a victim of domestic abuse. She said: ‘Domestic violence is a big issue and no attention is paid to it in Pakistan. [It] happens in many shapes and forms. ‘I have never spoken about my personal experience of domestic violence because I was in [the] media and I felt it would be unfair to expose the other party.’ She said she had been reluctant to tie the knot again because of her experiences in her former marriage. Last week the Khans visited a school in Peshawar where 132 pupils were massacred by the Taliban – but they were met by crowds of grieving relatives chanting for them to leave.","Dr Ijaz Rehman has given Reham Khan a week to withdraw allegations .

"Karon Thomas-Larkin has been suspended from teaching after she turned up to lessons drunk . A primary school teacher has been barred from the classroom after she turned up to lessons so drunk she could barely stand up and was unable to get a bus back home. Karon Thomas-Larkin, 47, who taught five and six-year-olds at Cwmffrwdoer Primary School in Pontypool, South Wales, smelled 'overbearingly' of alcohol seven times over six weeks. A disciplinary hearing was told that 13 parents had approached the head teacher with complaints about her behaviour and the fact she smelled of 'stale alcohol'. Rhiannon Dale, from the General Teaching Council for Wales, said that a learning support assistant had reported smelling alcohol on her breath in the school's tuck shop during morning break. She told the panel that a month later, the headteacher noted 'an overbearing smell' of alcohol in her office after Ms Thomas-Larkin attended a meeting there. When confronted by the headteacher, she claimed she had not had a drink since the previous week. The Year One teacher was sent home three times during October and told not to come back until she was in a fit state. She returned to school part-time in April 2013 and was told she could go home in the afternoons to plan her lessons. But on one afternoon Mrs Thomas-Larkin was recognised by two council officers while sitting on a bench, where she had spent more than two hours apparently drunk. Ms Dale told the panel: 'She had difficulty walking and standing and was seen staggering across the road. 'She tried to sit down on a bench and fell backwards and tried several times to stand up and fell before she got into the car taking her home. 'She was clearly intoxicated and one of the officials considered she had drunk a large amount of alcohol.' Mrs Thomas-Larkin, who had been at the school since 2005, was suspended before finally being dismissed in March last year. The 47-year-old had been a teacher at Cwmffrwdoer Primary School in Pontypool, South Wales since 2005 . The hearing was told that she had returned to work after a serious illness where she was treated in intensive care for Legionnaire's disease. Following her return to work at the beginning of the autumn term in 2012, several teachers and classroom assistants reported smelling alcohol on her clothes and breath. Ms Dale told the professional conduct hearing in Cardiff: 'She accepts the allegations and admits to unacceptable conduct on seven separate occasions at school. Colleagues reported they noticed the problem when she returned from work after being treated for Legionnaire's disease in 2012 . 'She put the safety and well being of her pupils in jeopardy. I don't consider presenting for work still under the influence as setting a good example to pupils.' Her union representative David Browne told the private hearing: 'This is a particularly sad case of health issues which had an impact on the set of circumstances. Committee chairman Steve Powell said: 'Presenting herself at school smelling of alcohol falls seriously short expected of a registered teacher and undermines public trust and confidence in the profession. 'As she admits, she is not yet fully recovered and a period of recovery is required before we can be confident there is no risk of repeat behaviour.' Retired teacher Chris Long, who was headteacher at the school for 17 years, said: 'She was a highly efficient teacher, who was keen to take on new responsibilities. 'Her pupils were fond of her and I never received any complaints from parents.' Mrs Thomas-Larkin was handed a suspension order banning her from teaching for 12 months and requiring her to present a medical report showing she is no longer dependent on alcohol before she can return to the classroom.","Karon Thomas-Larkin, 47, smelled 'overbearingly' of alcohol at school .

"Said Kouachi - one of the brothers who gunned down 12 people in Paris on January 7 - has been buried at a secret location in his home city of Reims. The city's officials said the burial was carried out at the French government's demand, despite concerns it could become a shrine for extremists. The Kouachi brothers - Said and Cherif - killed eight members of the Charlie Hebdo staff, sparking a wave of terror attacks across Paris which left 17 innocent people dead. A spokesman for the city of Reims said: 'Given the risk of disturbance of the peace and in order to quickly turn the page of this tragic episode, it was decided to do the burial quickly.'

Massacre: The attack on the magazine's offices (pictured) sparked a wave of terror attacks in the city, in which 17 innocent people died . Objection: Reims' mayor initially refused to have Kouachi, who attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices (pictured), buried in his city - but the French government forced it to go ahead . Its Mayor, Arnaud Robinet, said he'd 'categorically refuse' a request by Kouachi's family to bury him in the city where he lived - until police gunned him and his brother down on January 9. He added: 'I don't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics. I don't want a place that promotes hate. 'He was buried last night, in the most discrete, anonymous way possible.' Speaking Saturday on BFMTV, Mr Robinet said he was forced to allow the burial by the government, which enforced a French law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence. Robinet claimed he didn't know where Said Kouachi was buried in the cemetery - which he didn't identify. Antoine Flasaquier, the lawyer of Kouachi's widow, said the burial took place overnight 'in the greatest discretion and dignity'. Mr Flasaquier said the widow did not attend the burial for fear she would be followed by reporters and give away the location of the grave.

He too will be buried in an anonymous grave 'to avoid all risk of disturbance to the peace and to preserve the town's tranquility'.

However, Eurostar said its passenger services would not be running again until today at the earliest. In a statement yesterday, it apologised, adding: ‘If you were planning to travel today, we advise you to postpone your journey and not come to the station.’ A spokesman said passengers could rebook their tickets or get a refund if necessary. It also said it was paying for hotel accommodation at £150 per night and letting stranded passengers claim £50 towards food for every 24 hours they were delayed.

And the company is now facing a multi-million pound compensation bill as thousands of holidaymakers were left stranded in London and Paris. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of Eurostar passengers filled St Pancras station after all trains were cancelled following a lorry fire . All Eurostar trains were cancelled for rest of Saturday following the blaze at the French end of the tunnel . Eurostar services are yet to resume as attempts to clear smoke from the tunnel continue. All passenger services and the Eurotunnel Le Shuttle car service were halted after the vehicle caught fire at the French end of the underground railway's south tunnel yesterday. A Eurotunnel spokesman said on Twitter: 'Taking slightly longer than anticipated to recommence services, we need to be sure any residue smoke cleared completely before we do so. 'They aren't running yet, but should be within the next couple of hours. I appreciate it's frustrating, sorry.' Earlier, the company said it will run a full service tomorrow 'for passengers who have an existing reservation for this date'. It said trains would be delayed by between 30 and 60 minutes because of only one tunnel being open. But it strongly advised people whose trains were cancelled today - and who faced three hours queues to get a refund - not to arrive at stations unless they had already been re-booked.

'We are going on a boat for two weeks and this is now going to have a domino effect.' She added: 'There are not enough people helping. Nobody is saying anything and they aren't telling people their rights. They are supposed to give us information. 'It is out of their hands but they don't seem to know what's going on.' Eurostar urged passengers to leave the station but many remained in hope of a refund or a later train . Ben Lawton was taken to a 'make shift medical centre' amid fears they could inhale the fumes. He told the Sun on Sunday: 'We were evacuated and given gas masks. Then we were taken to an airtight concrete room within the tunnel and had to wait for two hours. 'Then we were taken by coach to Calais.' Artur Ogonowski, a council worker from Preston had planning to travel to Paris to take his four-year-old son Alex to Disneyland. After standing in the queue for more than an hour, the family were still only a third of the way to the front. Mr Ogonowski, 35, said: 'We checked in at 12.50pm and we have Disneyland booked for tonight. We left home in Preston at 8am.' He added: 'They don't seem to know what is going on - they just asked us to queue. 'We don't want refunds we just want to get there.' Matthew Harvey from Sydney was travelling with his wife and three children to Paris. It would have been the first time his children had visited the city. Mr Harvey, 44, said: 'We got on the train and it kept stopping and we didn't know why.' Passengers were then told they would be returning to London. Mr Harvey said: 'We thought that it might be a bit of an overreaction because of everything that has been happening.' He added: 'We were due to be staying in Paris for a week. We are hoping to get there tomorrow. We need to get to Paris because our flight back to Australia is from there.' 'Eurostar have given us £150 per room for tonight which isn't easy in London,' he said. Josiane Marcel, a 35-year-old banker from Paris arrived at the station at 4pm to return home after a weekend in London. She said: 'I didn't get anything from Eurostar - not a text or an email. 'We didn't know anything about the disruption before we got here. 'When I arrived the man said the tunnel was closed and gave me a leaflet.' Impasse: No Eurostar passengers will be heading to France for the rest of the day following the closure . Elsewhere, on Twitter, Labour peer Stewart Wood wrote: 'Enjoyed my Eurostar trip from Paris to Calais, 3 hours without moving & then back to Paris. Gare du Nord unchanged since I left 6 hours ago.' Graduate Margaret Murphy tweeted: 'The wait to exchange/refund #Eurostar tickets. Just told it could be over 3 hour wait here at St Pancras.' Kristen Davis, who works in Paris, tweeted: 'Once again I'm stuck in a @Eurostar in Northern #France! instead of heading to #London we're going to Lille.' Ben Pedroche tweeted: 'Meltdown at St Pancras due to all Eurostars cancelled. Lots of pissed-off French people.' A carbon dioxide alarm is also said to have gone off just before midday, with Eurotunnel investigating the cause . A spokesman for Eurotunnel insisted that there was no fire in the tunnel, but there was smoke coming from a lorry. Cargo on the lorry was said to be smoldering but it is not clear what the goods on board were. The fire has now been doused. He said: 'Technicians have gone in and have seen smoke and not flames. 'Two CO2 detectors went off in the north tunnel. As is procedure, the trains came to a controlled stop. All traffic was slowed down and was reversed back to stations.' A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A lorry fire has led to the closure of both bores of the Channel Tunnel. 'The fire was at the French end of the tunnel and is being dealt with by the French authorities. There are no reported injuries. 'However, rail passengers are advised to expect significant delays whilst the vehicle is being recovered and fumes are cleared from the tunnels.' The closure comes amid heightened security following the terror attacks in France last week. In March, hundreds of Eurostar passengers were delayed after a lightning strike triggered a fire in a building close to the entrance to the tunnel in Kent. Misery: French and British passengers were united in their frustration following the closure . There were long queues outside St Pancras, stretching all the way down one side of the building .

"George Paskins, 81, was convicted of repeatedly raping three young girls during 16-year abuse . A pensioner who preyed on young girls in a 16-year long campaign of abuse has been jailed for 18 years. George Paskins from Paignton, Devon, began regularly raping one girl when she was just three and another when was eight in 1965 and was found guilty by a jury on his 81st birthday. A court heard that he was so relaxed during his abuse that on one occasion he even paused to make a cup of tea and another described how he used a comic to cover her face. One of the victims was repeatedly raped between the ages of three and four until the age of 10 or 11 while the abuse started at the age of eight for second girl and ended when she was 11. A third girl was also indecently assaulted, although Paskins swore 'on the Holy Bible' that he did not touch any of the girls. Recorder Paul Dunkels at Plymouth Crown Court said Paskins was a 'bully' who used violence and threats to make sure the girls never complained. He told the pensioner: 'Undoubtedly the two girls who were raped suffered serious psychological trauma. 'One of the girls was extremely young when you began to rape her.' All three victims, two via videolink from Australia, bravely spoke of the casual and perverse brutality they suffered at the hands of Paskins up until 1981. The former carpenter and joiner told the week-long trial his victims should be punished for fabricating claims against him. 'I have never touched them,' he said. 'To me, it is a terrible thing that they have done. I think they should be punished.' Paskins was convicted of raping the first victim three times between 1965 and 1977 and the second girl three times between 1970 and 1975. He was given another two years concurrent for indecent assault of the third girl and 12 months for indecency with her, and is expected to spend nine years behind bars - taking him to the age of 90. Neither he, nor his wife at the back of the court, showed any reaction when the foreman announced the verdicts.

"The sale of a print of a painting by the Prince of Wales has funded a new kindergarten in one of the most deprived places in the world. Children’s charity Kids For Kids has used the £32,500 raised by the sale of Prince Charles’s Terrace At Highgrove – gifted to them by the Prince himself – to open the school in Darfur in western Sudan. The Kids For Kids First Community Kindergarten in the village of Abu Nahla is testimony to the popularity of the heir to the throne’s lithographs. The framed print, personally signed by the Prince, originally sold for £7,500 at a celebrity auction in 2012. The sale of one of Prince Charles's prints has funded a kindergarten in Darfur. Here he is pictured working on one of his paintings in 2008 . Children play music at the kindergarten in Darfur which was funded by the sale of the Prince's print . Months later, its new owner, businessman Andrew Mead, sold it to an anonymous sheik in a second charity auction in the Saudi capital of Riyadh for £25,000 – and donated that sum to the charity too. It is thought to be a record price paid for a work of art by the Prince, who never sells his original paintings. Patricia Parker MBE, chief executive of Kids For Kids, said: ‘It is incredible to think that this new school has come from the proceeds of a single work by the Prince.’ Kids For Kids spent about £22,000 on the new building, which boasts two classrooms and an office for teaching staff. The money has also helped buy other essential items including toys, musical instruments, a roundabout and a slide. The Prince is thought to be aware of the school, but a Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on how much sales of his prints had raised for charity. Melanie Gerlis, of trade paper The Art Newspaper, said the value of the print was boosted by its connection to Charles. Children's charity Kids for Kids used the £32,500 raised by the sale of Terrace At Highgrove (pictured) to open the school in western Sudan . She added: ‘It certainly helps that he is a prince and it would help even more should he become King.’ Art critic Brian Sewell said the Prince had a mixed record as an artist, producing both good and bad pieces – mainly because he cannot commit enough time to painting due to his heavy schedule. ‘If he could do it all the time, he wouldn’t produce a bad one,’ Mr Sewell added.","The sale of one of Prince Charles's artworks has funded a school in Darfur .

"It is dressing room scenario that most women can empathize with. Trying on a pair of jeans in your size - only to find they don't fit. And when you are plus-sized, this is an even more frequent occurrence, according to one US writer. To prove her point, Brooklyn-based Marie Southard Ospina, 23,  tried out 10 pairs of size 16 jeans. Scroll down for video . Perfect fit: Brooklyn-based writer Marie Southard Ospina, 23, tried out 10 pairs of size 16 jeans. Above, she found that NYDJ PLUS Plus Stretch Slim Fit Ankle Jeans fitted perfectly, with 'soft, sufficiently stretchy' denim . She then captured photos of herself donning the jeans in New York stores, before reviewing the fit. In some cases - such as NYDJ PLUS Plus Stretch Slim Fit Ankle Jeans and Liz Claiborne City-Fit Skinny Jeans (Plus) - the pants appeared to fit her body shape, often with flattering effects. However, in others, Ms Ospina, Bustle.com's associate style and beauty editor, was unable to fasten the jeans at all unless 'I lie flat on my back and suck it in more than I’ve ever sucked it in before'. These included Jones New York's plus-size jeans, Jessica Simpson's Plus Skinny Jeans range, Arizona's brand and Calvin Klein Skinny Jeans, said Ms Ospina, who owns size 14 to 20 jeans. Tight: When trying on some jeans (including Calvin Klein's Skinny Jeans range, pictured) Ms Ospina was unable to fasten the jeans at all unless 'I lie flat on my back and suck it in more than I’ve ever sucked it in before' 'Dreaded camel toe': In reference to Old Navy's Plus Women's Skinny Jeans (pictured), the plus-size writer said: 'Digging the relaxed boyfriend style. Not digging the “digging” at the hips and the dreaded camel toe' Meanwhile, some pairs of jeans apparently left her with a more 'pear-shaped' figure (including Forever 21's jeans), while others resulted in 'dreaded camel-toe' (such as Old Navy's  Skinny Jeans). And in one case, the Colombian-American writer found the jeans were too baggy around the waist. Writing about women's clothing sizes for Buzzfeed, Ms Ospina, who also conducted a plus-size Photoshop experiment in December, said: 'When you’re plus-size, things get even trickier . 'Let’s forget, for a moment, that most brands and stores simply stop producing apparel after a size 12. The reality is that a curvier body has, well, more curves. Comfortable: Ms Ospina, who also conducted a plus-size Photoshop experiment in December, found that Levi's plus-size jeans (pictured) were 'relatively comfy and soft'. But she added: 'I would prefer you in high-waist' Too baggy: With regard to Decree's jeans range (pictured), she wrote: 'When stretched at the front, we’re looking at three unnecessary inches of space. But you’re not baggy anywhere else! The confusion never stops' 'And those curves aren’t something you can easily measure - let alone put into jeans.' She added that her latest experiment has proved to her - and hopefully, others - that women's 'obsession with being the ""right"" size' is 'nonsensical'. 'To try to define a “size” is equatable to trying to define a “color"". Much more energy than it’s worth,' said the writer, who admits she is 'not a big denim lover'. 'Sure, I had fun trying to squeeze into pants that were far too small. Because once you get into it, it is actually fun. 'But there are other things that require far more better use of head space.'","Marie Southard Ospina, 23, tried out 10 pairs of size 16 jeans in New York .

"A hush fell over the House of Lords last week as severely disabled crossbench peer Baroness Campbell revealed her fears over plans to give some terminally ill people the right to die. Speaking at times only with the aid of a respirator and the help of an assistant, Lady Campbell, who suffers from severe spinal muscular atrophy, spelt out her opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill. This is an edited version of her speech. 'We have been told time and again that disabled people with life-limiting conditions have nothing to fear from the Assisted Dying Bill. We are told it is necessary only to help a few desperate individuals to end their lives when they have weeks or months to live, and that, if enacted, it will not touch anyone who does not want it. I do not believe that. Disabled and terminally people are rightly frightened that it puts them at risk. One of the most important reasons why I oppose the Bill is the definition of terminal illness and how many months, weeks or years we have to live. Believe me, I know about terminal illness, personally and professionally. Scroll down for video . Crossbench peer Baroness Campbell, who suffers from severe spinal muscular atrophy, spelt out her opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill in the House of Lords . I am fearful not least because the Bill defines terminal illness as an ‘inevitably progressive condition which cannot be reversed by treatment’. That could apply to many disabilities, my own included. Not a single organisation of disabled or terminally ill people is actively campaigning for this legislation. They all agree that it is impossible to create clear blue water between disability and terminal illness and as regards how many months until one might die. The definition of terminal illness in the Bill is ‘an inevitably progressive condition which cannot be reversed by treatment (a “terminal illness”)’, from which the person ‘is reasonably expected to die within six months’. The Bill adds: ‘Treatment which only relieves the symptoms of an inevitably progressive condition temporarily is not to be regarded as treatment which can reverse that condition.’ Baroness Campbell told the House of Lords 'Disabled and terminally people are rightly frightened that it (the bill) puts them at risk' The brain, eyes, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, joints and nerves can all be subject to ‘inevitably progressive’ conditions deteriorating at widely differing rates. Various forms of cancer, heart disease and neurological conditions can fit the criteria for ‘inevitably progressive’ at some stages. It would take only a chest infection or a small change in my muscle capacity for me to be put at risk. The catch-all of six months sends the invidious message that once you are down, you are on your way out. For any newly diagnosed individual, it allows the early seeds of fear to be sown, perhaps by the individual, perhaps by family and friends, or perhaps both. Words of hope will have to compete against advice to shop around for a doctor willing to give a prognosis of six months or less. As someone who has come close to death on several occasions, I know how essential it is to have a positive outlook. There are times when one believes that one is going to die. That can be for weeks or even months. When and if you get through that period and if, as in my case, a new ventilation system is suddenly developed, you get better again. Perhaps you have a week, a month or, as in my case, you have another two years. However, during the weary low period when everyone expects you are going to die, you could easily take advantage of an assisted dying exit. Other disabled and terminally ill people have spoken of enduring such periods for years before their spirits finally lift. People felt that they were going to die. They do not take out pensions. I do not have a pension. Why? It is because everyone was telling me that I was going to die. The Bill is a law for the strong at the expense of the weak. Last weekend, I went to see the film The Theory Of Everything, a very engaging and honest biography of Professor Hawking and his contribution to theoretical physics. It closes with Stephen speaking to a group of scientists. He had outlived his sell-by date by 52 years. He was often in the state of terminal progression, but he is still here. I was deeply moved when he said: ‘However difficult life may seem, there is always something that someone can do and succeed at.’ I have lived my life according to that belief, which is why I am here today. We do not walk that path alone; it requires everyone’s optimism and belief in us. The Bill’s supporters argue it will apply only to a very small number of people. That intention will be far better realised if prognosis is set with a much smaller time limit of weeks or, maybe months, but not six months. 'The Bill is a law for the strong at the expense of the weak,' Baroness Campbell told the House of Lords . Outside this building, there are people sitting in wheelchairs with terminal conditions saying, ‘No, this is not about choice—this is not about me asking.’ They have often felt so low that they felt that they had no options. They could have taken advantage of this Bill, because they have a terminal illness. But people with terminal illnesses in the disability community say we should slow down and think again. We have to listen to them. Do not tell me that this is not about disabled people. It is very much about us because we are the people with experience of these issues. Many of those campaigning for this measure have not experienced these issues. They are people in control of their lives. They are people who fear becoming what they see us as.'","Baroness Campbell says the bill frightens the disabled and terminally ill .
Opposes the Bill because of the definition of terminal illness .
Defines it as ‘inevitably progressive condition which cannot be reversed .
Says it would only take a small change in her condition to be at risk .

"Police in Ireland have been accused of racism after DNA tests proved that two blond children taken from their Roma gypsy parents were rightfully theirs. Detectives were responding to public tip offs fueled by media coverage of the alleged child abduction case involving blonde-haired girl Maria and a family of Roma in Greece. In both cases, police suspected that the children, a seven-year-old girl from Dublin and two-year-old Iancu Munteau from Athlone, might be victims of abduction because they were blond haired and blue eyed unlike the rest of their immediate family. Angry: Iancu Muntean has since been returned to his parents Iancu and Loredana after he was taken from his family home in Athlone by police . Pleas: Iancu's father told police that other members of their family also had blond hair and blue eyes and that the boy was his natural son . Garda commissioner Martin Callinan has now been ordered to produce a report explaining why the two children were taken from their families. Ireland's Ombudsman for Children is also to investigate the issue. Emily Logan will be given the report . from the Garda Commissioner as well as one from the Health Service . Executive (HSE) in two weeks' time and will review the circumstances . which led to Irish police removing the children from their homes. Justice Minister Alan Shatter told lawmakers he was 'pleased and relieved' that the children had been returned to their homes. He said: 'We must all be particularly conscious of the regrettable distress that arose for the two families and their children.' Taken: The two-year-old, pictured back at home in Athlone, was kept overnight by authorities . He defended the need for police and child welfare officers to remove children from potentially dangerous homes, but cautioned that Irish authorities must ensure 'that no group or minority community is singled out for unwarranted suspicion in relation to child protection issues.' He said that he believes that police were acting 'in good faith' when they took the children and said that he is keen to ensure that lessons have been learned. But Dublin-based support group for gypsies, Pavee Point, has accused the police of racial profiling. On Monday, police went to one Roma family's home in southwest Dublin and sought the passport and birth certificate of the seven-year-old girl. The family produced them, but police opted to issue an emergency child protection order and placed the child in state care. Police said the Romanian passport was not useful because it had a baby photo, not the girl's current appearance, while the birth certificate did not match Dublin hospital records. On Tuesday, police in the midlands town of Athlone went to another Roma family's home and asked both parents to provide mouth-swab samples from their son and themselves. The boy then was taken away by social workers overnight and returned the next day after the child's parentage was confirmed. Iancu Munteau's father, also called Iancu, told reporters he had assured police that other relatives also had blond hair and blue eyes. He said his wife couldn't sleep all night and the boy's older sister cried much of the night. The Dublin family's lawyer, Waheed Mudah, issued a statement outside the Family Court accusing the police of acting without justifiable cause. Much media coverage: Eleftheria Dimopoulou with husband Christos Salis and little Maria, the Roma couple under arrest in Greece over the alleged abduction of the little girl . Mudah said his clients were 'very conscious of the fact that this case has been linked' with the Greek child-abduction case, 'which has nothing to do with them'. He said his clients hoped parents across Ireland would 'consider how they would feel if one of their children was taken away in similar circumstances for similar reasons. They hope no other family has to go through the experience they have suffered'. Pavee Point, a Dublin-based support group for Gypsies, said the police were guilty of racial profiling and child abduction. The group's co-director, Martin Collins, said he feared that more children of Roma parents who are not dark-skinned and have brown eyes could be taken away for DNA tests. He said: 'It's outrageous. It's despicable.' In a statement the Garda Siochana force defended its actions as consistent with child-protection laws. The statement added; 'We take extremely serious(ly) all reports received from members of the public concerning child welfare issues.' Interpol has still been unable to identify Maria, who was found living with a Roma couple in Farsala last week. She was found living with a couple, Elefthena Dimopoulou and Hristos Salis, who told police and prosecutors they had received the blond girl from a destitute Bulgarian woman and had brought her up with their own five children. They have been charged with abduction and document fraud, and have been jailed awaiting trial. DNA checks on Interpol's missing children's register has so far failed to find a match with Maria.","Irish police will have to produce a report into why two children were taken .

According to numerous interviews at the time, he helped Britney through her darkest hour of public meltdown, and warned that alcohol could kill her if she didn't stop. 'I told her: ""If you fall off the wagon, I don't think you will live"",' Sundahl told the National Enquirer in 2007. '""If you don't want to get sober for yourself, do it for your kids."" 'She truly wants to stop what she’s doing, and she has changed her life in another direction. She doesn’t get drunk every night and pass out.' Their relationship ended after a few months but they stayed friends. And despite moving to Afghanistan last year, where he flies dignitaries in and out of the conflict zone, Sundahl was said to have started seeing Spears again in the summer of 2014, the Daily Mirror reported. Sundahl told Britney to get sober or else she'd die, according to an interview in 2007 during her meltdown . Made a choice: Spears battled through alcoholism, which then-boyfriend Sundahl allegedly helped her with . A source close to Britney told the Daily Mirror on Friday: 'She is devastated. Britney thought he was a lovely man.' Spears, who has two sons Jayden James, eight, and Sean Preston, nine, with ex-husband Kevin Federline, has yet to issue an official comment. Sundahl's body has been expatriated to the Untied States and he was buried in a Buddhist ceremony this week in Los Angeles. His brother Karl, who also lives in LA, told the Mirror: 'It’s heartbreaking – John went there to try to repair the country.

Her spray tans and glossy, semi-permanent highlights have been ditched because of the chemicals they contain. Ahead of last week’s visit to London’s Barlby primary school, where the Duchess and artist Grayson Perry opened a new centre for her charity, The Art Room, she booked an appointment to have a vegetable dye rinsed through her hair before having it blow-dried and styled.

"A Greek court has ruled that a children's charity is to be awarded custody of a five-year-old girl who was taken from a Roma family that had been looking after her. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed 'Maria' became the focus of international media attention last year when police in Farsala arrested a couple claiming to be her parents on suspicion of child abduction.

Maria will now be raised until the age of . 18 by the charity Smile of the Child, who have been taking care of . her since she was taken away from the Roma camp. Scroll down for video . Decision: A Greek court has ruled that a children's charity is to be awarded custody of 'Maria' - a five-year-old girl who was last year taken from a Roma family that had been looking after her . Maria was discovered by Greek authorities when police raided a Roma camp on the outskirts of Farsala. They were investigating claims that weapons were being hidden in the camp illegally. A prosecutor noticed that the pale-skinned little girl bore little resemblance to the couple looking after her - with the case going on to make worldwide headlines as rumours raged that she may have been abducted from a non-Roma family. Dimopoulou and Sali insisted they were innocent, saying Maria had been given to them as a baby by a Bulgarian Roma couple who were no longer able to look after her. Greek authorities later tracked Maria's birth mother to a camp near the Bulgarian town of Nikolaevo, where Dimopoulou and Sali's account was corroborated. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed 'Maria' (centre) was taken into custody after a couple claiming to be her parents - Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40 (left), and Christos Salis, 39 (right) - were arrested on suspicion of child abduction . Despite this Maria was removed from the family and placed in the temporary care of Smile of the Child. News of the court's ruling that she will now stay with the charity until the age of 18 emerged today. According to The Independent's Nathalie Savaricas, Smile of the Child has not yet received official confirmation of the verdict, but staff say they have been informally told that the charity will now responsible for her care until adulthood. Panagiotis Pardalis, who works for Smile of the Child, told the newspaper: 'We are available to continue to provide . everything that is necessary to ensure her well-being as in every other . of the 356 child-cases we are currently handling.' Maria is joined at the charity by another 20 Roma and Greek-speaking children, and she is said to be able to speak both languages fluently now herself.

"He is the co-founder of Chrysalis Records and the man who catapulted pop band Blondie to worldwide fame, so it seems only natural that music mogul Terry Ellis’s pioneering spirit should extend to the seven-bedroom home he built in the British Virgin Islands. Shannon House on Tortola has spectacular views of the Atlantic and is surrounded by lush tropical gardens. With its lagoon-shaped swimming pool and colonial-style interiors, the £2.1 million home wouldn’t look out of place in a luxury travel brochure. Spectacular: The lavish home, which comes with a two-tier lagoon-shaped pool, offers beautiful oceean views . ‘There was nothing but jungle and volcanic rock here when I bought the land,’ says Terry, who bought the site from his close friend Chris Blackwell – founder of Island Records and mentor of Bob Marley – in 1978. ‘I had to trek through the jungle with a cutlass just to get to see it.’ Terry’s music career began when he was studying at Newcastle University. An ardent pop fan, he became social secretary for the students’ union and booked acts such as The Animals, Cream and Rod Stewart before they became household names. ‘I was looking for the full college experience,’ he explains. ‘So when I started, I said to the head of the students’ union, “I can run something, give me a job.” They said, “We need somebody to book pop groups.” ’ Even though he lacked experience, Terry proved a natural. After graduating, he juggled his day job as a computer systems analyst with managing bands in the evenings and at weekends. Hidden getaway: The remote £2.1million property is located on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands . When he started to make enough money from his music commissions, he gave up the computer job. The owner of Shannon House, Terry Ellis, catapulted Blondie (pictured) to global fame . In 1969, he formed Chrysalis Records with Chris Wright – the venture gets its title from an amalgamation of the names of the two founders. The company expanded to the US in 1975, opening an office in Los Angeles, and Terry began renting an apartment on Tortola, the largest of the British Virgin Islands. ‘I’d had a love affair with the Caribbean after holidays there,’ he says. ‘The British Virgin Islands are very special – they feel very British. I knew I wanted to settle there but couldn’t find a house I liked, so I decided to build one. 'It’s a beautiful spot with tremendous privacy. It’s set on a ridge and very high up, so the views are spectacular.’ Terry employed a ‘genius’ architect, Michael Helm, who created an Indonesian-style property with lots of open terraces to maximise the panoramic views. Helm cleverly incorporated and built around the existing volcanic rock so that the wall of one of the living rooms is a 30ft-high boulder. Halfway through the project, Terry met his future wife Daniele on a blind date in London. She had two young children, Frederic and Beatrice, from her first marriage. ‘She visited Tortola and walked around the building site making adjustments so that it suited a family – much to the chagrin of the architect who thought he was building the ultimate bachelor pad,’ he laughs. By the end of the building project, Terry and Daniele were engaged and they married on Tortola in 1980 – their wedding reception was held at the house. Price: $3.25 million (£2.1 million) Location: Tortola, British Virgin Islands . Bedrooms: Seven . Unique features: Built on a volcanic outcrop; spectacular panoramic views; lagoon-shaped two-tier swimming pool . The couple went on to have three daughters together – Amber, Kimberley and Tiffany. ‘We added bedrooms as we kept on having children,’ says Terry. ‘I don’t remember how much it all cost, but it was more than I expected.’ There are also four separate cottages on the estate. There is a large expat community in the British Virgin Islands – about half the residents are from the UK, the US, Canada and South Africa – with many people working in the financial services sector. Although there is an international school on Tortola, the Ellis children were educated in New York. Terry, now 70, tried to retire in 2000 but found he wanted to keep working. Stunning: Shannon House is set on a ridge surrounded by tropical gardens and has great views of the Atlantic Ocean . Reluctant to sell: Terry Ellis, who co-founded Chrysalis Records and made Blondie into a global star, has decided to downsize now that his children are all grown up and scattered around the world . He ran his own wine company in New York for five years and now travels the world speaking about his music career at colleges. Terry and Daniele have decided to downsize as their children are adults now and are ‘scattered around the world’. ‘The house has been such a big part of our lives so there will be tears when we sell,’ Terry says. ‘It’s a special house and it requires a special person.’ lbvisothebysrealty.com .","Terry Ellis co-founded Chrysalis Records and made Blondie into global star .

"A toddler has been caught on camera at a Texas zoo, seemingly oblivious to the desperate efforts of one of its residents to make a meal out of him. The little boy brought to the lion enclosure at El Paso zoo is a tantalizing thought for this lioness who keeps on enthusiastically tapping away at the reinforced glass that separates the two of them. Zari, as she is known, is one of four lions who live at the zoo, making it her home since 2010. Often she can be seen interacting with children. The video was posted onto the internet showing the extraordinary encounter between a big animal and the youngster. What a tease: The toddler appears to be completely unfazed by this hungry lioness. Sometimes lions and cheetah will spend several minutes playing with wildebeest calves or gazelle fawns before finally chomping them . The space between: The video shows a lioness at the zoo clawing at the glass and trying to get its jaws around a toddler's head, all while only inches from the child's face . The lioness  apparently does this with kids quite a bit; she loves children, but it's probably a good thing that the glass is very thick! The child doesn't appear to be all that bothered by the interaction between himself and the jungle beast. The lioness is persistent yet the toddler is unperturbed. At the zoo they tell customers not to feed the animals - something that this little kid would heartily agree with. Just saying hi? At zoos, lions may be provoked by children more often than adults just because they’re lower to the ground . Tasty: Lions like to bite their prey around the neck or head. Because of how most zoos are constructed—children’s heads tend to be right at the lion’s eye level . Attempting to explain why there are a number of videos of lions 'playing' with children, Craig Packer of the Lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota notes that while 'some of the lions look quite playful in their attempts … sometimes the animals will spend several minutes playing with wildebeest calves or gazelle fawns before finally chomping them.' He added that 'predators generally treat calves/fawns/babies differently from adults because they are such easy prey; there's no real chance of escape, so what's the hurry?'","Zari, a 7-year-old African lioness, was captured on camera as she pawed at the glass of her enclosure trying to reach a baby on the other side .

"A report has claimed that more than half of children in the United States qualify for free or low-cost school lunches. The study by the Southern Education Foundation found that 51 per cent of students were from low-income families in 2013. The publication analyzed National Center for Education Statistics for children who can get subsidized meals and suggests the figure has been gradually rising since the recession in 2008. Claims: The study by the Southern Education Foundation found that 51 per cent of students were from low-income families in 2013. Of the states with a majority of low-income students, 13 were located in the South, and six in the West . In 40 of the 50 states, low income students made up 40 percent of all public school children on average. Of the states with a majority of low-income students, 13 were located in the South, and six in the West. The highest concentration came in Mississippi, where 71 percent qualified, followed by New Mexico (68) and Louisiana (65). Children are qualified for free meals if their family members are already on these benefit programs or if their household income is not more than 135 percent of the poverty level - about $32,000 for a family of four . To qualify for lowered-price meals, their household income must be more than 185 percent of the poverty level or below - about $44,000 for a family. The report read: 'For the first time in recent history, a majority of the schoolchildren attending the nation’s public schools come from low income families. 'The latest data collected from the states by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), evidence that 51 percent of the students across the nation’s public schools were low income in 2013. 'The pattern was spread across the nation. Half or more of the public schoolchildren in 21 states were eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunches, a benefit available only to families living in poverty or near-poverty in 2013.1 . Table: The highest concentration came in Mississippi, where 71 percent qualified, followed by New Mexico (68) and Louisiana (65) 'In 19 other states, low income students constituted between 40 percent and 49 percent of the states’ public school enrollment. In other words, very high proportions of low income students were evident in four-fifths of the 50 states in 2013.' Despite the alarming statistics, there are ways the figure may be misleading. Upper grade children do not participate in the school programs because they don't want to eat in the cafeteria. Furthermore, the Community Eligibility Provision, enacted a couple of years ago, allows certain school districts to offer free meals to everyone without  proof of income. More than 2,000 school districts enrolling 6 million students are eligible, and the number is growing quickly. For example, every single child in the Milwaukee Public School system can get free school meals.","Study by Southern Education Foundation said 51% in 2013 were from low-income families and qualified for subsidized meals .

"The depraved, sadistic horror of the latest videos and photographs posted on the internet by Islamic State (IS) is almost impossible to contemplate. They show two men bound and blindfolded as they are manhandled to the edge of a rooftop parapet. Their only ‘crime’? To be gay. A masked IS fighter announces into a microphone that the two prisoners have ‘engaged in homosexual activities’ and must be punished in accordance with Islamic, Sharia law. In the square about 100 feet below, a large, all-male mob has gathered. Then the grisly carnival proceeds as, one by one, the men are thrown from the roof. A still shows one victim in a sitting position, mid-flight. In another, both lie on the ground motionless, presumably dead. Scroll down for video . Baying: A large all-male mob waits in the square 100 feet below the rooftop parapet where two prisoners are paraded by IS fighters . The events took place in Mosul, the third largest city in Iraq, which IS now controls. The same ‘release’ from IS on Friday shows two more victims, supposedly ‘bandits’, hanging by their wrists from rough, iron crucifixes while masked gunmen, dressed in military fatigues, brandish pistols. The next photo reveals the puffs of gunsmoke as both men are shot through the head. Then there is a video sequence which, if possible, is more shocking. A woman shrouded in a black burka is dragged across a sandy area, pulled by a white cord tied round her waist. Her voice, punctuated by terrified, breathless gasps, can be heard pleading with her captors. Then, in a grove of dusty trees, the fighters hurl large rocks at her. The final image shows her body covered by a tarpaulin. Her supposed ‘crime’ is said to have been adultery. Execution: A masked IS fighter manhandles a bound and blindfolded prisoner towards the edge of the rooftop . IS, which controls sizeable portions of Syria and Iraq, is by no means alone in its resort to execution, although few countries exact capital punishment with the same stomach-churning brutality. Yet my new book reveals that across the world, the use of capital punishment is in retreat, with the spread of human rights standards even to countries such as China. Since 1988, the number of countries which have abolished capital punishment has tripled from 35 to 100. Only 39 of the world’s 198 nations have executed anyone in the past ten years. There has also been a steep decline in the use of the death penalty in most countries that retain it. The 35 executions in the US last year were the fewest for 20 years. There have been steep falls in Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia, while China has introduced much stricter legal safeguards and rights of appeal. It is still the world’s most frequent user, but although the total of prisoners executed remains a state secret, local experts believe it has halved in less than a decade. The worrying exception, however, is the Muslim world, where many countries continue to impose the death penalty for ‘offences’ which in most jurisdictions would never be considered as crimes – such as homosexuality and adultery. Sickening: The prisoner stays in the sitting position as he plummets to what can only be his death . Here there has been a surge in the number of executions and the continuing application of the death penalty for ‘crimes’ far less serious than murder or terrorism. In fact, some Islamic scholars believe use of capital punishment in countries like Saudi Arabia goes far beyond the requirements of Koranic teaching. In Saudi, and some other states where Sharia law is embedded in the legal system, the fundamentalists are in control. The Koran says the death penalty should be reserved for the most heinous offences. Executions in Iran have roughly quintupled to just under 1,000 a year since 2005, and show no sign of diminishing, despite the election of the so-called ‘liberal’ Hassan Rouhani as president. Here the death penalty is imposed for crimes including embezzlement, burglary and robbery, as well as religious ‘crimes’ such as adultery. Grisly: Two Islamic State fighters lead the second prisoner to the rooftop edge . Homosexuality is a capital crime in Islamic countries including Iran, Northern Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan. Capital punishment can be applied for adultery in Afghanistan, Iran, Northern Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and the UAE. As an abolitionist, I find it depressing that while British soldiers died in part to defend human rights in Iraq and Afghanistan, both countries have seen big increases in the use of the death penalty. In Iraq, capital punishment was abolished in 2003, but reintroduced two years later. It now covers not only murder but crimes such as the theft of electricity. Iraq executes about 150 people a year. By the end of 2013, there were 300 prisoners on death row in Afghanistan, many convicted only on the evidence of confessions obtained under torture. There have been executions for ‘immoral behaviours’ such as infidelity, and of children. Horror: The two prisoners lie motionless on the ground, both men presumed dead . Even Muslim countries where executions had wholly or largely ceased are now seeing a new surge. Following the terrorist attack on the school in Peshawar last year, Pakistan has carried out its first for eight years. And last week, Indonesia announced it intended to execute the 64 people on its death row for drug crimes as soon as possible, and issued six immediate death warrants. The theatrical IS atrocities are monstrous, yet of course there is a context – and that is the handful of regimes where the brutal application of capital punishment is the norm, not the exception. It is all too easy for western governments to condemn IS while still maintaining relationships with countries such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and increasingly Iran. It is not consistent – and if we are serious about human rights it must be addressed.","Horrific punishment for 'homosexual activities' shown in grisly new IS clip .

Unsuspecting taxpayers with more than one income could be landed with a bill of up to £2,000 because HMRC offices are failing to share information on a central database. The people most likely to be affected are couples with two pensions, those who continue to work part-time when they retire and former armed services personnel who now have civilian jobs, but still draw an army pension. Scroll down for video . People could be hit with an extra tax bill after local HMRC offices failed to share their information on a central database . The problems have been caused by people's personal allowance - which means all earnings up to £10,000 are tax free - have been allocated more than once. Often the mistake is only found a year later, when a bill for the unpaid tax is sent. People are being warned to take a close look at their tax returns, due to be submitted by January 31, to ensure no mistake has been made - especially as up to three million people are thought to have multiple incomes. Clive Stevens, the executive chairman of accountancy practice Reeves,described the error rate as 'high'. Clive Stevens, who sits on the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, described the error rate as 'high' Mr Stevens, who also sits on the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, told The Telegraph:  'Often when people have two sources of income, two tax codes are issued by separate HMRC offices, each acting on the basis of information given to them by an employer, pension provider or the taxpayer directly. 'Clerical errors are made because the workforce, which has suffered sweeping redundancies, is demoralised and the required attention to detail and care is not there. 'In my experience, up to three out of five PAYE codes that we see in our office are incorrect when first issued. 'In the worst cases, it has taken 10 attempts to get a correct code from HMRC.' But an HMRC spokesman said more than 98 per cent of its tax codes are right, with the cast majority of people paying their tax correctly from the outset and throughout the year. The spokesman added: 'The introduction of our new computer system mean that these kinds of very old underpayment cases would not happen now. 'We introduced the National PAYE Service in July 2009 which merged 12 regional databases into one national system which means that any HMRC office can respond to our customer's enquiries. 'The idea that millions of people will get taxed is just completely wrong.'","Pensioners and former armed services personnel more likely to be hit .

"Stephen Fry has married his partner Elliott Spencer, ten days after announcing their engagement. The 57-year-old took to Twitter to share the happy news, posting a photograph of he and his stand-up comedian husband signing the civil register in Dereham, Norfolk. He accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Gosh.@ElliottGSpencer and I go into a room as two people, sign a book and leave as one. Amazing.' Scroll down for video . Stephen Fry has married partner Elliott Spencer, sharing the happy news with his 8 million followers online . Later Mr Fry shared this photograph, saying the wedding had been 'witnessed by a mini Oscar Wilde' His groom quickly retweeted the image to the joy of their millions of followers. Dressed in a grey suit with a multi-coloured tie, the actor is seen gazing lovingly at Mr Spencer, who is 30 years his junior. It is not known how many people were in attendance, though Mr Fry this evening joked their vows had been witnessed by an Oscar Wilde doll. 'Oh and @ElliottGSpencer and I had our vows witnessed by a mini Oscar Wilde. Because one should.' Wilde, who was imprisoned for gross indecency after embarking on an affair with the son of the Marquis of Queensberry in 1895, is one of Fry's most famous roles. In reference to the flowers pinned through their button holes, the actor accompanied his tweet with the message: #greencarnations. The gesture was an homage to the British writer whose 19th Century followers wore the flowers. Mr Fry and Mr Spencer are understood to have married in the Mitford Suite at Dereham Register Office in Norfolk, near to the former's country home. Public record: This is the declaration to marry posted in the Register Office in Dereham, Norfolk, shortly before Christmas . The couple are understood to have tied the knot at a register office in Dereham, Norfolk (pictured above) Hugh Laurie led congratulatory messages shared on Twitter, with Nigella Lawson and Derren Brown also sharing their good wishes . The Norfolk County Council website describes the ground floor Mitford Suite ceremony room as the 'outstanding feature' of the 1980s style building. It says: 'Decorated in a modern style, in shades of turquoise, lilac and purple, there is seating for 40 people.' Earlier in the day Mr Fry hinted at their nuptials, claiming he would be going to a 'banquet' before watching Norwich City play Cardiff City. 'Gulp! @Ronnieo147 v @nr147 this afternoon @BBCSnooker. A banquet. And then @NorwichCityFC v @CardiffCityFC - good things… #BBCSnooker.' Derren Brown was among the first to congratulate the couple once news of their wedding was shared, responding to the photograph with: 'Gor.geous xxx'. Actor Hugh Laurie added: 'Bloody hell it's happened! @ElliottGSpencer has made an honest man of m'col. Love and happiness to all!!' Upon news of their engagement, Mr Fry said he had hoped for a private wedding. Confirming their then pending nuptials on January 6, he shared on Twitter: 'Oh. It looks as though a certain cat is out of a certain bag. 'I'm very very happy of course but had hoped for a private wedding. Fat chance!' 'Thank you all SO much for your kind congratulations. Deeply touched xxx'. Mr Spencer added: 'Thank you for all the lovely messages :) x x x'. Two days later he wrote: 'Feeling slightly frazzled but very happy. May possibly hide behind the sofa...' Asked the date of the wedding, Mr Fry said: 'Now, we won't be giving that away. And I'm sorry to say you won't be invited. It will be some time this year, as you have to give a year's notice.' Upon news of their engagement, Mr Spencer's parents said they were 'over the moon' to welcome the television star into their family. Mr Spencer's father Robert, who at 57 is the same age as his new son-in-law, said he and his wife Melanie, 52, are 'over the moon'. 'We are obviously very happy. We are over the moon, that is all I want to say.' Overjoyed: The couple debuted matching engagement rings in London just over a week ago . The couple previously showed off matching Rhodium engagement rings after announcing their plan to marry . They were seen leaving Mr Fry's London home earlier this month in his Bentley after announcing their engagement . The following day the pair were seen at Cwmbran Magistrates Court in South Wales where Spencer was banned from driving . The following day Mr Spencer was banned from driving after travelling at 101mph in his partner's Aston Martin. The pair were on their way to a literary festival when the actor reportedly told his then fiance to 'put your foot down'. Mr Spencer was accompanied by the 57-year-old at Cwmbran Magistrates' Court in South Wales just 24 hours after announcing their engagement. The previous day he was seen crashing Mr Fry's Bentley in London. Mr Fry campaigned in the past for gay marriage to be made legal, slamming its critics by saying there were 260 species of animals which suggested homosexual tendencies. 'At least 260 species of animal have been noted exhibiting homosexual behaviour but only one species of animal ever, so far as we know, has exhibited homophobic behaviour — and that’s the human being,' he said in the video for Out4Marriage. 'So ask which is really natural.' In the same year he admitted to trying to kill himself following the break-up of his previous relationship. Mr Fry, who suffers from bipolar disorder, revealed that in 2012 he tried to commit suicide with a cocktail of vodka and pills, and was only saved by a producer who discovered him. Friends have credited Mr Spencer with putting a smile back on the actor's face following a crippling battle with depression. One friend said: 'We've got the old Stephen back. He has found new hope in Elliott and they thrive off each other.' The star spent 14 years with former make-up and vitamin salesman Daniel Cohen before they split in 2010. Previously he has spoken of his struggle with depression and loneliness. In 2013 he said: 'Loneliness is the most terrible and contradictory of my problems. I hate having only myself to come home to.' 'It's not that I want a sexual partner, a long-term partner, someone to share a bed and a snuggle on the sofa with – although perhaps I do and in the past I have had and it has been joyful. Mr Spencer's parents previously told of their joy over the couple's engagement, saying they were 'over the moon' their son was to marry the QI star . Mr Spencer, who is 30 years his husband's junior, has been credited with helping him in his battle with depression . Mr Spencer is said to have 'brought the old Stephen back'.  The couple are pictured with actress Emma Thompson earlier this year . The comedian previously posted photographs with his 'heroes' Jimmy Carr and David Mitchell . 'But the fact is I value my privacy too. It's a lose-lose matter.' Last year he also spoke openly about his battle with drugs and claimed he took cocaine at Buckingham Palace. Opening up about a 15-year addiction to the Class A drug, the comedian details dozens of respected institutions where he says he took it. The list included the House of Lords, the House of Commons and BBC Television Centre. In his latest autobiography, More Fool Me, published in September, Fry wrote: 'I take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly, to the owners, managers or representatives of the noble and ignoble premises and to the hundreds of private homes, offices, car dashboards, tables, mantelpieces and available polished surfaces that could so easily have been added to this list of shame'. Following on from 2010's The Fry Chronicles, which touched on his drug use in its closing pages, his new book sees the presenter speak in detail about the habit that cost him hundreds of thousands of pounds. It also reveals his brushes with the law and how he narrowly escaped drug charges after being stopped by police while in possession of cocaine. This third instalment of his autobiography follows Fry through the 1980s and 90s after he had found fame through shows such as A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster. He recalls the 'momentous night' in 1986 when he first took cocaine with an unnamed actor friend and admits that he never saw himself as an addict as his dependency spiralled out of control.'

"Police have launched a murder investigation after a 35-year-old father of two was stabbed near a restaurant in Northampton. Jon Casey was stabbed close to the Lazeez restaurant on Barrack Road in Northampton at 5.30pm on Friday. Mr Casey collapsed at the scene and was raced to Northampton General Hospital where he was declared dead less than an hour later. Jon Casey, 35, was stabbed to death near the Lazeez restaurant in Northampton, pictured, on Friday night . Police said that Mr Casey had suffered stab injuries although his body has been transferred to Leicester, where a Home Office pathologist will complete a post mortem examination to determine the exact cause of death. Detective Inspector Mark Brayfield of Northamptonshire Police said that detectives were following a number of lines of inquiry. Officers have been searching the area around the crime scene looking for the murder weapon. Several drains have been inspected, with roadside grilles lifted to see if the killer stashed the knife nearby. DI Brayfield said: 'This was a brutal and ultimately fatal attack and we would urge anyone in the area at the time and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward. 'We are very keen to know of Mr Casey’s movements in the hours leading up to his death.' It is understood that the killer ran off after stabbing Mr Casey, leaving him for dead on the side of the street. A woman passerby who was taking her seven-year-old son to a martial arts class said she saw Mr Casey lying on the floor and called for an ambulance. Mr Casey was rushed to Northampton General Hospital, pictured, where he died shortly afterwards . She raced over to him and attempted to cover his wounds until paramedics arrived.

"Greek police today admitted there was no evidence linking suspected jihadis arrested yesterday to a foiled plot to attack police in Belgium. A police source said earlier the men, detained separately in Athens, 1,500 miles from Brussels, included an individual who at first sight matched the description of a key terror suspect in Belgium. But after careful vetting of ID information in Brussels, Belgian officials said there was no match with anyone they were looking for and said 'they had nothing to do with the Belgian case'. Not captured: One of the suspects arrested in Athens was thought to 'match the description' of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, pictured, 27, the man Belgian authorities believe was the mastermind behind a suspected plot . Police officers investigate the scene of the raid after killing two members of a Belgian terror cell in Verviers . This image of blood splattered across the inside of a house in Verviers, Belgium shows the aftermath of the police raid which averted a potential 'second Paris' attack . Suspects: Two jihadis killed in an anti-terror raid in Verviers, Belgium, are believed to be Redouane Hagaoui (left), also known as Abu Khalid Al Maghribi, and Tarik Jadaoun (right), who has the alias Abu Hamza Belgiki . Greek police arrested a man today which 'matches the description' of ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 27 . Belgian police said counter-terrorist units prevented a jihadist plot on Thursday evening, killing two gunmen and wounding another in a shootout in Verviers, in eastern Belgium. One of the suspects arrested in Athens had been thought to 'match the description' of Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 27, the man Belgian authorities believe was the mastermind behind the suspected plot. Greek police sent photos, fingerprints and DNA material to Belgium and were waiting to see whether the person is Abaaoud, a police official told Associated Press. It came after Belgian media reported that investigators were still hunting for one suspect - a Belgian with Moroccan roots - who had gone to fight with ISIS in Syria and was thought to be in Greece. Troops were deployed across Belgium today to guard potential targets. Uniformed soldiers could be seen outside Jewish schools and government buildings. It was the first time in 30 years that authorities used troops to reinforce police, and they said the number of troops could double until a review of situation next week. Defence officials said the nation's security threat level would remain raised at three - the second highest level - for at least week. Federal prosecutor Eric Van der Sypt, who coordinated a series of raids on 12 alleged terrorist hideouts across Belgium, told Mail Online: 'Their plan was to launch attacks similar to that in London when a soldier was killed. They wanted to kill policeman on the street .' The radical Islamic group also wanted to film the horrific murder and then circulate the footage online, bringing the brutality of ISIS to the West, police sources said. Guns, munitions and explosives, as well as police uniforms and a large amount of money, were all seized by police during the operation. The group was reportedly equipped with Belgian police uniforms, four Kalashnikov machine guns, handguns and explosives. Another part of their twisted plot included taking a number of hostages by seizing a bus, it was reported by Belgium's RTL broadcaster. Police charged five people on Friday with 'participating in the activities of a terrorist group'.

A third suspect was also arrested after Belgian special forces stormed the apartment in Verviers . Europe is on high alert after Islamist gunmen killed 17 people in Paris. More than 20 people have been arrested in Belgium, France and Germany. No link has been established between the terrorist plot in Belgium and last week's attacks in Paris which killed 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a policewoman and four hostages at a kosher supermarket. Belgium has seen a particularly large number of people join extremists in Syria, and is 'the worst affected country in Europe relative to population size', said Peter Neumann of the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. He estimates 450 people have left Belgium to fight with Islamic radical groups in Syria, and that 150 have returned home. Belgian has long been viewed as a hub for jihadists going to Syria. A high-profile court case is currently going on in Antwerp in which 43 men and three women alleged to be members of Sharia4Belgium, a group linked with IS. Thirty-seven are still believed to be in Syria, including two of the three women, and are being tried in absentia. Charges range from terrorism to kidnapping and murder. Mehdi Nemmouche, a 29-year-old alleged French jihadist is currently awaiting trial in Brussels for shooting dead four people at the city's Jewish Museum after returning to Europe from Syria last year. Belgium, which has long been home to a large Muslim population, is believed to have the highest proportion of citizens who have left to fight in the Middle East, after Britain. Estimates put the number of Belgian citizens who have travelled to the Syrian region - so-called 'foreign fighters' - at up to 400. According to Europol, Belgium was one of a number of EU countries that defused terrorist plots last year. Dutch media reported in October that Belgian police had averted a planned terrorist attack on the European Commission's Berlaymont building in Brussels. Elsewhere today, two French citizens have been arrested by authorities in Yemen on suspicion of being members of Al-Qaeda, the country's national security chief said. General Ali Hassan al-Ahmadi said the pair were held on charges of belonging to the militant group. He did not mention whether they were involved in this month's attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Speaking to reporters in the capital, Sanaa, he said that al Qaida has around 1,000 members in Yemen, from 11 different Arab and non-Arab countries.","Four suspected jihadists detained by Greek police over Belgian terror plot .

"Seconds from crashing: Sir Paul and wife Nancy . The pilot of a helicopter carrying Sir Paul McCartney and his wife Nancy missed two urgent warnings that he was seconds from crashing. The aircraft then avoided hitting treetops near the couple’s East Sussex home by just 2ft, according to an investigation into the incident. The pilot, who had become ‘spatially disorientated’, dramatically swung the chartered Sikorsky S-76C to safety with seconds to spare. His co-pilot was so convinced they were going to crash that he ‘momentarily’ lost the ability to speak during the drama. Sir Paul, 72, and his 53-year-old wife, Nancy Shevell, were returning from London after they had attended the launch of a vegetarian cookbook written by Sir Paul’s eldest daughter Mary in May 2012, as revealed at the time by The Mail on Sunday. In treacherous weather, the pilot was attempting a night landing on a helipad encircled by woodland. A full investigation carried out by the Department of Transport’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found that neither pilot heard two audio warnings. The first said ‘LOW TERRAIN’, meaning they were 30 seconds from either the ground or an obstacle, in this case the treetops. The second message, ‘WARNING TERRAIN’, was issued when they were 20 seconds away. Both alerts also flashed on the controls. But despite the ‘warnings that the helicopter was approaching the ground, the flight crew were not aware of these warnings’, said the AAIB report, which also revealed the terror in the cockpit before the second of two aborted landings. As they approached the helipad, the pilot ‘switched the landing lights on, but the glare from the falling rain in front of the helicopter prompted him to switch them off again’. The co-pilot later recalled telling the pilot that, at this point, they were below the ‘safety altitude without sufficient visual references’. They pressed on ‘even though he believed that the commander’s actions were flawed’. Eventually the pilot decided it was unsafe to land and tried another approach. Scroll down for video . The pilot of a helicopter, attempting a landing in treacherous weather, missed two urgent warnings. Pictured, an Air Harrods helicopter . The report said: ‘The co-pilot, who was monitoring the instruments, saw that the helicopter was descending and began to speak to highlight this to the commander.’ Seconds later he saw the altimeter ‘winding down towards zero extremely quickly’ and then found himself ‘momentarily unable to continue speaking, expecting the helicopter to crash’. But the pilot, ‘recognising that the helicopter was approaching the treetops, began an aggressive go-around, flaring the helicopter and increasing power’. The pilot eventually landed safely after diverting to Lydd Airport in Kent, 15 miles from the McCartney home near Rye. The £5 million nine-seater helicopter was chartered from Air Harrods, which charges about £3,000 an hour and describes itself as the ‘leading London- based business aviation service provider’. Tony Blair is a client. A spokesman for the firm said last night that it co-operated fully with the investigation. Sir Paul’s spokesman declined to comment.

"Angry motorists abused police officers and paramedics as they battled to save the life of a man who jumped from a multi-storey car park. Officers closed the NCP car park on St Jude's Passage, in Birmingham City Centre after they received reports of a man acting suspiciously. Members of the public became concerned after spotting the man sitting on the ledge of the car park and called the police. Emergency services were abused by angry motorists who wanted to access this Birmingham car park as they battled to save the life of a man who had fallen from the structure shortly after 4.15pm today . Police immediately prevented anyone else from entering the building, which is only a short distance from the Bull Ring shopping centre, while a specialist team of negotiators raced to the scene. Unfortunately, the man, who is believed to be in his 40s, fell from the building. As police and paramedics battled to save the man's life, they were abused by motorists who wanted to retrieve their cars from the car park. West Midlands police confirmed that the man died in hospital shortly after the incident. Officers alerted the West Midlands Police Professional Standards Department who will investigate the handling of the case because officers were at the scene when he fell. Inspector Mat Minton, from Birmingham Police, said: 'As officers battled to save the man's life, police community support officers who were stopping people entering the area were met with abuse from drivers angry at being unable to return to their cars.

"In an effort to help a group of pups, one British photographer has turned away from the sad animal cruelty commercials featuring Sarah McLachlan and turned toward something a bit more positive. Stuart Holroyd, 34, takes elaborate portraits of abused, abandoned shelter dogs in an effort to raise money for their temporary home and ultimately land them a permanent one. Holroyd, a seasoned photographer, places the dogs in stunning settings from one pup in a Christmas setting standing in front of a fireplace to a shaggy dog looking upward as a fluorescent butterfly hovers above his nose. Costa: Here, is a blind pup named Costa photographed next to a pile of luggage in front of a bright moon . Barley: A dog named Barley sits in front of a fireplace in a Christmas setting (Barley has been adopted) The effort is called The Bay Tree Project. Holroyd, from the U.K. now living in Cyprus, is publishing the 10 images in a book and displaying them in an exhibition in February with all proceeds going to the Bay Tree Boarding Kennels, an animal rescue shelter in Larnaca run by his friend Kayte Wilson-Smith, according to the project's Facebook page. Wilson-Smith houses between 60 and 70 dogs at one time on her own pension and small donations, according to The Chive. Winston: A black pooch named Winston stands in a field with a man appearing to be riding on his back (Winston has been adopted) Fergus: A three-legged dog named Fergus stands majestically in the middle of a street with his tongue out . With electricity and food donated to her by the locals, Wilson-Smith keeps the dogs in the small rescue center and helps them get adopted to other countries -- as animal cruelty in the Cyprus is rising, according to Chive. 'I saw my friend Kayte struggling and I wanted to do something different for her and try to get the problem noticed but in a more positive way,' Holroyd told Media Drum World. 'The shelter needs refurbishment so these animals can really have halfway house before their forever home.' Molly: Here, a dog named Molly stands near the edge of a cliff as a fluorescent butterfly hovers above her nose (Molly has been adopted) Ozzy: A dog names Ozzy sits in the grass in front of planes, wearing a military-style hat (Ozzy has been adopted) So far, the puppy pics have raised the shelter 3,207 euros (that's 3,707 USD), according to the Bay Tree Project. The page indicates that the monetary goal is 5,000 euros. 'This was only supposed to be a very small project but it has turned out to be bigger than we could imagine,' Holroyd told Bored Panda. The project's Facebook page indicates that six of the 10 photographed dogs have been adopted as of Thursday.

"It is a grim outlook for the fate of Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran as six people convicted of drug offences were executed by firing squad in Indonesia under its new hard-line president. President Joko Widodo ordered his first round of executions in the early hours of Sunday, with four men and six women dying. One woman, Rani Andriani, was from Indonesia while the rest hailed from Brazil, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Malawi and Nigeria. Scroll down for video . Wife of convicted drug smuggler Namaona Denis pictured here just before his execution on January 18 . Dewo Retno Atik leaves the maximum security presion Nusa Kambangan in Cilacap in Central Java . Vietnamese woman Tran Thi Bich Hanh was executed in Boyolali district in central Java, while Andriani, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Dutchman Ang Kiem Soei, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo and Malawi's Namaona Denis were put to death on Nusa Kambangan Island. The island is home to a high-security prison located off the south coast of the archipelago's main island of Java. All of the executed were caught attempting to smuggle drugs, except for Soei who was found guilty of operating a huge ecstasy-producing factory. The executions of those who were handed their sentences between 2000 and 2001 were carried out just after midnight on Sunday, the ABC reported Indonesian attorney-general's office spokesman Tony Spontana as saying. Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, are expected to be executed this year, but the former is waiting to hear back from the court about whether or not he has been granted clemency. Brazilian national  Marco Moreira (right in 2004 in his holding cell) along with Dutch citizen Ang Kiem Soei (left in 2003) were both executed on Sunday morning, just after midnight . Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan (right) and Myuran Sukumaran (left) are scheduled for execution in 2015 . The latter had his appeal rejected last month, 9News reported. In a last-ditch effort to save his client from meeting the same fate as those executed on Sunday, Sukumaran's Indonesia lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis told News Corp he would be submitting a request to Denpasar District Court for a case review next week. This review, which is called a PK in the south-east Asian country, is usually granted when new evidence emerges. Both Chan and Sukumaran have had previous PKs rejected before. But it is not known if an appeal for a second review will even be allowed as there is no legislation surrounding the issue as of yet in Indonesia.

Police officers and security personnel stand guard as a ferry carrying ambulances sets off for Nusa Kambangan island where the executions of the five of six drug convicts were carried out . An ambulance carrying the coffin containing the body of drug convict Malawian national Namaona Denis leaves from Nusa Kambangan island . Mr Lubis said the law had been applied wrongly to the last review, which was denied by the Supreme Court. The lawyer will argue Sukumaran, who has served 10 years in prison, is now reformed and has helped fellow prisoners also rehabilitate by setting up in-house jail programs. 'If the purpose of any sentence is rehabilitation... those who have made a significant change in their life should be given relief. It doesn’t mean that he has to be freed because he has also admitted that he is guilty of a narcotic crime, Mr Lubis told News Corp. 'However, there are many forms of punishment. A life sentence or 20 years prison term or 25 years prison term. There are many forms of other punishment. I just want to ensure that the perspective of justice should be at the forefront.' The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle 8.2kg heroin into Australia . Kerobokan prison in Denpasar is where Chan and Sukumaran are being held in Indonesia . If the pair - who were caught trying to smuggle in 8.2kg of heroin from Indonesia to Australia in 2005 - are to be executed, Sunday would have given them a grim preview of what was to come for them. Before the six convicted drug offenders faced the firing squad, made of 12 police officers, they were isolated in cells and were allowed last visits from family members and religious figures in the lead up to their deaths. They were lined up and donned aprons that had reflectors attached on them over their hearts. The six were shot dead all at the same time on Sunday. Their executions have attracted widespread criticism from world leaders, including from Amnesty International, calling for Mr Widodo to scrap the death penalty. The organisation's research director for south-east Asia and the Pacific, Rupert Abbott, called the executions 'a seriously regressive move'. Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) has faced criticism over his first round of executions as leader . A spokesman for Denpasar District Court displays a clemency presidential decree for Myuran Sukumaran . 'The new administration has taken office on the back of promises to make human rights a priority, but the execution of six people flies in the face of these commitments,' Mr Abbott said in a statement. 'This is a country that just a few years ago had taken positive steps to move away from the death penalty, but the authorities are now steering the country in the opposite direction. 'The government must immediately halt plans to put more people to death.' Mr Abbott urged Indonesia to 'impose a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its eventual abolition'. While the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called the plan 'deeply regrettable'. News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf.","Six drug offenders were executed on Sunday by firing squad in Indonesia .

"Passengers in driverless cars will need to be ready to take the wheel in a crisis, it has been reported. With the first trials of computer-controlled cars set to get underway, the Government has started drafting rules that will require those inside the vehicles to remain alert and fit to drive at all times. A person sitting in the drivers seat will also still be required to wear a seatbelt and be responsible for speeding fines or penalties incurred, the Sunday Times reported. Companies are due to start testing driverless cars in the UK. Bristol, Greenwich in south east London and Coventry and Milton Keynes (illustrated) will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months . Graham Parkhurst, the head of one of the four official pilot projects, told the newspaper that they will be examining how long a driver can stay alert if they had nothing to do. 'It is like the laws in the infancy of motoring when a man had to walk in front of a motor vehicle waving a red flag,' he told the Sunday Times. Ministers have previously admitted that the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves. Milton Keynes and Coventry will share the UK Autodrive programme (pictured), which involves Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, universities and engineering consultancies. They will test self driving cars on real roads as well as light weight self driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in Milton Keynes . Bristol, Greenwich in south east London and Coventry and Milton Keynes will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting this year. It is hoped that testing driverless cars in a real-world environment will help lead to greater levels of understanding of the vehicles and will allow the public to imagine how the cars could fit into everyday life. Coventry and Milton Keynes: Engineers involved in the Autodrive Programme will develop infrastructure to best work with autonomous cars navigating real roads. Driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of Milton Keynes. Greenwich: The Gateway project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking. Bristol: The insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the Venturer consortium. The programme will also look at how cars cope with the city's challenging terrain and how they are received by the public. Milton Keynes and Coventry will share the UK Autodrive programme, which involves Ford, Jaguar Land Rover as well as a number of universities and engineering consultancies. They will test self-driving cars on real roads as well as lightweight self-driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in Milton Keynes. One of the focuses of the trial will be developing infrastructure to best interact with the cars. The scheme involves General Motors, the AA and RAC. Finally, experts in Bristol will investigate the insurance implications of driverless vehicles and study the public’s response to the technology. The Venturer consortium programme ‘aims to deepen understanding of the impact on road users and wider society and open up new opportunities for our economy and society,’ Innovate UK said. The hilly city’s challenging terrain will also allow engineers to see how the cars cope with busy, winding roads. In Greenwich, the Gateway project will test automated electric shuttle vehicles (pictured), plus robotic valet parking for driverless cars. The scheme involves General Motors, the AA and RAC . It is hoped that the data collected will be used to successfully introduce driverless cars in cities and towns across the UK to reduce congestion, improve air quality and use roads more efficiently and safely. The chancellor announced an extra £9 million in funding for the new technology, adding to £10 million already promised in the summer. The aim is to establish the UK as the global hub for the research, development and integration of driverless vehicles and associated technologies.","Government has started drafting rules for those in driverless cars in the UK .

"Within moments of Prince George's latest photos appearing online, the tills at Cath Kidston were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the 16-month-old's £32 tank top. But as demand skyrocketed, the sailboat-emblazoned top soon sold out - leaving a crowd of frustrated mothers in its wake and gleeful fashion brand executives rushing through a fresh batch. Now, the knitted tank tops have begun to appear on eBay but will cost would-be purchasers far more than they did in the shops. Scroll down for video . Selling well: The sold-out Cath Kidston top has begun to appear on eBay for double the original price . Adorable: George wore the knitted tank top for his latest photos, which were released late on Saturday night . The most recent listing, which trumpets the top as being 'Worn By Prince George, has a starting bid of £25 but the sale is still three days away from finishing. Another has attracted bids amounting to £55, while another, a larger version aimed at boys aged three to four, is currently listed at £35. This is not the first time the Prince George effect has struck at a brand's bottom line. Although just 16-months-old, nearly everything the toddler wears sells out. Indeed, within 48 hours of being carried from the Lindo Wing in a receiving blanket by Aden + Anais, the £44.95 wrap had sold out, while traffic to the brand's website shot up by 1,960 per cent. And so it has continued, with French brand Petit Bateau benefiting when George wore its £27.50 striped sailcloth dungarees for his first birthday photo, and children's designer Rachel Riley enjoying a cash boost from his appearances during the Royal Tour Down Under. Riley, who was almost unheard of until Prince George wore her sailboat smocked dungarees for a 'crawl-about' in New Zealand, credits the George effect with transforming her business. Gorgeous: The new photos of Prince George were released ahead of the Christmas holiday . Lucrative: The £32 Cath Kidston top has now sold out but is to be reissued by the label . 'He is such a high profile baby and he’s brought lots of attention and excitement to the brand,' the London-based designer said in an interview with Forbes magazine. 'It’s been phenomenal for the business to have Prince George wearing pieces from the collection. Personally, as a British citizen, if there’s one child I’d want to dress it’s the heir to the throne. I’m absolutely thrilled.' Others to benefit include little known Belgian label, Les Petit Abeilles whose white romper suit emblazoned with sailboats was worn as George arrived in Australia, and Spain's Neck & Neck whose website crashed after the baby royal was photographed in its pinstriped dungarees during a day out at the polo. 'Prince George wore the sailboat romper by Les Petites Abeilles on two occasions, at the Dukes arrival in New Zealand (with a white cardigan) and in Australia,' remembers Les Petit Abeilles founder, Désirée von Hohenlohe. Cute: George sparked a sales boom at Rachel Riley after being photographed in this sailboat romper suit . First hit: The George Effect came into being 48 hours after he was born when his white blanket sold out . 'It was a great surprise and honour to see it worn by Prince George. We had a significant increase in sales afterwards and people emailed us from all over the world to order the romper.' And it isn't just Les Petit Abeilles sales figures that have felt the Prince George effect. As Ms von Hohenlohe explains, the increased scrutiny has resulted in a makeover for the business itself., . 'We had the idea of developing our business by launching a web shop,' she explains. 'With all the publicity we received, we had to speed up setting the shop up. 'It also motivates us for our future projects. Now there are big expectations and people are following what we are doing. 'A fashion magazine even contacted us to photo shoot of our autumn/winter collection; this has been very encouraging for us.' Most of all though, Ms von Hohenlohe says she is thrilled by the simple fact that the Duchess of Cambridge liked her work enough to buy it for her baby son. Popular: So popular did this pair of Petit Bateau dungarees prove, they sold out in blue and red . Good look: George's wardrobe for Australia and New Zealand proved more popular than his mother's . 'We are of course thrilled with such an honour and we have great admiration for the royals,' she beams. 'The fact that they liked our sailboat romper means a lot to us, regardless of whether the current sailboat romper frenzy continue or not. 'We will always remember the moment we saw the little Prince wearing our romper, and the excitement we felt. We feel great about the fact that Les Petites Abeilles can dress little boys all over the world like little Princes.' And dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog, What Prince George Wore, dedicated to all things baby style. The blog even has a sister site in the shape of What Kate Wore - a website devoted to the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe - although Prince William is yet to find similar favour with the fashion set. But while the Duchess of Cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears, even she cannot compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power. From £44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops, the George effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and eBay entrepreneurs contemplating another decade of buoyant sales to come.","Prince George appears in a £32 Cath Kidston top in his latest photos .

"Two teenage boys have been jailed for the murder of a young father after their gang gatecrashed a birthday party. Ayomindy Bile, 15, and Jesse Quaye, 18, were convicted of brutally stabbing 20-year-old Connor Barrett after a four-week trial in November. The father-of-one was stabbed in the chest and back at a party in a family home in Hemsby, Norfolk in May last year. Ayomindy Bile, 15, (pictured left) and Jesse Quaye, 18, (right) were jailed for 15 years each for the murder of Connor Barrett . He was attacked after a large group of uninvited guests, including Bile and Quaye, turned up and began to cause trouble. Norwich Crown Court heard Bile, who can be named after an anonymity order was lifted, pulled out a knife. He and Quaye then attacked Mr Barrett and stabbed him in the back after he confronted them about punching his friend. The court heard that Bile then bragged to his friends how he had 'hooked him' as his victim's young brother watched him die. Father-of-one Connor was stabbed in the chest and back at a party last year . It also emerged the 15-year-old was on bail at the time for possession of a kitchen knife in a public place after being arrested two weeks earlier. He also has two previous convictions for street robberies dating from when he was 13. Quaye, of Cobholm, Norfolk, and Bile, of Great Yarmouth, were jailed for 15 years each on Friday after being found guilty of murder. Judge Stephen Holt said: 'Connor was a much loved young man who was the life and soul of most parties. He preferred talking to violence. 'The whole atmosphere changed when you two turned up to a party with a group of friends. 'Before the violence kicked of Bile produced a flick knife. When asked why you were carrying a flick knife your response was ""if anyone f***s with me they'll get it in there"". 'Connor approached and he was unarmed. He was surrounded by you and your gang. 'One of the wounds on his back would have required severe force - according to the pathologist it splintered bone. 'We will never know who inflicted that fatal wound. Bile then bragged 'I hooked him'. 'Connor's family were at that party and his younger brother watched his life slip away.' The judge added: 'This is a truly tragic case and there are no winners. 'A decent and loving young man has had his life taken leaving his family and friends distraught and young son's life devastated. 'The one message that must go out is that is if young men don't carry knives they are not going to be able to pull them out and use them . 'If they do, they may use them with tragic results. This message has to be got across to young people.' Tributes were left at the scene of the murder after the father-of-one was stabbed in Hemsby, Norfolk . Mr Barrett was attacked after a large group of uninvited guests, including Bile and Quaye, turned up at the party and began to cause trouble . The teenagers were also found guilty of actual bodily harm to Ricky Halliday, the party-goer Mr Barrett was trying to defend. Bile pleaded guilty and Quaye was found guilty of possessing offensive weapons. A third defendant, Anthony McLean, 41, also from Great Yarmouth, was found guilty of assisting Quaye to evade justice. A court heard he drove the teen to London in the hours after the attack. He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. Anthony McLean, 41, from Great Yarmouth, was found guilty of assisting Quaye to evade justice . Amjad Malik, prosecuting, said Mr Barrett had been DJing at the 21st birthday party when Bile and Quaye arrived having heard about it on social media. When a fight broke out, Mr Barrett intervened in an attempt to protect his friend Mr Halliday and tried to talk to the defendants. But instead he was brutally stabbed multiple times before the cowardly teenagers fled. Paul Keleher, mitigating for Quaye, said he had a troubled upbringing and a 'misguided view' that he needed a knife for self-defence. After the case, the victim's family said they had suffered 'immeasurable sadness' since his death. They said: 'Connor was a considerate, kind, caring and loving great grandson, grandson, son, brother, nephew and cousin. He was also a dedicated and devoted father to his own son. 'His life has been cruelly stolen from him and his family, when he was coming into the prime of his life just a month away from his 21st birthday. 'The past eight months, we have suffered immeasurable sadness - there are no words which can describe the pain and grief we feel. 'We have taken no pleasure from hearing the guilty verdict, or the sentence given today. 'We accept the sentence but in no way feel that justice will be served, as no length of time will ever help us come to terms with what we have lost. 'We are relieved this horrific part of our lives is over and will go home today to begin to grieve for Connor and learn to come to terms with the life sentence that we were given on 11 May. We will never be given parole. 'Our thanks go to all that have helped the family and to convict the accused.'

The 47-year-old said: 'I'm really excited. It's strange knowing you are going to become a father. It gives me a sense of peace. It completely changes your relationship with the world. 'I've wanted to do this for such a long time I thought if I don't do it now I'll probably be too old.' Mr Massow, who plans to succeed Boris Johnson as London Mayor in 2016, added: 'I know the situation is odd. But I thought 'go for it'.' The baby will be brought up predominantly by the two women, who are in their 30s and live in Croydon, South London. Mr Massow lives in a large Georgian townhouse in Bloomsbury, Central London, which has a separate flat that the two women and their child can use.

"Police have been accused of acting 'above the law' after the case against a chief constable over the fatal shooting of an unarmed man collapsed because his force demanded evidence be kept secret. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, was due to stand trial on Monday accused of Health and Safety breaches in the operation that lead to the death of a 36-year-old man. Father-of-two Anthony Grainger died of a single gunshot wound to the chest after the car he was in was stopped in Culcheth, Cheshire, on March 3 2012. Killed: Father-of-two Anthony Grainger (pictured) died of a single gunshot wound to the chest after the car he was in was stopped in Culcheth, Cheshire, on March 3 2012 . Swoop: Police believed they had intelligence Mr Grainger and two others were part of an organised crime unit and were planning an armed robbery on a Sainsbury's store in the village. Above, the car he was in . Police believed they had intelligence Mr Grainger and two others were part of an organised crime unit and were planning an armed robbery on a Sainsbury's store in the village. It was later discovered that he was unarmed and there were no weapons in the car. The three men with Mr Grainger were later acquitted of charges of conspiracy to rob. The Crown Prosecution Service decided the marksman should not face charges for murder or manslaughter because a jury would be likely to accept that he believed his actions were necessary. Instead, Sir Peter, who had pleaded not guilty, had been charged under the Health and Safety at Work Act. But the prosecution abandoned its case after deciding some evidence collected by police was so sensitive it would not be in the public interest to be heard in open court. The evidence is thought to relate to the role of paid police informants and decisions made during the extensive covert surveillance operation that led to Mr Grainger's death. Charged: Sir PeterFahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, had been charged under the Health and Safety at Work Act in relation to the police operation that led to Mr Grainger's death . The judge, Mr Justice William Davis, had also granted anonymity to some 30 police officers who were witnesses or would be mentioned in the case. But lawyers for Sir Peter, who was prosecuted as head of the force, argued he could not get a fair trail if certain evidence was not made public in court. Mr Justice Davis ordered that the evidence should be given if the defendant was to get a fair trial - at which point the prosecution, after consulting with the police, decided not to proceed. Mr Grainger's family said they were 'hugely disappointed' at the outcome and 'simply want answers'. And their solicitor, Jonathan Bridge, warned it could set 'a really dangerous precedent where the police are in effect above the law in cases where there is sensitive evidence,' The Times reported. He added that the family would approach the Home Office next week about the future conduct of the case and may seek a public enquiry. The prosecution argued that during the covert operation, the Greater Manchester Police made '26 failings' arising out of armed police officers being deployed without any proper intelligence basis. It also argued and the use of armed police was unnecessary or premature. The decision by William Boyce, QC, to abandon the case at Liverpool Crown Court effectively ends all criminal proceedings over the death of Mr Grainger. The CPS said: 'We have considered the rulings made by the judge that there is material which needs to be disclosed in open court in order for the defendant to have a fair trial. 'After consulting with relevant parties, we have concluded that we are unable to reveal that material for public interest reasons. We are therefore unable to proceed.' Mr Grainger is believed to be the first person to die in a police shooting since Mark Duggan in London, whose death sparked rioting in the capital and other cities across the country.","Anthony Grainger fatally shot by police in 2012 after covert surveillance .

"An Iranian newspaper has been shut down after the country's authorities accused its front page headline of 'supporting' the Charlie Hebdo magazine. The article's headline quoted Hollywood actor, George Clooney, saying: 'I am Charlie Hebdo.' But the accompanying article did not actually express support for Clooney's statement, nor for the magazine itself. The editor of Mardom-e-Emrooz - or Today's People - confirmed his paper was ordered to close for publishing the story. Clooney was one of many actors to arrive at the Golden Globe awards to wear 'Je Suis Charlie' pins. 'Today was an extraordinary day,' he said during an acceptance speech for his lifetime achievement award - in reference to the solidarity marches in Paris. 'There were millions of people that marched — not just in Paris but around the world. They were Christians and Jews and Muslims... And they didn’t march in protest — they marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear. Je suis Charlie.' Shut down: Mardom-e-Emrooz (pictured) featured Hollywood actor George Clooney on its front page with the words 'I am Charlie Hebdo' above him . Je Suis Charlie: George Clooney (left) was one of many actors to wear 'I am Charlie' pins on the red carpet of the Golden Globe awards . Iran has condemned the satirical French magazine's insistence on publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad is 'provocative' and an insult to Islam. But the country also denounced the deadly assault on its office, and the subsequent terror attacks in Paris - in which 17 innocent people were killed. Elsewhere in the Muslim world, Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani also criticised Charlie Hebdo's 'survivor' edition, describing it as a 'blasphemous and irresponsible' act. In a statement issued by the presidential palace, he said: 'Freedom of expression should be used in a way to boost understanding between the religions. 'Afghanistan has suffered many years of war and violence, more than any other country, and it is necessary to understand and promote peaceful coexistence among all the people of the world.' Iraq's Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, also issued a statement of condemnation against the Paris attacks by saying terrorism 'has nothing to do with Islam in any way'. But he too warned against the publication of 'blasphemous' images, saying: 'offensive words might lead to further bloodshed.' Bloody protests have already erupted around the world as furious Muslims react to Charlie Hebdo's 'survivor' edition - again featuring the holy Prophet Muhammad on its front cover. A photographer was shot in Pakistan as 200 angry protesters took to the streets in the city of Kuratchi - while equally violent demonstrations broke out in Peshawar and Lahore.

Meanwhile, the Niger government confirmed four people were killed as the police clashed with protesters who attacked a French cultural centre and set churches ablaze. Police fired tear gas to suppress the crowds in the city of Zinder, where angry Muslims burned French flags and attacked Christian shops with clubs and Molotov cocktails. Three civilians died - including two who were shot by police during an attack on their station - Niger's Interior Minister, Hassoumi Massaoudou, said on state televison. The fourth person to be killed was a police officer who was run over, while 45 other people sustained injuries. Clashes also broke out in the Jordanian capital of Amman, between security forces and about 2,000 protesters organised by the Muslim Brotherhood - the country's largest opposition group. Riot police used batons to disperse the people as they tried to march towards the French Embassy.

In 2011 he went on an official Government trip to Africa and also worked as an adviser to Chancellor George Osborne. In a statement to the Sunday Mirror, the married father-of-three said: ‘I absolutely deny the allegations made about me. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’ It was reported last night that the girl is 13. A City of London Police spokesman said: ‘Detectives arrested a 56-year-old man on January 5, 2015, on suspicion of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, sexual activity with a child, meeting a child following sexual grooming and rape of a girl under the age of consent.’ Richard made his fortune in the 1990s, buying and selling software firms in his native California, before moving to Britain in 2001. Richard was one of the original Dragons, but left the BBC show in 2005 after failing to make any investments in the second series. He remains the only Dragon not to invest throughout a series. Later he said he needed  to attend to his businesses, with filming for the BBC show taking up too much time. In 2008 he served was chairman of the Tories' Small Business Task Force, advising George Osborne and David Cameron. He then founded School for Start Ups which describes itself as creating 'education programs events and online support for budding entrepreneurs', and works in partnership with leading UK Universities, the Royal Institution and the British Library. In 2008 Richard was chairman of the Tories' Small Business Task Force, advising George Osborne and David Cameron. He is pictured with the Chancellor . The businessman appeared in two series of the BBC show Dragons' Den before launching a company to help start-ups . The company has made visits to business schools and universities across the country, and offers loans of up to £25,000 to would-be aspiring entrepreneurs. In a recent interview with the Guardian, the Californian spoke of how British people were 'polite to a fault', and criticised programmes such as The Apprentice as creating a false image of the business world. 'Unfortunately, I think it [the Apprentice] represents all the worst in business. It’s not the way I run my company. It’s not the way I treat my staff. 'It’s not the way I expect an entrepreneur to act,' he told the newspaper. In 2006, married father Richard received an honorary Queen's Award for Enterprise Promotion for his work in promoting, developing and helping fellow entrepreneurs. He was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Business from Plymouth University in 2013 and in November it was announced that he was to be the next chancellor of Teeside University - a role he was due to start early this year. Announcing his appointment, outgoing chancellor Lord Sawyer of Darlington said: 'I am sure that Doug Richard will be an outstanding chancellor. 'He is influential and well known as an active business leader and successful entrepreneur.' A Downing Street spokesman declined to comment.

"A Towie fan who ran away to Syria with her son and escaped from the clutches of ISIS has told of her terrifying ordeal as she ran a mile through the desert before crossing the border to Turkey. Tareena Shakil from Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire, entered Syria last year after telling relatives she was going on holiday to Spain with her 16-month-old son Zaheem. But after becoming disillusioned with the fanatical regime, the 25-year-old claims she made a dangerous trip to the Turkish border - clutching Zaheem as she climbed over barbed wire to safety. Today her father, Mohammed, has spoken of a tearful phone call he received from his daughter during which she described her shock at the 'hell' of living under ISIS - and her bid for freedom. Tareena Shakil, pictured left with her 16-month-old son, Zaheem, fled to Syria with her child in November last year. The 25-year-old has told of her terrifying ordeal as she ran through the desert to escape ISIS control . Shakil, who fled to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in November last year, is now being held by Turkish authorities. It is understood she will be returned to the UK. Speaking to the Sun, Mohammed, 47, said that his daughter told him how ISIS had lied to her to convince her to go over to Syria. But once there, she was shocked by the full horror of the regime. She said: 'There were bombs going off everywhere. I never felt safe. I was monitored by chiefs all the time. Women are treated like cattle, herded around and not allowed anywhere without a man.' Shakil, a former Morrisons worker, said that when ISIS chiefs tried to force her to get married she realised she had to escape with her son. It was has been previously claimed the young mother fled after being attacked by a would-be suitor. The 25-year-old previously told a family friend that she broke into a house and stole her passport before tricking a taxi driver into driving her from Raqqa to the Turkish border. She claims she then ran a mile through harsh desert terrain before climbing over a barbed wire fence - cutting her hands to shreds - as she tried to avoid snipers. In November the former Morrisons worker posted this selfie with her son from her home in an ISIS stronghold of the pair of them smiling. She claims she tricked a taxi driver into driver her to the Turkish border . She told her father: 'I thought the guards were going to shoot me there and then. But I didn't care if I lived or died. 'I just held on to Zaheem and thought ""I have got to get over the barbed wire"". When I got to the other side, I just couldn't believe I was safe'. Shakil now wants to make sure others know the truth about ISIS, Mohammed said, to ensure others don't 'fall into their trap'. After arriving in Raqqa last year, Shakil posted fanatical messages and sent selfies to family in Britain, telling relatives she and her young son would never return. After fleeing her British home in November last year, Shakil entered Syria through the Turkish border. She has since returned to the country after 'begging guards not to shoot her' as she climbed a barbed wire fence . The residential street where Shakil lived in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. Her father has today described a tearful phone call from his daughter in which she claimed to have run a mile through the desert to escape . West Midlands Police confirmed the young mother was being held by Turkish authorities who are working alongside British forces. Still considered a missing person and it is understood Shakil will be returned to the UK. 'We are aware a missing British woman travelling from Syria has been detained by Turkish authorities for immigration matters,' a spokesman for West Midlands Police told MailOnline. 'Police are working with the Turkish authorities to ensure her safe return the UK.' Her reported escape from Raqqa comes just two months after she posted a selfie with her son from her home inside the ISIS stronghold. A family friend of Shakil told the Sun's Dan Sales: 'The border guards didn't fire for some reason - maybe because she was carrying her son. Her hands were hurt and her feet cut to ribbons climbing the fence.' Previously her father Mohammed, 42, said she sent him the picture to show they had arrived but she has since cut off all contact. He has told of how his daughter was a school prefect and Girl Guide and was so fascinated with the ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex, that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars. Her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria in October. Mr Shakil said his daughter did a psychology degree and got married, although she later divorced. Shakil is believed to have fled to this refugee camp in Gaziantep, Turkey. She is now being held by authorities and it is understood she will be returned to the UK . He said he believes she was vulnerable after the break-up of her marriage to Zaheem's father Sam - who has flown to Turkey and hopes to bring his son home. Around six months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages, including images of Islamist fighters and the ISIS black flag, and calling herself a 'slave to Allah'. After fleeing, Shakil told her family how she was in Raqqa and could never return to the UK. In one message she wrote: 'I can't come back there now … we can't. Tell her don't cry. Read the Koran, I love you mummy!' And of her journey, she said: 'So many people died coming. They got shot at the border. But we made it. We ran across the border in the blazing sun.' Mohammed told the Sun he knew his daughter would realise her mistake once she arrived in Syria and said he would now fly to Turkey with her British birth certificate in attempt to have her freed. Around six months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages . One of the images posted by Tareena on the social media page which has since been removed . Friends say that she wanted to flee from the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa because the group were going to force her to marry a jihadi. Her father claims she now wants to reveal the truth about the terror group . Despite posting extremist material online, Shakil is still being considered a person of interest by the authorities and may not face criminal charges. Social services have not been involved by British forces with regard to her young son's care. 'All decisions on returnees from Syria or Iraq are taken on a case-by-case basis,' a spokesman for the Home Office said. 'Some of these people may have been exposed to traumatic experiences and others may be radicalised or vulnerable to radicalisation. 'For some, prosecution for terrorist offences is the right course of action. 'For others, it may be that support from, for example, mental health or social services, is more appropriate.'","Tareena Shakil fled to Syria with her toddler son in November 2014 .

"Boxer Amir Khan was forced to ask the Prime Minister for a favour after being denied a visa to the U.S. on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The British Muslim had his visa application denied by 'edgy immigration guys' as he went to board a flight to Las Vegas to commentate on a fight last September. Luckily Khan, who is well-known in America, is on good terms with David Cameron and was able to put a call in asking him to pull some diplomatic strings. Scroll down for video . Muslim boxer Amir Khan called in a favour from the Prime Minister after being denied a U.S. visa on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks . Cheers Dave: The champion boxer rang up David Cameron who was able to pull some strings and ensure he could make it to America to commentate on a fight . In an interview with The Times, the 28-year-old boxing champion spoke of the moment he was turned away at the gate as he tried to fly out to watch a fight between world champion Floyd Mayweather and Marcos Maidana. Khan said: 'I was flying out on September 11. I think the immigration guys get edgy. They just told me my visa was refused and I couldn't get on the plane. 'David Cameron takes my calls. He's a good friend. He came and opened this community centre for me. I rang him and said I had a bit of a problem. 'He said, ""Hold on a minute,"" then he called me back and it was sorted. 'I also met Hillary Clinton in Washington and she asked me if I'd had problems, took my name and I haven't had a problem since. It's good to have those connections. I am grateful for what boxing has given me.' Speaking of the effect Islamic extremism has had on the lives of ordinary British Muslims, Khan criticised Ukip leader Nigel Farage for blaming the Paris attacks on the country's 'gross policy of multiculturalism'. The boxer said: 'What Nigel Farage said makes me angry. I was born here, went to school here, my mates are here. 'I've won a world title with the Union Jack proudly displayed on my shorts. I've won an Olympic medal with my heart full of pride. I am more British even than Farage and a lot of white people. I try and show it through action.' Khan, pictured in a fight with Devon Alexander, said he was 'grateful' for the connections boxing gave him . The Muslim boxer recently visited the Pakistani school where 148 were slaughtered by terrorists . Khan, who won the silver medal at the Athens Olympics in 2004 aged just 17, also spoke about the effect Islamic extremism has had on the lives of British Muslims, including his own. He said: 'I'm getting pulled over in my car more, and at immigration. I think you have to see it as necessary. In the end they are keeping the country safe.' The boxer recently made a trip to the Pakistani school where 148 people were killed in a terrorist massacre and donated the £30,000 shorts he wore in his welterweight title win. 'I've cancelled trips to Pakistan before on other people's advice. It can be a dangerous place,' he said. 'But I've got a daughter myself now. I went because I wanted to tell those kids that they need to overcome fear and get back to school. That's how you make something of your life. You can't let terrorists win.'","Amir Khan had to ask the PM for a favour after he was denied a U.S. visa .

"Yesterday, in a McDonald’s in Switzerland, I saw people paying nearly £8 for a Big Mac and fries. For anyone unfamiliar with their prices, that’s more than double the cost of the same meal in the UK: £3.88. The ten-minute taxi ride to get from my hotel – £123 for B&B in a chain establishment – to the fast food restaurant was £25. Like thousands of British holidaymakers here for a skiing break, the crippling prices mean that for every second I’m here, my bank balance is falling as fast as the snow around me. Switzerland always was pricey. But last week, for complex reasons, the government’s bankers unhinged their Swiss franc from the euro. Instantly, the franc took off like a hot air balloon. Now it’s the only point of conversation. One young Spanish couple spoke with amazement at paying the equivalent of £68.70 for two posh burgers and beers. British dental surgeon Alyn Morgan was sipping a £15 Margarita cocktail in a ski bar in Verbier in the early hours of yesterday morning. Three days earlier, it would have cost £12. Scroll down for video . Steep: the price of ski rentals and chocolate in Switzerland shot up overnight . ‘I was crying on Thursday, the day we came on holiday,’ he said. ‘Our trip was costing at one stage 30 per cent more. When news broke about the franc, I was watching this weekend’s trip getting more expensive by the minute.’ Mr Morgan, 43, and his wife Emma travelled from their home in London for an annual January skiing break with five friends. The group had just spent £700 on a sushi meal at the Nevai Hotel that would have cost £579 before the central bank’s intervention. TOURISM is now in real peril. Exports will cost more. The decision to stop pegging the franc to the euro will cause economic difficulties in Switzerland. So why on earth did these safety-first, boring Swiss bankers decide to break away and cause such convulsions to the currency markets last week? The answer is that, however bad it might be for the Swiss, it’s a nightmare for the euro. And it is precisely because of the euro’s perilous weakness that these seismic events are happening. In many ways the situation here is a mirror image of what happened with Britain’s ERM fiasco in 1992, when we stopped locking the pound to a basket of European currencies. The Swiss have spent the past three years trying desperately to stop a tide of money pouring into the country, mostly from investors desperate to avoid or ditch the euro: the influx was causing the franc to inflate and make their famous exports – chocolates, watches, pharmaceuticals – too expensive, especially for the Euro market that accounts for half of Switzerland’s trade. They even began charging negative interest in their world famous banks – effectively upending the basic rule of banking by forcing depositors to pay – but still the cash flowed in. Finally, last week, rumours swept the money markets that the European Central Bank was about to print more money – so-called quantitative easing – to bail it out of its latest crisis; this time, brought on by concerns Greece will tumble out of the eurozone after an election later this month. The pressures between the strong franc and weak euro became intolerable, and the Swiss threw in the towel. The cap had to be lifted, and the franc instantly jumped 39 per cent against the floundering euro – the biggest single-day move for a rich nation’s currency in four decades. It ended the day ‘just’ 17 per cent up in a market that considers a two per cent move dramatic. The shocking rises in Switzerland spell disaster from Europe's single currency . This unleashed what the boss of Swatch rightly called a ‘tsunami for the export industry, and for tourism and finally for the entire country’. With the instantly increased price of exports, came fears of job losses. But while many Swiss shares slumped, the bigger problem is faced by the euro. It has lost a key pillar of support and, as one London analyst said so rightly last week, ‘can’t find a friend for love nor money’. Even now, after such a long time and damaging episode, the eurozone and its pathetic panjandrums have not resolved the internal contradictions of a costly experiment that has caused economic carnage around the Continent. Now even Germany, the Continent’s economic powerhouse, is struggling to bear the cost of this flawed attempt to align diverse economies without resolving core structural issues. The timing of the Swiss shock could not have been worse (or perhaps more delicious) – on the eve of this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, when business leaders and global dignitaries (and Prince Andrew) gather in the glitzy alpine town to debate the state of the world. The central bank’s announcement was called ‘a bit of a surprise’ by Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who had not been given advance warning. This is diplomatic speak for ‘what the hell?’ or worse – especially since three days earlier the bank’s vice-chairman had insisted the exchange rate cap remained the cornerstone of fiscal policy. And in the ski resorts yesterday, it was British holidaymakers left utterly dismayed as equipment rental and guiding costs rose 20 per cent overnight. A week’s ski pass for a family of four in Verbier shot up from £863 to £1,030. A beer on their first night cost £4.50 but two nights later was £5.40. Shopkeepers across Switzerland are desperately trying to calculate the damage. ‘Everyone was very startled by events,’ said Niklaus Wilhelm, manager of a upmarket cigar shop in Zurich. ‘We have to see what happens but it is just too expensive for people to come on holiday to Switzerland now.’ Wilhelm said some 40 per cent of his sales came from European customers. At the start of last week he was selling cigars costing €8 in Germany for the equivalent of €11; now they are €15. Meanwhile, a German border town was flooded with Swiss people stocking up on cheaper clothes, electronics and food. Happily, in the rest of Europe, there is good news for us Britons: the euro has slumped against sterling to the most attractive rate since July 2008. And even here in Switzerland, there was one party of holidaying Britons left content amid the crisis last week. Lawrence Jones, owner of an internet hosting business, was in Verbier with friends when they went to withdraw cash from an ATM. As they did so, they realised the rate had not been changed, so kept pulling out more and more money until the machine was empty. ‘Sometimes the Swiss aren’t quite as organised as some may believe,’ he said happily. There are always winners alongside losers in these situations. But this was just small change for a nation that has already blown so much money trying to insulate itself from the crushing euro catastrophe.","Swiss government banker's unhinged their franc from euro last week .

"The former Tory Party candidate accused of having an affair with a married headmaster was seen yesterday for the first time since the story broke. Keely Huxtable, 33, was reported to have been ‘found naked’ during school hours with Richard Tattersfield by his wife Janet. Ms Huxtable was dubbed a ‘Cameron Cutie’ when she stood for election in 2010 as one of a dozen Conservative young female hopefuls. Headmaster Richard Tattersfield, left, was found in a compromising position with 'Cameron Cutie' Keely Huxtable, right, who was said to be 'found naked' during school hours by Mr Tattersfield's wife Janet . But wearing a duffel coat outside the Birmingham house she used to share with husband Timothy, she looked far from her normal glamorous self. Her husband has now moved out, while Mr Tattersfield, 45, is believed to have moved in. Mrs Huxtable’s political hopes were dashed when she narrowly failed to capture the Northfield constituency she contested five years ago. Last week she resigned as chairman of governors of Dame Elizabeth Cadbury Technology College in Bournville – where Mr Tattersfield is head – after the affair became public. Mrs Huxtable branded the claims as ‘rubbish’ and said she was the victim of a ‘witch hunt’. The married head has now been suspended after his wife allegedly caught him sprinting from his bedroom in his boxer shorts with the naked Mrs Huxtable, who is the school's chair of governors, in his bed. But Ms Huxtable - labelled a 'Cameron Cutie' after she became the youngest woman to be selected to stand for the Tories in the 2010 General Election -  branded the claims 'rubbish'. She said the couple were fully clothed and 'working'. She said: 'The school had been found to be weak around humanities and maths and we had to re-write the school's management plan, that's what we were doing.' She added: 'She [Mrs Tattersfield] was there for five minutes, it is a load of rubbish.' The alleged affair came to light after Mrs Tattersfield claimed she found the pair together in early December last year. Mrs Huxtable's husband only found out about the incident when Mrs Tattersfield telephoned him to say that she had caught the pair in bed together  and that the affair had been going on since January last year. Mrs Huxtable, pictured, had previously said her relationship with Mr Tattersfield 'was never about sex' He said his wife only admitted she had been sleeping with Mr Tattersfield after he confronted her in December. He later discovered the pair had gone for a two-day luxury break at a hotel-spa over Valentine’s Day, claiming it was a ‘school conference’. The couple say it is a 'witch-hunt' and they were working on 'strategic leadership planning' when confronted by Mr Tattersfield's wife, Jan. Mrs Huxtable says that their relationship has 'never been about sex' and they became close because of a 'passion' for education. The headteacher was suspended on December 15 after Birmingham City Council launched an investigation into 'serious allegations'. Married Mrs Huxtable, 33, resigned the following day as chairwoman of the governing body at the state school. Mrs Huxtable said: 'We only started a relationship properly after November, it's never been about sex. 'It's about two people with a shared massive passion for something [education] that have just got closer together.' Probe: The headteacher is  suspended from duties at Dame Elizabeth Cadbury Technology College in Birmingham and Mrs Huxtable has resigned as chair of the governing body at the state school . Mrs Huxtable is not being investigated but it is understood  her relationship with the headteacher forms a significant part of the council probe. It is understood the council investigation also relates to the management of resources and finances at the school. Sources claim the investigation includes an allegation the couple were found by the head's wife at a house he was renting after they separated. It is claimed he was in his boxer shorts, while his chairwoman of governors was naked in bed. The school was informed of the allegations the same day and the headmaster was suspended the following Monday. Mrs Huxtable quit her role as chair of the school governors the following day. A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: 'On the basis of the seriousness of the allegations made, the head teacher was suspended in December, pending an investigation which is currently under way. The chair of governors also resigned in December.' It is understood the school has received allegations that the headteacher had used the Cotteridge property to meet Mrs Huxtable on a number of Friday afternoons in November and December, during school hours.","Keely Huxtable was believed to be 'found naked' during school hours .

"A straight A student was kicked out of classes after she dyed her hair green to look like singer Avril Lavigne. Ellie Douglas is facing weeks of being taught in isolation at Halewood Academy in Liverpool. The 15-year-old had her hair coloured over the Christmas break in tribute to her pop idol. But on the first day back at school, she was taken aside and told she had 24 hours to remove the dye and restore her natural hair colour or she would be put in isolation. Ellie Douglas, pictured with her father Mark, is facing weeks of being taught in isolation at Halewood Academy in Liverpool after dying her hair over the Christmas holiday . She spent three days in an isolation cubicle and was escorted to lessons by a teacher before her father Mark removed her from school. Ellie says she had showed her headteacher a picture of the colour she wanted before having it done, and he said it would be fine - although she would have to wear her hair up. Her mother, who lives in Doncaster, paid for her to have the colour done as a Christmas present. Father Mark Douglas took her to a hairdresser earlier this week but they were told Ellie would have to wait to re-dye it because to do it so soon would damage her hair. He said that despite having the colour toned down with a colour wash, the school still insisted Ellie remain in isolation. The 15-year-old dyed her hair to look like her pop idol Avril Lavigne, pictured, and she says she even showed the colour she wanted to the headteacher, who approved it . The earliest she can go back to the hairdresser in Doncaster where she had it done is January 31. Ellie claimed one teacher told her that red and purple were 'normal' colours, but that her shade was unacceptable. The student, who is also facing having her prefect badge taken from her, said: 'It's wrong that people are allowed purple and red hair when I can't have blue. 'It's really stressful. Even though it's a Christmas present I've compromised. 'I'm quite angry and upset that the school won't compromise with me.' Ellie is predicted to get all As and A-stars in her GCSEs and has ambitions to be a geneticist. But she has missed mock exams for two of her favourite subjects, Chemistry and Physics, because of being out of school. Mr Douglas says he plans to raise a formal complaint. He said: 'She's a prefect and an A-star student. She's never once been in trouble in any school she's been in. 'I just think it's so wrong.'

"Annabelle Fuller was questioned under caution last week amid claims the former Ukip aide falsely accused a Tory MP of groping her . Nigel Farage faced embarrassment last night as it emerged that Scotland Yard formally questioned his alleged ‘ex-mistress’ over claims that she fabricated a sexual assault case against a Tory MP. Detectives quizzed Annabelle Fuller under caution last week following suggestions that she falsely accused Andrew Bridgen of touching her inappropriately. Officers are understood to be close to concluding their investigation. It is the latest development in an astonishing saga which started in June 2011 when Mr Bridgen, 50, was arrested after Ms Fuller said he had groped her on the balcony of his Westminster flat. The charges were dropped shortly afterwards when Ms Fuller, a former aide to the Ukip leader, withdrew her allegations. The MP for North West Leicestershire says the case wrecked his marriage and he now has limited contact with his children. Detectives have gained access to Ms Fuller’s phone records to check her account of events with people she spoke to that night. The 33-year-old was described as Farage’s ‘former mistress’ under parliamentary privilege last year in Strasbourg by former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire. Both Mr Farage and Ms Fuller strongly deny an affair, and Ms Fuller has since stopped working for the party. She claimed that the 2011 incident arose after she met Mr Bridgen at a Westminster pub with a civil servant, and all three went to the MP’s flat after midnight to discuss military charities. he ran from the property in the early hours, grabbing Mr Bridgen’s BlackBerry and Commons pass as evidence. A security guard called police, and Ms Fuller told them Mr Bridgen reached up her skirt and touched her bottom and leg. Despite the charges being dropped, Mr Bridgen and his wife Jackie soon divorced. Scotland Yard’s investigation into Ms Fuller was launched after claims by Jasna Badzak, a former Ukip official who says she exchanged messages with Ms Fuller following the incident, and that Ms Fuller boasted of seeing messages from David Cameron on Mr Bridgen’s BlackBerry. Last month, Ms Badzak was sent a police ‘Prevention of Harassment’ letter for talking to The Mail on Sunday, on the grounds that it led to Ms Fuller being ‘subjected to numerous phone calls and emails’. Andrew Bridgen said the ordeal ruined his marriage and family life. He is pictured with his former wife Jackie Bridgen in 2010, a year before he was accused of sexually assaulting Ms Fuller . The Ukip leader has strongly denied ever having an affair with the former aide. She no longer works for the party . The police action prompted Tory MP Zac Goldsmith to write to London Mayor Boris Johnson urging him to investigate whether officers were abusing their position by trying to stop a newspaper investigation of Ukip. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A 33-year-old woman attended a Central London police station on Wednesday 14th January, where she was interviewed under caution. Inquiries are ongoing.’ Ukip said: ‘This case is being investigated and it would be inappropriate to comment further.’ Ms Fuller declined to comment. Mr Bridgen said that it would be ‘inappropriate to comment’. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Annabelle Fuller was questioned under caution by police last week .

"An inquest has been opened into the death of a talented horse rider who tragically died after being kicked by a horse she had raised since birth. Mary Hancy, 55, was grooming one of her horses in a yard last Sunday when it kicked out at her and left her with head and abdomen injuries. An air ambulance rushed her to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge after the accident but doctors could not save her life. Mary Hancy pictured as she competes in an equestrian event on a horse called Rocky. She died last Sunday after another one of her horses kicked out at her, leaving her with head and abdomen injuries . An inquest has now been opened into the death of Mrs Hancy. Here she is pictured with her husband Steve . She had worked for Howard Rose at the Crows Hall Hannoverian Stud in Norwich, Norfolk, and competed in equestrian events all her life. Her daughter Kelly Hancy, 24, said her mum had worked with horses since the age of 13 and was in the 'wrong place at the wrong time'. She said: 'She has left a massive gap that can never be replaced. If I can do half as good a job as she did then I will be pleased. Mrs Hancy (pictured) died after the horse she was grooming became spooked and kicked out at her. Her daughter Kelly said her mother was in the 'wrong place at the wrong time' 'She was amazing really. She was so strong could do anything she wanted to with horses. I would always go to her for advice. 'I would always be on the yard with mum and I think it was her favourite place. She was like my best friend. 'We were just clipping at the time and it was the last horse that she had bred. She was very proud of him. He was only five years-old and he was a bit spooked by something and kicked out and caught her. 'It was just a case of the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know what is going to happen to the horse now.' Mrs Hancy, who lived in Ashill, Norfolk, would frequently groom her daughter's horse in preparation for competitions. She also worked as a lorry driver for family haulage business R Hancy and Sons that she ran with her husband Steve, 59. But her real passion was horses and her close friend Howard Rose said the whole of the horsing community was in 'shock'. He said: 'She was an exceptional horsewoman and worked for me since she was 13 years old. 'Mary was one of those people that if someone was in trouble she would be sure to help.

"A little boy with a form of mutism who struggles to express himself has been 'taught' to show his emotions - by his pet cat. Lorcan Dillon, 7, suffers from an anxiety condition that leaves him virtually unable to communicate with teachers and classmates at school. He also find it difficult to express love and affection towards his family. But he turned a corner after his mother Jayne brought a cream Birman called Jessi-cat into their home in Davyhulme, Greater Manchester. Best of friends: Lorcan with Jessi-Cat . The pair have become inseparable over the past two years and Lorcan is now able to say 'I love you' for the first time. Lorcan's mother Jayne Dillon, 44, a former hospital midwife said: 'Jessi-Cat has made a huge difference to Lorcan's life. 'We've had her for a couple of years and in the last year alone he seems to be making excellent progress at school. 'In the past two weeks he's started communicating with people he doesn't know very well and even reads to one of the teachers now - something he's never done before. 'The bond between Lorcan and Jessi-Cat is so touching as he's able to show physical affection to her which he doesn't like doing with people - even me. She's such a delightful, responsive cat and he hugs and kisses her all the time.' Jayne said the bond between her son and cat was 'so touching' Playtime: Jessi-Cat is a finalist for the Cats Protection's National Awards 2012 for helping Lorcan . She added: 'The reason why we have got Jessi-Cat is because pets and cats in particular I think are very good with children with special needs or autism or anything like that, and it's a way for Lorcan to communicate. 'Lorcan does speak at home with his family, but still finds it hard to show his emotions to them - he can't say ""I love you"" to his mum. 'He does speak normally at home - he doesn't have selective mutism with us at all in the house. 'But he doesn't express his emotions - he would not say 'I love you mummy' or anything like that but with the cat he can cuddle her and stroke her and talk to her and he does say 'I love you Jessi-Cat' which is really nice. 'It is a way for him to express his emotions that otherwise he wouldn't be able to do.' Seven-year-old Lorcan Dillon sufferers from Selective Mutism - a condition that means he finds it difficult to communicate with people, leaving him feeling lonely and affecting his confidence. It is said to affect around one in 1,000 children. Jayne added: 'Lorcan was diagnosed when he started nursery school at three and a half. The staff were concerned that he wouldn't speak to any of the adults and most of the children. 'Lorcan can find it very hard to express himself yet he can be himself around Jessi-Cat and finds it very easy to talk to her. 'She is always interested in what he's doing and that unconditional love she has for him has been a huge boost to his confidence. Jessi-Cat shows unconditional love for Lorcan . Jayne said her son and cat were rarely apart . 'Lorcan is able to connect love to Jessi-Cat, something he can't do with people and she's been a great support to him when things have been really hard. 'She is without a doubt the best friend a boy could have and has made a huge positive impact in his life.' The pair are rarely apart and this year both Lorcan and the Cream Birman have been shortlisted in the Best Friends category in the Cats Protection National Cat Awards 2012. Jessi-Cat is down to the last three in the Best Friends category and if she wins she'll be in with a chance of scooping the prestigious title of National Cat of the Year. Kate Bunting, the Awards organiser at Cats Protection, says that Jessi-Cat's story was an inspiring one. She said: 'We had entries from across the length and breadth of the country and it was a tough job to narrow them down. 'Each and every entry we received told a tale about why cats have such a special place in people's hearts - sometimes heart-rending, sometimes funny and often quite amazing! 'We think all cats are special, but Jessi-Cat especially deserved a place in the final for showing what an incredible impact cats have on the lives of people of all ages.'",Lorcan suffers from an anxiety disorder known as selective mutism .
"A police force is building up a huge stockpile of Tasers which cost £150,000 in the last nine months alone - despite using the controversial weapon just once in eight years. Campaigners have condemned the spend by the Military of Defence police, which has had to cut millions of pounds from its budget and sack 800 officers - a quarter of the workforce - since 2010. Figures seen by MailOnline reveal the force, which guards military bases around Britain, spent £361,185 on 363 Tasers since the weapons were introduced in 2007. Charge: Ministry of Defence police have spend £360,000 on Tasers, including £150,000 since April alone - despite using the controversial 50,000-volt stun guns just once in the last eight years (photo posed by model) Weapon: The force has almost 400 of these X26 Tasers, which it says are a safer alternative to guns . Some 217 of those, almost two thirds of the entire stock, were bought since April 2013 after police inspectors said they should become commonplace. Yet they have been drawn from their holsters no more than 13 times. A Taser was discharged on a suspect just once, during an incident in 2011 which was not within the force's normal remit. Seven Tasers were aimed using a ‘red dot’ laser sight, and the remaining five were drawn but not aimed. Not a single Taser was drawn from its holster in 2013. Those figures could now fall even further after Home Secretary Theresa May called for the use of Tasers to be reviewed amid claims they are used too much on vulnerable people. A report found 30 per cent of people Tasered in London in 2011 had mental health issues - and half were from ethnic minorities. Mrs May told a summit in October: 'Imagine what it is like for the thousands of people with mental health problems, learning disabilities or other vulnerabilities who regularly encounter the police... people who are confused, distressed and disorientated. Crackdown: Home Secretary Theresa May called for the use of Tasers to be reviewed amid claims they are used too much on vulnerable people. She told a summit in October the experience must be 'terrifying' Killed: Andrew Pimlott, 32, burned to death after a Taser was fired despite him dousing himself in petrol . 'And then imagine if that encounter also leads to physical restraint, or even being Tasered by the police. 'Imagine being transported to hospital not in an ambulance, but in the back of a police car. Or being detained in a police cell rather than a health-based place of safety or mental health ward. 'That encounter must be terrifying.' The X26-series weapons currently cost £1,050 each and are made by the U.S. firm Taser International in a 100,000 sq ft complex in Scottsdale, Arizona. On patrol: Armed Ministry of Defence police on guard in Whitehall, central London (file photo) They are already common in U.S. police forces and the firm, whose motto is ‘Protect Life. Protect Truth’, claims they have ‘transformed law enforcement and become a vital tool’. But despite bringing down injury rates in U.S. states where they are used instead of guns, the weapons have been at the centre of several scandals. A British father died of severe burns after police Tasered him - despite the fact he had doused himself in petrol. Andrew Pimlott, 32, was set on fire by the 50,000-volt charge outside his Plymouth home where he had threatened to take his own life. The Independent Police Complaints Commission immediately launched an investigation into the 2013 incident and has since handed a file to prosecutors. The Ministry of Defence police force has around 2,600 officers, the vast majority of whom are armed, guarding more than 50 strategic sites across the UK including army, navy and RAF bases. Officers also guard the MoD offices in Whitehall, the 35-acre Royal Mint headquarters in Llantrisant, south Wales, the Aldermaston Nuclear Weapons Research facility in Berkshire and nuclear submarine bases on the River Clyde. Responding to today's figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, the MoD insisted Tasers were needed as a non-lethal alternative to guns. But the costs were slammed by campaigners and Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker. Mr Coaker told MailOnline: 'It seems strange that despite Tasers being used just a handful of times since 2007, the Ministry of Defence has ordered 217 in the last 18 months. 'Why does the MoD Police need increased Taser capability, given how little it is used and the fact that officers already armed? Facility: Among the sites guarded by the MoD's force is the Royal Mint headquarters in Llantrisant (pictured) Stun: The Tasers' manufacturers insist they have saved lives where they are used instead of bullets . 'Over 90 per cent of the Defence Police carry firearms as part of their duties, enabling officers to protect themselves as well as the assets and personnel they are guarding. 'Is this just another example of chaotic defence procurement that has seen millions of pounds wasted under this Government? British taxpayers will want to know the answer.' Campaigning lawyer Sophie Khan, who brought a landmark High Court case in 2013 accusing the Metropolitan Police’s Taser roll-out of being unlawful, said: ‘There is a concern about why they have bought so many, where obviously there’s not a need for them. ‘The MoD police are facing financial issues and the money obviously could have been spent in other areas - training, equipment or safety. ‘Given the Home Secretary’s speech in October, the likelihood is there’s going to be a decrease in the coming years because she’s very concerned about them. ‘It’s going to be a lot of wasted money if the Home Secretary comes back after the review and says “we only need one Taser for X number of officers”.’ Opposition: Campaigning layer Sophie Khan (left) said there was 'obviously not a need for them'. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker (right) suggested it could be more 'chaotic defence procurement' Amnesty International UK Arms Control Director Oliver Sprague added: 'Tasers are potentially lethal weapons and we’ve always said they should only be used when there’s a clear threat to life or of serious injury, and only as a last resort by high-trained law-enforcement officers. 'What’s baffling here is why the MOD police are spending vast amounts of money on a weapon for which there seems to be so little need. 'We’re already worried by the way our police authorities seem to think that more and more weaponry is the solution to every policing problem. 'We only want to see the police and the MOD purchasing Tasers if there’s a clearly demonstrated security and policing need.' The Ministry of Defence said the increase in Taser numbers was recommended by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. 'HM Inspector of Constabulary did a routine police firearms inspection in 2013 and recommended that all front-line officers (forward facing or public facing eg on the steps of Main Building) be trained to use Tasers, as a “less lethal” option to the use of firearms,' a spokesman said. 'It is mandatory in the police world for firearms officers to have a range of other options to deploy, to reduce the potential for recourse to conventional weapons. 'Currently there are fewer than 400 Tasers in the Force, and the stock is shared. 'Obviously a number are used in standard police training, and some will be damaged and need to be replaced on a continuous basis.' The one time an X26 Taser was deployed, the incident was outside the MoD force's normal remit (file photo) The spokesman added a Taser was discharged once by the force in 2011, during a domestic incident in which a man with a knife was threatening two women. The incident was not within the normal remit of MoD police, but officers were tasked because they were nearby and 'successfully defused a life-threatening situation'. 'MoD Police train all Authorised Firearms Officers in the use of Taser in accordance with national armed policing policy. 'The MoD’s Police Committee, which is independently chaired, and whose role is to oversee the proper functioning of the MDP, supports the recommendation from HM inspectorate of Police (HMIC) in 2013, that MOD Police increase Taser training to all public-facing officers, and is tracking progress on its implementation.' 2007/08 - 39 (Cost: £31,200) 2009/10 - 49 (£45,325) 2010/11 - 20 (£19,500) 2011/12 - 30 (£29,350) 2012/13 - 8 (£7,960) 2013/14 - 67 (£70,350) 2014/15 - 150 (£157,500) TOTAL - 363 (£361,185) 2008 - Drawn: 1  Aimed: 2  Discharged: 0 . 2009 - Drawn: 0  Aimed: 0  Discharged: 0 . 2010 - Drawn: 1  Aimed: 1  Discharged: 0 . 2011 - Drawn: 3  Aimed: 1  Discharged: 1 . 2012 - Drawn: 0  Aimed: 1  Discharged: 0 . 2013 - Drawn: 0  Aimed: 0  Discharged: 0 . 2014 - Drawn: 0  Aimed: 2  Discharged: 0 .

Access: The media was allowed to film in the secretive GCHQ headquarters in Cheltenham, which is home to one of the three UK Intelligence and Security Agencies, along with MI5 and MI6 . A GCHQ report was released yesterday revealing that serious cyber attacks cost the UK economy millions of pounds annually. The agency, along with MI5 and the Cabinet Office, has increased communication with private firms because the threat posed by cyber attacks has risen. The visit to the HQ was granted by David Cameron who is pushing to give agencies like GCHQ access to encrypted communications. Last night, the Prime Minister warned internet firms they must work with security agencies to stop their networks becoming a 'safe haven' for terrorists. He used a press conference in the White House in the U.S. to insist the likes of Facebook and and WhatsApp cannot be used as a secret way for extremists to plot atrocities away from the glare of MI5 and the FBI. Mr Cameron insists the security agencies must be able to intercept communications between extremists and terror suspects who use encrypted messaging services and social media sites to plot atrocities. He said: 'I take a very simple approach to this, which is ever since we've been sending letters to each other or making telephone calls to each other or mobile phone calls to each other or, indeed, contacting each other on the internet, it has been possible in both our countries in extremis, in my country by signed warrant by the Home Secretary, to potentially listen to a call between two terrorists, to stop them in their activity.

'And my only argument is that as technology develops, as the world moves on, we should try to avoid the safe havens that could otherwise be created for terrorists to talk to each other. 'That's the goal that I think is so important. Because I'm in no doubt as, having been Prime Minister for four-and-a-half years, having seen how our intelligence services work, I know that some of these plots that get prevented, the lives that get saved.

"The 999 handler who took the call from murdered schoolboy Breck Bednar's mother warning he was being groomed two months before he was murdered has resigned. It has emerged the call handler has stood down and another staff member has been served with a misconduct notice by the police watchdog, which is investigating how the force responded to claims the boy was being groomed in the months leading up to his murder. Breck's mother, Lorin LeFave, called police two months before her son's death at the hands of Lewis Daynes, claiming her son was being 'groomed for gay sex' by the 19-year-old, who was jailed for life on Monday. It has emerged the 999 handler, who took the call from Lorin LeFave (right) the mother of murdered schoolboy Breck Bednar (left) warning he was being groomed months before he was murdered, has resigned . The Independent Police Complaints Commission issued a misconduct notice to a member of staff at Surrey Police's call centre as part of its investigation into how the force handled the complaint. The watchdog also confirmed in a statement released earlier this month that the actual call handler who spoke to Breck's mother has already resigned. Breck's mother told police  Lewis Daynes (pictured)  was 'grooming her son for gay sex' - the 19-year-old was jailed for life on Monday for Breck's murder . Its investigation will focus on how Surrey Police responded to the allegations of online grooming, including what actions it took and what actions it should have taken to protect the schoolboy. Breck was stabbed to death at Daynes' flat in Grays, Essex in February last year. An IPCC spokesman said it will also probe whether the force was working in accordance with child protection guidlines and whether the call handlers were given appropriate training. Daynes was jailed for a minimum of 25 years at Chelmsford Crown Court on Monday after admitting murdering the Caterham schoolboy, whom he groomed on a gaming forum. IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor, who is overseeing the investigation, said: 'Our thoughts are with Breck's family. 'The investigators and I have met with Breck's parents to express our condolences and explain the scope of our investigation. 'We will be keeping them informed throughout the investigation. 'We have obtained details of the call made by Breck's mother to Surrey Police about the communication between her son and Lewis Daynes. 'We need to understand how that information was acted on, and whether more could or should have been done to safeguard Breck.' The watchdog began its investigation in November. A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'The decision to resign by one of the members of staff was not connected to the investigation – she simply resigned and was not suspended either for this case or any other unrelated matter before she did so.' Following the sentencing of Daynes, Assistant Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, said: 'This has been a tragic case and our thoughts remain with Breck's friends and family. 'In December 2013 a call was made to Surrey Police by Breck's mother expressing concerns around online grooming and due to the prior contact the case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 'They have since decided to conduct an independent investigation into the actions taken by Surrey Police following this communication. 'A review of practises in our call handling centre has since been carried out and changes have been implemented to improve the way information is handled and shared.

"It could be up to 18 months before the family of Irish tourist Patrick Lyttle know if he will make a full recovery after he was knocked unconscious by his brother during a night out in Kings Cross - in Sydney's inner city. Patrick Lyttle was rushed to hospital on January 3 and spent almost a week in an induced coma in a critical but stable condition. The 31-year-old woke up on January 9 after his brother, Barry, appeared in court charged over the one-punch attack. Scroll down for video . Patrick Lyttle, 31, (right) woke up from his coma six days after brother Barry, 33, (left) allegedly struck him . Barry uploaded this photo with Patrick, right, and their father Oliver, centre, hours after his brother woke up . Patrick had bleeding at the back of his skull and swelling of the brain, a source close to the incident told The Sunday Telegraph. The Irishman had to have surgery to relieve the pressure on his brain. Doctors at St Vincent's Hospital - in Sydney's inner-city suburb of Darlinghurst - have told the family it was too early to tell if he would make a full recovery from his serious injuries. 'The only way they will know that he’s not going to recover fully is if his progression stops,' the source told News Corp. Along with the long anxious wait ahead for family, police will also have to do the same to find out what happened on the night of the alleged attack. Right now, Patrick cannot speak and it is expected he will not be able to communicate for another two to four weeks as he is on strong medication and remains in a state of grogginess. The source said he was only able to exert his energy for a short period of time and spends most of his time sleeping. His brother and his father, Oliver, have maintained a near constant presence by Patrick's bedside. Previously, Barry - who is charged with reckless grevious bodily harm - spoke to Daily Mail Australia exclusively, saying: ‘The way things are, we are just taking each day as it comes. ‘He seems to be improving, (we’re all) taking each day as it comes.' Barry Lyttle, 33, was charged with reckless grievous bodily harm and was granted bail on January 5 . The brothers' father, Oliver, arrived at court to support his older son while Patrick lay in a coma. Oliver and Barry have maintained a near constant presence at Patrick's bedside . Hours after his brother woke up in hospital on January 9, Barry Lyttle posted a photo to his Facebook page with his brother Patrick, and their father Oliver standing in front of the Sydney Opera House. Within minutes messages of support were flowing in from friends and family. 'Barry. great picture... great family!!! everything is gonna [sic] workout mate!' wrote one friends. Another wrote, 'stay strong cuz [sic]! You will all get through this!! Here's to good times ahead, as before!' The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross - in Sydney's inner-city . Following the January 3 incident, Barry spent a weekend in police custody and was granted bail. He is due to appear in Downing Centre Local Court on January 20. After Barry's initial court hearing on January 5, a tearful Oliver Lyttle told reporters his sons had loved each other since they were children. 'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done. 'I want to thank everybody for the way things have went [in court today] and their sympathy.' Patrick Lyttle was treated by paramedics at the scene in Sydney's inner city, where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit . Two Irish brothers were involved in a confrontation outside a nightclub in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner city which has left the younger brother fighting for his life . As part of his bail conditions, Barry had to hand over his Irish passport to authorities. He is not allowed to approach his brother within 12 hours of consuming alcohol. He is required to live with his Australian aunt at a Blacktown address and he will have to report to Blacktown Police Station each day. Barry and Oliver arrived in Australia on December 29 to visit Patrick, who arrived in Sydney for an Australian-wide trip last June. Police say Barry punched his younger brother in the head during an argument on January 3, causing him to fall backwards and hit the footpath.

"A woman died of a heart attack after an ambulance took more than an hour to answer a 999 call. Grandmother Monica Lewis, 57, suffered from epilepsy and was having a ‘severe’ fit when her partner Harry Smith, 73, phoned for emergency medical attention. The ambulance should have taken no more than 19 minutes, according to official guidelines. While Miss Lewis waited, two ambulances on the way to her home in Croydon, South London, were diverted to ‘higher priority’ calls. She deteriorated in Mr Smith’s arms, screaming, ‘I’m going to die’, until she finally had a heart attack, triggered by her fit. Last night Mr Smith said: ‘If the ambulance had got here in time, she would have survived. That’s a fact.’ Monica’s daughter Gemma Senior said she was ‘disgusted and disappointed’ over the failure of the NHS, adding: ‘She only lived a ten-minute drive from hospital.’ Health experts said her tragic death on Friday was a stark reminder of the pressure that ambulance services were under. Just hours after Miss Lewis died, NHS bosses unveiled a pilot scheme to give ambulances services in London and South West England more time to reach patients like her before breaching targets. The plan is the forerunner of a more radical idea – revealed last month by The Mail on Sunday – to more than double the time ambulances are allowed to reach the vast majority of seriously ill or injured patients. Instead of having eight minutes as a target, they would have 19 minutes. Mr Smith called 999 at 12.29am on Friday telling the London Ambulance Service operator his partner of six years – a divorced mother-of-two with seven grandchildren – had started having a ‘severe’ epileptic fit. He said: ‘Normally I’d never call the ambulance unless she had at least three seizures in a night, but this was different. It was so severe, and she was in so much pain. At one point Monica screamed in terror “I’m going to die!” It was initially classed as a category C call, meaning a 19-minute response time. All the while the 999 operator kept asking whether Miss Lewis was still breathing. He replied that she was. Harry Smith (left) said if the ambulance had arrived in time, his partner Monica Lewis (right) would still be alive . That meant she was classed as a Category C ‘serious but not immediately life threatening’ incident, leading to two ambulances being diverted to other ‘higher priority’ cases in the space of 47 minutes. At 1.16am the operator upgraded the call from Category C to Red 2, meaning she thought Miss Lewis was now in a life-threatening situation. The ambulance arrived at her Croydon almshouse at 1.39am but by then she had gone into cardiac arrest. Retired car mechanic and bus driver Mr Smith said: ‘When they finally came in, she had stopped breathing. ‘She was foaming at the mouth, with saliva and blood coming out, but she was not breathing.’ He added: ‘I want them to know they are responsible for the death of my precious, beautiful woman, who I called my wife. ‘We all have to die but she died a terrible death, she died in pain. She should not have died so young.’ Gemma, a 38-year-old accountant, got there shortly before 2am – driving four miles in eight minutes. She said two ambulance vehicles turned up – first a single paramedic in a ‘fast responder’ car and, 20 minutes later, a fully equipped ambulance. She said: ‘The ambulance crew told me they had come from Brixton. I said, “What? Mayday Hospital [in Croydon] is only down the road!” ‘I’m so angry. The ambulance crews might as well not have come. I’m certain she was already dead when they arrived. London Ambulance Service has the slowest response times in England. File image used . ‘It could all have ended differently had the ambulance taken 12 minutes and not over an hour.’ Epileptic fits usually stop by themselves within half an hour, which is why they are not generally classed as life threatening. But some fits keep going, and the sufferer enters ‘status epilepticus’. Unless the sufferer receives emergency help, this can cause brain damage and death. It can also trigger a heart attack. Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive of the charity Epilepsy Action, said: ‘We find it shocking an ambulance could take so long to reach someone having status epilepticus, a known medical emergency.’ A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman last night offered their ‘sincere condolences’, adding: ‘We are very sorry that we were unable to send an ambulance response any sooner.’ London Ambulance Service has the slowest response times in England. National targets state 75 per cent of Red 2 calls should be reached within eight minutes. But in London in November only 55 per cent hit this target, compared with 68 per cent across England. From February, 999 operators in London and South West England will get longer to assess Red 2 calls, before the ‘clock starts’ on the eight- minute target. The assessment time will rise from one to three minutes. The idea is to reduce the number of ambulances sent by mistake. On Friday, NHS bosses wrote to Ministers stating there was ‘merit’ in a further plan to increase Red 2 target times from eight to 19 minutes. If this happens, some Red 2 medical conditions will be permanently upgraded to Red 1 – where the target will stay at eight minutes. Cyclist Michelle Cooper died after being sent home from hospital following an accident . A cyclist who crashed and hit her head died after she was sent home from a hospital that was so busy it was in a state of emergency. Mother-of-four Michele Cooper, 52, was taken to Cheltenham General on Tuesday after being found in the road near her home. She had been cycling back after playing tennis. Her husband, Timothy, said she was taken to A&E, had a brain scan, kept in overnight, then discharged on Wednesday morning. After coming home ‘she collapsed’, said Mr Cooper, 53, an insurance broker. ‘We don’t know what happened.’ The NHS trust that runs Cheltenham General and the Gloucestershire Royal, had declared ‘major internal critical incidents’ at both hospitals on January 5, to deal with what was described as ‘unprecedented demand’.","A woman died of a heart attack after ambulance took an hour to reach her .

"A group of Boston taxi drivers is suing the city, saying officials have violated their rights by allowing the likes of Uber and Lyft to operate without licenses. Drivers are demanding damages and more oversight in a suit filed against the city of Boston at a federal court in the city. Drivers Raphael Ophir and Joseph Pierre, as well as industry group the Boston Taxi Owners Association launched the action. Unconstitutional? Taxi drivers in Boston say the regulatory set-up that exists now violates the 14th amendment, which guarantees equal treatment under the law (file photo) According to the Boston Globe, they complain that while they have to buy expensive taxi medallions for their cars, Uber drivers do not. Taxi drivers say this violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal treatment under the law, because it applies different rules to similar services. The suit said: 'The City has . . . permitted the de facto taxi companies to flout the law with open impunity by deploying an invasion of unlicensed cars and drivers with no requirement of any medallion.' Uber has historically responded to such complaints by saying it is a technology company which connects riders and customers, rather than directly providing transportation. A city spokeswoman said officials hadn't received the complaint Friday and officials will review it. A city advisory commission has been examining the regulations. Legal struggles: Uber has been struck by lawsuits across the country, and is now banned in Portland, Oregon and Las Vegas . The lawsuit also challenges proposed state rules to have the Department of Public Utilities regulate ride-hailing services as 'transportation network companies.' The legislature hasn't approved the proposal. The lawsuit asks a judge to stop the state from enacting it. The action is part of a series of legal struggles over Uber, which has been banned in Las Vegas and Portland, Oregon. Legal decisions are also awaited in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Pennsylvania over whether the company can operate.","Cabbies say current set-up is unfair because they need to pay out for license .

"An Air India flight from Chennai to Paris was delayed by three hours earlier this morning after a fight broke out in the cockpit between the pilot and an engineer. The plane had arrived from Mumbai and was scheduled to take off at 9.45am to Delhi but developed a technical snag. Air India have confirmed that the pilot allegedly assaulted a ground engineer on board flight number AI 143 as he prepared to take off. A fight broke out in the cockpit of an Air India flight between the pilot and an engineer (File Photo) It is believed an argument over the delay caused tensions to rise that developed into a fight. The Economic Times are reporting that the pilot was not convinced the problem had been rectified, and refused to fly. Air India ordered an inquiry into the incident, which delayed the flight with 122 passengers on board, said airline spokesman GP Rao. The Times of India have named the pilot as Captain Manik Lal and the engineer as V T Kannan. Passengers were stuck at Chennai Airport for three hours longer than expected after the fight . An Air India official told The Times: 'He (Lal) was not pleased to see too many people inside the cockpit and started to send them out. 'The flight engineer V T Kannan reached the cockpit and informed the pilot that the plane was yet to be handed over to the crew for flying. 'But the pilot refused to pay heed to the explanation' The flight departed after another pilot replaced the one involved in the incident, Rao added, saying that it was not immediately known what triggered the clash. The Press Trust of India news agency said the engineer, who was in the aircraft for a routine check, suffered a minor chin injury. The flight departed around three hours later than scheduled, arriving in Delhi 2.50pm local time.

"One of the two terrorists shot dead by Belgian police last week had apparently faked his own death in Syria, so he could return to his home country undetected and attempt a terror attack. In a sign terrorists are using disinformation to confuse and distract security forces, Islamic State fighters claimed on social media that Tarik Jadaoun, 24, was 'martyred' just weeks before he returned to Belgium. He was shot dead with Redouane Hagaoui, 22, on Thursday by a commando squad in Verviers, near the German border. Tarik Jadaoun (right), 24, was 'martyred' just weeks before he returned to Belgium to take part in a terror plot . Police said the pair were just hours away from launching a sickening plot to behead a police officer. Jadaoun and Hagaoui had apparently returned from Syria some months ago, after months training and fighting for IS. In May, IS fighter Hicham Chaib posted a Facebook message claiming Jadaoun was 'martyred' in southern Syria. The post spread immediately across social media, with terrorists praising Jadaoun as a 'martyr.' Terrorism experts believe the attempt is a worrying trend among Western jihadis. Jadaoun apparently faked his own death in Syria, so he could return to his home country undetected . At least one fighter from Britain is thought to have used a similar ruse to return to the UK from Syria, before being arrested and charged with terror offences. A security source said: 'We are always suspicious when there is a claim on social media someone has died in Syria or Iraq. It's an easy claim to make and we don't have the means of verifying it with checks on the ground.' Security expert Professor Anthony Glees, of Buckingham University, said: 'This shows that IS not only understands how to manipulate social media but how important it is as a tactic of terrorism.","One of the two terrorists shot dead by Belgian police faked own death .

"OId rivalries die hard between the Germans and the Brits - particularly when it comes to bagging the best spots by the pool on holiday. But in a twist on the stereotype, a new poll suggests that tan-thirsty Brits are now twice as likely to reserve a sunlounger with a towel than German holidaymakers. But, as if to restore the balance of the world, statistics show that one in 10 Germans think it is OK to wear socks with sandals. Happiness is... Brits are now twice as likely to reserve a sunlounger with a towel than German holidaymakers, even though more Germans (20 per cent compared to 12 per cent of Brits) Germans holidaymakers also spend more, drink less and travel to more exotic destinations during their precious down time, although a worrying 10 per cent still think it's acceptable to wear socks underneath their sandals, even in blisteringly hot weather. According to the survey by comparison website TravelSupermarket, Germans will spend an average of £1,582 on their main family holiday this year, 23 per cent more than penny-pinching Britons who will spend around £1,291. German holidaymakers will also be enjoying a longer break than their fellow British travelers, spending around 12 days away, compared to 10, and they're also more likely to squeeze in an additional short-haul trip during the year. And while 50 per cent more Germans will be hoping to travel to far-flung destinations such as Asia, and Curacao in the Caribbean this year, twice as many Brits  as Germans (32 per cent versus 14 per cent) will be making do with a staycation. When it comes to drinking on holiday, however, there is no competition. Around 25 per cent of British holidaymakers admit to drinking more while on vacation, compared to just nine per cent of our more restrained German neighbours. Good style never takes a holiday: 10 per cent of Germans still think it's acceptable to wear socks underneath their sandals, even in blisteringly hot weather . And with diet and exercise high on the agenda at this time of year, it seems that the Germans enjoy healthier holidays than their British counterparts, with over a third admitting that the chance to be more active is a motivating factor when choosing a family break. Bob Atkinson, travel expert from TravelSupermarket said: 'Despite the fact that Brits get better value for money on their holiday purchases, it’s interesting to see that Germans are more adventurous in their holiday choices. Brits tend to talk about German holiday habits in jest, but instead, they could do well to take a leaf out of the book of their European cousins. Come fly with me: German holidaymakers tend to travel further afield than their British counterparts . Home is where the heart is: While 50 per cent more Germans than Brits will be sunning themselves in far-flung destinations such as Asia, and Curacao in the Caribbean, 32 per cent of Brits will enjoy a staycation . 'If you’re considering following in the footsteps of German holidaymakers, it’s worth doing your research to find out what would suit you best. 'You can pick one of the new Ryanair services opening up the Atlantic islands of the Azores - great for walking, whale watching and sunbathing. 'Or why not try an active holiday in a long-haul destination such as Tanzania with an organised ascent of Kilimanjaro, a restful beach break in the Indian Ocean paradise of Zanzibar or perhaps a fly drive to the US states of Rhode Island or Oregon, home to Portland and the film set for TV cult classic Twin Peaks.'","Germans will spend around 23% more on family holiday than Brits .

"Police were last night urged to patrol in pairs for their own safety amid rising fears of a terrorist plot to murder an officer on UK streets. The advice was issued by the nation's counter-terrorism chief as it was revealed that hundreds of extra firearms officers will be deployed across London. Fears of an attack in Britain were raised after the atrocities in France that left 17 dead, among them three police officers. Scroll down for video . Armed and ready: The equipment carried by some armed officers in London, here outside Horse Guards . And they intensified last week when Belgian commandos killed Islamic State (IS) fanatics who wanted to behead a policeman or judge in a plot echoing the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, the national police lead for counter-terrorism, has now advised force chiefs in England and Wales to 'review the safety and security of staff' urgently – and to abandon lone patrols where necessary. In response, the country's biggest force, the Met, has adopted dual patrols as policy – something previously considered a luxury. With resources stretched, Home Secretary Theresa May had previously encouraged forces to let officers take to the streets alone. The reversal will be welcomed by London's frontline officers who have felt increasingly in danger, amid warnings from Islamists that uniformed police or soldiers would be targets for terror attacks. Some officers have spoken of concern that they have been subject to 'hostile reconnaissance' in the vicinity of police stations when travelling to or from work. It led to calls for them to be allowed to carry protective equipment such as CS spray and batons while off-duty. Mark Rowley, the national police lead for counter-terrorism, has now advised force chiefs in England and Wales to 'review the safety and security of staff' urgently – and to abandon lone patrols where necessary . Mr Rowley, who briefed chief constables at a meeting last Thursday, has advised officers not to go to and from work in 'half-blue' – wearing part of their uniform often hidden under a jacket – instead asking them to adopt purely civilian clothes while travelling. In October, a court heard that four men charged with a terror plot had allegedly sworn allegiance to IS and planned to murder police or soldiers in a drive-by shooting on the streets of London. It was claimed they carried out 'reconnaissance' of Shepherd's Bush police station in West London and a barracks in nearby White City. Yesterday, as Europe remained on high alert, it was revealed that hundreds of extra firearms officers were being deployed across London, which already has 2,700 heavily-equipped officers authorised to carry guns. Scotland Yard is also likely to double the number of its officers carrying Tasers from 2,500 to 5,000. Officers have been given a four-page document with advice on safety measures. It urges caution, for instance, when using social media accounts. Meanwhile, Britain's border forces have stepped up security checks to prevent automatic weapons, such as those used in Paris, from entering the country. Security sources say the French cities of Marseilles and Toulouse have become a 'hotbed' for high-powered assault rifles in recent years. 'France in particular has seen a huge expansion in the number of weapons on the streets, and there is no guarantee they won't end up here,' said a source. The Charlie Hebdo killers possessed an array of weaponry almost unthinkable on the streets of Britain. It included a Czech-made Skorpion sub-machine gun, several Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifles, Tokarev pistols, an M82 grenade launcher and hand grenades. Border checks at the Channel have so far kept Britain relatively free of such hardware, but security chiefs admit that there are now so many in Europe that they are more likely to be smuggled into the country. Officials estimate there could be as many as 10 million weapons in illegal circulation across the EU and say an assault rifle can be bought for under £1,000 on the black market and handguns for half that amount. Many are understood to come from Eastern Europe and the former Yugoslav republics as well as from the Middle East and North Africa. Last night, immigration and security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'This Government is doing more than any previous government to disrupt organised crime and protect the security of the border.'

"It is a story of faith, courage and determination in the face of immense pressure. When Dimitri and Varvara Artamkin found they were expecting quintuplets, the medical authorities in Russia said they must abort some of them to ensure the survival of the rest. But they refused, deciding instead to place their trust in the expertise of the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. It was a gamble that paid off in spectacular style – and a story that captured British hearts. Not only did the medical team defy all expectations by delivering the five girls safely, the quintuplets went on to thrive under its dedicated care. Now, just over seven years since their remarkable birth, the girls – Elizaveta, Alexandra, Nadezhda, Tatiana and Varvara Artamkin – have returned to Britain from their home in Moscow to pay a touching tribute to the doctors and nurses who pulled off the modern miracle. 'Gifts from God': The quintuplets - from left, Alexandra, Tatiana, Varvara, Elizaveta and Nadezhda - meet Dr Lawrence Impey seven years after he oversaw their delivery . Modern miracles: The girls, their parents Dimitri and Varvara Artamkin and Dr Lawrence Impey after their birth . ‘It’s fantastic to be here with the girls seeing everyone again,’ said Dimitri, 36. ‘We are so thankful to the doctors and nurses who took care of Varvara and the girls – they did the most amazing job. We’ve come here to show our gratitude to them. We’ve shown the girls so many pictures of the team as they’ve grown up, so they were very excited to meet them in person and see the place where they were born. It’s very special to us all.’ Every detail of their delivery by caesarean on November 10, 2007 had to be planned with precision, with a team of 18 doctors and nurses on standby to provide the finest care available. The babies were whisked into intensive care, and the day after their birth they were separated because so much specialist equipment was needed to care for them. Two were taken to London’s Queen Charlotte’s Hospital and then Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, while three remained at John Radcliffe. The girls, pictured with some of the many staff at John Radcliffe Hospital who cared for them . Defied odds: Moscow doctors told the parents to abort some of their babies to save the rest, but they refused . Hospital tour: The girls are shown an incubator at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where they were born in 2007 . Staff at John Radcliffe were delighted to see the girls again. Dr Lawrence Impey, the consultant obstetrician who oversaw their births, remembers the day well. He said: ‘It was planned like a military operation, and the stakes were high. Statistically, it didn’t look as though all five would make it – I had to talk to Varvara and Dimitri about the risks. So it’s wonderful to see all the girls so healthy and happy.’ The Artamkins touched Britain with their story, which they shared with The Mail on Sunday after the girls’ birth. The couple, who have known each other since childhood, were delighted to discover that Varvara was pregnant in 2007 following a course of fertility treatment. But when they learned they were expecting five children, doctors in Russia told them aborting some of the babies was the only option to ensure the survival of any of them – and of Varvara herself. The couple, members of the Russian Orthodox Church, refused and sought specialist help instead. A doctor advised them that they should travel to Britain. Miss Sunshines: The girls smile in sunhats and sundresses on holiday in Spain last year . Lined up: On a model bison in Russia in 2013, left, and right, the Artamkin girls at Christmas last year . Although not poor by Russian standards, Dimitri, a mathematics professor, and Varvara, 36, who has worked as a music teacher, are by no means well-off. Their trip and treatment were funded by a generous local businessman. Live births of such a large number of babies are extremely rare and the risks to the mother are high. In the majority of cases, they either miscarry or the babies are born too prematurely to survive. But the quintuplets were delivered safely, despite being 14 weeks early and ranging in weight from just 1lb 13oz to 2lb 2oz. Each baby had one doctor and two nurses assigned to her, and within days they were all breathing by themselves. Dimitri said at the time: ‘They are so small, but very strong. They are little fighters.’ After four months of treatment here, the family returned home to the outskirts of Moscow in March 2008 to begin their new life together. The council offered them a house and Varvara gave up her job to devote herself to the all-consuming task of looking after the girls. They will go to school this September, but in the meantime Varvara is paid an allowance by the state to teach them at home. Parents Varvara and Dimitri holding Tatiana with (from left) Vavara, Elizaveta, Nadezhda and Alexandra . The girls are learning English, and their parents allow them to watch Peppa Pig to help them with the language, although they’re not allowed to watch any other television. They go to church every week and sing in the choir. ‘They are hard work, but they are worth it,’ said Varvara. ‘They’re very close, although they do clash sometimes, like all siblings. They dress alike because they get jealous if one’s wearing something different. ‘They all have their own distinct personalities, and we’re encouraging them to be their own people. Nadezhda and Elizaveta both love reading, and Varvara, who’s the tallest, is the most serious, while Tatiana is always smiling.’ Dimitri added: ‘Alexandra is the leader, although they’d all like to be. ‘There’s no quiet one. They are all noisy.’ The couple saved up for their trip back to Britain because they were desperate for the girls to return to the place of their birth. Dimitri said: ‘We believe God gave the girls to us as a gift and sent us here to give them the best chance of survival. It was very important to us for them to know the people who did so much for them. We cannot thank them enough. I hope the girls will remember this visit for the rest of their lives, and always feel grateful for the care they received.’ How the Mail on Sunday reported the story, which captured British hearts, after doctors defied all expectations by delivering the five girls safely .","Dimitri and Varvara Artamkin told they must abort some of their babies .

Tragic scene: The incident happened just after midnight on Saturday, May 10 last year, on Conklin Street in Farmingdale . Tragedy: Cody Talanian (left) and his friend Tristan Reichle (right) were both killed after a car crash last May . Too soon: Carly Lonnberg (left) and Jesse Romero (right) also died shortly after the crash . Heartbreaking: Noah Francis (pictured) was also killed in the accident . According to detectives, a 2001 Nissan driven by a 17-year-old Tristan Reichle was traveling westbound when the vehicle crossed into the eastbound lanes and struck a GMC Suburban operated by a 53-year-old man. There were five people inside, two of whom were ejected. Four victims died immediately after the accident, while the fifth died at the hospital the next day. Prosecutors allege that Gloe stopped at a red light in the lane next to Reichle, challenging him to a race several times. When the traffic signal turned green, the two cars crossed Route 110 and were racing each other westbound on Conklin Street when Reichle lost control. Reichle was killed in the crash along with 18-year-old Jesse Romero, 14-year-old Carly Lonborg and 15-year-old Noah Francis. Cody Talanian, 17, was pronounced dead at 10 p.m. the following evening at Nassau University Medical Center. High schoolers: All five teens who were riding in this 2001 Nissan were from Farmingdale High School . Disbelief: The families of the teens awoke to the awful news on Mother's Day 2014 . All five victims attended Farmingdale High School, though one was a former student. 'Today's indictment is the result of an event that brought heartbreak to these families, the innocent victims who were injured, and the Farmingdale community since last May,' Acting District Attorney Madeline Singas said. 'Unfortunately nothing will alleviate the pain or bring back the lives lost in this senseless crash. We owe it to our kids and everyone on our roads to remember that speed and racing kill. As parents, grandparents and teachers we cannot emphasize enough to our kids that when you are old enough to drive a car, you are also old enough to be held responsible for your decisions behind the wheel.' Gloe's attorney Stephen LaMagna insists his client will be acquitted, calling the incident 'unbelievably tragic,' and noted Gloe's vehicle was not involved in the actual crash. 'My client did not cause this accident in anyway and in any form,' LaMagna said. 'My client, his family, have been heartbroken as well as the rest of the community over what happened 9 months ago. Unfortunately many times in tragedies such as these, invariably the district attorney's office has a need to blame somebody , anybody whether or not that person was truly responsible for this tragedy.'","Five teenagers were killed in a car crash on Long Island when their Nissan crossed the center lane and smashed into another vehicle .

"How many amendments does the Constitution have? And who is the president of the United States? If you cannot answer the above two questions, you may not pass the US citizenship test on civics. And therefore, you might not be able to graduate from high school in Arizona - thanks to a new bill. On Thursday, state governor, Doug Ducey, signed new legislation requiring all high school students to pass the civics test before they can graduate. It will come into effect in the 2016-17 school year. Scroll down for questions . New legislation: On Thursday, Arizona governor, Doug Ducey (pictured, left, on Friday) signed new legislation requiring all high school students in the state to pass the US citizenship test on civics before they can graduate . Under the legislation, Arizona students must correctly answer 60 of the 100 cited questions  in order to pass the test and graduate. This is the equivalent of an 'F' on a typical school grading scale. The civics exam, which aims to increase students' knowledge of basic government, includes subjects such as the Founding Fathers, the Bill of Rights, past US presidents and the location of states, . Questions include: If the president can no longer serve, who becomes president?; We elect a U.S. Senator for how many years?, and name one state that borders Canada. They also feature: What do we call the first 10 amendments to the constitution?, and before he was president, Eisenhower was a general. What war was he in? Arizona's new legislation  is part of a nationwide push by the Arizona-based Joe Foss Institute, which aims to have all 50 states adopt the requirement by 2017, the 230th anniversary of the Constitution.

Above, Gov Ducey, (left) smiles as he shakes hands with his son, Jack, as his sons Joe (second left) and Sam look on during inauguration ceremonies at the Arizona Capitol on January 5 . The Institute, whose motto is 'Patriotism Matters,' has created a civics institute to promote the test to state legislatures to ensure that students are be better prepared to be engaged American citizens. Institute president Frank Riggs, a former California congressman who ran for Arizona governor as a Republican last year, said the testing initiative seeks 'to ensure the delivery the very basics civics education that every high school graduate should have.' 'This has been building for a long time,' added Ted McConnell, executive director of the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools, co-chaired by ex-US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. But addressing educators' warnings that the  test is not a fix-all solution to the nation's dire knowledge of civics, Mr McConnell added he is aware it only skims the surface of what students need to know. Hearing: Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler (right) talks with (l-r) Gary Maddock, David Johnson, and Don Weible, following a House Education Committee hearing on the high school civics test . 'The folks who are civic educators and experts by and large are pushing for a much, much more well-rounded approach,' said Paul Baumann, director of the National Center for Learning and Civic Engagement at the Education Commission of the States, a state-led research organization. According to the Joe Foss Institute, legislatures in 15 states are expected to consider introducing compulsory civics tests for high school students this year.

"Frustrated pensioners vented their fury over the Government’s new savings bonds yesterday after an official website went into meltdown – leaving many demanding refunds and asking where their money had gone. Chancellor George Osborne boasted that the bonds for the over-65s were the fastest-selling financial product in modern times, after more than 110,000 pensioners invested a total of £1.15 billion in only two days. But the National Savings and Investments (NS&I) website could not cope with the demand and repeatedly crashed, leading to widespread confusion and payment errors. Scroll down for video . Angry pensioners branded the bonds for the over-65s scheme a 'shambles' after the National Savings and Investments website repeatedly crashed, leading to widespread confusion and payment errors . Angry customers branded the scheme a ‘shambles’ after experiencing a series of problems, with some investing far more than they wanted to as they mistakenly filled out online forms several times. To make matters worse, the dedicated 24-hour phone line was also swamped, leaving worried savers unable to claim refunds or find out where their money had gone. Retired businessman Chris Pearson, 69, who lives near Woking in Surrey, tried three times to invest in bonds for him and his wife but ended up getting error messages saying ‘service temporarily unavailable’ each time after inputting bank details. The fourth time he was successful and received a confirmation email. He later contacted his bank and found that £10,000 had already been taken and a further £30,000 worth of payments were due to leave his account. Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) had boasted the bonds were the fastest-selling financial product in modern times . He tried to get through on the NS&I’s 24-hour helpline to explain his predicament but sat waiting for two and a half hours in the middle of the night without anyone answering. He finally gave up at 4am. Last night he told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It has been a shambles. To sit on the phone for hours during the middle of the night and get no answer is crazy. It’s just ridiculous.’ Other customers complained that the online applications crashed mid-way through payments, or failed to send a confirmation notice. Ray Dixon, 67, from Norfolk, said the process left him with ‘no idea’ whether he would be charged. He said: ‘What happened was that I appeared to get my bonds, and at the end of the process you go through to the Visa verification. That went through and then suddenly the screen went blank.’ Mr Dixon contacted his bank, which told him the charge had been ‘acknowledged but not cleared’. He is yet to receive an electronic receipt for his bonds, despite waiting for more than 36 hours. ‘They must have anticipated there was going to be a rush and should have put on extra staff to cope,’ he said. Mr Osborne announced the bonds in last year’s Budget in an effort to help older savers demoralised by record low interest rates. The bonds are available for one and three-year terms, with interest rates of 2.8 and 4 per cent (before tax). Savers are limited to £10,000 for each type of bond, with couples allowed a maximum of £40,000. But news that the Government will cap the scheme when £10 billion has been invested led to a huge rush. Mr Osborne said it was ‘the biggest opening sale of any retail financial product in Britain’s modern history’. A spokesman for NS&I said: ‘Any customer who has inadvertently made more than one payment will be refunded.’","More than 110,000 pensioners invested in Government's new saving bonds .

"Petco has stopped selling a boozy treat meant to calm dogs. The national chain has taken the Good Dog Pet Calming Supplement off its shelves and removed it from their online store after some protested over the alcohol content of the product. The treatment, which is said to be homeopathic, contains an astonishing 13 percent alcohol. Petco (above) has taken the Good Dog Pet Calming Supplement off its shelves and removed it from their online store after some protested over the alcohol content of the product . While it claims to be homeopathic, the the Good Dog Pet Calming Supplement (above) is 13 percent alcohol . Petco spokesperson David Hallisey said in a statement; 'In light of recent concerns expressed by some of our customers with regard to Good Dog Pet Calming Supplement, and this product's alcohol content, we have decided to issue a voluntary recall, effective immediately.' He then added; 'While we are unaware of any instances of this product causing illness when used as directed, customers can return this product to any of our stores for a full refund of their purchase.' The ASPCA has previously warned against the ingestion of alcohol by animals, saying even the smallest amount can be fatal. This comes just two weeks after the San Diego-based company removed all Chinese-made dog and cat treats from its website and stores over fears they were linked to 1,000 dog deaths since 2007 - and an unknown number of animal illnesses. The illnesses and deaths were linked to a number of treats, including chicken, duck or sweet potato jerky. 'We know some pet parents are wary of dog and cat treats made in China, especially Chicken Jerky products, and we’ve heard their concern,' said Petco CEO Jim Myers in a statement last May. 'As a leader in the industry and the trusted partner for our pet parents, we’re eager to make this transition and to expand our assortment of safe and healthy treats, the majority of which are made right here in the U.S. 'Very simply, we feel this decision is in the best interest of the pets we all love and, ultimately, for our business.' Treats at the store now come from the U.S. or places such as the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and South America.","Petco has stopped selling the Good Dog Pet Calming Supplement after objections over the fact that the product was 13 percent alcohol .

"Twenty-two people were killed after a tugboat on a test voyage overturned in the Yangtze River, Chinese state media have confirmed. Four Singaporeans, an Indian, an Indonesian, a Japanese and a Malaysian were among the men who died in the accident, while the 14 other victims were Chinese, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. Just three people, all Chinese, were pulled alive from the water after the 368-ton ship capsized on Thursday. Among the rescued was one man, identified as an interpreter, who was freed when rescuers cut through the bottom of the boat's hull early Friday -  a full 14 hours after it went down. Chinese state media has confirmed 22 people died when a tug boat on a test voyage in the Yangtze River overturned on Thursday . Just three people were rescued, including an interpreter who was cut from the ship's hull 14 hours after the ship sank . Rescue crews were only able to conduct a thorough search of the tug boat on Saturday morning, then it was pulled into shallow waters . Survivor Wang Zhenkai, who spoke to state television from his hospital bed, said: 'Water entered the boat cabin very quickly, in less than 20 seconds it was completely filled with water.' Wang was accompanying a Japanese technician who was testing the engine of the ship. He survived by clinging to a hydraulic pump and said he had grabbed the Japanese engineer, but their grasp was broken as the boat began to sink. Rescuers, who had been hampered by swift currents, finally managed to pull the 98-foot long Wanshenzhou 67 into shallow waters this morning, allowing them to search inside. The ship had been on a test voyage in the river's Fubei Channel, in Jiangsu province, and it is understood the ship's owner, parts supplier and engineer were among the 25 people aboard when it went under. An official at the Jiangsu maritime search and rescue center, who declined to give his name, confirmed that 22 people were dead. The ship was built by Anhui Bengbu Shenzhou Machinery Co. Ltd in October. Distraught relatives gathered at the banks of the river, in Jiangsu province, to wait for news of their missing loved ones . But for most it would be bad news as most of the 25-strong crew were killed when the ship went over. Pictured: Emergency services bring a survivor to safety . A relative offers prayers on the bank of the Yangtze River - the longest river in Asia and third longest in the world . Emergency services took 40 hours to get the ship into shallow water after it overturned in river's Fubei Channel . Survivor Wang Zhenkai revealed it took less than 20 seconds for the water to fill the boat cabin . The final body was retrieved on Saturday afternoon, maritime officials said. A Singapore foreign ministry spokesman said Friday that the vessel was registered in the city-state and four of its nationals were on board. The accident occurred on a stretch of the river that experiences extremely strong currents, between the cities of Jingjiang and Zhangjiagang, which is close to the Yangtze's mouth near the commercial hub Shanghai. The provincial government said the boat was undergoing trials without properly completing the required procedures and without first reporting the condition of the ship, as required by regulations.

"A collection of personal photos and handwritten notes from former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to the designers who made her clothes has sold for a staggering $28,400 at auction. In the notes - among a few dozen pieces of private correspondence - stylish Onassis thanks her designers and even admits to tiring of the all-black attire long considered chic in New York City. Writing to Bill Hamilton, then-design director at Carolina Herrera, she tells him: 'I just love this suit and will wear it everywhere as I am SO sick of everyone constantly in black.' Scroll down for video . Sold: A collection of personal photos and handwritten notes from former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to the designers who made her clothes (pictured) has sold for a total of $28,400 at auction . First lady in red: In the notes, stylish Onassis (pictured dressed in a red Christian Dior two-piece in 1962) thanks her designers and even admits to tiring of the all-black attire long considered chic in New York City . The letter, accompanied by Onassis's own sketch of a suit with single-breasted jacket, continues: 'Like Mediterranean villages where everyone is in mourning for 20 years.' The note was among numerous items of Onassis to have sold at Palm Beach Modern Auctions in Florida on Saturday. More than 1,100 people offered bids by phone, online and in person. The lots also included private correspondence between Onassis and her interior designer Richard Keith Langham, as well as personal photos of her at Palm Beach, dressed in an array of outfits. Auction house co-owner Wade Terwiller said Onassis wrote to both Mr Hamilton and Mr Langham about clothes and furnishings she was buying from the mid-1980s through her death in 1994. Exhibit A: Rico Baca, auctioneer and co-owner of Palm Beach Modern Auctions, is seen pointing to photos of President John Kennedy's widow taken by Bob Davidoff, who spent decades as the Kennedys' photographer . Prep: Mumbi O'Brien, with Palm Beach Modern Auctions, lays out handwritten notes and drawings into lots . He added that letters by the widow of President John Kennedy rarely appear at auction - and therefore, the collection fielded 'tremendous interest' in the around 20 lots available. 'When we hold auctions of art and furniture, you don't see people engaging in dialogue at the preview. This was different,' he said. 'People wanted to comment on her clothes and recall where they were and what was going on when Jackie appeared in a particular outfit.' Potential bidders related to Onassis' thoughts on her personal style, including detailed instructions on how she wanted her jackets and pants to fit and pleas for more color, Mr Terwiller said. He said the one woman read Onassis's note to Mr Hamilton in which she admitted she was 'sick' of the color black and found herself agreeing with the former  first lady. 'One of the women at the preview was reading that note and said, ""I know what she meant about black. I'm sick of seeing black, too, and I'm from that generation"",' he said. 'People really connected with Jackie,' he added. Mr Hamilton recalled how Onassis would arrive for fittings with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil in her handbag, ready to work through lunch to get the details right. Master of color: Potential bidders related to Onassis' thoughts on her personal style, including detailed instructions on how she wanted her jackets and pants to fit and pleas for more color. Above, Onassis is pictured in a mint green Oleg Cassini number in 1962 (left) and sporting pink shoulder-pads in 1989 (right) 'To get the point across she would do drawings of ideas she wanted, from a canopy bed to a jacket,' he said. 'We spent a lot of time selecting fabrics. 'She knew when she went out she had to look perfect.' Co-owner Rico Baca said the notes about clothing and furniture purchases show the human side of the Onassis, who married tycoon Aristotle Onassis after her husband's assassination. 'In the notes, you get a sense of how someone famous can make the average person comfortable,' said Mr Baca, adding that he had expected bidding to start from $800 to $1,200 for each lot. Impeccable: Fetching the highest bid was a book about Onassis's restoration of the White House, which she signed for Langham. It sold for a whopping $4,575.  Above, the former first lady is pictured wearing a yellow dress designed by Carolina Herrera in 1961 (left) and a ruffled black gown in 1979 .

The woman, who says she was forced to sleep with the British royal aged 17, said: 'There was a constant influx of girls coming in and going out. And we were all very young'. Going into more detail about what marked the girls out for selection, she said: Young, pretty, you know, a fun personality. They couldn’t be black'. She added that any non-white girls would have to be 'exotically beautiful' even to be considered. Roberts also said that Epstein would sleep with as many as seven girls per day - and that some were only 12 years old. The woman, who now lives in Australia where she has three children, has made explosive claims about Epstein and Prince Andrew in connection with a federal case being heard in Palm Beach, Florida. In the court papers she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein where an orgy took place. 'Caressing': Virginia Roberts, shown above with Prince Andrew aged 17, wrote about their alleged sexual encounters in her youth . She has also described their first encounter, which began with her pouring a bath for the prince. In a diary recently unveiled by Radar Online, she wrote: 'The room quickly filled with steam from the hot water as I turned to Andrew and began to kiss his neck and undress him. 'He was caressing every part of my naked body and filling my head with endless compliments about my blossoming figure.' However, she said the sex itself was 'short-lived' and that he dressed and departed soon after. Epstein's legal team are desperate to keep details of the trial secret - including the details of a 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors. But the judge in the case has said he may make the documents public despite his protestations. Judge Kenneth Marra, of the Southern District of Florida, has ordered Epstein to explain why the conditions of the negotiation should remained hidden. He said: 'Public policy favors judicial records being open to the public', and said that unless Epstein could prove his case was 'extraordinary', they would be published. Friends: Prince Andrew, left, has been dragged into the controversy surrounding Epstein. The two are pictured together in Central Park . Under the 2008 deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting sex with a minor and was sentenced to 18 months in jail, of which he served 13. He had been accused of sexually abusing as many as 40 young women. Epstein has also been linked to Britain's Prince Andrew and prominent U.S. attorney Alan Dershowitz, who were accused in a court filing last month of having sex with an underage girl they met through Epstein. Dershowitz, who represented Epstein in the 2008 criminal case, has denied the allegations, as have Buckingham Palace officials. Some of Epstein's alleged victims are now seeking to have the plea overturned in a lawsuit in the Florida court before Judge Marra, saying that it violated their rights. In October, Epstein asked Marra to keep under seal correspondence between prosecutors and his lawyers related to the plea deal. In Thursday's order, however, Marra said he would only seal the correspondence if Epstein could show 'extraordinary circumstances or particularized needs' that justified doing so. Epstein's legal team plans to file a brief early next week laying out its argument in favor of keeping the documents sealed, Epstein attorney Martin Weinberg said Friday.

"The world could be on the brink of an outbreak of a deadly and ‘virtually untreatable’ strain of drug resistant tuberculosis unless immediate action is taken, doctors have warned. The first cases of 'totally drug-resistant' tuberculosis have been found in South Africa, according to a new paper published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infectious . Diseases journal. Clinics across the country ravaged by the bacterial lung infection, have reported an explosion in the number of patients struck down with a virulent strain. Outbreak: A tuberculosis sufferer receives treatment in hospital for the disease which health organisations warn is becoming drug resistant. (File picture) Fears are mounting that conventional treatments would be next to useless in the face of the new disease, which killed 1.4 million people globally in 2011, according to the World Health Organisation. The disease is particularly prevalent in South Africa, where high rates of HIV means the immune systems of many more people are susceptible to infections. But compounding the problem is the higher cases in which the illness is only partially treated. This has led to the disease evolving into a strain which is not vulnerable to antibiotics. Dr Uvistra Naidoo, who treats TB sufferers in a South African clinic, has horrific first-hand experience of the new disease after contracting a strain himself. He underwent three years of agonising treatment after contracting the new multi drug-resistant disease - only surviving after undergoing a cocktail of powerful drugs which caused life-threatening side effects. Warning: Doctors have seen an increase in the number of patients being diagnosed with drug resistant strains of TB. (File picture) Mr Naidoo contracted Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a complication from the treatment that causes layers of skin to separate from each other which caused him regularly to bleed from his eyes. He told U.S.News: 'The TB doesn't feel like it's killing you, but the drugs do,' adding: 'My case was three years long. I don't think the average patient has that kind of patience.' As far back as March 2010, the World Health Organisation warned that in some areas of the world, one in four people with tuberculosis were being struck down with the 'disease that can no longer be treated with standard drugs regimens'. After widespread vaccination in much of the developed world, the disease has been largely isolated in 22 so-called 'high burden' countries - including South Africa. These poorer regions account for around 80 per cent of global cases of TB. But it is feared not enough is being done to tackle the growing problem, which is not limited to South Africa. A New York hospital was hit by a multi drug-resistant TB outbreak in the early '90s. Of the 32 patients who caught the infection, 29 died. Serious outbreaks have also been reported in Peru, Russia, and India during the last ten years, . Despite drug companies developing a new generation of treatments, experts have warned more action needs to be taken and new drugs brought out. Karin Weyer, coordinator of the World Health Organisation's Stop TB department on drug resistance told U.S.News: 'It's encouraging we have a few drugs in the pipeline, but we need several new ones, with new mechanisms of action, to protect against new resistances.'","Clinics see explosion in cases of 'drug resistant' bacterial lung infections .

"Shootout: The Marion County home is where Ma Barker, the mother of several gangsters, was killed alongside her son Fred . Bullet holes mark the walls of the Marion County home where Ma Barker, mother to several of the US government's most wanted gangsters, breathed her last breath. Now county tax collector and former state legislator George Albright wants to turn the preserved home into a museum dedicated to the era of public enemies. 'Everything is like it was — it's almost like it happened yesterday, from bullet holes in the walls and the furniture,' Ocklawaha resident Charlene Yarborough told News 13. On January 16, 1935, FBI agents surrounded the house, located on Lake Weir, killing gangster Fred Barker and his mother after an hours-long shootout. Fred was founder of the notorious Barker-Karpis gang, of which his brother Arthur 'Doc' Barker was also a member, that was responsible for a string of high-profile kidnappings in the 1930s. After Alvin Karpis was declared Public Enemy Number 1 in 1934, the FBI arrested Doc and found a map showing where his brother and mother were hiding out. Agents were tipped off to the rented home by mention of a one-eyed alligator named Old Joe, which lived in Lake Weir, and was known to neighbors. According to the book Touched by the Sun, the agents emptied thousands of bullets into the home, then sent local handyman Willie Woodbury in with a bulletproof vest. Scene: Bullet holes still mark the walls of the Florida site of the shootout, which took place between Fred Barker and 14 agents from the FBI back in 1935 . Woodbury entered and confirmed no one inside was alive. The book Haunting Sunshine notes that Fred was riddled with 14 bullets, his mother, was killed with one shot. Neighbors watched the shootout, and Albright said his grandfather hid behind a tree to witness the gun battle. According to Albright, his grandfather split his pants while crouching, but had enough time to buy replacements before catching the end of the shootout. Preservation: Tax collector and former state legislator George Albright wants to turn the preserved home into a museum dedicated to the FBI era of public enemies . Wanted: Fred Barker, one of the founders of the Barker-Karpis gang that committed bank robberies and high-profile kidnappings, was found riddled with 14 bullets after firing on FBI agents . Matron: Ma Barker, also known by the names Arrie and Kate, was turned into a gangster in popular mythology, though role in the criminal undertakings of her sons is believed to be insignificant . 'This was one of the watershed moments, Jan. 16, 1935, where the FBI, the good guys won,' Albright said. Albright, who was once caretaker of the property, has submitted a $1million proposal to buy the home from its Miami owners and convert it into a museum. State legislators are expected to decide on the proposal in the spring. 'The condition is wonderful,' Albright said. 'This is a perfect property to showcase the gun battle itself, the rise and the fall of the gangster movement and the rise of the FBI and their successes.' 'It’s still a defining event in American history and it deserves to be protected,' he added.","Former state legislator George Albright wants the state to buy the home, where bullet-pocked walls still stand .

"Cash-strapped hospital chiefs are spending vast amounts on sending mental health patients into private care after they axed more than 1,000 NHS beds - to save money. Damning figures compiled by MailOnline show the soaring amount paid to private firms to provide 'out-of-area' beds, which have to be used if publicly-funded beds run out. These beds can be up to hundreds of miles from patients' homes and cost the taxpayer thousands of pounds, but have been used increasingly as NHS mental health wards are cut back. Despair: Damning figures show the soaring amount paid to private firms for 'out-of-area' mental health beds, used when NHS beds run out. The cost to the taxpayer has more than doubled in just two years (file photo) Figures provided by 22 mental health trusts show they spent £38.2million on private sector out-of-area beds in 2013/14 - two and a half times the £14.7million they spent in 2011/12. Those same trusts cut back their own acute mental health beds – the ones used for serious breakdowns and psychotic episodes - by 6.1 per cent over the same period, from 4,332 to 4,066. The figures, released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act, prompted outrage from leading mental health charities and Labour's shadow public health minister. Mark Winstanley, chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'Sending people away from home for treatment, while cutting beds in local mental health wards, makes no sense financially and causes human misery. 'Not only is this a bad use of vital NHS resources, it is also very distressing for people because it delays them from getting treatment and cuts them off from their family and friends. 'Everyone who needs a hospital bed should be able to get one close to home, no matter where they live or what their circumstances are.' Counting the cost: Each line shows one NHS trust which responded to MailOnline, and how much it spent on private out-of-area beds for mental health patients in the past three years. Largest increases are highlighted . Mind policy chief Louise Rubin said the figures suggested bed cuts - which hospitals justify as modernising out-of-date wards and providing more private rooms - were 'short-sighted'. 'Historical underfunding, compounded by cuts over three consecutive years, have left mental health services close to breaking point at a time when more and more people need support. 'We are very concerned that people are not getting the help they need when in crisis, especially given reports of falling numbers of beds and increasing numbers of people being sent miles across the country to receive care.' Isolated: Nikki Mattocks was just 14 when she was sent to a mental health ward 30 miles from her home . One victim was 17-year-old Nikki Mattocks. She started to hear voices and self-harm when she was just 14 and was later diagnosed with depression and a borderline personality disorder. But there were not the right beds available in her local hospital in Croydon, south London - so for five weeks she was sent 30 miles away to Woking, Surrey, and Maidstone, Kent. Her father David, a window cleaner, had to borrow money to afford to see her. 'It was an hour's drive each way,' she said. 'He came to see me as much as he could but he had to work more hours and borrow money. 'I was so isolated. I had to go without seeing any of my friends because they didn't know how to get to me and couldn't afford it. 'One of the main ways I had got through it was to have people around me so it was a lot harder being so out of touch.' Nikki, who now plans to study mental health nursing at university in September, said: 'I was sent to private hospitals twice because they had no beds. 'I can't even imagine how much that cost them. It seems like such a waste. It just doesn't make sense.' The figures obtained by MailOnline are just a snapshot of the picture across Britain, because the other NHS trusts we asked did not or could not respond to our requests in full. But the figures come just two months after the Royal College of Nursing warned  care was at crisis point, with 1,500 mental health beds closed down since 2010. General secretary Dr Peter Carter told MailOnline demand has risen by almost a third since 2010. 'It’s a false economy to make these sorts of cuts,' he said. 'This increased NHS spending on private sector beds is a sign that the health service lacks capacity and urgently needs to increase its own provision. 'This short-sighted approach also undermines the quality of patient care. 'Inadequate provision means there’s a severe lack of mental health beds in many communities and too many patients have to go hundreds of miles away from home to access a service. Condemned: The Royal College of Nursing's Peter Carter (pictured) said the cuts were a 'false economy' 'Some patients with serious mental illnesses are having to wait until their health deteriorates to such an extent that they have to be detained before they start getting specialist care. 'Children with mental health problems have been placed in police cells because there aren’t beds available.' One of the worst offenders was the South London and Maudsley NHS trust, which leaped from spending £1.8million in 2011/12 to £5.5million last year. It admitted the increase was due to a 'huge demand on our services and the consequent need for some of our patients to be admitted to overspill beds managed by private sector organisations.' But it insisted costs are expected to come down this year after 'significant changes' including more information for nurses, more funding and a specialist team to monitor private spending. Another of the worst offenders was the Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust. It spent just £121,000 on private beds in 2011/12, but this rose to £1.2million the next year and an eye-watering £5.7million the year after. That figure, apparently the most drastic increase in Britain, was originally revealed by Green party campaigner Ed Targett who described it as a 'scandal'. The Kent and Medway trust insisted running out of beds was not the only reason patients had to be placed in private care. 'Reasons may include a specific specialist need for certain conditions or disorders which is not provided on an inpatient basis within our Trust,' a spokesman said. 'Other reasons may include the inability of a service user to be able to travel to the nearest NHS inpatient unit and a private sector bed is in fact closer to their home.' The 22 trusts chosen were the only ones to provide complete information in response to a Freedom of Information request by MailOnline. Out of area beds also include money paid from one NHS hospital to another, not just money paid to private firms. However, our requests asked for information only about private sector beds. Worst offenders: The South London and Maudsley trust spent £5.5million - a leap of £3.7m in just two years . Just three of the 22 health trusts reduced the amount they spent on private beds - and just three increased the number of beds on their own wards. In some areas, bed cuts were drastic. One trust alone, Norfolk and Suffolk, axed 74 mental health beds from its stock of 322 in just two years - a cut of almost a quarter. At the other end of England, Avon and Wiltshire axed 42 beds from its 2011 stock of 209 - which had already been drastically reduced from the 249 it had in 2009. Just three Avon and Wiltshire patients were placed in private sector beds in the year before the General Election. Four went to the private sector the next year, 13 the year after, and 32 the year after that. Yet in 2013/14, the number skyrocketed to 96 - costing NHS chiefs £1.4million. Criticism: Labour's Luciana Berger. The government said it was introducing new ways to cut the spend . Labour shadow health minister Luciana Berger condemned the figures. She told MailOnline: 'Instead of prioritising mental health as they promised, the Government has cut mental health services more than other hospital services. 'We have seen increased waiting times, people having to travel hundreds of miles to get the help they need or not getting any help at all.' Dr Martin McShane, NHS England's director for people with long term conditions, said: 'We know mental health services across the country are facing challenges and it can be difficult to ensure capacity is always at the right point in the system. 'However, we have announced the first waiting times and access standards in mental health for both psychological therapies and early intervention for psychosis. 'This is intended to help rebalance the system focusing initially on reducing waiting times for people with anxiety, depression, eating disorders and first episode psychosis. 'We want to ensure patients are able to access high quality care at an early stage, reducing demand for acute admissions.' The Department of Health said it has new measures to stop mental health patients ending up in police cells, and is spending £120million to reduce the amount of time people had to wait for NHS treatment. A spokesman added the government has invested £450million since 2010 to improve access to talking therapies, helping almost 1million people. 'The Government has made it clear that beds must always be available for those who need them,' the spokesman added. 'For the first time ever we're collecting data on people travelling long distances for care so that services can be held to account. 'We are going further than ever before to put mental health on a par with physical health and we expect NHS Trusts, who have committed to making this a reality, to ensure mental health doesn't lose out in local spending.' Misplaced: The Royal College of Nursing says children with mental health problems are ending up in cells .

"Negligence: Malbert Rich, 53, is suing Metro for negligence due to its handling of the Jan. 12 incident that left one dead, two critical, and more than 80 sick . A victim of Monday's Washington D.C. Metro smoke incident has revealed how he sent final text messages to his loved ones, convinced he was going to die. Malbert Rich, 53, is suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for negligence due to its handling of the Monday's incident that left one dead, two critical, and more than 80 sick after inhaling heavy smoke for nearly an hour in a subway train. With passengers around him coughing, choking, and others vomiting, he said in a news conference, Rich didn't see a way out, WUSA reports. Convinced he was going to die, Rich sent a final text message to his children and his mother. 'I told my mother I loved being her son, and I told my kids I loved being their dad,' Rich said. Rich spent nearly four days in the hospital being treated for smoke inhalation and now his lawsuit is one of two being filed against Metro, according to WUSA. Rich's lawyer, Kim Brooks Rodney, said that though it is known that the incident was caused by an electrical malfunction in the tunnel, the lawsuit is being filed because of rescuer's delayed response in the situation. She told WUSA that the goal of the lawsuit is to improve D.C.'s subway system. The subway train, consisting of six passenger cars, left the L'Efant Plaza station at 3.15pm and stopped after traveling just 386 feet and began filling with smoke, according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board. The passengers were trapped on the train, CBS reports, for 44 minutes before officials cut off the faulty third rail that caused the smoke. Scroll down for video . Final Message: Convinced he was going to die, Rich sent a final text message to his children and his mother (here, Rich's lawyer Kim Brooks Rodney, speaks, as Rich looks on) Passengers on another train that left the station shortly after the first experienced the heavy smoke as well, FOX reports. The first train's driver instructed the passengers to remain calm as he said he would back up the train, returning it to the station. However, the second train was blocking the way. The driver of the second train, along with some of its passengers, left the vehicle to get away from the smoke. No Way Out: Rich (left) said that people on the train were having seizures around him and he didn't see a way out of the situation (on the right, passengers on the smoke-filled train are seen covering their mouths and noses) Without a driver there was no one to move the second train. This, of course, prohibited the first train from returning to the station. A timeline of the incident released by the city states that the first respondent on the scene didn't arrive until more than an hour after the smoke was first reported. The passengers banded together in the incident, sharing water, sharing a bottle of wine, and even administering CPR to one woman, Carol Glover, who died in the incident. 'I just didn't see any way that we were going to get out of there because the smoke was encapsulating and all you could see out the window was darkness,' Rich said.

"Last week, for the first time in 15 years, I didn’t go out for my daily run. As a veteran of more than 50 marathons and a 100-mile Himalayan trail race, it takes a lot to stop me. But instead of taking in the trees, lawns and ponds of London’s Hyde Park – the one thing that keeps me sane – I was lying in a hospital bed, the victim of a dog attack that was as vicious as it was wholly unprovoked. It nearly took off my leg and left me with scars, skin grafts and serious questions about the way we allow dogs and their owners to menace others – as well as growing doubts about the way our public parks are managed and policed. 'I screamed for help': Jeff Prestridge back at the scene of the 'vicious' and 'unprovoked' attack in Hyde Park . Don’t get me wrong: dogs, properly managed, are truly wonderful companions. I’d even go so far as to say I’m a dog-lover. Normally I pay no attention, not even to the professional walkers pulled along by packs of three, four or five animals at once – dogs that presumably belong to owners too busy to actually look after them themselves. So when, last week, I went for a short, sharp run in Hyde Park, family pets were among the last things on my mind. I’ve come to love this magnificent Royal park, with its eclectic mix of tourists, Lycra-clad cyclists, parakeets and runners of all shapes and sizes. And I have also come to love the Serpentine, in which I’ve occasionally swum on a crisp winter morning. For 15 years I’ve run through the park without incident, bar the time I foolishly ran into a bin and sliced open the top of my thigh. A dozen stitches taught me a lesson. But bins are to be expected in Hyde Park – Australian cattle dogs are not. They are bred for one purpose: to ‘nip’ the heels of cattle being herded across the Outback and so keep them in order. Hence the breed’s other name – the Australian heeler. Film lovers may remember the character ‘Dog’ from Mad Max 2 – Max Rockatansky’s canine companion following the loss of his family. Well, ‘Dog’ was an Aussie cattle dog. I never saw this one coming. I was gliding past the Peter Pan statue and in sight of the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain when the dog homed in on my right leg like a heat-seeking missile. My first reaction was to hurl abuse at the two walkers in ‘control’ of the half a dozen dogs from which this Exocet had emerged. Powerful: The Australian cattle dog is bred to herd and 'nip' the legs of cattle . But when I looked down at my foot, all I could see was blood pumping from the wound and a flap of skin the size of a mini pizza dangling from just above my ankle. This dog, squat with the shoulders of a weightlifter, had not just ‘nipped’ but savaged my leg before sauntering off, its mission presumably accomplished. One of the dog walkers ran away, taking his motley crew of mutts with him. No doubt he did not have a licence for professional dog-walking, as is required in Royal parks. The other walker, God bless him, stayed. Everything then became a blur. I remember screaming for help. A runner stopped to offer me comfort and used his top as a tourniquet on my leg while a park employee looked on in disbelief. A wonderful elderly gentleman called the police and two friendly constables came to the rescue. They looked after me until an ambulance crew arrived to whisk me away – after 30 minutes of form-filling – to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. After a night in hospital, copious quantities of morphine, countless blood-pressure tests and heart-rate checks, I was wheeled into theatre for a skin graft from my left thigh. The dangling skin couldn’t be saved. However, I’m told I should make a full recovery, provided that the antibiotics do their job. I can’t thank enough the medical staff who took care of me, nor the police who retrieved my clothes from the gym and my keys from work. They even visited me after my operation. My beef is elsewhere. It’s quite obvious that when I run again – and I will run again, come hell or high water – I’m going to be nervous when I see a dog walker coming my way, let alone if I spot an Australian cattle dog. Why do people keep dangerous dogs like this muscular vampire cooped up in a cheek-by-jowl city like London? Is it insecurity? Machismo? Or, more justifiably, as a deterrent to burglars (the owner, an Aussie, is an art dealer and lives in swanky Kensington)? This dog is bred to herd by aggression. It should be on the other side of the globe at this very moment chasing cattle, not in London mauling a sub-standard runner. Imagine how much worse things could have turned out had the victim been a child. Secondly, given its fearsome reputation and heel-nipping DNA, why wasn’t the dog on a lead in an area where all dogs are required to be so? And given the ferocity of the breed, shouldn’t it at the very least have been muzzled? Under the Dangerous Dogs Act, the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the dog walker (or in this case, as I have since discovered, the ‘dog trainer’ who was walking it). Touch wood, he will be prosecuted for not being in control of the dog, but the owner and the animal itself will in all likelihood escape any kind of sanction. Mr Prestridge's damaged leg was left needing a skin graft . The owner has since removed the dog to the countryside, and agreed to have it both muzzled and on a lead when it is taken out, but that’s probably as far as it will go. Maybe he will receive a summons when the case against the trainer goes to court, but it’s not a given. He says that the dog has never attacked before but, given that it has been receiving ‘training’, I don’t believe him. The dog has behavioural problems. It is unlikely to be destroyed. The Australian cattle dog is not listed as a dangerous breed under the Act. And as a dog-lover, I’m not keen to see it put down. But finally, and most worryingly, the whole episode highlights a worrying deterioration in the policing of our Royal parks. The dog was not seized because most kennel facilities at police stations have been closed due to budget cuts. Against the rules, the dog was not on a lead, presumably because the walker thought he could get away with it. Policing is light-touch. And the walker who fled had obviously walked dogs there many times before without being required to show a licence. I very much doubt that he had ever been asked to produce one. London’s eight Royal parks are patrolled by the Metropolitan Police. But the pressure to cut police budgets continues, which is all rather worrying when you consider the millions of people who visit these sites every year. If we are not careful, London’s scantily policed Royal parks could become magnets for criminals and thugs – and it won’t just be runners who are the victims of violence.

"A plane full of senior Philippine officials who were part of Pope Francis's entourage to the island veered off the runway as it prepared for take-off as storms lashed the region. The jet carrying 11 people was due to leave Tacloban airport just minutes after the Pope's plane left for Manila when its front tyres blew and overshot the track. No one was hurt but authorities closed the airport as tropical storm Mekkhala hit the region, with wind gusts of up to 80mph. A private jet carrying Philippine officials on Pope Francis's trip to the island crashed off the runway today . However, the storm has already claimed one life after a 27-year-old volunteer was killed when a scaffolding holding huge speakers was blown over by the wind, Leyte health officials said. Kristel Padasas was volunteering with charity Catholic Relief Services at a mass officiated by the Pope near the airport today when the accident happened. The city of Tacloban, which was one of the worst affected areas by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, welcomed the leader of the Catholic Church this morning. At least 6,300 people were killed, a million were left homeless and four million were displaced after the devastating storm struck 14 months ago. Since then, Pope Francis has vowed to visit the area  and was today welcomed by hundreds of thousands of people, who lined the streets in ponchos. 'I felt that I had to be here...I am here to be with you, perhaps a little late, I have to say, but I am here,' he said. The Pope, speaking through an interpreter who translated his comments into English from his native Spanish, said he 'respected the feelings' of those who felt they had been let down by God because of the disaster but implored them to move forward in their faith. The front tyres of the plane blew during take-off and left the plane to overshot the runway at Tacloban airport . A boy and a member of security person stand next to a piece of debris after the accident during storms . 'Many of you have asked the Lord, 'Why?' And to each of you the Lord is responding to your hearts from his heart ... so many of you have lost everything. I don't know what to say to you but the Lord does know what to say to you,' he said.

"Wear Spanx 'so you don't have to worry about sucking in all the time or being bloated'. Switch your glasses for contact lenses because 'poking your eyes is worth it just this once'. And make sure you choose 'something cute and Alpha Chi' for your Facebook profile picture. These are just a few of the terrifying beauty and social standards that the sorority girls of Alpha Chi Omega at the University of Southern California are told to adhere to during Polish Week. Scroll down for video . Strict: The beauty and social standards that the sorority girls of Alpha Chi Omega (pictured) at the University of Southern California have to adhere to during Polish Week have been revealed in an anonymous email . The strict guidelines were revealed in an  email, titled: 'Personal Development/Recruitment Info' and sent to Jezebel by an anonymous sorority girl, who has since graduated from the university. They standards were written up and distributed to AXO girls in 2013. But to this day, the sorority continues to uphold such provisions, according to the news site. For the duration of the seven days - the week before the sorority rush starts - girls must wear their hair 'curly or straight', with 'one normal color - no crazy ombre, no color you wouldn't see in nature'. They should also don proper undergarments, have neat eyebrows ('I know ""full"" eyebrows are in style right now, but ""full"" does not mean ""BUSHY"" or ""WILD"") and apply a full face of make-up. This includes the use of foundation, concealer, mascara, 'something pinky neutral for lips', blot powder, eyeliner, neutral eyeshadow, bronzer and blush, as well as 'neutral pink' nail varnish. 'If you are not wearing makeup, I will stop you and apply it myself,' the author of the guidelines wrote. 'I don't care if you're late for class I don't care if you're a sophomore or super senior. I will stop you.' Sorority Appearance Guidelines by jezebel2 . In their wardrobes, AXO girls should possess gold sandals, a seaglass top, a black dress, a red dress, a Tiffany blue necklace, nude wedges and nude heels if they wish to remain popular. And in terms of their diets, they must 'stay away from fried and super sugary foods' and exercise. 'Being sick or feeling gross during recruitment sucks. Start eating healthy today and you'll feel so much better by the time polish week and recruitment starts,' the author states. 'Stay away from fried and super sugary foods. Your face will seriously brighten up. Also, exercise. Start now and you'll have way more energy and endurance for the long hours of recruitment.' For a fuller list of the sorority's 2013 guidelines, see below: . Spanx . 'I cannot express how important Spanx are to make you look your best! Even if you are very thin, Spanx give you a better ""line"" when you wear clothes (no awkward bumps!). 'Plus you don't have to worry about sucking in all the time or being bloated! Just make sure they don't show when you're wearing clothes (don't get ones with long legs when you're wearing shorts).' Hair . 'Please get your hair trimmed, roots touched up etc before work week... Remember: Your hair needs to be one normal color. No crazy ombre, no color you wouldn't see in nature. '(Also if you're thinking about going from black to blonde or vice versa, do so after recruitment. You won't know for sure what it looks like, and if you hate it... that won't fly.' 'For recruitment, your hair has to be curly or straight. No waves.' The guidelines add that if you have straight hair and want to wear it curly - 'don't'. 'It needs to be able to hold for 15-hour days and hairspray crunchy hair or limp hair is not acceptable,' they state. Health . 'Being sick or feeling gross during recruitment sucks. Start eating healthy today and you'll feel so much better by the time polish week and recruitment starts. 'Stay away from fried and super sugary foods. Your face will seriously brighten up. Also, exercise. Start now and you'll have way more energy and endurance for the long hours of recruitment.' Eyebrows . 'Bad eyebrows will make you look less beautiful than you actually are! Your eyebrows need to look neat (as in not messy) for recruitment. 'I know ""full"" eyebrows are in style right now, but ""full"" does not mean ""BUSHY"" or ""WILD"". If you have SPARSE BROWS then you need to fill them in. There are plenty of eyebrow kits out there.' Makeup . Girls must wear foundation, concealer, mascara, 'something pinky neutral for lips', blot powder, eyeliner, neutral eyeshadow, bronzer and blush. 'If you are not wearing makeup, I will stop you and apply it myself. I don't care if you're late for class. I don't care if you're a sophomore or super senior. I will stop you.' Glasses . 'We would like to strongly encourage that you wear contacts during recruitment. Obviously if that is not an option for you or if you are uncomfortable doing so it is by no means mandatory. 'However, we want the PNMs to be able to see your lovely eyes the best they can and strongly encourage wearing contacts over glasses. Poking your eyes is worth it just this once, promise!' Social media . 'Please make your profile pics, cover photos, etc. something cute and Alpha Chi. Don't use a picture where we're making ugly faces or are in a visibly not sober state!

"The Baltimore Ravens have reached a settlement in the disturbing domestic violence case that led to football star Ray Rice's suspension from the game. But while the terms of the settlement have not been released, Rice had been seeking more than $3.5 million for wrongful termination. The three-time Pro Bowl running back was released after video of him knocking out wife Janay — then his fiancee — in an elevator was released publicly by gossip site TMZ in September. Scroll down for video . United front: Former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice (pictured arriving at court with his wife, Janay Palmer, on November 5) and The Baltimore Ravens have reached a settlement . Shocking footage: The footballer was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely after he was filmed punching Palmer  with his left fist in an elevator at an Atlantic City casino . Brutal: Elevator surveillance cameras caught the moment that Rice punched his then-fiancee Janay in the face in an Atlantic City casino elevator leaving her sprawled out on the floor . The brutal assault saw Rice dragging Janay out of the elevator sparked national outrage and highlighted the often overlooked issue of domestic violence in the NFL. However,  months after the assault, Baltimore Ravens President Dick Cass said it is now time 'to turn the page' on the incident. The NFL is still keen to show it is against domestic abuse saying it will  continue its work within the community on the issue of intimate partner abuse. Rice became a free agent after former federal judge Barbara S. Jones overturned NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's indefinite suspension and reinstated him. But he hasn't yet drawn interest from any teams. In December, Rice chose a Christmas fundraiser collecting toys for needy children for his first public appearance since the video of him knocking out his wife in an elevator was released. On the field: During his appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying the player's (pictured) two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice . The 27-year-old attended the Toys for Tots fundraiser, held at the Jimmy's Famous Seafood restaurant in Dundalk. During an interview, Rice said it 'feels good to be out and among the Baltimore community and just to give back'. He added addressed the aggravated assault charges laid against him after punching then-fiancee  Palmer, whom he has since married. 'I made a horrible mistake in my life, but, you know, if you truly believe in second chances, you know, they will forgive me,' Rice told CBS Baltimore. 'We wish Janay and Ray Rice the best,' Cass said. Ruling: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (left) had his decision overturned by former federal judge Barbara S. Jones making Rice, right,  a free agent . There have been a spate of  abuse cases among players including Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, pictured left, and Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary, right . Yet since the Rice incident brought the issue of abuse to the fore, there have been a spate of similarly shocking incidents with other NFL players. Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson, created a storm of controversy after he admitted to hitting his son with a switch. And this week, Indianapolis Colts linebacker Joshua McNary denied allegations that he raped a woman at his apartment after the pair met during an evening of heavy drinking in early December. McNary was taken into police custody on Wednesday night after charges of rape, criminal confinement with bodily injury and battery resulting in bodily injury were filed against him.","The Baltimore Ravens did not release the terms of the settlement .

"It is, say Royal insiders, the Duchess of Cambridge's 'secret weapon' for staying in shape. So it's no surprise that smoothie-maker the NutriBullet has become a must-have device. The gadget, which pulverises fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds, is known as an 'extractor' rather than a juicer or blender, due to its unique high-powered blade action. It's this, manufacturers say, which is the key to retaining the nutritional content in your smoothie. Today, The Mail on Sunday is offering readers the chance to buy one, along with a recipe book detailing how you can use it, and other bonus items as part of an incredible half-price deal. So what IS the NutriBullet – and can it justify the hype? Scroll down for video . The NUTRiBULLET is a smoothie maker known as an extractor, rather than a juicer or blender . First, a word on digestion . Chewing is the first step in the digestive process, where food is broken down into smaller pieces. But, as adults, many of us do it a lot less, meaning that we absorb fewer vitamins and minerals. This, coupled with the fact that digestive enzymes deplete as we grow older, means that by middle age, we're often not getting the best from our diets, even if we're trying to eat well. This is where the NutriBullet comes in. Why 'extracting' is the key . Despite its small size, the NutriBullet's 600w motor and extractor blades are enough to turn even heartier vegetables, fruit and ice into smooth drinks in a process called 'nutrition extraction'. When you consume this nutrition-extracted food, according to the gadget's makers, you spare the digestive system the work of breaking down dense and fibrous foods, allowing it to focus on absorbing the maximum amount of nutrients locked inside. Slimmer, happier, healthier . At the core of the NutriBullet plan is the Nutriblast – a smoothie comprising 50 per cent greens and 50 per cent fruit, plus two to four tablespoons of 'boosts' (nuts, seeds or other super-charged foods). To make a Nutriblast, you always follow this method, but tailor the ingredients depending on the results you want – whether it's better sleep, cardiovascular health, or stronger muscles. It couldn't be simpler – just swap breakfast or lunch for a filling smoothie. Over the following pages, we've provided inspiring recipes to help you get started, but you can always create your own blend. Just remember: half greens, half fruit and veg, and those 'boosts'. Now, turn over, choose your recipes… and introduce a daily Nutriblast to your balanced diet. By Barney Calman, Health Editor . Contrary to recent reports, drinking juices and smoothies will not make you fat. But if you are expecting to add one of these tasty blends to a diet of chips, chocolate biscuits and lashings of wine, and still reap some kind of miraculous health benefit, you’ll be disappointed. Most doctors will tell you there is no such thing as unhealthy food – it’s an unhealthy diet that is a problem. The good news is that this means you can indulge in the odd burger or slice of cake. But if you eat these all the time, at best you’ll be consuming unhealthy foods at the expense of far better choices. At worst, you’ll be overweight and on your way to a heart attack. A despairing dietician once told me that she has unwell, obese patients who ignore all her advice, yet gamely inform her that they are drinking ‘a whole carton of orange juice every day now’, alongside their usual four cans of cola. Sadly, one doesn’t magically counteract the other. Juices and smoothies are concentrated and so make gulping down large quantities of fruit sugars in one sitting easy. In some cases, they contain more sugar than a can of cola. A litre a day is too much, but a small glass of orange juice as part of a healthy, balanced diet (where cake and coke is a rare treat rather than a regular item) will provide vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in a convenient way. The NUTRiBULLET recipes here contain vegetables (naturally lower in sugar), as well as fruit and seeds, and nuts or cereals to increase the satiating fibre content – making them a really good choice. One a day will do you heaps of nutritional favours as long as it’s not used to wash down a fast-food takeaway. The boring truth is that there is no quick fix when it comes to diet, and a smoothie-maker won’t change your life. But if you have resolved this year to eat a better, more balanced diet, then getting one of these is certainly a brilliant place to start. 1. Bananas are a great way to boost your fibre intake, which can help prevent heart disease and diabetes and improve digestive health. A medium-sized banana contains 3g of fibre, a sixth of the recommended daily intake. 2. If you’re craving carbs, opt for sweet potatoes. They are a good source of fibre, help stabilise blood sugar, and contain nearly three times your daily Vitamin A allowance, which is essential for healthy vision. 3. Blueberries are loaded with Vitamins K and C and fibre. A study of 93,000 women found those who ate at least three portions a week reduced their heart-attack risk by a third. 4. Raw cacao powder has nearly four times the antioxidant content of dark chocolate. Antioxidants help to combat free radicals. 5. Often avoided by dieters, avocados are high in fibre to keep you fuller for longer, and contain beneficial fats to lower cholesterol. 6. Just one papaya contains twice the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. An enzyme called papain can be extracted from the papaya and applied to skin to treat infected wounds. 7. Oats contain soluble fibre called oat beta-glucan, which helps prevent cholesterol in food being absorbed into our bodies. 8. Adding almonds to your diet could lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. A US study found people who consumed a fifth of their daily calories by eating almonds had lower levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol. 9. Leafy green kale contains folate, a B vitamin central to brain development. It can also be beneficial for heart health. 10. Ginger soothes the digestive system and also encourages perspiration, so it can help reduce fevers by cooling the body.","The NUTRiBULLET is said to be Duchess of Cambridge's 'secret weapon'

"A Canadian tourist has been arrested in Nepal on charges that he lured a nine-year-old boy to his hotel room and had sex with him.

He was detained by the district court until the charges can be further investigated, Lalitpur's police chief Pushpa Ranjit said. Ernest Fenwick MacIntosh, 71, was arrested at a hotel in Lalitpur, a suburb south of the capital, Kathmandu . It is alleged that Macintosh, who has a string of previous child sex offenses, threatened the boy. Officials have not given any others details on the case because it involves a minor. But, if convicted, MacIntosh could face up to 10 years in jail. MacIntosh arrived in Nepal on a tourist visa in August 2014, and was a frequent visitor to the children's shelter where the boy lived and they met there. Canadian news reports said the tourist was originally from Nova Scotia and had 17 child sex offense convictions against him. He was accused of sexually abusing boys in the 1970s and the allegations surfaced in 1995, when he was living in India. But he wasn't extradited until 2007, and the first of his two trials in Nova Scotia didn't start until 2010. His convictions were quashed in April 2013. Police are also investigating whether there are any other minors involved. Abuse: It is alleged that Macintosh threatened the nine-year-old boy, not seen here, according to police .

"A sordid tale of lesbian sex, murder and seduction in a Catholic convent in 19th-century Rome has been discovered in a secret Vatican archive. The Sant'Ambrogio scandal involves a beautiful young sister who convinced the nuns she was experiencing visions and visits from heaven - then made them engage in rampant sexual activity. Herbert Wolf, a leading scholar of the Catholic Church, learned of the Sant'Ambrogio scandal when he became one of the first allowed into the archives of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Whistleblower: This portrait of Princess Katharina von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was painted in 1848, when she was 31 . The Nuns of Sant'Ambrogio has been translated into English. It tells the story of Princess Katharina (pictured here in later  life), who blew the whistle on the scandal in the convent . The naughty nun also entered into an erotic relationship with a theologian on the pretense he was possessed, and is thought to have murdered three other sisters. But when a German princess fled the convent in disgust, a sex scandal hidden behind a habit for many years was unveiled. Wolf, a professor of ecclesiastical his­tory at University of Muenster, Germany, made the discovery and has retold it in his book The Nuns of Sant'Ambrogio. Written in German, the controversial never-told-before tale has been translated into English for the first time. Princess Katharina von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen first visited Rome when she was just 17 in 1834, where she embraced the Catholic faith in its strictest form. The young liberal girl became a 'pious Catholic noblewoman'. In 1858, having been widowed twice, the German aristocrat returned to the religious city at the age of 41 and was clothed as a novice at Sant'Ambrogio convent - home to women of all ages. Interestingly, a recruitment drive by the stunning Maria had resulted in about 20 young women joining. During her 15-month stay, Katharina witnessed the nuns following a 'forbidden cult' and also said she had noted a suspicious relationship between Maria and a man named Peter Kreuzburg. This went on, she said, under the pretext of trying to free him of a demonic possession. Gustav Adolf zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (pictured) rescued his cousin Katharina from the convent of Sant’Ambrogio . Karl August, Count von Reisach, was a spiritual guide to Katharina, who uncovered the tale of lesbian seduction in a 19th century Roman convent . Sant'Ambrogio della Massima is in the street of the same name near the Fontana delle Tartarughe in Rome . The princess read one letter from the man, addressed to Maria. It contained erotic innuendos and 'extremely obscene expressions', asking the two nuns to engage in sexual acts with him. The princess also witnessed Maria, the novice mistress, claiming sainthood and stating she was capable of 'supernatural things' and possessed 'heavenly gifts'. But raising doubts about the convent became dangerous and Katharina claimed that in an attempt to silence her, she was poisoned. Despite becoming gravely ill, she survived the attempted murder and wrote a frantic letter to her cousin, Gustav Adolf zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, a confidant of Pope Pius IX, claiming that she was being abused and feared for her life. Just weeks after her escape, Katha­rina contacted the Holy Tribunal of the Sanctum Officium, and made allegations against the nuns. A subsequent investigation by the Church’s Inquisition uncovered  the secrets of Sant’Ambrogio and the illicit behavior inside. Princess Katharina von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen first visited Rome when she was just 17 in 1834, where she embraced the Catholic faith in its strictest form . This painting hung in the Sant’Ambrogio, where the sex, seduction and murders took place . During the investigation, Sister Agnese Eletta - who had been expelled from the church - revealed that Maria had touched her  to heal her and because God had instructed her to do so. A report of the preliminary hearings presented to the Pope at the time revealed: 'The novices had committed improper acts with the novice mistress, exchanging intimacies and kisses. 'The night before profess­ing their vows, lesbian initiation rites had taken place. 'The women had also indulged in physical lovemaking, up to and including inter­course. Author: Herbert Wolf, a leading scholar of the Catholic Church, learned of the nuns of Rome's Sant'Ambrogio scandal when he became one of the first allowed into the archives of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . 'All this had happened under the pretense of heavenly sanctification.' And revealing her encounters with Maria, another nun, Maria Giacinta said: 'The unchaste acts were committed through touching with our hands, bodies, and two or three times also using my tongue. 'She was the most keen on touching our bodies together, which she called “giving"", and she asked me to lie in a certain position, with my legs raised, while she “entwined” herself with me, as she called it.' But it was not just women Maria got into bed with. She revealed a priest would 'dispense' blessings to her. 'He began by laying his hands on my head, and then he blessed me in the name of the Holy Trinity, the Madonna, and in his own name as my father confessor and protector,' she said. 'Then he fell on his knees and gave me an ardent kiss. Then he stretched out his right hand and at the same time laid his face upon my breast, on the side where the heart is. 'Then he kissed me on the mouth and on the face, and laid his head on my throat, under my chin. He remained there as our faces touched and he supported my face with his hands. 'He held me in a vehement embrace, and I remained lying on his breast for a while; sometimes he kissed me.' But along with other others at the convent, Maria Luisa did get her comeuppance. The investigation found she had tried to kill another nun by giving her enough opium to kill a horse. She was also thought to be responsible for the deaths of three other sisters. For crimes including the poisoning and murder, she was sentenced to monastic imprisonment in absolute isolation for 18 years. The convent was also dissolved. In recent times the site has had various uses, including as a nightclub called Rialto Sant'Ambrogio. Convent: During her 15-month stay, Katharina witnessed the nuns following a forbidden cult and a suspicious relationship between Maria and a man named Peter Kreuzburg, under the pretext of trying to free him of a demonic possession . The princess also witnessed Maria claiming sainthood and stating she was capable of 'supernatural things' and possessed 'heavenly gifts' at the convent in Rome . The Archibo Segreto Vaticano, the secret Vatican archive, had been open to researchers since 1881, but the documents relating to the Roman Inquisition were not made available until years later. Pope John Paul II finally opened the Archive of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1998, and Wolf was one of the first scholars to be allowed in. He has been honored with the Leibnizpreis of the German Science prize, the Communicator Prize and the Gutenberg Prize. Thanks to Wolf's investigations, this shocking tale of debauchery, which was hidden away more than 150 years ago, has been told for the very first time.","Nun Maria Luisa convinced other sisters to engage in sexual activity .

"High school is a tough time for any teenager, but the students at Miami Sunset Senior High School seem to have it a little harder. Photos from inside the school have surfaced on social media showing horrifying conditions, from a moldy carton of fruit punch, to brown tap water and cockroaches on the walls and the food. 'When I’m in school I expect to be taken care of,' former student Angie Garcia, who said she left because of the state of the school, told NBC MIami. 'I expect to be protected by the staff and by the faculty and they did none of that. 'I’m not sure what their interests are, but it’s certainly not us.' 'It was just deplorable.' Scroll down for video . Horrifying: Photos showing the terrible conditions inside Miami Sunset Senior High School have gone viral. A shot of a moldy carton of fruit punch (pictured) is the most disturbing . Thirsty?: Students claim the water from the drinking fountain comes out brown, yellow, grey or cloudy, but the school district says it has passed safety tests . Yummy: A cockroach is seen here on the side of a milk carton . Mold: Of particular concern is the state of the bathrooms, which appear moldy and damp . The disturbing photos quickly went viral and have outraged many, especially parents. Darlene Pratt told WSVN she is worried about her child's health and safety. 'I'm disgusted,' she told the network. 'Health hazards, safety hazards, it's a huge concern and seeing the pictures with the mold, and knowing that that is what my child is being served for lunch. 'It's very, very, very disturbing.' The photos have forced the local school district to answer questions about cleanliness. Barbara Mendizabal, Sunset's regional superintendent at Miami-Dade County Schools, said it was a back-to-school issue and that the facility is normally not in such a state. 'What we can say also is that prior to winter break, the building was not cleaned properly,' she said. Okay: A worrying sign was posted above the drinking fountain, despite the water apparently passing safety tests . Ick: Another carton of fruit punch is seen covered in mold . Mendizabal said the moldy juice - which is the most horrifying of the photos to emerge - was thrown away and not consumed. 'A student, during lunch time brought it up to the assistant principal's attention, that the juice tasted funny,' she told WSVN. 'He brought it up with the cafeteria manager and the assistant manager, and they quickly picked up all the juices and discarded the juices.' The school district has maintained the water has passed all the necessary safety tests. A lot to answer for: Barbara Mendizabal, Sunset's regional superintendent at Miami-Dade County Schools, said the district is looking into the problems and trying to organize repairs . The buildings at Miami Sunset Senior High School are nearly 40 years old. The school is in the running for a grant that would award them $6 million, which would be spent on repairs.

"They say the devil is in the detail. But one horrified Christian mom  was left reeling after she saw, what she describes, as a detailed 'Satanic symbol' in the break lights of a school bus while driving through Cordova, Tennessee. Robyn Wilkins from Memphis said she was stuck behind the bus in traffic when she was cursed with the sight of the  star-shaped red break lights in a circle which looked like a Satanic pentagram. Devilish? This is the school bus which had the 'evil' Satanic pentagram symbol in its brake lights . Close up: The lights were caught on camera by a worried woman after she saw them while stuck in traffic . Symbol: The 'Pentagram' is a symbol used by witches and Satanists for their own style of worship . Worried that she was being shown an evil sign as she drove through town, Wilkins snapped a picture of it and shared it with her local news station. She told WMC Action News: 'Anyone who fears a God, if not God and Jesus Christ, should be outraged. If you can't put a cross on there, you cannot put a pentagram on it.' The 'Pentagram' is a symbol used by witches, Wiccans and Satanists. Some  Satanists and occultists have adopted it as their holy symbol, but other faiths use it as well. Since her discovery, Wilkins has been joined by other local parents who believe that something sinister could be happening in the area - culminating in the takeover of taillights on school buses. They have all taken to  social media to protest against the 'evil' brake lights on a government vehicle. They're now calling for the lights to be removed from the buses and replaced with a single red bulb so that they can rest easily at nights knowing that they're no longer in use. Robyn Wilkins from Memphis, was driving in traffic when she caught sight of the star-shaped red break light . Wiccan: Jo Applewhite, pictured, said people needed to 'find out what it really means before getting riled up' But one practicing Wiccan said that there is nothing to fear and everyone needs to calm down. Jo Applewhite, a practicing Wiccan told WMC: 'Find out what it really means before you start getting riled up and all worked up about something.' Others argue that it was not a Pagan sign and was simply a red brake light. Durham School Services and The Shelby County School District declined to comment.","Robyn Wilkins from Memphis was driving in traffic when she saw the lights .

'There is a danger that a sympathetic doctor will sign someone off to have their dog fly with them when they could probably do without it.’ It is not known where Cavill and Kal-El were flying to on Friday.

"Yvonne Davies (pictured) was found with stab wounds at her home in Stockport on Friday night . A magistrate and public relations boss was stabbed to death by her husband who later committed suicide, police believe. Yvonne Davies, 45, was knifed in a frenzied attack at her home on a quiet residential street. Neighbours said a man concerned for their welfare broke into the house with a hammer on Friday afternoon and discovered the bodies before police arrived. Mrs Davies was found stabbed to death while her husband, Andrew, also 45, was found hanged in the house after the suspected murder and suicide. The couple have a young daughter, but she is thought to have been at school at the time. Mrs Davies was the head of communications and public relations at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs a number of hospitals including Manchester Royal Infirmary and Saint Mary’s Hospital. She was also active in the local community. She had sat as a magistrate in Manchester since 1999 and was well-respected by her fellow justices. As part of her role at the hospital, Mrs Davies met a host of celebrities who visited it including Manchester City midfielder David Silva and Hollywood star David Hasselhoff. Mr Davies was believed to have been a manager at Royal Mail in Greater Manchester, where he had worked for several years. Neighbours said the couple, who lived in a smart semi-detached house in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, appeared to be fine in the days leading up to the incident and there were no outward signs of any marital trouble. One neighbour said: ‘They were just perfectly normal people and there had been no rows or disturbances at their house. I don’t think they had split up or anything. ‘They just appeared to be carrying on with their lives. They were always friendly and pleasant.’ Police officers are pictured working at the home of Mrs Davies and her husband Andrew in Stockport . Another said: ‘I saw them on Thursday and my son saw them on Friday morning and there certainly wasn’t any indication that anything was wrong. ‘It’s a huge shock to everyone and very, very sad. I just feel sorry for the little one, to go to school in the morning and come back and find you’ve got no mum and dad. It’s awful.’ She added: ‘My husband went to walk the dog and he said, “There’s something going on over the road.” There was a commotion and people standing outside the house. ‘Then a man, we’re not sure who he was, smashed the front door with a hammer and got in. It was him who found them.’ Sources say Mrs Davies’s colleagues are ‘absolutely devastated’ by the tragedy. Police forensic specialists carry out their investigation at the home. Neighbours said news of their death was a 'massive shock' Friend Chris Lomas said: ‘Yvonne was a genuinely lovely woman who always had time for you no matter how busy she was.’ Neighbour Emma Houldsworth: ‘This is so terrible. The poor little girl left with no parents. You just wouldn’t believe anything like this could happen on your street.’ Police believe the deaths are a murder and suicide. Detective Superintendent Emily Higham said: ‘We are making initial inquiries and a post-mortem examination is yet to take place. ‘However, at this stage, we do not believe there is any third party involvement and we are not currently looking for anyone in connection with their deaths. ’ For confidential help, call Samaritans on 08457 909090, go to a local branch or visit www.samaritans.org .

"The 11-year-old boy walked free from court yesterday after pleading guilty to eight crimes - his mother blames his school for the boy's anger issues . The mother of a one boy crime wave blamed for a fifth of all crime in his home town has claimed his bad behaviour is the fault of his school - as they have not offered him anger management classes. The 11-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, yesterday walked free from court after telling magistrates he wants to be a bank manager. His mother, speaking after the hearing at youth court, said: 'He gets bored and frustrated which can make him more upset, destructive and angry. 'For me as a mother this stress is awful -  there's no anger management, no counselling. 'There's limited school support - that's why it's taken so long, lack of funding.' The child, who was accused of exposing himself in a Carphone Warehouse and abusing customers with foul language in Costa Coffee, appeared before Yeovil Magistrates in Somerset on Friday. He was previously given a conditional caution for two counts of violence against a person, arson, two counts of criminal damage, theft and handing stolen goods. After being told to pay attention and take his hands out of his pockets, the schoolboy told magistrates he wanted to work in a bank as he was good at maths. Having arrived with his grandfather, the court was adjourned for two hours while police officers looked for his mother. Upon his return he entered the court grinning to hear accusations of exposing himself to a girl in public and using profane language towards mothers and children in a coffee shop in Shepton Mallet. Police said the boy caused a spike in the number of crimes reported in the sleepy rural village - with 10 out of 50 crimes being attributed to him. Describing the latest offences, Judith Morris, prosecuting, said: 'The offences took place on November 11 last year at around 3.30 pm at the Townsend retail park in Shepton Mallet. '[He] was there, he walked into Costa Coffee and shouted various swear words when inside. 'In the store was mostly mums with children or elderly people. They were alarmed and distressed. 'After running out, a few minutes later he was outside a Carphone Warehouse. An 11-year-old girl was there. 'He called to get her attention and then he pulled down his trousers and pants exposing his genitals. She went home and told her mother.' But the court heard how the child had 'impressed' his solicitor as a 'nice, well behaved boy'. His grandfather told the court the boy was very clever, but had recently got in with the wrong crowd. The 11-year-old boy (pictured wearing a Batman hat), who cannot be named for legal reasons, yesterday walked free from court after telling magistrates he wants to be a bank manager because he is 'good at maths' Ray Peters, defending, said: 'I have to say, over the short period of time I have spent with him, he has impressed me as being a nice, well behaved and intelligent boy. 'His mother has tried to get him on the straight and narrow. She tells me he has several issues, particularly with anger. 'Recently, he made contact with his biological dad who he has never had contact with. 'He left when his mum was three months pregnant. He said that he wanted no contact with the boy. 'He was taken out of mainstream education for a time and was well behaved. He then attended a placement. 'That placement came to an end because of the powers that be and he had to return to mainstream education. 'So far as these offences are concerned, I think they can best be described as showing off in front of older boys who he is clearly better off staying away from.' Yeovil Magistrates Court (pictured) heard how the child wanted to become a bank manager when he grows up . After pleading guilty, the 11-year-old was told he could put his crimes 'behind him'. Sentencing, Chair David Phillips said: 'I'm sure now it has all taken place you can appreciate how frightened people were. You realise that is wrong. 'We have heard consistently you are an intelligent boy. In terms of age, you are. You will now be given and opportunity to put this behind you.' Speaking outside the court yesterday his mother added that her son had not had sufficient support since he left a specialist school where his behaviour was 'impeccable'. He returned to a conventional school, where he was expelled, a and is now waiting to be re-enrolled at his original school. She said: 'A lot of people have been supporting me and saying they have been let down by authorities. 'The problem was they moved him from the school too early to go back into mainstream school, because academically he's clever. 'We're waiting for the [boarding] school to do a risk assessment which is just holding things up.' Magistrates handed the boy a three month referral order.","The 11-year-old boy pleaded guilty to two counts of threatening behaviour .

"Remarkable drone footage has revealed the extent of devastation wrought on Sergey Prokofiev International Airport in eastern Ukraine. Separatist forces now claim to have taken complete control of Sergey Prokofiev International Airport after a series of battles with pro-government forces over the fiercely contested complex. The airport has been closed for months, but it has symbolic value for both sides and has become the main flashpoint in the fighting even as prospects for a new round of peace talks have dimmed. Scroll down for video . Crater holes mark the ground and debris lies scattered across the complex after months of intense shelling . The airport, which includes a now collapsed control tower and multiple hangars, is left decimated . The roof of the complex is riddled with holes after separatists took complete control of the site . Nestled in the snowy and barren landscape is a plane hangar left in ruins after the bloody clashes . The footage reveals the airport now sits completely gutted, with blast craters and shell damage covering almost every section of the site. Prior to yesterday, government troops held a tenuous grip on the airport, even though the complex, which includes a multi-storey control tower and extensive outbuildings, is only a battered shell after nine months of conflict. Separatist organisation Donetsk People’s Republic made an online statement yesterday in which they claimed that 'today, we can speak about control over the territory of Donetsk airport and its surroundings', the New York Times reported. A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Yuri Biryukov, said separatists had launched a full-scale attack on the airport to try to dislodge government forces. Meanwhile, representatives from Ukraine and Russia, separatist leaders and officials from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had been tentatively due to meet in the Belarussian capital, Minsk, yesterday to try to get a peace effort and ceasefire back on track. But the meeting of the so-called 'contact group' did not get off the ground, despite calls from Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. One rebel official, Denis Pushilin, left Minsk saying he did not know when a further attempt to hold talks would be scheduled. In a report highlighting the collapse of health care in Ukraine's eastern regions, the Geneva-based World Health Organization has put the death toll from the nine-month conflict at more than 4,800. The terminal of Sergey Prokofiev International Airport is left in pieces with a collapsed roof . Pictured are the remains of the airport's control tower, which is believed to have collapsed in recent days . Footage from inside the airport shows trees  have been left shredded following the shelling . A soldier carries water across an open space inside the airport, which is now under separatist control . Separatist forces take shelter inside a gutted plane hangar following a rebel attack on the site . Ukraine, Russia and separatist leaders agreed in Minsk last September on a 12-point peace blueprint for scaling down the conflict, including through a ceasefire. But the accord was flouted from the start, with each side blaming the other. Kiev says 200 soldiers have been killed since the truce theoretically came into force in early September. Kiev accuses Russia of failing to comply with the agreement to withdraw Russian fighters and military equipment from the east. Despite what the West and Kiev say is incontrovertible evidence, Moscow denies its troops are involved in the conflict. Ukraine's parliament voted on Thursday to rotate Ukrainian front-line troops and resume partial conscription after a security official said Russian forces had sharply increased military activity in the east. Russia reacted to this on Friday saying the move could undermine peace efforts. 'Any action related to military preparations does not help the process,' Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. 'We will hope that all this... does not lead to a renewed military confrontation.'","Drone footage reveals the gutted remains of Donetsk international airport .

"A pair of New York cops might lose their badges after being accused of attempting to have sex with an alleged rape victim. Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media. Skorzewski is married and Lamboy works in the Manhattan Special Victims Division. Skorzewski has also been removed from the special victims unit and busted to beat cop duty at the 114th Precinct in Astoria, Queens. Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media . The Daily News reports that Deputy Chief Kim Royster confirmed the charges. The duo can plead guilty and accept a penalty or go to trial. Of Skorzewski the alleged victim said: 'I am surprised that he is still working. I never really blamed the lieutenant, but he’s partially responsible because he took us out drinking. They paid for everything.' The accuser claimed he had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol. 'We actually got kicked out of that one,' she said. 'Luke’s wife also called him around that time. She was really upset that they were out drinking.' She claims he later called her 'my favorite victim.' Neither of the officers has commented. The woman reportedly met them in 2013 when she, a college student, reported a rape to Skorzewski after allegedly being attacked at a Union Square apartment. She had named a former 'Law & Order: SVU' writer. The officers traveled to Seattle to interview her about the case that July. She admitted to thinking Skorzewski was attractive and was suprised at the then officer's youthfulness. During the trip, they insisted she drink with them, and after a day of boozing invited her to stay at their hotel. The accuser claimed Skorzewski had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol . Upon going to the room, Skorzewski told her she was 'really cool' and 'awesome.' He offered her the bed while he crashed on the couch but when the morning came he asked to get in bed and put his arm around her, then requested a kiss. She told the married cop with two kids no, and he became aggressive. 'He really felt me up, tried to get his hands down my pants,' she told The Daily News. 'He was trying to put his hands down my pants or work them up my shorts.' She went along for a time before breaking away and showering alone. 'I was afraid to tell anyone about what happened with Luke,' she said, as her rape investigation continued. 'At the end of the weekend, Lt. Lamboy was like, ‘You can’t tell anybody about this weekend. Your credibility will be shot.' The cops never talked to her alleged rapist. In April 2014, she finally wrote to the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau detailing her claims, which she says have been 'substantiated.' 'I was surprised that it took so long for anything to happen,' she said.","Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, and Lt.

"Pop stars Eliza Doolittle and Sam Smith are being sued by an unknown songwriter who claims she wrote the lyrics they wrote on chart hits. Katie Farrah Sopher alleges that her songbook was stolen by her 'violent' ex-boyfriend  Sean Sawyers, who sold her work on to music industry contacts. In legal documents seen by The Mail on Sunday, Sopher is claiming more than £200,000 in damages over four songs. Three of them are from the Surrey-based duo Disclosure: Latch, which reached number 11 in the charts and featured Smith on vocals; the number two hit White Noise; and You and Me, which featured Doolittle. Stolen: Kate Farrah Sopher claims that Eliza Doolittle's (pictured) collaboration with Disclosure - You and Me - uses the words from lyrics she wrote . Compensation: Sopher is now claiming over £200,000 in damages after alleging that four of her songs was stolen - one of which went on become a hit for Sam Smith (pictured) Sopher, from East London, is also seeking damages from dance duo AlunaGeorge, both for their contribution to White Noise and because she claims she wrote the lyrics to their top 20 success Attracting Flies. In her testimony Sopher said the lyrics of all four songs sprang from the suffering she endured during a toxic five-year relationship, including references to domestic violence leaving her 'black and blue' in 2013's White Noise. The statement alleges Sawyers 'attempted to control [Sopher], was jealous and possessive and... believed she was cheating on him, which made him violent and reluctant to allow [her] to speak to other men.' Sawyers denies all the allegations against him. Sopher claims she wrote the lyrics in a songbook which went missing shortly after she split from Sawyers in 2009. She subsequently discovered they had been set to music and had become major hits. But in a defence filed with the High Court, Sawyers strongly rejected Sopher's claims. He states: 'I am denying all the allegations... There is zero truth to the claims made against me. I never saw the book the claimant mentions... [so] I could not have committed the alleged damages, theft, copyright infringement.' Sawyers declined to comment further last night, while Sopher and all the musicians involved did not respond to requests for comment.","Katie Farrah Sopher claiming over £200,000 in damages over four songs .

Mr Obama led the tributes by calling Mr Mandela a 'giant of history'. The U.S. President compared Mr Mandela’s actions to those of Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln and US civil rights leader Martin Luther King but also warned against viewing Mr Mandela as detached from normal life.

A source told RadarOnline that the 41-year-old mother-of-five from Georgia, who appears on USA Network's fly-on-the-wall show without a hair out of place, 'is hardly the Southern belle she claims to be' and is a 'totally fake.' They added that she also did not win the title of Miss South Carolina in her teenage years as stated in the show and 'it’s total BS.'

Instead, Mrs Chrisley apparently grew up 'living the simple life' in a double-wide trailer in Winchester, South Carolina - a far cry from the 30,000-square-foot mansion she lives in now. She shared the cozy abode with her parents, who worked as a mechanic and bank teller, and her brother who reportedly committed suicide a the age of 25. However, Mrs Chrisley escaped the trailer lifestyle after meeting her millionaire husband Todd - who was still married at the time - in the early Nineties.

"Amardip Bhopari, 28, (pictured) slept with the 16-year-old in her car, on an industrial estate and even in a school classroom after embarking on the fling . A female teacher had sex with a 'vulnerable' pupil and plied him with booze and presents has been jailed for two years. Amardip Bhopari, 28, from Streetly, Birmingham, slept with the 16-year-old in her car, on an industrial estate and even in a school classroom after embarking on the fling. She met the youngster while working at a school for pupils with learning disabilities and sent him sexual texts after he gave her his phone number. Bhopal was jailed for two years after admitting three counts of sexual activity with a child at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday. Judge James Burbidge QC said: 'I do not suggest you sought him out as vulnerable. 'However as a teacher you owed him a duty of care that all teachers must owe to a child. 'You had sex with him in public places, on an industrial estate and hotels and you also provided him with experiences that, as a 16-year-old, meant that he would be attached to you.' Hugh O'Brien-Quinn, prosecuting, told the court that the defendant started working at the academy in December 2012. During an art lesson taken by Bhopari the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wrote his number on a piece of paper and gave it to her. When Bhopari rang the number later that night they had a 'sexual' conversation which continued over the next week. Just before Valentine's Day 2013 Bhopari lured the teen to her art classroom where she performed a sexual act on him. They continued their relationship on an industrial estate near the school and had sex several times in her car and at her home. On the youngster's birthday Bhopari took him to a Formula One hotel where they stayed all day drinking vodka. Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) where teacher Amardip Bhopari was jailed for two years on Friday . Mr O'Brien Quinn told the court that despite the youngster telling her he was not looking for a relationship she continued to pester him with messages asking to meet up. On one occasion she took him to Drayton Manor Park where she 'paid for everything he wanted' and allowed him to drive her car even though he did not have a licence. Even when the boy, who suffers from ADHD and dyslexia, started a relationship with a girl his own age and called off the affair Bhopari refused to accept it. John Smitheman, defending, said Bhopari, who had left the academy as a result of the matters being discovered, was full of remorse. She had got a job at the school without any teaching qualifications where it appeared she was a great success. He said 'She fell in love with this young man, they had a relationship. She knew that it was wrong but it happened.' Bhopari was also ordered to register as a sex offender for ten years.","Amardip Bhopari, 28, met boy at school for pupils with learning disabilities .

"To be fair, Natalie Suresch and Joe Felicetti claimed that weekend first. The Philadelphia couple chose Sept. 26 for their wedding and then planned accordingly: They booked their venue, a former factory building in one of the city's most historic neighborhoods. They hired a DJ. Suresch purchased her dress. Then Pope Francis announced he was coming to town — the same day. 'We can't compete with the pope,' said Suresch. Forced out: Natalie Suresch and Joe Felicetti are just one of the Philadelphia couples who've been forced to reschedule their late September wedding because of the pope's visit to the city . My bad! Francis is making his first trip to the United States and the anticipated crowd of some 1.5 million devotees has hotel rooms booked solid for miles around . The couple's story is a cautionary tale for anyone planning to do something in Philadelphia during the last weekend of September, when the pontiff expects to make his first visit to the United States. Organizers predict 1.5 million people will visit the city to see Francis as part of the World Meeting of Families. Suresch and Felicetti found out about the conflict when his sister called to say she was hoping to see her little brother married and the Holy Father in one shot. At first, the couple was concerned but not frantic. They began checking for possible hotel blocks for their guests. They found nothing within 10 miles. Or 50 miles. 'I had a moment of pure panic, about 20 minutes of hysterical crying when I was yelling at Joe for no apparent reason,' said Suresch, 35, gallery manager for French furniture company RocheBobois. 'He was like a deer in headlights.' Said Felicetti, 41, an architect, 'I called the venue woman at 9 o'clock on a Sunday night to see if we could change the date so she would stop crying.' They now plan to marry Oct. 9. No choice: Brittany Lowell and Jeff Doney are also competing with the pope on their wedding day. Unlike other couples, Lowell and Doney were unable to reschedule. They were forced to book hotel rooms a half-hour from their church . Tourism and hospitality officials said the impact of Francis' appearance is unlike anything they've experienced in recent memory. 'His visit changes the whole paradigm,' said Jack Ferguson, chief executive of the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau. To illustrate how crowded things could get, Ferguson offered this: Imagine if, on one weekend, the downtown convention center was hosting 30,000 people while Beyonce and Jay-Z performed on a nearby public stage at the same time the area's major sports clubs — Eagles, Phillies, Flyers, 76ers and even the Union soccer team — were playing championship games at local venues. 'That's how you can get the magnitude of what's happening,' he said. Bob Dmuchowski, sales and marketing director for Kimpton's Hotel Monaco near Independence Hall, said his team told a few couples who wanted to have their weddings there during the papal visit that it was not a good idea. 'We're a boutique-style hotel and we wouldn't be able to provide that memorable experience for them,' he said. Afloat: Jason DeCampli and Cathy Gough were forced to reschedule their Great Gatsby inspired nuptials because of the papal visit . The hotel has 268 rooms, and about 30 of them have already been booked by a World Meeting of Families delegation from the Midwest. Kimpton is now figuring out its strategy for renting the other rooms. Single-night reservations won't be accepted; the hotel will most likely require guests stay for three nights. 'It may look like a lot of hotels are sold out online, but what you're finding is they're not accepting that stay pattern of just Friday and Saturday,' Dmuchowski said. Even Ed Grose, executive director of the Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association, said he may end up sleeping on an inflatable mattress on his office floor during the pope's stay. 'I have connections in the hotel business, obviously, and I couldn't get myself a room,' he said. Suresch and Felicetti said they've recovered from their initial shock and accepted their new wedding date — a Friday instead of a Saturday, as originally planned. Not ideal, they said, but it's the only date that allowed them to marry first and still go on their planned honeymoon later in October. The DJ was able to accommodate them as well. And while they may have lost a few years from their lives during that one panicky night, they lost no money. They're joking about it now. That's a good thing. 'People are saying, 'You should have just gotten the pope to marry you,'' Suresch said. 'Yeah. Right.'","The September papal visit to the city of brotherly love has many area couples scrambling to reschedule their nuptials .
Natalie Suresch and Joe Felicetti could find no hotel rooms within 50 miles of the city on that weekend and were forced to reschedule .

"Think Hondas are boring? Well this one might change your mind. Unveiled this week at the Detroit Motor Show, its long awaited new NSX supercar will blow away a few cobwebs. And it's a petrol electric sport hybrid that is green as well as bright red. With its aerodynamic, low slung features, the NSX, pictured below, looks more McLaren than Honda but certainly does have all that Jazz. A combination of the 550bhp twin-turbo V6 engine at the rear and two of its three electric motors fixed on the axle towards the front gives independent drive to each wheel, via a 9-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The long awaited NSX supercar (pictured) was unveiled this week at the Detroit Motor Show . The third electric motor, between the engine and the gearbox, aids smooth acceleration, braking and gear changes. In Britain and mainland Europe it will be sold as a Honda. But in the U.S. it will carry the badge of Acura, Honda's upmarket luxury arm, which is to the Japanese company what Lexus is to Toyota, and Infiniti to Nissan. It features a space-frame construction using ultra high strength steel and aluminium, with a carbon-fibre floor and ultra-thin pillars. A Honda executive, who really should get out more, described it as a 'human-centred supercar'. But it's fair to say that the driver is cocooned in a fighter aircraft style cockpit with sculpted sports seats. There are four driving modes: quiet, sport, sport-plus and track, for those days when you might fancy an all-out burn-up around a racing track, rather than risking your licence. To help haul its 19-in front and 20-in rear alloy wheels to a halt, it has powerful carbon ceramic brakes. A cluster of four exhaust pipes adds a flourish to the rear. Though a Japanese icon, the NSX will be built at the Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC) in Marysville, Ohio, from imported and home-sourced parts. It is the second generation of the NSX and is launched exactly 25 years after the original made its debut at the Chicago Motor Show in 1989. Expect a price tag of around £100,000 when it goes on sale this summer. Bentley has chosen a name for its forthcoming luxury 4x4 — the Bentayga. The unusual monicker is taken from the Roque Bentayga, a dramatic and rugged landscape on the island of Gran Canaria. It's already been spied in disguise out on test ahead of its official unveiling later this year and going on sale in 2016. There's also video of it under light disguise storming around on sand dunes like Lawrence of Arabia. A 'baby' Bentley off-roader has also been mooted by the Crewe-based firm, which has a target of pushing production to 20,000 cars by 2020. SMALL cars are some of the worst performers when it comes to meeting their official miles per gallon fuel efficiency figures — with the 2013 Nissan Note the worst offender, a new study concludes. By contrast, large cars, sometimes dubbed 'gas guzzlers', are more likely to meet their claimed efficiency ratings. The findings have been published by consumer motoring website HonestJohn.co.uk. Its study of more than 60,000 cars concluded that the 2013 Note misses its official European drive cycle fuel-economy rating of 74.72 mph by nearly a third (32.3 per cent), managing 50.5mpg in the real world. Next is the 2014 Mini Hatch — out by 32 per cent on its claimed 68mpg. Joint third from bottom are the 2012 Citroen DS5 and 2013 Renault Captur. Both miss their claimed averages by 29.2 per cent. The best-selling car of 2014, the 2013 Ford Fiesta, is the fifth worst performer, falling 28.9 per cent short of its claimed economy figure of 67.57mpg. By contrast the classic Land Rover Defender from 1984 onwards is the best performing car by exceeding its claim, achieving 106.3 per cent of its official fuel economy (26.58mpg). On average, cars now achieve 86 per cent of their official MPG figures — but this is decreasing by 1 percentage point every year . Daniel Powell, managing editor of HonestJohn.co.uk, said: 'It's no secret car buyers are confused by official fuel economy figures.' I've always had a soft-spot for Alfa Romeos, ever since I saw Dustin Hoffman's Spider in The Graduate, though I couldn't quite stretch to one as an impoverished cub reporter. Now the sporty Italian car company has lifted the lid on its new two-seater soft-top 4c Spider. It's the wind-in-the-hair sibling of the existing 4c coupe. The wraps came off at this week's Detroit Motor Show. To keep the weight down it has an all-fabric roof which has to be stowed manually behind the seats rather than electronically. Even the windscreen is 10 per cent thinner. The new two-seater soft-top 4c Spider is expected to go on sale in the summer priced at around £50,000 . It comes in seven exterior colours, including the vibrant Giallo yellow shown here, with matching stitching for the seats, steering wheel and doors, and six inside trim options. The new Alfa is expected to go on sale in summer priced around £50,000 and will be powered by a 1.75 litre, four-cylinder engine which will propel it from rest to 60 mph in around 4.1 seconds with the 237 bhp of pulling power for a top speed of around 160 mph. Alfa Romeo says it combines 'scintillating performance with open-top thrills and the unmistakable soundtrack of an Italian, performance-tuned engine and exhaust'. That's helped by an all-new, titanium exhaust system mounted centrally, which can be tuned according to the driver's mood. The dramatic ultra-lightweight single-cell or monocoque chassis is made of carbon fibre layers that together are three-times stronger and seven-times lighter than steel. The bodywork is made entirely from 'sheet moulded compound' — or SMC — a lowdensity, high-strength composite material that is 20 per cent lighter and more rigid than steel. It was designed by Alfa Romeo Centro Stile and will be produced at the Maserati plant in Modena, Italy. So from all the Alfa males out there, here's to you, Mrs Robinson.","It's a petrol electric sport hybrid with aerodynamic low slung features .

"Brutal: Aaron Jackson was working as a doorman at a nightclub in Leicester when a thug attacked him and bit a chunk out of his nose . A promising young boxer says his career is over after a thug bit off his nose is a row outside a nightclub. Aaron Jackson suffered the horrifying injury while working as a bouncer at the venue, just days after signing a professional boxing contract. Mr Jackson, 21, from Leicester, was left scarred for life after Sanchez Moore sank his teeth into the 21-year-old's face in June last year. He says his boxing career is all but finished and he also fears he will be unable to return to door work - his only form of income. Since the horrifying attack, Mr Jackson has undergone five painful operations to reconstruct his missing nose, using skin grown on his forehead to graft the new organ. The groundbreaking procedure, by plastic surgeons at Leicester Royal Infirmary sees layers of skin stretched over the remaining stump of his nose, shaped into place and given time to grow and replace the missing tissue. But 17-stone Mr Jackson, who was attacked out side Liquid Nightclub in Leicester, says his face will never be the same again. He said: 'It will never be the same. When my partner saw me, she was shocked. Anyone would be shocked, but I've been assured that eventually it will look like a nose, not my nose, but a nose. 'I don't hate him [Moore], I don't think I hate him, but my mum does. I feel sorry for him. When he pleaded guilty, I could see in his eyes he knew how serious it was. 'There was an incident, but it was a difficult one to assess, so we gave him the benefit of the doubt. 'I asked him to leave nicely but he started kicking off. 'We struggled, but we were getting him out, then someone grabbed me from behind. We never found out who it was because the cameras didn't pick it up. Career ruined: The 21-year-old was a promising boxer before the attack but said he has barely left his house since having reconstructive surgery on his nose . 'He came at me and he bit me. I knew he had done something but I didn't know what until someone said I needed to go and sit down. 'I sat down and one of the managers came and looked after me and the police took me to hospital. 'At the time I didn't realise how serious it was - I just thought the doctors would stitch it back on. 'The whole thing has been really painful. I haven't been able to do anything for the past six months and I had to stop work. I was in the gym every day of the week. I haven't been able to go since this happened. 'I don't really know if I want to be a doorman anymore. This has put doubt in my mind as to whether I will go back. Thug: Sanchez Moore, above, bit a chunk out of Aaron Jackson's nose while an unidentified person held the 21-year-old bouncer from behind . 'It was my birthday on January 11 - it wasn't really how I should have spent my 21st. I didn't want to go out. Now I just want to get back to doing some work and get back onto my feet and get back to normal. 'A couple of my friends have looked after me and have reminded me it will all be over soon and my family have been really supportive.' 'I only had a couple of amateur boxing bouts, but I turned pro because I wanted to see how good I could be. That's out of the window now, that's gone. 'I'll never know.' Moore, 26, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Leicester Crown Court last week and will be sentenced on February 27. Scene: Mr Jackson was working as a bouncer at Liquid nightclub in Leicester, above, when he was set upon by an unknown individual and Sanchez Moore . Detective Inspector Chris Hitchin, from Leicestershire Police, said: 'The injuries sustained by the victim are probably the most horrific I have seen during my career in the force, this was a nasty assault on a man who was only doing his job. 'The victim has been scarred for life and has undergone a number of medical treatments and is due to have a further operation later on this week. 'The victim has been spared the ordeal of reliving the events of that night in the court room, but, unfortunately, he will never forget what happened and his reflection in the mirror is a constant reminder of that. 'Hopefully, the conviction and subsequent sentence will help reassure him that justice has been done.' Confessed to crime: Sanchez Moore admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent at Leicester Crown Court, above, last week and will be sentenced on February 27 .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"A new mansion for one of the world's richest tycoons has ruffled the feathers of a wealthy neighbour - who complained it would ruin his right to shoot game. Billionaire H&M owner Stefan Persson won permission last month to build a nine-bed manor on his 780-acre estate in Wiltshire with a swimming pool, tea house, walled gardens and an orangery. But the decision to uproot a clump of 'monotonous' poplar trees prompted a row with millionaire Harry Hyams, who has lived on the nearby Ramsbury Manor Estate for a reputed 50 years. Clash of the tycoons: Property mogul Harry Hyams (left: estimated wealth £300million) said plans by H&M boss Stefan Persson (right: estimated wealth £16billion) would upset his rights to shoot game on his estate . Pile: An artist's impression of the H&M owner's nine-bed mansion, which will have a pool and a tea house . Stately home: Ramsbury Manor in Wiltshire, where 87-year-old tycoon Harry Hyams has shooting rights . The 87-year-old property developer behind London's Centre Point tower block warned the scheme was in 'direct conflict' with 'sporting rights' he has over the land. According to the Sunday Times, Mr Hyams said the poplars provide 'winter holding cover' for pheasants. Shooting rights can also include partridge, deer or pigeons. The trees were due to be uprooted and replaced to improve the look of the area of outstanding natural beauty - but it is thought the process could disturb game birds and drive them away from their habitat. Mr Hyams contacted solicitors and sent a formal complaint via a planning agent, who wrote: 'Mr Hyams has sporting rights over the whole of the application site and all of its surrounding lands. Magnate: H&M boss Stefan Persson, pictured with his wife Denise, is the world's 24th-richest ma . 'I must enforce the fact that Mr Hyams' sporting rights are an enforceable legal profit a prendre... and are owned in perpetuity. 'These major landscape works... would be in direct conflict with his sporting rights, severely compromising the exercise of these sporting rights in full'. In the end Hyams' argument did not prevent the H&M tycoon's house, near the leafy village of Ramsbury, from being built. Council officers said the shooting rights were nothing to do with them - so the two tycoons would have to fight it out between themselves. And they pointed out that replanting a better mix of woodland trees could actually improve the environment for game birds in the long run. Mr Persson's agent said: 'The poplar plantations have a uniform and monotonous appearance which is entirely alien to the locality. 'The uniformity of appearance extends to the understorey which is managed by frequent cutting. 'In some parts of the plantation, the poplar trees are dying, or at best are showing signs of stress and decline – making them vulnerable to wind-throw and storm damage.' The Swedish chairman of fashion chain H&M owns almost 9,000 acres of land in Wiltshire and is ranked as the world's 24th-richest man by Forbes. The 67-year-old's new mansion will be joined by two bungalows and employ six full-time staff, with parking spaces for 12 cars. Although Mr Persson is a director of the UK-based Ramsbury Estates Limited, the application itself has been made through a firm based in Luxembourg. His wealthy neighbour was not the only person to object. One occupier of a bungalow due to be demolished for the plan complained she taught piano there and it would lead to a loss of income. '[She said] has not been offered suitable alternative accommodation by the landlord that is either of an adequate size or in a suitable location for her singing and piano teaching business to continue', a report said. Sumptuous: The published plans for the H&M tycoon's home (pictured) sparked a row with a rich neighbour . Wealth: The new house will be on 780 acres of land and will also include an orangery and pool building . Mr Hyams, meanwhile, has lived in the luxurious Ramsbury Manor for five decades after making his fortune as a property developer in the 1960s. He was one of the key figures behind London's Centre Point, a well-recognised 35-storey tower in the heart of the West End which famously stood empty for more than a decade after it was built. He was ranked 303rd in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, which estimated his wealth at £312million. His stately home was once the target of Britain's biggest ever burglary on a private property in 2006, when a gang of thieves made off with antiques and art worth £30million. Ringleader Daniel O'Loughlin, 35, was jailed for 11 years in 2008 for his role in the heist.","Stefan Persson, 67, is set to build nine-bed manor with pool in Wiltshire .
