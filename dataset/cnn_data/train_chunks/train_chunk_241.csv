"(CNN) -- Snapchat will add new privacy features after a hack last week that exposed millions of phone numbers and user names from the popular photo- and video-sharing app. The company said in a blog post it will be updating the app to allow users to opt out of a ""Find Friends"" feature that uses their mobile phone number. They'll also be adding internal restrictions that will make it more difficult to employ the method hackers say they used to expose 4.6 million accounts. ""The Snapchat community is a place where friends feel comfortable expressing themselves and we're dedicated to preventing abuse,"" Snapchat said in the post, which did not include an apology to its users. On Tuesday, hackers posted user names and phone numbers, with the final two numbers redacted, to a website called SnapchatDB.info. The site had been suspended by its Web host but, by Friday, appeared to be back online with phone numbers and user names both partially disguised. The site made the data available for download and offered, by request, to consider releasing unredacted info, which matched the user names with the phone numbers associated with them. The hack appears to have been an effort to push Snapchat into improving its privacy protections. ""Our motivation behind the release was to raise the public awareness around the issue, and also put public pressure on Snapchat to get this exploit fixed,"" the hackers said in a statement released to news outlets. ""It is understandable that tech startups have limited resources but security and privacy should not be a secondary goal. Security matters as much as user experience does."" Last week, Gibson Security -- a group of ""white hat"" hackers, meaning they don't exploit the security gaps they find -- published what they said was code that would enable such a hack. The SnapchatDB group said Snapchat implemented ""very minor obstacles"" after that. In the blog post, Snapchat said it had added security measures after Gibson suggested in August that such a hack was possible, but that the group's Christmas Eve post had more details that made Snapchat's system easier to exploit. Sources told Business Insider last month that Snapchat has about 30 million monthly active users and more than 16 million daily users.","Snapchat will let users opt out of ""Find Friends"" after last week's hack .

"(CNN) -- The checkered flag has only just fallen on the final Formula One race of the year in Brazil but the sport's top car designer is already predicting a spicy 2014 season. Adrian Newey is the man behind the Red Bull racer that has powered Sebastian Vettel and the team to four straight world championships. But the Englishman is not taking Red Bull's dominance for granted as major rule changes loom on the horizon. Next year, each team must package its car around a new turbo engine as well as complying with aerodynamic rule changes which will mainly affect the design of the cars' front and rear wings. ""The aerodynamic changes are big,"" explained Newey to Formula1.com. ""But they are smaller than the changes we had in 2009. ""So yes, there is the chance that one team comes up with a car that is better than their rivals', but on top of that you have the engine changes. ""What is absolutely unclear is whether one engine manufacturer will be able to come up with a significant advantage. ""But the car that will brush aside all others will be a car having the combination of good engine and good chassis -- if one side is letting you down you will have a problem. ""Who will come up with the ideal combination? That's the big guessing game for all of us and will add spice to the 2014 season."" Red Bull will continue to be powered by Renault while Mercedes and Ferrari will pit their new 1.6-litre, V6 engines against the French engine manufacturer. The 2014 cars will also rely on more hybrid power harvested from Energy Recovery Systems (ERS). While these elements of the car are out of Newey's hands, the Englishman, who says he has received offers to join rival teams, remains in charge of Red Bull's car design as the team's chief technical officer. There has already been speculation within the sport that the 2014 cars will be less easy on the eye than this season's sleek racers. It's a theory that also irks Newey, who still uses a drawing board to sketch out the design of his peerless machines. ""Ideally the car is fast and has a stylish design,"" the former Williams and McLaren designer continued. ""But everybody in the paddock will give a fast car preference over an attractive car -- that's the way it is. ""Yes, for me it would be good if a bit more consideration was given to aesthetics in the drafting of the regulations. But fast is paramount over beauty."" Newey and his team of more than 100 engineers have been working on Red Bull's 2014 for many months, even while juggling the demands of winning current championships. Amazing brain . But the Englishman, rated as the sport's leading car designer, was still willing to share some tips on preparing for a major rule change -- even if there could be a slight danger that rivals such as Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren might just pinch some of his ideas. ""The first thing that you do is to read the regulations -- very, very carefully,"" he explained. ""You try to read what they actually say, rather than what they intend to say, as this is not always the same thing. ""After that I'm actually breaking it down into bite-size chunks. Then you try to understand from the regulations the aerodynamic and mechanical packaging that appears to be the best solutions for those different areas. ""You go away and research them and at some point try to bring it all back together again. For me that is the important bit: the end product should be a whole and not pieces thrown together into one cluster. ""Does it still look a good idea after 24 hours? That decides whether it gets a tick or a cross. ""Actually, you develop a sensibility for that procedure. The brain is an amazing thing: you might be doing something completely different -- maybe making a cup of tea -- and suddenly you know right from wrong!"" The most coveted designer in Formula One will find out whether he has got it right or wrong when testing for the new season begins next January.","Red Bull car designer Adrian Newey says 2014 rule changes will spice up new season .

"(CNN) -- The body of a man found Saturday in a mangrove area near Miami may be that of a 42-year-old passenger who fell Thursday from a small plane, police said. ""Even though we presume that the body found is that of Gerardo Nales, investigators are pending 'official identification' from the Medical Examiner's Office,"" said Miami-Dade Police Department spokesman Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, in a statement. The body was discovered at 10:30 a.m., he said. Authorities had been looking for the Key Biscayne man since a pilot's mayday distress call sent them scrambling. ""I have a door ajar,"" said the pilot of the single-engine Piper PA-46 aircraft, ""and a passenger that fell down."" Nales, the only other person aboard, ""opened the back door and he just fell down the plane,"" the pilot said, according to a recording of his conversation with air traffic controllers. The pilot said he was flying Thursday afternoon at an altitude of 1,800 feet about two miles from shore when the incident occurred. The search was called off later that night and resumed Friday at daybreak. A police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped.

"(CNN) -- A large group of Baltimore corrections officers and members of a notorious prison gang have been working together to peddle drugs, phones and sex inside the city's jail, prosecutors say. But an indictment released this week is another shot, prosecutors say, at putting an end to it. The indictment, announcing charges on 14 more Baltimore corrections officers, reads like a script from the now defunct HBO crime drama ""The Wire."" But the U.S. Attorney's Office for Maryland says this drama involving a prison gang, the Black Guerrilla Family, and a growing number of Baltimore jail guards has gone on for too long. ""Correctional officers were in bed with BGF inmates,"" said U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein seemed to mean that both literally and figuratively, court documents show. According to one indictment, alleged gang member Tavon White had a sexual relationship with four jail guards while he was incarcerated. Former guards accused of smuggling cell phones into Texas prison . He impregnated all four of them and they all helped him smuggle items into prison, according to the indictment. One of the guards had ""Tavon"" tattooed on her wrist, the indictment said. In January, White summed up his standing in the prison while talking on a cell phone that had been smuggled in, the indictment says . ""This is my jail. You understand that? I'm dead serious. ... I make every final call in this jail ... and nothing go past me. ... Any of my brothers that deal with anybody, it's gonna come to me. Before (somebody) stab somebody, they gotta run it through me,"" White said. according to the indictment. Correctional officers were allegedly bribed to smuggle in drugs, cell phones and other prohibited objects, which they hid underneath their clothes, ""inside body cavities,"" even in sandwiches, the indictment said. New Orleans jail video shows drugs, guns, filth . Some inmates who weren't part of the gang had to pay protection money -- or more accurately, their relatives on the outside did -- authorities claim. ""Court documents allege the BGF members recruited correctional officers through personal and often sexual relationships, as well as bribes, and that some officers traded sex for money,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in its news release. The end result was what Rosenstein's office called a ""criminal organization"" operating inside jails ""enabling (participants) to make large amounts of money through drug trafficking, robbery, assault, extortion, bribery, witness retaliation, money laundering and obstruction of justice."" The investigation first came to light in April with the announcement of the first round of arrests. In all, 44 people have been indicted on federal charges.

"(CNN) -- Delayed, but a go. That's what ""Fast & Furious"" actor Vin Diesel told fans Sunday night about the franchise's seventh installment. He posted a message and photograph on Facebook that showed the last scene he and Paul Walker filmed together. ""There was a unique sense of completion, of pride we shared... in the film we were now completing... the magic captured... and, in just how far we've come...,"" Diesel wrote, announcing a new release date for the film -- April 10, 2015. ""P.s. He'd want you to know first...,"" he said. The movie had been scheduled for a July 2014 release, but production was put on hold following Walker's sudden death. Walker, 40, and the rest of the ""Fast & Furious"" cast were on a short break for Thanksgiving when he stepped into a red 2005 Porsche Carerra GT for a short ride around a Santa Clarita, California, business park. Investigators believe the car, driven by Walker's friend, was speeding when it clipped a light pole and was engulfed in flames, killing both men. Walker's ex-cop character, Brian O'Conner, was central to five of the first six ""Fast & Furious"" stories, and his death left the future of the next film in doubt. Millions of dollars are at stake, considering the franchise has sold $2.6 billion in tickets around the world since 2001.

"(CNN) -- They met in elementary school, began a romance during World War II and married not long afterward. They had a lifelong devotion to each other as husband and wife that lasted nearly 66 years -- and one day earlier this month they died, just 11 hours apart. Their children call it their ""final act of love."" Harold Knapke, 91, and his wife, Ruth, 89, died August 11 at the Versailles Health Care Center nursing home in Russia, Ohio, spokeswoman Teresa Pohlmon said. Their children said they were nine days short of their 66th wedding anniversary. ""It's consoling to us that they went together,"" said their daughter, Margaret Knapke. ""On one hand it's difficult to lose both parents at once when you didn't see it coming ... but it's very consoling that they got to go together."" According to Margaret, her father's health had been deteriorating more quickly than her mother's for about a year. ""We would ask, 'Why is he still here?'"" Margaret said. ""And the answer was that he was here for Mom."" ""He loved her very dearly. He was extremely loyal. He wanted to be here with her,"" she added. ""He would sleep all day toward the end but when he'd wake the first thing he'd ask is, 'Where's your mother? How's your mother?'"" Decades of love sound like this . Margaret said Ruth contracted a rare infection shortly before her death and it was clear she was not going to recover. When Margaret and her siblings told her father the news, she recalled, he took it calmly but they saw a ""shift"" in him. Just a few days later, Margaret and one of her sisters noticed that their father appeared to be very ill, she said. ""My sister said, 'It's almost like he's trying to catch up to Mom.'"" Three days later, Harold died, at 7:30 a.m. ""I think he realized what was happening and wanted to pave the way for her,"" the couple's son, Ted Knapke, said. After their father died, the Knapke children surrounded their mother -- who was not lucid -- and told her, ""Dad's up there waiting. They got the card game going and it's time you got up there. Don't stick around for us,"" Ted Knapke said. Ruth Knapke died that night, at 6:30 p.m. ""I think certainly when two people are that close for 66 years you become pretty in sync mentally. So regardless of their state I think they realized it was time,"" Ted Knapke said. Ruth and Harold Knapke met when they were students at the same elementary school in Ohio but were separated when Harold's family moved several towns away, according to Carol Romie, another daughter of the Knapkes. ""Dad was a year ahead of Mom and I remember Mom would tell us, 'I had a crush on your dad when I was in the third grade,'"" Margaret Knapke said. It wasn't until Harold was serving in World War II and stationed in Germany that their relationship began. Ruth's brother-in-law Steve, who was also serving, overheard that Harold was from the same county in Ohio as Ruth and suggested that Harold write to her. Their relationship grew from there, according to their daughter Ginny Reindl. ""Mom knew who he was right away,"" Margaret Knapke said of her mother's reaction to the letter. The two continued to write each other until Harold returned from the war in 1945. The couple married two years later, on August 20, 1947, and had six children together: Carol, Pat, Margaret, Ginny, Ted and Tim. Harold worked in Ohio's Fort Recovery school system as a principal, teacher and coach and Ruth became a school secretary. ""I guess to me, the most important part of the story was their dedication to each other -- loyal right to the end,"" Romie said. ""Supportive and protective of each other, and that was the beautiful part. They worked at being married for 65 years. It didn't just happen. They went into it with the idea that this was forever, and it was. They made it that way."" The two were laid to rest together in a joint funeral. ""Mom and Dad were ordinary people,"" Reindl said. ""I guess if people can learn from our story it's that there is love that lasts, and that's a good thing.""","Harold and Ruth Knapke were married for nearly 66 years .

"Washington (CNN) -- In mid-October, political pundits wondered how House Republicans could have put their sizable majority in jeopardy by forcing a government shutdown. Polls showed Republicans getting most of the blame for the shutdown and Democrats taking a lead in generic match ups against GOP congressional candidates. But those gains were quickly wiped away by the disastrous roll out of President Barack Obama's signature health care law. Within weeks, Democrats were panicking that their support of Obamacare could cost them their Senate majority and risk losing more House seats. House Democratic campaign chief Rep. Steve Israel of New York shrugged off GOP declarations that the new health care law's failures spelled doom for Democrats in the midterms, telling CNN in an interview, ""if Republicans are going to run on rooting for failure, then so be it."" Instead Israel insists House Republicans owned the shutdown and ""2014 will not be referendum on the President, it's a referendum on whether you want to elect a Republican who will continue to do damage, it's about a do-nothing or do-damage Congress."" Poll suggests Obamacare could have cost Obama second term . GOP confident Obamacare will continue to hurt Democrats in midterms . Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry, who heads the effort to recruit GOP candidates to unseat Democrats and expand the House GOP majority, told CNN any blowback from the ""brief moment"" of shutdown in October will ""melt away"" but health care problems will persist. ""The shutdown ended. Obamacare will still be painful six months from now and a year from now,"" he said. House Democrats need to pick up 17 GOP Congressional seats to win back the majority in the House of Representatives. But they also need to protect a list of roughly two dozen incumbent Democrats who represent red-leaning and purple districts. GOP members say while Obama isn't on the ballot, he remains a major factor in the midterms. The president's record low poll numbers and questions about his credibility after failing to follow through on a key promise about his health care plan are causing a drag on Democratic incumbents and challengers. Some already compare this midterm and Obamacare to the one that cost the Republicans their House majority in 2006, when then-President George W. Bush faced questions about his handling of Hurricane Katrina and the unpopular Iraq war pulled down his approval ratings. ""President Obama is very close to the low point of where President Bush was,"" Rep. Greg Walden, chair of National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters last week. ""Those of us who were here in those days remember how it felt going into the '06 election and it wasn't good."" Poll: Voters split over Democrats, Republicans in 2014 . The House GOP midterm playbook is a straightforward one -- highlight the problems with Obamacare and its economic impact. Walden says for now Congressional Republicans don't need to supply an alternative health care plan of their own because the Democratic-led Senate and the White House would never consider a GOP proposal. While a group of 39 House Democrats sought to put distance between themselves and the President last week by backing a House GOP bill that allows insurers to offer current health care policies for another year, House Democratic leaders continue to stress Obamacare will turn out to be a net positive for the party by next fall. ""Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act."" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in an interview with NBC on Sunday. Pelosi defends Obamacare claims, can't predict effect on Dems in midterms . The Democratic National Committee distributed a memo this week using examples of GOP candidates like Mitt Romney and Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli who ran against Obamacare and lost. The memo concluded, ""while Republicans are campaigning to bring back a broken health care system, Democrats will be campaigning on Obamacare."" For those new Democratic candidates who weren't in Washington when Obamacare was passed, Israel says he advises new candidates to run as ""problem-solvers, running on solutions."" And he points to internal polling across competitive districts that shows that voters prefer a candidate who wants to ""fix and improve"" Obamacare rather than one who vows to ""repeal and defund"" the law 55%-40%. But a new ABC/Washington Post poll out on Tuesday found that four in 10 Americans were more likely to oppose a candidate who backed the law, and only about one-fifth saying they are likely to vote for a politician who supports the law. McHenry points to House Republican challengers who have personal experiences with the new health care law, saying they will work tirelessly to link Democrats to it. Stewart Mills, who oversees 6,000 employees in his family's business in northeastern Minnesota, is a top GOP recruit running against Democratic Rep Rick Nolan. He talks about his company's health care costs and highlights his opposition to Obamacare as a key reason for entering the race. Republicans believe several candidates who narrowly lost to Democrats in 2012 in competitive districts in Arizona, North Carolina, and Utah will prevail in rematches in 2014 because this time House Democrats won't have the help of a presidential ticket boosting turnout. House Democrats say GOP record of dysfunction will cost them seats . The focus now is squarely on Obamacare, but Democrats believe the political debate will move into better territory for them as attention returns to fiscal fights on Capitol Hill. The short-term deal to reopen the government created a mid-December target for Congress to agree to a budget, and a January deadline for funding the government. The Treasury's borrowing authority runs out in mid-February. House Dems cool down after Obamacare meeting . The number two House Democrat complained on Tuesday that House Budget Conference Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and other congressional Republicans weren't serious about budget negotiations, and warned the government could again be facing a shutdown. ""Paul Ryan ought to lead, not follow his caucus down a road, which would lead to shutdown. That would be irresponsible and harmful and I hope he doesn't do that,"" Rep Steny Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday. The Democratic Congressional campaign committee believes the shutdown was a recruiting bonanza for them, and helped contribute to some recent GOP retirements. Israel points to eight GOP seats that were put in play directly because of the extended standoff. Omaha City Councilman Pete Festersen jumped in the race against Nebraska GOP Rep. Lee Terry after Terry said he needed his government paycheck to afford his home. On his campaign website, Festersen positions himself as an outsider: ""I am running for Congress to help change a dysfunctional Washington. The time has come for moderate minds and respectful leaders to work together."" Democrats also say Republicans' lack of diversity and inability to reach out beyond their base -- a major factor in their national loss in 2012 -- will also hurt their chances to make inroads in Democratic districts in 2014. ""The movement is underway and it takes time,"" McHenry admitted. But he pointed to GOP candidate Carl DeMaio in San Diego, who is challenging Democratic Rep. Scott Peters. DeMaio is openly gay and backed by the House GOP campaign arm. Seven keys to the 2014 midterms .","Democratic gains brought on by shutdown wiped away by Obamacare fiasco .

"(CNN) -- Friends describe Mia Vayner as boisterous, outgoing and passionate. She's not afraid to tell you what she thinks and has a wicked sense of humor. ""Mia is a go-getter,"" says her wife Evelyn Vayner. ""She has lived a life with setback after setback... yet she manages to look at the future and go after what she wants with more vigor and fight than anyone else I have ever known."" That innate drive made Evelyn certain Mia would accomplish her latest goal: to lose more than 250 pounds, despite her paraplegia. Evelyn met Mia while she was backpacking around Australia in the late 1990s. Mia grew up in the outback and offered to show Evelyn around. Their friendship quickly grew into something more. ""I realized that Mia was transgender and given that I'm from NYC, I truly thought nothing of it,"" Evelyn says. ""I was immediately taken by her openness."" The couple now lives in Flushing, Queens. Mia is a hotel consultant and blogger; Evelyn works in publishing. At her heaviest in 2009, Mia weighed close to 540 pounds. Evelyn had also battled obesity her entire life. Late-night binges, empty bags of chips and emotional eating were common in their house. One day, Mia decided she'd had enough. ""A lot of people think once you're in a wheelchair, you're just nothing,"" she says. ""The doctors said, 'There, there, good fat person.' And I said, 'Screw that.'"" Mia ditched her motorized wheelchair and built a new one from a few broken chairs she got off Craigslist. Her ""Frankenchair,"" as she called it, had a sporty design that allowed her to move more efficiently. She started off slowly -- pushing herself around the block. In the first month, she lost 50 pounds. By the time she had lost 100 pounds, she was pushing herself a mile every morning. Evelyn and Mia decided to change their diet, as well. A lifelong vegan, Mia had always eaten good food -- ""but you can eat a lot of vegan food."" They cut back on portion sizes and started shopping for locally grown, organic produce. ""When we set out to make this change, we knew that it would be a slow road,"" Evelyn said. ""We wanted it to be a slow road because we knew that fast weight loss had always led to ultimate failure."" To keep her goal attainable, Mia told herself she would lose 10 pounds 30 times. She bought a fishbowl and pulled a treat out of it every time she reached another mini-goal. By April 2011 she weighed 325 pounds. ""I do cheat,"" Mia says. ""It's no good saying, 'I'm never going to have chocolate cake again' because your wife will find you on the floor at 3 a.m. with chocolate all over your face."" Mia doesn't like to talk about the incident that left her partially paralyzed below the waist. A physical assault when she was young damaged the nerves in her back, severely weakening her spine. Another accident in her early 40s exacerbated the condition and left her with minimal feeling in her legs. ""I haven't stood up since Bush was president,"" she likes to joke. But her disability hasn't stopped her from doing the activities she loves. She does judo from her wheelchair. She swims 2 miles every morning and is thinking about competing in a triathlon. Mia also loves rock climbing. She and Evelyn joined the NYC Adaptive Climbing group and started climbing two to three times a week at Brooklyn Boulders. Kareemah Batts, founder of Adaptive Climbing Inc., saw Mia's determination her first day. In the beginning Mia was frustrated that climbing didn't come easily, Batts says, but she wouldn't quit. ""You're fighting with your body to do something that it doesn't do,"" Batts told Mia. Mia now weighs 265 pounds and is still losing weight. Her cholesterol and blood pressure levels are normal, and she no longer has type 2 diabetes. She's gone from wearing a size 36 dress to wearing a size 16. ""The weight loss has changed her outlook on life and her self-respect, and also has given her another way to connect with her community,"" Evelyn says. ""It has reinvigorated our mutual interest in all kinds of things we thought were not possible.""","At her heaviest, Mia Vayner weighed around 540 pounds .

"(CNN) -- It was not the present cricket fans would have asked for when they woke up bleary eyed on Christmas morning. Jacques Kallis, arguably the greatest all-rounder in the history of the game, has announced he will retire from Test match cricket following the second Test against India which begins on December 26. Kallis, 38, made the announcement in a statement Wednesday following a career which has spanned 18 years and 165 Test matches. ""It has been an honor and a privilege to have been part of the South African Test team since making my debut 18 years ago,"" he said. ""I have enjoyed every moment out in the middle but I just feel that the time is right to hang up my Test whites. ""It wasn't an easy decision to come to, especially with Australia around the corner and the success this team is enjoying, but I feel that I have made my contribution in this format."" Kallis made his debut against England as a 20-year-old in December 1995 and has scored 13,174 runs at an average of 55.12, with 44 centuries and 58 half-centuries. He sits fourth on the list of leading run scorers behind the recently retired Sachin Tendulkar, Australia's Ricky Ponting and India's Rahul Dravid. Kallis, whose bowling was also a crucial part of his role in the South Africa team, gained him 292 wickets while he also held on to 199 catches. He will remain available for limited overs cricket and could feature in the Twenty20 World Cup in Bangladesh in March. Kallis hade made 11,574 runs in 325 one-day internationals and providing he remains fit, should be on course to play a key role in Australia and New Zealand at the 50-over World Cup in 2015. ""The last two years specifically have been a memorable journey with an exceptional group of cricketers,"" Kallis said. ""I am fortunate enough to have ended my Test career amongst a group of talented cricketers but more importantly, friends whom I will cherish for years to come. ""I don't see it as goodbye because I still have a lot of hunger to push South Africa to that World Cup in 2015 if I am fit and performing. ""Winning an IPL title with the Kolkata Knight Riders was a special achievement, and I am still determined to taste that success with South Africa at an ICC event."" Kallis has been an integral part of the Proteas side which has risen to World No.1 in the Test match rankings. Under captain Graeme Smith, he has been one of the outstanding players alongside fast bowler Dale Steyn, batsman Hashim Amla and the talented AB de Villiers. He was named as the International Cricket Council's Player of the Year in 2005 along with England's Andrew Flintoff as well as being named Test match Player of the Year following an incredible season where he scored five centuries in consecutive matches.

""The impact Jacques has made on South African cricket has been immense, not just as a player but as a human being,"" he said. ""I'm not sure we will ever see another player of that stature very soon. ""Jacques calmness, maturity and presence in the change room will sorely be missed and hopefully he will still be able to play a role in this team's success in the near future.

"(CNN) -- President Obama called it ""the defining issue of our time"" in his 2012 State of the Union, but he did so without ever uttering the phrase ""income inequality."" Perhaps that's because income inequality is one of those alliterative word pairs everyone's heard by now but few fully understand. Instead of wonking up his speech with terms that may confuse some, Obama focused on the more familiar American Dream. That's ""the basic American promise,"" as he put it, ""that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement. ""The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive,"" he continued. ""No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important."" But what, exactly, is income inequality, and why does it matter so much in modern America that you would vote on it as one of the top social justice issues of our time? Here's a snack-sized primer: . A definition of income inequality . Income inequality refers to how evenly or unevenly income is distributed in a society. The United States has a relatively high level of income inequality because the very richest people take home a large share of the economic pie -- and there is a relatively large gap between them and some of the poorest people in America. Scandinavian countries have lower levels of income inequality because, overall, prosperity is more broadly distributed there, instead of being concentrated in the hands of a few. There are other variations of inequality, too. Some economists think ""wealth inequality"" is a better measure of what's happening in the United States, since the super-rich are even farther away from the rest of us when you consider their assets, not just their incomes. Some prefer the broader term ""economic inequality."" How is income inequality measured? The most popular measure of inequality is called the Gini coefficient. That coefficient, or index, ""measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution,"" according to the World Bank. A rating of 0 means the society in question is perfectly equal -- or everyone has the same income. A rating of 100 means that one person takes home 100% of the income. The United States has a Gini rating of 45, according to the CIA World Factbook. Sweden, the most-equal country, gets a rating of 23. Lesotho, in southern Africa, has the highest Gini coefficient on the CIA's list with a rating of 63.2. There are other ways to measure inequality, too, such as looking at the income held by the richest 20% and comparing it to that held by the poorest 20%. All of the different measures try to answer the question: How is money distributed in this place? What's the trend in the United States? The reason the president and others keep talking about income inequality -- with or without calling it that -- is because the income gap in America has been growing since the late 1970s. Experts disagree on exactly why, but most say it has something to do with cutting taxes on the very richest Americans and the growth of the finance industry. Technology also likely contributes to the shift, as many middle-class workers have seen their jobs taken by machines. Meanwhile, the very richest people are taking home a larger share of income than at any time since the late 1920s. Is more income inequality necessarily bad? Pretty much no one these days thinks everyone in the United States should have exactly the same income. But many economists and philosophers say extreme income inequality -- and many would argue that's what we have -- is a problem. The economist Joseph Stiglitz argues income inequality is ""holding back"" our recovery from the recession. The epidemiologist Kate Pickett says high income inequality is associated with all sorts of bad things -- from obesity to high incarceration rates and violence. The philosopher Thomas Pogge told me societies can become so economically divided that people stop seeing each other as equals -- and a sort of classist, ""Downton Abbey"" dynamic develops. Others argue income inequality hampers economic mobility -- meaning it's less likely that that American Dream is actually a reality for people. Think of the economy as a ladder, former U.S. labor secretary Robert Reich told me. If the rungs of the ladder are super far apart, how can you expect a person to climb? More-conservative thinkers argue that income inequality is necessary for a capitalist society to thrive -- that income gaps encourage competition, innovation and hard work. How is the use more unequal than Nigeria? If you look at the CIA's list of the most equal and unequal countries, the United States ranks below a whole host of nations that most Americans probably wouldn't want to move to. They include: Iran, Uganda, Nigeria, Russia, Senegal, Nicaragua, Mali, Mauritania, Vietnam, Yemen, Mongolia. I could go on and on. It's important to keep in mind that, in this case, the Gini coefficient is being used to measure inequalities within a given society. South Africa has a very high rate of income inequality because it does have both very wealthy and very poor people. There aren't many rich people in Niger, another country that's more equal than the United States. If everyone is more or less poor -- a country still could be relatively equal. So, that's a caveat. But there still is research to support the idea that very high levels of income inequality tear at the fabric of society, regardless of its overall wealth. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Income inequality has been growing in the United States since the late 1970s .

"Show us how you celebrate Christmas in your part of the world . (T+L) -- Blame it on my childhood. During the 1970s in suburban Worcester, Massachusetts, it was long my mother's ambition to grace our brick Colonial with hush-inducing purity. She thought that by putting a single candle in each of the windows at Christmas, our house would be the envy of the neighborhood— a magical locus of holiday coziness and kinship, the visual equivalent of nutmeg. What transpired, though, out of inertia and a fear of flames, was a different matter altogether. She bought only two candles, both electric, which were put in two ground-floor windows. Their streaky, uncertain light took the form of two vertical smears on either side of our front door; it looked like our house was crying. The following week, my mother and I drove by a neighbor's extravagantly decorated home—gobs of colorful, twinkly bulbs swathing house and shrubbery; a sleigh; windows caked with aerosol snow. Mom: ""We're gonna need more candles."" We never got those candles, and so my interest in this garish form of beauty is born of deprivation. By turns awesome and hokey, Christmas lights reflect man's struggle to create something as beautiful as dusk or dawn; they're fireworks in suspended animation. Their earliest historical antecedent is probably the pagan Yule log of northern Europe, which burned for many days during the dark winter solstice, thus rendering it a symbol of hope. T+L: America's prettiest winter towns . But if the contemporary iterations of this symbol are any guide—so often does a Milky Way of man-made twinkle reveal a rat's maze of black electrical cable—then the current byword would seem to be less hope and more Martha Stewart's worst nightmare. Indeed—whether in Worcester or Copenhagen or Hong Kong or Medellín, Colombia—Christmas lights have the curious ability simultaneously to slightly repel us and to put us at ease. At first blush we think, ""Good Lord, what is this wanton, throbbing blight on the landscape, and what is its potential damage to the world's energy resources?"" But upon further reflection we decide, ""Let's find a parking space, shall we?"" Hark, the Mission Inn Hotel & Spa, in Riverside, California, where 3.6 million lights annually shed their buxom charms on 400-plus animated figures, horse-drawn-carriage rides, Santa, fireworks, and live reindeer! Hark, the light-bedecked Tanglin Mall, in Singapore, just 85 miles north of the equator, where children have been known to throw ""snowballs"" created by a foam-making machine at a shopping center lined with luxury boutiques! Hark, the Simmons family of Cathedral City, California's Dancing Christmas Light Show, with seven miles of cable, more than 150,000 LED lights, and narration over a short-range radio station called the Icicle from a former Price Is Right announcer! T+L: The world's most traditional holiday foods . Christmas lights are a civic obligation. They're a form of advertising. They're a gateway drug for other holiday dysfunction. Whatever their particular function—and regardless of whether they're hung by cities or their residents—all these twinkling bulbs help broaden the definition of Christmas. Sure, everyone knows that an elegant wreath of holly, when secured to a mantel or antique wooden door, can distill end-of-year cheer faster than you can say ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" or how stumbling upon pine boughs that are maypoled up a shepherd's-crook streetlight can suddenly transform you into a ruddy-cheeked Dickens character with a name like Mrs. Cumbersnoot. But what of the giant, green fluorescent clam whose Santa hat of twinkly lights looks like a strange, predatory apostrophe? What of the scrum of light-saddled fiberglass elves that have been cunningly gathered around a city hall's drainpipe? These, too, are Christmas, my friend. And these, too, have their charms. For those of us who enjoy Christmas-light viewing as a spectator sport, it's the regional or location-specific twists that linger long in the mind. When a standard-bearer like New York City's Rockefeller Center trots out its towering tree, or Vienna strings up its giant, globular, all-white chandeliers of lights that lead up to St. Stephen's Cathedral, both efforts yield a generalized Christmas ideal that could be happening anywhere in the world. But you know you're in Ocean City, Maryland, when you see lights that portray how Santa hooked a marlin while trolling from his charter boat, the HoHoHo. You know you're in San Antonio, Texas, when 1.8 million lights on 200 trees and 20 bridges illuminate flesh-and-blood carolers who warble from the decks of passing river barges. Or maybe the absence of lights is a clue to your location: consider the Sichuan restaurant in Beijing that has covered its tree not with radiant bulbs but with chili peppers. Or maybe, best/worst case scenario, the concept of location itself is altogether a moot point. Think of the swirling cloud of cultural dissonance you'd witness if you traveled to Copenhagen's Tivoli Park to look at the lights strung on the park's Japanese pagoda. For the full effect, you'll probably want to wear a guayabera and recite from the Koran. T+L: America's best hot chocolate . I also welcome a tiny amount of emperilment to my viewing; a whiff of danger can be a valuable component in the one-two punch of repulsion and ease. ""Due to high electrical voltage, please DO NOT enter the show area or yard for any reason! Failure to observe this rule could result in serious injury or death"": this is a warning not for a downtown area or a rodeo, but rather for a private home (belonging to the aforementioned Simmons family of Cathedral City). Suddenly the stakes are raised. Suddenly I'm on board. Indeed, there have been instances where I've walked toward some of these twitching, thrumming displays—and suddenly feared that these giant spiderwebs of pulsing electricity are bug zappers, but for people. It's all too easy to imagine how my body would ricochet from bulb to bulb, emitting a scarifying screech of smoke and crackle, whereupon I'd crash to the floor, a human crouton. So often do lighting displays' rickety natures or excessiveness lead to anxiety that it takes no effort to misread a haphazardly copyedited 1995 article from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Visitors to Atlanta's Starr Park, the article claimed, would encounter ""a playground area decorated with lighted reindeer."" Run, Blitzen! A brush with danger, followed by a sense of relief: looking at Christmas lights is a slap and then a kiss. I remember sitting in a café in the Piazza della Rotonda, in Rome, some years ago, half of my then-boyfriend Jess's face illuminated by a fiery crimson glow from a string of Christmas lights hanging on the building's front. The slash of red slicing across his face gave him the look of an angry elf or of the ""before and after"" picture in an infomercial for satanic rituals. I couldn't reconcile the shaky, blood-evocative light with Jess's button-down temperament and oxford shirt, nor with the magisterial, late-evening hush of the piazza and its dusty stone monuments. But then I looked across the square at the centuries-old Pantheon and thought of ancient Rome. I thought, Centurions, pillaging, vino. I thought, Bacchanalia, bonfires. Just then, it all came together for me. And what of my mother and Christmas? The electric candles have long since been lost. A few years back, Mom moved to a retirement community in Durham, North Carolina, whose gift shop she manages. She recently told me, ""Last year I hung all my Christmas lights and swags in the shop. But afterward I was too lazy to put them away in boxes, so they're all in my bathtub now."" This month, these bulbs and boughs and wreaths will decorate the gift shop again, but Mom and I will be in Key West. We're excited about the prospect of Floridian holiday excess, and we're fairly certain the island will cough up some high-level twinkle. I told Mom that last year's festivities there included a Harbor Walk of Lights, a lighted boat parade, a vodka-company-sponsored tour of decorated Victorian guesthouses, and an underwater light display. She weighed in with, ""Their decorating committee is very active."" Christmas will once more shine Mylar-bright. There will definitely be enough candles. Planning a getaway?

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A double car bomb attack outside of a hotel in Somalia's capital Wednesday night killed at least one person and injured up to a dozen others, police said. Police official Yusuf Ali said the first suicide car bomb exploded outside the main gate of the Jazeera Palace Hotel, with the second blast from a parked car following as first responders began gathering to evacuate the injured. Three of the wounded were security personnel stationed outside the gate. At the time of the Mogadishu blasts, there were several senior members of the Somali government inside the Jazeera hotel. It is believed the injured guards were part of the security detail of government officials. Of the 12 people injured, some were seriously wounded and transported to local hospitals. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Last month, another bombing at a hotel in the capital left five people dead and at least 15 wounded, a government spokesman said. A car bomb went off on November 8 outside Hotel Makkah Al-Mukarama in central Mogadishu, Abdikarim Hussein Guled, the African country's interior and national security minister, told local media. Those killed included Abdulkadir Ali, the Somalian government's former acting envoy to Britain better known as ""Dhub,"" said Abdirahman Omar Osman, presidential spokesperson. Some of Somalia's violence has been traced to Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group and was behind the deadly siege earlier this fall of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall. A U.S. military drone strike in southern Somalia in late October killed two suspected Al-Shabaab members, U.S. officials said. And a recent joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces killed at least 30 people believed to be part of that group. In September 2012, Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, escaped an apparent assassination attempt at the Jazeera hotel, just two days after being selected as the troubled country's new leader. According to a presidential press officer and several journalists at the scene, early indications are that the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers who set off explosives at the gates of the Jazeera Palace Hotel, where the president was having high-level meetings. At least four Somali government soldiers and one African Union soldier were killed in that attack, according to journalists at the scene. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu, and CNN's Ray Sanchez wrote this story from New York.","Double car bombs explode near Somali hotel .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago, nearly to the day, I arrived at Oxford University with my wife of six months to become the first rabbi in residence in decades. I had just turned 22. My mandate was simple: Deepen Jewish identity among the Jewish students and cultivate values-based leadership among the students at large. What I never expected to be my mission, but what eventually became central to everything I did, was defending Israel against ferocious and unjust assault. I quickly discovered that universities in general, and elite universities in particular, are breeding grounds for anti-Israel bias. We beat back many attempts over 11 years to slander Israel as an expansionist, neo-colonialist power and succeeded in portraying the true nature of the Middle East's only democracy. We hosted six Israeli prime ministers and countless other eloquent defenders of the Jewish state. But since I returned to the United States, the situation among academics has only become worse. Just after Pink Floyd's Roger Waters compared Israel to Nazi Germany, we have the American Studies Association, comprising about 5,000 academics, voting to boycott Israeli academic institutions. The group is refusing all collaborations with universities, although not individual scholars. The reason, members say, is Israel's human rights abuses against Palestinians and the occupation. Opposing view: Boycott a sting to Israeli apartheid . The ASA has not boycotted any other country in a similar way. Not, say, China, which regularly jails political dissidents for lengthy sentences and commits them to near-slave labor without any judicial process. Liu Xiaobo, who won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, is serving an 11-year sentence on fraudulent subversion charges. His wife, Liu Xia, has been held incommunicado under house arrest for three years even though she has never been charged. So why would Israel, a thriving liberal democracy that guarantees the right of due process to all of its citizens, including minorities, be singled out? If you argue that the reason is Israel's ""occupation"" of Arab lands, the American Studies Association is surely aware of China's brutal occupation of Tibet since 1950. China faces no existential threat. It does not have terrorists blowing up schools and buses and does not have a neighbor building a nuclear bomb threatening to annihilate it. Israel, by contrast, has all of these things. Israel has been under the threat of extermination by its Arab neighbors for six decades, has lost countless citizens to terrorism and has a nuclear-inclined Iran threatening to wipe it off the map. Surely a group of scholars would understand the unique security situation facing a nation that has suffered a genocide of 6 million people just 70 years ago. So why Israel? According to an article in the New York Post, ASA President Curtis Marez said that his group singled out Israel, knowing that many of Israel's neighbors have worse human rights abuses, because ""one has to start somewhere."" At Oxford, I had the privilege of hosting and debating some of the world's leading intellectuals. Never before have I read a more inane quote from a man claiming to be a scholar. That's your reason? One has to start somewhere and that somewhere just happens to be, yet again, the Jews? If it's a matter of choosing a place to start, you could draw straws or perhaps throw dice or pull names from a hat. So, a group of academics just decided it was time to boycott some country and decided, arbitrarily, that Israel was as good as any? This isn't even a case of anti-Semitism so much as buffoonery, not a case of prejudice so much as stupidity. Let's state the real facts. Israel is the Middle East's only democracy, guaranteeing a free press and the right to worship, as well as the rights of women and homosexuals. Although the Arab nations that surround Israel commit unspeakable human rights violations every day, Israel struggles under existential threat to balance its security needs with the freedoms it cherishes. The 1995 interim agreement says, ""Israel and [the Palestinians] will ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples."" Yet Palestinian schools teach hatred of Israel. A U.S. government report finds that 84% of the references to Israelis in Palestinian textbooks are negative. Palestinian universities promote extremism. In 2007, the Washington Institute reported in an article called ""Teaching Terror"" that university campuses are full of Hamas propaganda. Israel has roadblocks and builds fences solely because it got tired of seeing its citizens blown to smithereens. Calling for an academic boycott of Israel for the steps it takes to defend itself is akin to calling for an academic boycott of Britain and the United States during World War II. And, mind you, Israel has never even come close to indiscriminately bombing civilian population centers the way the allies did in that war. Israel takes great care to protect the lives of innocent civilians even as it fights genocidal terror organizations Hamas and Hezbollah. We Americans who cherish freedom, democracy and liberty should be ashamed that a group of our nation's ""scholars"" have so viciously maligned a most humane nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shmuley Boteach.","American Studies Association voted to boycott Israeli academic institutions .

"Chengdu, China (CNN) -- The researcher dressed in blue plastic smock, slippers and gloves is having a tough time getting his work done. Every time Zhang Zhen sets up his camera on a tripod in an effort to document the behavior of one of the panda cubs scattered on a grassy hillside, one particularly frisky baby panda comes wobbling towards him, interrupting his shoot. ""Mumu!"" he yells in frustration, as the four-month old cub rears up on her hind legs, lunging towards him. He picks Mumu up and deposits her at the opposite end of the enclosure. ""I'm not sure why she's been all over me like this. I think she's excited today,"" Zhang says. Mumu is the oldest of fourteen baby pandas that were born last summer here at the Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Chengdu, China. China's panda experts have improved the science of breeding and raising members of this endangered species in captivity. The proof of their success is in the baby panda enclosure, where visitors can watch as the newest generation of pandas takes turns napping, playing and exploring their outdoor habitat. The fuzzy young cubs are still shaky on their feet, and often trip and roll down the enclosure's slight incline. While two cubs wrestle, another tries to climb a tree and then tumbles onto its back, slowly performing a backwards somersault, much to the amusement of onlookers. Giant panda Tian Tian likely miscarried . ""There are new breakthroughs, so that's why the panda population has continued to increase,"" said Deng Tao, the chief zoo keeper at the Chengdu base. When Deng first began working at the base 12 years ago, he said there were only 20 pandas here. Today, the center is responsible for more than 100 animals. Deng recently returned from the Atlanta Zoo, where he spent months assisting with the birth and care of twin cubs who were born there last July. ""Now we have new technologies that can very accurately identify when a panda is ovulating and do artificial insemination during a precise point in the [reproductive] cycle,"" Deng explained. On its website, the Atlanta Zoo credited Deng and his colleagues in Chengdu with developing a technique using incubators and taking turns rotating twin cubs with the mother to better ensure the newborns' chance of survival. ""Before when a panda had twins, the mother panda could only take care of one cub so we have resolved the issue of having twin pandas and helping them to integrate,"" Deng said. The next big challenge facing China's panda keepers involves reintroducing captive animals back to the wild. ""We have made a training base to return pandas to the wild,"" Deng explained. ""Once they are mature and able to forage for food and hide from danger, then we will release some pandas."" National Zoo's panda cub is healthy, officials say . Wildlife conservation groups say China's effort to save the giant panda from extinction is a rare success story. According to the World Wildlife Fund, as of 1988 there were only around 1,000 pandas left living in the wild. In 2004, that number was estimated to have grown to 1,600 wild pandas. More recent panda census statistics are not yet available. ""The government put the resources [into conservation]. They've actually set up some mountains just as a habitat for the panda,"" said May Mei, the chief representative in China for the conservation group WildAid. China has lavished resources on the conservation of the giant panda- rather than on some other indigenous endangered species- in large part because the animal is such an important national symbol. ""They are a treasure for people in China,"" Mei said. The breeding center in Chengdu is also something of a panda theme park. Excerpts from the animated DreamWorks film ""Kung Fu Panda"" play on a giant screen at the entrance to the facility, which receives more than a million visitors a year. Inside, tourists travel in panda mobiles, decorated with the cartoon movie's main character, Po the Panda. In addition to stuffed animal pandas, souvenir shops offer a variety of hats, ear muffs, and even fuzzy nunchucks decorated with the panda's distinctive black-and-white panda patterns. Visitors walk along paths, gazing and taking photos of pandas in large outdoor pens. The animals seem to completely ignore humans. In one pen, a 25-year-old male named Shi-shi lies on his back, gorging himself on bamboo which he holds in his front paw with the help of what trainers call the panda's ""pseudo-thumb."" Other adults seem to spend much of their time fast asleep in their enclosures. But the big lumbering animals clearly have charisma. ""They're cute man!"" says Chris Delbene, a 21-year-old university student from Orego who is studying Chinese in Beijing. ""They live a great lifestyle, play all day, eat, sleep.""

"Bor, South Sudan (CNN) -- Fears that a new civil war could erupt in South Sudan drove leaders of two neighboring African countries into its capital, Juba, Thursday. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, Ethiopian Premier Hailemariam Desalegn and South Sudanese officials had ""very constructive"" talks, but reached no agreements, South Sudan's foreign minister said Thursday. They will meet again Friday with leaders of nations that belong to an East African governmental group, according to Foreign Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin. Kenyatta and Desalegn have called for an immediate end to the fighting, in which South Sudan's President Salva Kiir is fighting a rebellion led by former Vice President Riek Machar, whom he dismissed months ago. News of the summit comes as United Nations officials work feverishly to finalize details of sending peacekeeping reinforcements to South Sudan. The U.N. hopes to send them in no later than Saturday to help protect the 50,000 people now crowding U.N. bases, seeking shelter from the fighting. The U.N. Security Council voted Tuesday to bring the total peacekeeping force up to 12,500 soldiers and 1,323 police officers. At a press briefing, Hilde Frafjord Johnson, the U.N. special representative of the secretary-general, said by teleconference that the fighting threatens to bring back ""nightmares of the past"" -- decades of strife that led to creation of the world's newest country. ""And for us, one of the most important things is to have those nightmares end,"" she said. Recurring nightmare . The bloodletting on Wednesday in the South Sudan city of Bor was a real-time repeat of slaughters 22 years before -- another time in which Machar, then a rebel leader, broke ranks and turned against a former ally. In 1991, when the south still belonged to the nation of Sudan, it fought a bloody civil war against the north. Machar had a falling out with John Garang, who led the fight against the north. That split led to vicious attacks in Bor. People fled. People died. More than two decades later, after South Sudan achieved independence from Khartoum, after it became the world's newest nation, people are again dying. They are again fleeing government troops battling rebel followers of Machar. In Bor, the evidence of fresh blood was everywhere Wednesday. On Christmas Day, the stores were looted, emptied of everything. The hospitals had no medicine, no doctors. Even they ran to save their own lives. Homes lay burned. Razed. On both sides of the main roads, streams of people carried their life's belongings. Even chairs. Sporadic gunfire, mainly warning shots now from government troops, pierced the air. The heavy fighting, for now, was done. President Kiir's soldiers were in control. The rebels were battling elsewhere for control including further north in the city of Malakal, the capital of oil-rich Upper Nile state. The conflict, which broke out mid-month, has led to mass killings as evidenced by mass graves, the United Nations has said. It's a tribal war, in which ethnic interest is placed above national unity. Kiir and Machar are longtime rivals from two different tribal clans -- Kiir, like Garang before him, is from the Dinka tribe, and Machar from the Neur. But the speed with which tensions broke into outright violence took everyone by surprise, the U.N.'s Johnson said Thursday. ""The speed, the gravity and the scale, I think nobody would have expected,"" she said. Humanitarian crisis . On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that those responsible for civilian deaths would be held accountable. ""I once again call on the country's leaders to settle their differences peacefully -- and I underscore their responsibility to protect civilians,"" Ban said. The Peace and Security Council of the African Union expressed ""deep dismay and disappointment that the continent's newest nation should descend so rapidly into internal strife."" As the crisis worsens, aid agencies predict they will need $166 million from now until March to provide water, sanitation, medical care and food. Even in Juba, food is running short. In the last 10 days, 90,000 people have been forced from their homes; 58,000 of them are at U.N. peacekeeping bases. Wounded U.S. Navy SEALs . Bor is where Machar's forces fired on three U.S. military aircraft that were on an evacuation mission Saturday. Four Navy SEALs were injured; the most seriously injured of them was en route Wednesday to the U.S. military hospital facility in Landstuhl, Germany. He had been treated initially in Nairobi, Kenya. ""The fourth injured service member is on his way,"" a U.S. military official with knowledge of the operation said. ""I hear he is doing well."" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the four SEALs were part of an operation to evacuate Americans in and around Bor when the CV-22 Osprey they were aboard was shot down. The Osprey was flown by an Air Force Special Operations team, and the SEALs were aboard to provide security when they landed, the official said. In places like Bor, conflict had become a part of life, except perhaps for a brief time after South Sudan was born. In Bor Wednesday, a 33-year-old woman who had lived through the violence of 1991, found herself questioning the future. Again. ""How long,"" she asked, ""are we going to continue to run?""

While Heinz has not publicly addressed its reasons for naming Hees CEO, questions have been raised about the strategy behind recruiting him. Perhaps, given his fast-food experience, the plan was to have him turnaround a relationship that had been falling apart for several years. While many perceive the hiring of Hees as an abrupt end to the Heinz McDonald's relationship, it actually began souring during the 1973 tomato shortage. Heinz, in a 2011 interview with the Wall Street Journal, revealed that it only was serving two U.S. markets -- Minneapolis and Pittsburgh -- for McDonald's. Within that same article, Heinz announced new ketchup packaging that, while not specifically developed to lure McDonald's back, created hope that the door could be reopened. To date, that has not happened, and with Hees at the helm, the door is now completely closed. Possibly, Heinz expected Hees fast-food industry background to rejuvenate its McDonald's relationship and drive revenue from it. If that was the rationale, the strategy clearly backfired. However, the expectation of success primarily based on prior industry experience parallels a common salesperson hiring strategy. Executives in search of fast, high performance often focus their recruiting campaigns on candidates within their industry -- with a watchful eye on the competitor's top salespeople. Is this a brilliant growth strategy or a myth that, more often than not, leads to failure? To share a story ... During the Dot-Com boom, I was the Director of Sales for a large technology training company. At that time, Microsoft, Cisco, Novell, and IBM were experiencing explosive growth -- which created tremendous demand for information technology training to support its products. While our company was doing well, a competitor had fallen on hard times which led to my receiving a phone call from one of its top salespeople. He, and a group of five others, were interested in joining our firm. It would be inaccurate to say that the six salespeople were interviewed by our company. The truth is job offers were fast-tracked because of their industry background. ""This group requires no training and is bringing clients with them ... fast, high performance."" -- at least that is what we believed. All six accepted the job offers and all six were no longer with the company within ninety days of their hiring. We thought they would succeed (and fast) because of their industry experience -- but the plan was flawed. While they had been successful with a competitor, they were mismatched with our company. Our executive team, like so many others, was blinded by the myth of assured success when hiring those with industry background. While prior industry experience is certainly helpful to a salesperson, it is not a guarantee of success -- far from it. Many executives cite ""complexity of the industry"" as a reason to exclusively hire salespeople from competitors -- inferring that industry knowledge is too hard to teach. If that's true, how did these executives learn their industry? They certainly didn't come out of the womb with that insight. Those executives are really communicating that they don't want to train salespeople on the industry fundamentals. It also dangerously assumes that the competition is doing a better job of training salespeople than they are. Of course, another reason executives pursue the competition's salespeople is the expectation they will bring a book of business with them -- also a myth. Moving clients from one supplier to another is very difficult to do - unless there are reasons other than the salesperson changing business cards. Not to mention, there are potential legal issues when salespeople try to move ""their"" clients when changing jobs. Limiting salesperson hiring to just those with industry experience creates a scalability problem for the company. There are only so many people with industry experience and only a small subset who the company would want on the team. What happens when the candidate pool runs dry and there are job openings on the sales team? Rather than blindly pursue those salespeople with industry mastery, first study each sales role and identify the factors that affect performance. What causes salespeople to succeed or fail in the role? Understanding the performance factors provides the means to carefully assess sales talent for matches to those factors. Not only does this help identify which candidates with industry background will succeed in the company, but it also opens the door to strong candidates without prior industry experience. Cast the ""industry experience"" requirement aside and hire those salespeople who have what it takes to succeed in the company. Hiring right is the first step of positioning the business for success. The second is to create a sales on boarding program teaching salespeople the requisite knowledge to deliver fast, high performance for the company. Reviewing performance factors before hiring and developing on boarding programs are not just sales hiring strategies. These steps are also applicable for leadership positions. Had Heinz taken this approach, they may have selected a different CEO to lead the company. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lee B. Salz.","McDonald's terminated contract with Heinz after hiring former Burger King CEO .

"(CNN) -- The last time Earl Woods Jr. saw his half brother Tiger was four years ago, when the family buried their father. Earl Woods Jr. and his two siblings Kevin Woods and Royce Woods, also Tiger's half siblings, joined Tiger on his private jet to take their father's remains to Kansas. The three are the offspring of Tiger's father Earl Woods Sr. and his first wife Barbara Hart Woods. The couple divorced in 1968. ""He was gracious enough to allow us to join him on the jet to take my dad to Kansas,"" says Earl Woods Jr. ""I remember we came off the jet, walked down the runway, hugged, (we said) 'Hey, how you doin'?' And he went that way with the entourage, and we went this way. And that was the last I ever saw him."" That was in May 2006, at a time when Tiger was cementing his legacy as one of golf's greatest. After his father passed, Woods memorably won the British Open and dedicated the victory to his dad, who had been his first coach when he was just 3 years old. He won one more major championship that season and seven other PGA tour events. Tiger was one of the most popular figures in the world. But he had no contact with his half siblings -- Earl Jr., Kevin and Royce. Earl Jr. says he has reached out through phone calls and letters, but got no response. ""I have no grudge against him. I'm disappointed. I'm a little angry,"" he says. ""But, if he chooses to contact and to be in contact, we would love that. You know, we have unconditional love for him, whether he contacts us or not."" Earl Jr. wants Tiger to respond because Kevin is sick. He has multiple sclerosis and his health has declined 40 percent in the past two years, Earl Jr. says. ""Kevin doesn't want this to be a big to-do about his condition,"" Earl Jr. says. ""But, you know, it makes me a little angry that ... there is this issue with trying to get the news to him. And it's been so difficult. It's like he doesn't care. I kinda feel that he does."" CNN twice reached out to Tiger Woods' management company for this documentary. Woods didn't return messages seeking comment. When Tiger, born in 1975, was just starting out as a golfer, Earl Jr., who was a tool and die maker, says he cut down some clubs and worked in the shop getting them ready for the pint-sized lad. Even after he moved out of the family's house into his own apartment, he would come down on weekends to visit. He says his little brother was a bit of a nerd, who when he wasn't golfing was often on the computer. ""He knew a lot about those computers at a young age."" Tiger played other sports too -- soccer and cross-country -- but Tiger excelled at golf from an early age, Earl Jr. says. He and his siblings never felt like Tiger was getting special treatment -- their father was a born instructor, Earl says, and spent a lot of time in the backyard playing baseball with he and Kevin, too. Earl Woods Sr., a retired military officer, was a dominating presence. Many people wonder if Tiger changed greatly after his father died. Earl Jr. can't say for sure, but says their father instilled good values in his children and that Tiger is a good man who ""made critical mistakes"" in his marriage. Earl Jr. says Tiger isn't a womanizer -- he had been surrounded by groupies since his days as a teen national champion and young celebrity -- so he's puzzled as to why Tiger is reported to have had so many affairs recently. He thinks hanging around with other celebrities that were living a playboy lifestyle affected Tiger. And he thinks it would be different if Earl Sr. were still around. ""My Dad let Tiger be his own man when he was alive,"" Earl Jr. says. ""But I think that Tiger felt an obligation to make my father proud of him and not get caught up in -- the different things that some popular people get caught up in and that he had to live his life walking down a certain path. ""But with him gone, I don't know if there's anybody in his group that holds him to task anymore."" His half-brother lost his way, he says. ""What I saw was that -- he lost a part of himself,"" he says. ""I think that our father was a part of Tiger so much that, when he passed, Tiger became lost. That he didn't know how to fill that void."" But the Tiger talked about by media and critics isn't the real Eldrick Woods, he says. Tiger isn't arrogant, just very confident of his abilities, Earl Jr says. And he feels that as a golfer he needs to conduct himself a certain way with people. Some people misinterpret that as aloofness, his brother says. Some may question why Earl Jr. is speaking now. He says it's not because he wants money from his famous half-sibling. He says that after Tiger's auto accident and the subsequent scandal last November, his family wanted to give Tiger some time. But now they want a few things. They want him to know about Kevin. They want people to know the real Tiger Woods. But most of all, they just want to know how he's doing.","Earl Woods Jr. tells CNN he hasn't spoken to his half-brother in four years .

"(CNN) -- ""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson is back on A&E after a short suspension over controversial remarks he made about gays and black people. While the right is congratulating itself on winning this battle, it's actually losing its war on marriage equality. But both developments are good for America. What do I mean? Simple: While I completely disagree with Robertson's view on gays, he has the right -- which I defend -- to practice his faith and advocate his political and religious beliefs. The debate that erupted after his comments is healthy for our nation. If a person espouses views that others find offensive, they should be countered -- not silenced. And the right losing its war on marriage equality is also good for our nation because we must eradicate discrimination in all forms. To those who don't understand (or refuse to understand) how opposing marriage equality is discrimination, all you need to do is check out three court decisions announced, coincidentally enough, during the same time period that the Robertson controversy raged. First, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled on December 19 that marriage equality would be the law of that state. The court declared that ""barring individuals from marrying and depriving them of the rights, protections, and responsibilities of civil marriage solely because of their sexual orientation violates the Equal Protection Clause."" Then on December 20, Federal District Judge Robert Shelby struck down both Utah's statutes and an amendment to the Utah Constitution that had been approved by voters in 2004 banning same-sex marriage. Shelby found that the state's ""prohibition on same-sex marriage conflicts with the United States Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law."" Shelby also interestingly noted that the lawyers opposing same-sex marriage were making arguments that were ""almost identical"" to those offered by opponents of interracial marriage in the 1960s -- including that each was a ""threat to society."" While the decision is on appeal, currently gay couples are free to marry in Utah. And then on December 23, federal Judge Timothy Black ruled that Ohio public officials must recognize same-sex marriages when issuing death certificates. Consequently, gay couples married legally in other states would have the same rights as straight couples under Ohio law. As Black instructively noted, ""The question is presented whether a state can do what the federal government cannot -- i.e., discriminate against same-sex couples ... simply because the majority of the voters don't like homosexuality (or at least didn't in 2004.) Under the Constitution of the United States, the answer is no."" Let's be honest: These court decisions are vastly more important than whether multimillionaire Phil Robertson returns to his reality TV show. And keep in mind, while A&E lifted Robertson's suspension, it also announced it would ""use this moment"" to air public service announcements ""promoting unity, tolerance and acceptance among all people."" A&E: Star of 'Duck Dynasty' is back . Putting partisan fighting aside, marriage equality will be the law of the land in the future -- it's just a question of when. The U.S. Supreme Court in June struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. Currently, 18 states and the District of Columbia recognize marriage equality. That's up from 12 just six months ago. And despite what some on the right will tell you, opinion polls are clear that a majority of Americans now support marriage equality. Astoundingly, adults younger than 30 support marriage equality by a whopping 81%. Indeed, the generational divide on this issue couldn't be more apparent than when you compare the views of two self-described rednecks on gays: Phil Robertson versus Honey Boo Boo. While Robertson likened gays to those who commit bestiality, the much younger Honey Boo Boo stated last year: ""Ain't nothin' wrong with bein' a little gay. Everybody's a little gay."" The fact that our nation is moving to embrace marriage equality cannot come as a surprise to anyone with a sense of our country's history. We are by our nature a progressive nation -- it's one of the reasons we are an exceptional country. True, It may take a great deal of blood, sweat and tears, but we move forward. We have seen this from the fight for women's right to vote, to ending segregation, to striking down laws that banned interracial marriage. Until the day marriage equality is recognized, we can expect to see a vibrant, healthy -- and hopefully respectful -- debate on this issue. And that is something we should treasure, because that, too, is one of the reasons our nation is exceptional. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Right wins ""Duck Dynasty"" battle but losing war, Dean Obeidallah says .

"Belfast (CNN) -- Northern Ireland's leaders condemned Saturday the detonation of a small bomb in central Belfast that police said could have killed or injured people. The device, left in a holdall bag, exploded at about 7 p.m. local time Friday in Belfast's busy Cathedral Quarter, near St. Anne's Cathedral, police said. No one was hurt. First Minister Peter Robinson described the attack as ""despicable,"" while Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said it showed a ""complete disregard for life."" IRA dissidents are widely suspected of being behind the attack. A warning was telephoned through to a Belfast newspaper, but the wrong location was given for the device, police said. It was left on a sidewalk by a busy restaurant and the explosion occurred as police were still clearing buildings in the area, which included a hotel, a bar and an arts center. Chief Superintendent Alan McCrum said anyone nearby when the device went off could have been killed or maimed. ""This was an attack on the people of Belfast going about their normal lives on a busy night for socializing in the city,"" he said. ""Those who carried out this attack have nothing to offer except disruption and destruction."" McCrum appealed for the public to be vigilant in the run-up to Christmas against the threat of further attacks. More than 1,000 people were affected by the bomb threat and subsequent evacuation efforts, police said. Police are also investigating reports of fire damage to an office of the Alliance Party. The party last year backed a controversial decision by the Belfast city council to stop flying the Union flag every day, angering loyalists. 'Mindless minority' In their statement condemning Friday's explosion, Robinson and McGuinness urged anyone with information to contact the police. ""Once again we are witnessing the work of a mindless minority who are intent on taking the heart out of the city and wreaking havoc on the lives and businesses of the people of Belfast and Northern Ireland,"" said Robinson. ""Their cause will not be progressed in any way by acts such as this."" Northern Ireland's Justice Minister David Ford also condemned those behind the explosion. ""Yet again we see a reckless attempt to kill and injure innocent people in Belfast,"" he said. ""The people carrying out these attacks have set out no reason and explained no cause for their acts of senseless violence. Their only aim seems to be to injure and disrupt."" Gerry Kelly, a Sinn Fein member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, also condemned what he called an ""indiscriminate"" attack on the people of Belfast. ""Those that voice support for these groups, (whose) only allegiance is to violence, need to come forward and explain to the people what they aim to achieve by this reckless action,"" he said. ""They are visionless and opponents of change who will not stop the people of Belfast and beyond from moving forward to a more equal and peaceful society."" Belfast is home to the elected Northern Ireland Assembly, which was established by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The agreement largely ended three decades of violence between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland -- though distrust between the sides remains. Journalist Peter Taggart reported from Belfast and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","NEW: First Minister Peter Robinson condemns Belfast bomb blast as ""despicable""

"(CNN) -- The northeast region of the United States got pummeled with snow. It was bad, really bad. According to the National Weather Service, nearly 2 feet of snow fell north of Boston while other parts of the Northeast received as much as 18 inches. That was good enough to shut down schools, cancel flights in the region and declare snow emergencies. For my city, Valdez, Alaska, 18 inches of snow is just another day; schools operate, companies stay open and people go about their daily routines. The Prince William Sound community, where the Trans Alaska Pipeline and the Richardson Highway end, tops the list as the snowiest city in United States, according to The Weather Channel. It averages 326.3 inches of snow each year and has gotten as much as 556.7 inches in one season. Yet the city manager has said that declaring a snow emergency would be ""humiliating."" How does a town with a population of nearly 4,000 cope with all that snow? The plows go out in the early mornings trying to clear the snow before locals head to work and school. It's not smart to be driving during snow removal. Sometimes you can drive head-on into the path of a snowplow. Then there are the berms, that barrier of unplowed snow in the middle of the road. Unless you have an SUV or a truck that's high off the ground, making that left turn isn't advised. Those two obstacles can turn your drive down the street into an adventure. During this time, locals are asked not to park in the streets, at risk of getting a ticket. Where is all that snow stored? The city uses its local parks as snow dumps. They're green during the summer and white by winter. Barney Meyring Park is by far the biggest park strip in town. There are playgrounds, basketball courts and a large open space for dogs to run around in the park. The south end was used as a temporary football field last season. All those assets are hidden beneath several feet of snow during the winter. Next to city hall is another snow storage site, a parking lot that is turned into a two-story high snowcone every winter. Those are just the public and commercial places. During that quick trip to the store, now a little longer because you're dodging berms and snowplows, you will notice people with snowblowers in the driveways and on the roofs. Some residents have their own snowplows. Most just push the snow to the sidewalks and let the city crews do the rest. For me, Valdez was a shock. I grew up in Mississippi: If 2 inches of snow hit the ground (stick or melt), there was no school for that day. I got my first taste of a REAL winter when I ventured off to college in Nebraska. I remember sitting in the dorm and watching TV when the first snowstorm of the school year came. I thought for sure classes would be canceled. Every educational institution in the area canceled classes, except mine. Still in shock from not seeing my college's name scroll across the bottom of the screen, I bundled up and headed to class. When I moved to Alaska, I had the same thoughts about the Last Frontier as everyone else: It's cold, with igloos and polar bears. I thought my Midwest experience had prepared me for the elements of Alaska. My first winter in the state was in Wrangell, a town of more than 2,300 people in Southeast Alaska. As in the rest of the region, it rains much of the time. I saw plenty of snow during my two-year stint there, but it was nothing compared to Valdez. People warned me, but I didn't listen. I thought I was good with a nice coat, gloves and a decent pair of boots. It has been three years since I've moved here and I still have a sort of love-hate relationship with the snow. One thing is clear: It takes a lot of snow for the city to shut schools and businesses. That happened during the 2011-12 winter. After a slow start, Alaska's south central region was pummeled from December through February. It got really bad for Valdez's regional counterpart, Cordova. With the snow dumps full, that city declared a state of emergency and called in the Alaska National Guard to clear out most of the snow. Valdez officials came close to going in that direction after schools and businesses were closed because of excessive snow loads on roofs. Valdez City Manager John Hozey said it best during rounds of meetings with the public and other leaders: ""Valdez prides itself on being the snow capital in the world. And for us to declare a state of emergency would be humiliating."" Officials in Valdez didn't call in the National Guard, but relied on outside help with snow removal. It brought in workers from other parts of the state to help cut blocks of snow off the roofs of schools and businesses. A shovel that season was the most valuable tool in town. That winter saw seasonal records broken throughout the state. Anchorage bragged about breaking its seasonal record with 134.5 inches. Valdez's response: ""Good for you."" It received 152.2 inches in the month of December and closed out with 438.3 inches for the season. (Valdez's record for snowfall in a season was set during the 1989-90 winter with 556.7 inches.) I've had plenty of days where my sense of accomplishment from digging out my car from a previous snowfall is taken away minutes later by the next. Digging out my radio station's satellite dishes has become a regular winter chore. I can get by without studs on my tires, but they sure would make driving easier in those slippery areas. One of these days, I'll get used to the all the snow here in Valdez. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tony Gorman.","Ex-Mississippian Tony Gorman now lives in the snow capital of the U.S.

"(CNN) -- An American imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates after posting a video that parodied Dubai teens will be released this week, a family spokeswoman said Tuesday. Shezanne Cassim plans to fly back to the United States on Thursday, family spokeswoman Jennifer Gore said. There was no immediate response to the family's announcement from the UAE government, which has not replied to previous requests for comment on Cassim's case. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that after getting credit against his one-year sentence for time served and ""for good behavior,"" Cassim was moved to a deportation facility for processing. ""We understand processing will take a few days, at which point he will be returning to the United States,"" Psaki said, adding that U.S. diplomats have visited Cassim regularly in custody and should do so again Wednesday. Cassim, 29, of Woodbury, Minnesota, moved to Dubai in 2006 after graduating from college to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers. His family says the 29-year-old was arrested in April after uploading a 19-minute video that pokes fun at a clique of Dubai teens influenced by hip-hop culture. In December, he was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of about $2,700. The charges were not read in court, but the country's main English-language newspaper reported that Cassim was accused of defaming the UAE's image abroad. UAE officials would say only that Cassim ""was charged under the UAE's penal code"" and was ""entitled to the fair trial protections contained in the UAE's constitution."" In the 1990s, the label ""Satwa G"" was coined for a group of suburban teens who were known to talk tougher than they really were. Cassim's video depicts a look at a ""combat school"" in the Dubai district of Satwa, where these ""gangsters"" are trained. The training includes how to throw sandals at targets, use clothing accessories as whips and how to call on the phone for backup. Cassim's family said they weren't notified of the charges against him for five months. American gets 1-year prison sentence for parody video . ""He tries to put on a brave face,"" his brother, Shervon Cassim, said in December. ""He said that he was doing fine, not to worry about him, but I could just sense that he's a little depressed. My impression is that he's going just a little bit crazy in his cell."" Shervon Cassim said his brother made the video ""just for fun."" ""He's a big fan of 'SNL,' 'Funny or Die,' all those shows, and he and his friends just wanted to make a funny sketch comedy in their spare time,"" Shervon Cassim said. ""There was no indication in local law that making a comedy video, making fun of teenagers in the suburbs, was a threat to the UAE's national security."" The online comedy community Funny or Die, in fact, rallied to Cassim's support, launching a #FreeShez campaign to correspond with U.N. Human Rights Day on December 10. Cassim ended up serving nine months -- more than half of those before being charged -- before his recent move to a deportation facility, his family said in a statement. The family said it reached out to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry before his Mideast trip last week, with U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar also pushing for his release. ""The disregard for freedom of expression, the arbitrary application of this cybercrime law, the constant delays revealed the UAE legal system as archaic and unfair by modern standards,"" said Susan Burns, the family's U.S.-based lawyer.

"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are preparing for their face-off in Pennsylvania -- where the demographics appear to play in Clinton's favor and voters might be less receptive to Obama's message of ""change."" Sen. Hillary Clinton lags behind Sen. Barack Obama in the popular vote and in pledged delegates. ""Two million residents over the age of 65 ... a very heavily unionized state ... a lot of Catholics in this state ... women in Pennsylvania vote at a higher rate than men in Pennsylvania,"" said John Baer of the Philadelphia Daily News. Clinton also has family roots in Pennsylvania. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was the son of a factory worker from Scranton, according to the Clinton campaign. Obama's emphasis on change might not be on the forefront of voters' minds in Pennsylvania. More than three-quarters of the people who live in Pennsylvania were born there. ""It speaks to a state where change isn't an important element in day-to-day life,"" Baer said. And pollster Terry Madonna points out -- Pennsylvania's makeup resembles places that have been good to Clinton.  Watch more on Pennsylvania's Democratic voters » . ""The eastern part of Pennsylvania is more like New Jersey, and the western part is more like Ohio, and she won both of them,"" Madonna said. The question now: Does Obama have a chance in the state? ""The only way that Sen. Obama can do better than losing this state by 5 to 8 percent is if he is able to capture the imagination of new voters,"" Baer said. Strategists say Obama could win Pennsylvania the same way Gov. Ed Rendell beat Bob Casey in the 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary -- by sweeping Philadelphia and its suburbs. There's only one problem: Rendell has endorsed Clinton and is working hard to deliver his state for her. Clinton's strongest argument for her nomination is that she can win states such as Pennsylvania.  Watch more on the upcoming contests » . ""I've won the big states.

Harry VanSickle, commissioner of the state's Bureau of Commissions, Elections and Legislation, told CNN Radio this week that the state had a little more than 4 million registered Democrats and 3.2 million Republicans eligible for the April 22 primaries. Monday was the deadline to sign up to vote in the primary. A resident must be a registered Democrat to vote in the Democratic primary, where 158 delegates are at stake. VanSickle noted Pennsylvania had 8.2 million total registered voters at the time. The math shows 49 percent of Pennsylvania voters were registered Democrats as of Monday, compared with 39 percent for Republicans. The primary registration numbers will not be final until later in the week, as officials accept mail-in forms postmarked by Monday. The executive director of Philadelphia's Republican City Committee says the Democratic primary has hit his city like a hurricane.

"(CNN) -- A Sikh farmer in India has surpassed a month on a hunger strike, demanding the release of six men from his community jailed since the 1990s during a period of a deadly Sikh separatist movement in the country. Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa, 48, began his protest on November 14, his aide, Harpal Singh Cheema, told CNN. His hunger strike brings attention to the fates of Sikhs who were arrested and convicted for their actions during the separatist movement, but who, unlike others, have not had their sentences shortened. The fact that other Indians sentenced to life have been released earlier, but not the Sikhs, has some accusing the justice system of discrimination against the group. Those who support Khalsa's hunger strike say it is long overdue that the cases of those Sikhs be reviewed. An armed Sikh rebellion operated in Punjab, the heartland of the faith, from the 1980s to the early 1990s, when it was crushed. Hiding from the massacre: 1984 remembered . Many political leaders were assassinated during the insurgency. India's then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984, the same year she had ordered a military raid on the Golden Temple, the holiest of the Sikh shrines, to flush out militants holed up inside. Three of the six convicts whose freedom Khalsa is fighting for were arrested in 1995 for their alleged role in the assassination of Punjab's then-Chief Minister, Beant Singh, in a car bombing. They were sentenced to life in prison. The others were convicted under a draconian anti-terror law that has since been repealed, civil rights lawyer H.S. Phoolka said. ""It is not unusual to set lifers free after they have served 14 years in prison,"" Phoolka said. ""These prisoners should also be freed, as normalcy returned to Punjab long ago and they should be joining the mainstream now."" International rights groups have accused both the Sikh separatists and Indian forces of serious violations during the insurgency. The six Sikh inmates are lodged in the jails of the federally-administered territory of Chandigarh and in Punjab, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh states. Khalsa is ""weak but says he will not end (his hunger strike) until he sees those six prisoners free,"" his aide said. iReport: 'Free those political prisoners [who] should be legally free' Khalsa's protest, which has drawn support from across the Sikh political and religious spectrum, has gained a viral online attention, although the story is not prominent on India's national media. ""A number of Sikhs were falsely arrested, charged and convicted. Many of them are still in jails despite their old age. It's my personal opinion all such prisoners â€” whichever community they may belong to â€” should be set free now,"" said Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, general secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the top Sikh religious administration in Punjab. ""It's up to the discretion of those governments, administrations to reconsider their cases. We are trying our best,"" Punjab government spokesman Harcharan Bains said. In India, state authorities can review a lifer's case after a prisoner serving that sentence has spent 14 years, Bains and lawyer Phoolka said. ""But, otherwise, a life sentence means sentence until the last breath of the prisoner,"" Bains said. Rights attorneys, however, say authorities are selectively rejecting reviews of Sikh inmates incarcerated during the Punjab militancy. ""There are numerous examples where life convicts have been prematurely released after undergoing imprisonment of 12 to 14 years or even less,"" Phoolka said. ""It is a great discrimination against... because of their religious beliefs."" Meantime, Human Rights Watch, in a statement to CNN, called upon Indian authorities not to let prisoners remain behind the bars beyond their sentences. ""There were serious human rights abuses during the Punjab insurgency,"" the human rights group said. Both militants, with their attacks, and the security forces, abusing the now repealed terror law, committed human rights violations, the group said. Sikhs and rights bodies have also accused successive Indian governments of going soft on high-profile politicians suspected of perpetrating a massacre of Sikhs in and round New Delhi in the wake of Gandhi's assassination. Official figures put the number of those killed in the 1984 anti-Sikh attacks at 2,733 in the Indian capital alone. Human rights activists say the death toll was much higher. ""Despite the findings of independent commissions, government forces or officials responsible for excesses, including during the 1984 riots, are yet to be properly prosecuted,"" Human Rights Watch said in its statement. Himself a Sikh and the country's first non-Hindu head of government, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh issued a public apology for the deadly events -- 21 years after their occurrence. ""I have no hesitation in apologizing not only to the Sikh community but the whole Indian nation because what took place in 1984 is the negation of the concept of nationhood and what enshrined in our Constitution. So, I am not standing on any false prestige. On behalf of our government, on behalf of the entire people of this country, I bow my head in shame that such thing took place,"" Singh told India's Parliament in an impassioned address in 2005.","Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa has been on a hunger strike for more than a month .

"(CNN) -- Former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky arrived in Switzerland Sunday, according to a statement posted on his website. Khodorkovsky was pardoned and released from a Russian prison on December 20 after spending 10 years in jail after a fraud and tax evasion conviction. Less than a week after his release, Khodorkovsky was granted a Schengen visa -- which allows him to travel throughout the European Union -- by Swiss authorities. Khodorkovsky ""is grateful for the principled positions taken by the Swiss authorities over the many years of his unjust imprisonment,"" read the statement. ""Swiss judicial authorities were quick to recognise the politicised nature of Mr. Khodorkovsky's prosecution."" According to the statement, ""the purpose of his visit is a family matter, as he and his wife are accompanying their two sons back to school in Switzerland."" Khodorkovsky has two twin sons studying in a Swiss school. Khodorkovsky and his wife traveled by train from Berlin, where they have been since Khodorkovsky's release. After Russian President Vladimir Putin's December pardon, the country's Supreme Court will take a second look at cases against Khodorkovsky, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. The court cited the European Court of Human Rights' criticism of the tax evasion and fraud case. The statement said Khodorkovsky has not made plans for permanent residency in Switzerland. Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, with countries including the United States accusing it of selective prosecution and abuse of the legal system. Khodorkovsky's release was one of dozens, part of Putin's new amnesty law that some critics have described as a public relations campaign ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. In past statements to CNN, Khodorkovsky has said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of Yukos, the oil company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s.

"(CNN) -- New imagery posted on Google Earth shows evidence Iran continues to build out its nuclear sites, according to a group focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology. The Institute for Science and International Security said Tuesday it had examined updated commercial satellite imagery of Iran and found evidence of slow, but continuing, build-out of nuclear facilities. Iran has a controversial nuclear program. Many world powers say it aspires to building nuclear weapons but the country says it is developing nuclear power for peaceful purposes. The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on Iran in an effort to curb its nuclear program. ISIS says images of the Arak heavy water reactor and heavy water production facility from June 2010 appeared on Google Earth. ""Compared with earlier imagery from November 2009, also available on Google Earth, there do not appear to be major external changes at either reactor site or the heavy water production facility,"" ISIS said. However, it said, ""construction continues inside the buildings"" and ""assorted activity at heavily guarded sites along the mountainside to the Arak site"" continues. Google Earth in July posted images of the Gchine mine and mill from November 2010. ""There do not appear to be any new ponds under construction,"" ISIS said. But it says the ""waste tailings level can be seen changing."" In August, Google Earth added images of the Ardakan yellowcake production plant from March. ""The facility is being constructed very slowly, with few buildings added each year. Comparing the imagery to a picture from October 2009, a few more buildings have been constructed,"" ISIS said. The institute said ""two large square excavations can be seen,"" and ""one or both of them could be for a tailing pond."" Tailings are materials left over after ore is processed. Last month, ISIS and other groups leaked an International Atomic Energy Agency report saying Iran continues to defy U.N. resolutions aimed at curbing its nuclear program and cited ""increasing"" concerns it may be developing nuclear weapons. It follows a visit last month by an IAEA official to Iran, at the Middle Eastern nation's invitation. The report's author notes some instances in which Iran appears to be working with the international agency, as well as conducting parts of its program as it had said it would. But the report, intended for the IAEA's director general as well as the U.N. Security Council, also suggests Iran continues to flout U.N. and other resolutions regarding its nuclear program.","Images reveal minor changes at a heavy water reactor, group says .

"(CNN) -- Is Luis Suarez currently the world's best footballer? He is certainly making a case for himself. A day after the Uruguayan signed a new four-and-a-half year contract, Suarez found the back of the net two more times -- in brilliant fashion -- as Liverpool beat Cardiff City 3-1 to leapfrog Arsenal at the top of the English Premier League. ""Two brilliant goals, a genuine world-class player,"" stated Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, to the club website. Suarez might have had a hat-trick, too, had he shot on goal instead of setting up Raheem Sterling on a two-man break Saturday. Suarez now has 19 league goals this season -- despite missing the first six matches of the campaign due to a ban. That's more than Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Diego Costa. His goals-per-game ratio in the league is also better than the high-profile trio, who ply their trade in Spain's La Liga. If Suarez keeps up his impressive pace, he will smash the record for most goals in a Premier League season. Suarez, deputizing as captain for the still injured Steven Gerrard, opened the scoring when he volleyed Jordan Henderson's chipped pass past David Marshall in the 25th minute. He unselfishly assisted on Sterling's tap in three minutes before the interval and made it 3-0 with a curled effort across goal in the 45th. Liverpool struck the bar twice in the first half, with Marshall thwarting Sterling. Cardiff pulled a goal back through Jordon Mutch's header in the 58th minute during a brief spell of superiority but Liverpool soon reasserted its control and Suarez hit the outside of the post on a rebound. ""We played very well in the first half and in the second half not as well,"" Suarez told BT Sport. ""But most important was that we won."" Liverpool leads Arsenal by a point, though the Gunners can reclaim first spot Monday against Chelsea. Manchester City later went ahead of Arsenal on goal difference following a 4-2 win at Fulham and defending champion Manchester United ended a two-game league losing streak at home by downing West Ham 3-1 in a battle of teams who this week progressed to the last four of the League Cup. Liverpool visits Manchester City -- a perfect 8-0-0 at home with 35 goals scored -- in Boxing Day's standout clash. ""We have been on a fantastic run,"" said Rodgers. ""The quality of our football is at a really high level. We're pressing the game very well, our aggression to get the ball back is good. ""We'll arrive there on Boxing Day in a really good moment. It's a game I'm really looking forward to."" Manchester City has struggled away from home and looked like it might drop more points playing without injured striker Sergio Aguero after seeing a 2-0 lead turn to 2-2. But late goals by substitutes Jesus Navas and James Milner bailed out City. Ashley Young, another substitute, scored for the second consecutive game to add to first-half strikes for Danny Welbeck and Adnan Januzaj at Old Trafford. United overtook idle Tottenham for seventh. Newly promoted Cardiff stayed above the relegation zone but it may not be enough to prevent manager Malky Mackay from being dismissed by owner Vincent Tan. Tan -- in attendance at Anfield -- is reportedly dismayed by the amount of money Mackay spent on players in the off-season and wanted the former Scotland defender to resign. ""I won't be walking away,"" Mackay told BT Sport. ""That's the first thing. I'm proud to be the manager of Cardiff City."" Elsewhere, Newcastle blanked Crystal Palace 3-0 to maintain its push for a Champions League berth; Stoke overcame the disappointment of losing to United in the League Cup quarterfinals by toppling Aston Villa 2-1; and West Bromwich Albion drew Hull 1-1 in its first match since the sacking of Steve Clarke. Ten-man Sunderland, which upset Chelsea in the League Cup, earned a point but stayed last after a 0-0 draw against Norwich.","Luis Suarez scores two goals and sets up the other as Liverpool beats Cardiff 3-1 .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court prosecutor called for a delay in the Kenyan president's trial, saying there is no longer sufficient evidence to charge him with crimes against humanity. The trial against President Uhuru Kenyatta was scheduled to start in February. Kenyatta is accused of funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks during the 2007 post-election violence. He denies the charges. The case has suffered major setbacks in recent months. A key witness is not willing to testify while another one confessed to giving false evidence on a critical event in the case, according to Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. ""Having carefully considered my evidence and the impact of the two withdrawals, I have come to the conclusion that currently the case against Mr. Kenyatta does not satisfy the high evidentiary standards required at trial,"" Bensouda said in a statement. More than 1,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates battled one another after the election. Kenyatta's deputy, William Ruto, faces similar charges. His trial started in September. African leaders have accused the court of targeting their continent, and have demanded charges against sitting leaders be dropped. Last month, the U.N. Security Council rejected a resolution to suspend the trial.","ICC prosecutor seeks delay for the trial scheduled to start in February .

"(CNN) -- I had the pleasure of getting to know the Robertsons -- the duck call mogul stars of A&E's ""Duck Dynasty"" -- over the past couple of years. I've hunted ducks with Phil, the patriarch, and enjoyed Miss Kaye's home cooking. They are good, kindhearted, compassionate and generous people. The brouhaha over Phil Robertson's comments to a GQ reporter is disconcerting, not because I disagree with his views on homosexuality -- and I do, demonstrably -- but because his views are neither surprising nor unique. ""Duck Dynasty"" is a show about a Christian family. They pray at the end of every episode. They go to church, or school as Phil likes to call it. Phil's son Allen is an evangelical pastor. Phil quotes Scripture regularly on the show (and in real life.) They do not hide their Christianity, but rather they celebrate it. That Phil would therefore express a biblically literal interpretation of homosexuality may offend some, but it shouldn't surprise anyone. A&E has the right to its decision, but suspending Phil for his beliefs, even if expressed crudely, seems ungracious. The Robertsons' Christian values are, in large part, exactly why the show is so popular. Millions of viewers have made it the top reality show of all time because they reject the moral bankruptcy of other reality families. Indeed, the Robertsons' Christianity has been very profitable for A&E. The outrage over Phil's intolerance also seems blindly hypocritical. Many of his most indignant critics, including prominent voices in the media, are the very same people who are overtly intolerant and dismissive of Christians, regularly condemning them as idiots, fanatics and loons. A colleague of mine -- someone I like very much -- once said that parents who taught their children the creation story should be charged with child abuse. Another colleague of mine likened a Christian community in Florida to Jonestown. I've heard many others openly wish that anti-abortion Christians had been aborted. This is the kind of tolerance to which Phil Robertson should aspire? A&E need not endorse Phil's comments, nor must we embrace them. But it's unfortunate that an otherwise kind and giving family has been maligned for expressing personal views shared by many. Reject those views, but do not reject this family. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","S.E. Cupp has gotten to know the family featured in A&E's ""Duck Dynasty"" series .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- At least four people were killed and 77 injured when a car bomb exploded in a residential neighborhood in southern Beirut on Thursday, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported. The explosion caused significant damage, Lebanese broadcaster Al Manar TV said. Video from Al Manar showed people gathered around smoking cars, and others bringing hoses to put out the flames. Thick clouds of dust rose as buildings collapsed after the blast. The district, Haret Hreik, is known as a Hezbollah stronghold. The blast was strong enough to be felt in nearby neighborhoods of the capital, NNA reported. A source with knowledge of the security situation told CNN that the car bomb exploded near Al-Jawad restaurant, about 50 meters (55 yards) from a building used by Hezbollah. There has not yet been any claim of responsibility for the blast. Lebanon's armed forces, in a statement published by NNA, urged people not to gather in the area in case of further explosions. Experts are gathering forensic evidence from the scene, the statement said. The explosion comes less than a week after a car bomb exploded in downtown Beirut, killing half a dozen people and injuring dozens. Among those killed in that blast was Mohamad Chatah, a former Lebanese finance minister and ambassador to the United States. He was an outspoken critic of Hezbollah and the Syrian regime. Hezbollah, a Lebanese-based, Iranian-backed Shiite militia that is better equipped than Lebanon's army, has been supporting government forces in neighboring Syria's civil war. This has led to increased tensions in Lebanon, where sectarian divisions reflect those in Syria. 'Opened the doors of hell' Outgoing Prime Minister Najib Mikati warned that worse is to come if the Lebanese people don't overcome their political differences and engage in dialogue, NNA said. A member of the Future Bloc, a political group opposed to Hezbollah, condemned the bombing. Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian crisis has ""opened the doors of hell to Lebanon,"" said Ammar Houry, quoted by NNA. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi condemned the bombing, which he labeled a ""terrorist act,"" Syrian state news agency SANA reported. In an online statement, Derek Plumbly, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, expressed his ""outrage that this is the fourth bomb to have exploded in Beirut's southern suburbs since July."" ""It is deeply distressing to have to condemn yet another appalling act of terrorism, the latest in the number which have killed and injured so many innocent people in this country,"" he said. Plumbly called for those responsible to be held accountable. Car bombs in the same area of Beirut in July and August killed dozens and injured hundreds. And in November, a suicide bomb attack outside the Iranian Embassy, close to the neighborhood where Thursday's attack occurred, killed two dozen people and injured about 150. Earlier this week, Lebanese state media reported that Saudi Arabia had pledged $3 billion to strengthen the Lebanese army. The money will allow Lebanon's armed forces to buy weapons from France. It's been seen as a move to counter the strength of Hezbollah, but many analysts are doubtful because of the time it will take to equip and train the Lebanese armed forces, in a period when tensions and violence are increasing day by day. Hezbollah still enjoys wide backing in Lebanon, but some groups have been angered by its support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. 'Proxy war' Beirut-based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri told CNN the recent surge in violence in Lebanon was part of larger, regional turmoil. ""We are seeing the greatest proxy war of modern times playing itself out in Lebanon and Syria and Iraq, that have now become really one battlefield in which two great ideological camps are fighting to the death like gladiators,"" he said. Political divisions and ideological tensions in Lebanon go back several decades, Khouri said, but they have been reinforced by the emergence of radical Islamist terrorist groups, linked to al Qaeda, following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The situation has been aggravated by the civil war raging on Lebanon's doorstep in Syria, Khouri said, but that is not its cause. It's not clear who is behind the bombings, he said, adding that the violence is not from ordinary Sunnis and Shiites attacking each other, but a more complex picture of extremist ideologies. Hezbollah was designated as a terrorist group by the United States in 1995 ""for a long history of terrorist attacks against American citizens and officials, including the bombing of the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in Lebanon during the 1980s,"" the U.S. State Department website says. The U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon is due to begin the trial this month of four Hezbollah suspects in the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. He was also killed in a car bomb attack. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Beirut and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Nic Robertson, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Larry Register contributed to this report.","NEW: At least four people are killed and 77 injured in a large blast in Beirut, state media say .

"(CNN) -- Early this month, Jim O'Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist who coined the term ""BRICs"" (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), appeared on a weeklong BBC series in which he introduced yet another acronym to describe a new group of emerging economies, the ""MINTs"" (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey). The BRICs acronym kindled a lot of interest among investors eager to find the next ""big thing,"" while increasing attention to a group of nations that suffered from ongoing economic crisis during the 1990s. But considering that the BRICs economies have not done so well in recent years, perhaps it's not a good idea to introduce another acronym. Doing so suggests that we focus on these nations' economies while overlooking key differences in their political, economic, and social welfare systems. While working as Goldman Sachs' chief economist in 2001, O'Neill was struck by how fast Brazil, Russia, India, and China's economies were growing. This motivated him to introduce the BRICs acronym in a Goldman Sachs working paper titled ""Building Better Global Economic Brics."" Even from an economic point of view, in recent years, though, the BRICs have not done so well. Brazil's GDP growth level declined from 7.5% in 2010 to 0.9% in 2012,; Russia's from 4.5% in 2010 to 1.3% in 2013; India's from 10.5% in 2010 to approximately 4.4% in 2013, while China's decreased from 10.4% in 2010 to a still substantial 7.6% in 2013. Using the BRICs acronym also obscures the fact that these nations are rather different, ranging from democratic to authoritarian regimes. The BRICs vary considerably in their health and educational outcomes. While Brazil and China have relatively successful public health care systems, Brazil's educational system lacks adequate resources and hasn't succeeded at building a skilled work force, while China's education system is producing a large number of skilled college graduates. Russia and India's governments are failing to adequately invest in health and education, the product of a lack of political commitment and inadequate funding. Despite the appeal of the MINTs idea, those countries are not looking too good either. Most are seeing lowered rates of economic growth. Because of a decline in exports and industrial production, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) slashed Mexico's predicted GDP growth rate from 3.9% in 2012 to 2.9 in 2013 and 3.2% in 2014. In Indonesia, the World Bank projected that economic growth will slow from 5.6% in 2013 to 5.3% in 2014, considerably lower than the 6.2% average in 2012. According to the IMF, however, Nigeria's GDP growth is expected to rise from 6.2% in 2013 to 7.4% in 2014, the product of increased oil exports, economic stability, and increased domestic consumption. Yet the situation in Turkey isn't as peachy. GDP growth decreased from 9.2% in 2010 to 3.6% in 2013, with an OECD forecast of 3.8% in 2014. And just as with the BRIC nations, the MINTs exhibit different political institutions. Mexico and Indonesia are presidential democracies with relatively stable political coalitions. Nigeria is also a presidential democracy challenged by political corruption and ethnic conflict. And Turkey has struggled with corruption and a lack of toleration for dissent. While Mexico and Turkey have succeeded in extending universal health care coverage for the poor and providing medical services, their education system, as well as Indonesia and Nigeria's, are weak, leading to a low level of college graduates and a small skilled labor force. Indonesia and Nigeria's health care systems have also had insufficient resources, doctors and nurses. Adopting the MINTs acronym could lead us to expect too much, too soon. There's a lot more to an emerging nation than its economy: if citizens lack good health care and access to quality education, the country is unlikely to realize its potential. Indeed, even Jim O'Neill admits that it'll take at least 30 years to see if the MINTs become economic powerhouses. Therefore, let's give the MINTs a bit more time to nurture their economies, strengthen their political institutions, and more importantly, invest in their people before we make them models for the rest of the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eduardo J. Gómez.","Inventor of the BRICs concept has a new acronym for a group of nations to watch .

"(CNN) -- If Barcelona's players were driven to tears after last week's shock Champions League exit, they could at least rely on pocketfuls of cash to ease the pain. Sure, the world's best football team has slipped from its throne in recent weeks after losing to Chelsea in a nail-biting European semifinal at Camp Nou and also relinquishing the Spanish crown to Real Madrid. But hold your pity. This, after all, is the best-paid team on the planet, with each of its players earning an average $8.6 million a year according to a new report -- a 10% increase on the previous year. Losing hurts. But the Spanish team, led by record-breaking goal scorer Lionel Messi, can take some comfort in pocketing an average $166,934 each in wages every week. The two-time FIFA Club World Cup champions top the list of the highest-paid sports teams, revealed by researchers Sporting Intelligence. The report looked at the average salaries of 278 teams in 14 leagues across 10 countries. Real Madrid followed close behind in second place with its players earning an average $8.6 million a year. That's a whopping $166,934 per week and a 6% rise on last year. European soccer teams dominated the list, claiming seven of the top 10 spots. And as their billionaire owners continue to spend big on top-level players, traditional American sports such as baseball and basketball are being pushed down the list. Despite not winning a English league title since 1968, Manchester City moved up the earnings rankings from 10th to third this year -- largely thanks to the oil-rich deep pockets of owner Sheikh Mansour. The Abu Dhabi United Group chief has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on star players since buying the club in August 2008. City players now enjoy average annual salaries of $7.4 million, or around $142,389 per week. And after defeating rivals Manchester United in a Premier League battle watched by 600 million people worldwide on Tuesday, Mansour will be hoping to see returns on his mega investments. Likewise Russian billionaire Roman Abromovich will be eager for his Chelsea team -- which climbed from sixth to fourth on the rich list -- to earn their keep and deliver a Champions League title in the May 19 final. His players currently boast an average $6.7 million a year -- around $130,690 a week. Judging by the million-dollar football salaries, you'd be forgiven for thinking the UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations -- agreed in 2009 as a way of controlling clubs' ever-rising expenditure -- had done little to stem spending. ""It is possible but by no means certain that some wage restraint at some European football clubs is on the horizon as a result of new Financial Fair Play rules being introduced by UEFA, the governing body of football across Europe. But the effectiveness of UEFA's policing remains to be seen,"" the Sporting Intelligence report found. ""And in any case, the biggest, richest clubs will almost certainly continue to generate massive sums, and therefore continue to fund growing salary bills."" American basketball franchise the LA Lakers are the first non-football team on the list, coming in at fifth with an average yearly salary of $6.2 million -- or $120,732 per week. Next is baseball's New York Yankees in sixth place, having been top when the list was originally published two years ago. The report's authors say the plummet is partly due to wages being restricted in the U.S. since 2010, while in Europe the amounts spent on top players continues to rise. Rounding out the top 10 were baseball's Philadelphia Phillies, earning an average $5.8 million a year, and Italian soccer team Inter Milan on $5.7 million. Despite the NBA claiming just two teams in the top-24, basketball is still the best-paid league in the world with players earning average annual salaries of $4.29 million. In comparison, Spain's La Liga is skewed towards the top end with Barcelona players earning 22 times more than the lowest teams in the 20-club league. Figures are from the in-progress seasons in NBA basketball, NHL ice hockey, MLB baseball and MLS football, and from the most recently completed seasons for all other teams, including the major leagues of European football, AFL Aussie Rules and NPB Japanese baseball.","Barcelona is best-paid sports team, with players earning average of $8.6 million a year .

"(CNN) -- Fewer than half of Americans oppose legalized same-sex marriage, according to a new poll on the issue released Wednesday, with significant shifts in public opinion on the issue just since last year. More Americans continue to oppose gay marriage than support it, according to the poll, which was released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center. But for the first time since Pew starting asking about same sex marriage 15 years ago, fewer than half of those polled said they oppose legalizing the institution. The poll revealed other firsts. For the first time since Pew began asking about the issue, more white mainline Protestants and white Catholics favor gay marriage than oppose it. ""The shift in opinion on same-sex marriage has been broad-based, occurring across many demographic, political and religious groups,"" Pew's polling analysis said. The analysis noted that political independents, who were opposed to gay marriage by a wide margin just last year, are now divided on the issue. The poll -- which combines two surveys conducted from July to September of this year -- found that 42 percent of Americans favor same-sex marriage, while 48 percent oppose it. In polls conducted in 2009, 37 percent favored gay marriage while 54 percent were opposed, Pew said. ""The public continues to be far more supportive of gays and lesbians serving openly in the military than of allowing legal same-sex marriages,"" the Pew's polling analysis notes. Sixty percent of Americans favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, while 30 percent oppose it. Support for gays serving openly in the military has remained fairly stable over the last five years, Pew said. On gay marriage, the new poll found significant differences of opinions along age, racial and partisan lines. Americans in the so-called Millennial Generation -- those born after the 1980s -- favor gay marriage by 53 percent to 39 percent, the poll found. Among those born between 1928 and 1945, just 29 percent favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, while 59 percent are opposed. Among Democrats, 53 percent support legalized gay marriage, while just 24 percent of Republicans do. And while whites are evenly divided over gay marriage, the poll found, blacks oppose legalizing the institution by a wide margin.","For the first time in Pew poll's history, fewer than half oppose legal gay marriage .

"(CNN) -- Kremlin critic and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, released from more than 10 years of imprisonment in Russia last week, praised the two freed Pussy Riot rockers for enduring months of hell in prison. ""Dear girls. I know that the last months have been a living hell for you, and I am happy to learn that this torture, unworthy of a European country in the 21st century, has ended. ""Releasing political prisoners makes those in power at least a little more humane What is probably most important for you now, is to find the strength not to keep any hatred and anger in your hearts, after your ordeals of imprisonment. Congratulations!"" The punk rockers were thrilled by his comments. ""It's amazing. It would be so great for us to work with him,"" Nadezhda Tolokonnikova said. With the Sochi Olympics less than two months away, Russia has freed high-profile prisoners in recent weeks. A new amnesty law introduced by President Vladimir Putin allowed two members of Pussy Riot to leave prison on Monday, two months before the end of their two-year sentences for a performance critical of Putin. According to Russian media, Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina qualified for amnesty under the new law because they have young children. And last week, Putin pardoned Khodorkovsky, who had been jailed since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. Russia's international image has suffered from an anti-gay law passed under Putin, and there have been threats of protests and boycotts at the Olympics over its bans on ""homosexual propaganda."" The ""Arctic 30"" Russia has dropped its case against at least one of the Greenpeace ""Arctic 30,"" the environmental group said Tuesday on its Arctic Sunrise Twitter feed. According to Greenpeace, crew members of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise were peacefully protesting at an oil rig to bring attention to the threat of oil drilling and climate change. The oil rig belonged to Gazprom, a Moscow-based company. The Arctic 30 includes 28 Greenpeace activists and two freelance journalists. They were detained in September after two activists left their ship and tried to scale the oil platform. Russian authorities have accused the activists of trying to take over the oil platform and of endangering the lives of the company's employees. They say the activists' actions could have led to an environmental disaster. Most of the activists were released from jail by late November, but still faced charges of hooliganism. Russian authorities release most of Greenpeace protest group . Greenpeace spokesman Aaron Gray-Block said the Arctic 30 will be free to leave Russia once they get the proper stamps in their passports from the migration service. ""We know that getting those stamps would be the best Christmas present for the Arctic 30, and we hope it can occur quickly,"" Gray-Block said. CNN's Tom Cohen, Diana Magnay and Phillip Taylor contributed to this report.","NEW: Punk rockers say they hope to work with former oil tycoon on reform .

"(CNN) -- Environmental campaign group Greenpeace has called for people to join a ""global day of solidarity"" Saturday for 30 people detained and charged with piracy by Russia as they protested Arctic drilling last month. Russian authorities made the arrests after two of the activists left the Greenpeace icebreaker Arctic Sunrise and tried to climb the side of an oil platform owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom in the Barents Sea. Greenpeace has condemned the Russian action, saying its activists were taking part in a peaceful protest against the ""slow but unrelenting destruction of the Arctic."" The group has called on supporters around the world to stage candlelight vigils Saturday, holding signs saying ""Free the Arctic 30,"" to highlight the plight of those detained. All 30 people aboard the ship, including 28 activists and two freelance journalists from at least 18 countries, were charged last week with piracy. Meanwhile, the government in the Netherlands -- where the Arctic Sunrise is registered -- wrote to the Dutch parliament Friday to say it has launched legal action aimed at freeing the 30 under the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea. ""With regard to its detention of the ship, Russia invokes its authority to ensure safety at sea in the vicinity of the oil platform,"" Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans wrote. ""The Netherlands agrees on the importance of safety at sea, but in this case we contest the lawfulness of detaining the ship and its crew."" The ""arbitral procedure"" it has filed focuses ""on what the Netherlands views as the unlawfulness of boarding and detaining the ship and on our demand for the release of the ship and its crew,"" it said. ""Under this procedure the Netherlands can in two weeks, if insufficient progress has been made, request the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea to prescribe provisional measures for the release of the ship and its crew."" This would not interfere with Russia's ability to pursue criminal proceedings against the 30 people, Timmermans said. Two of those detained are Dutch nationals, both of whom are receiving consular assistance. The defendants also include Americans Peter Wilcox, who is the captain of the Arctic Sunrise, and Dmitry Litvinov, who Greenpeace says also holds Swedish citizenship. Greenpeace ship captain defies orders, Russians resort to towing . The other detainees are from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Britain, New Zealand, Ukraine, Russia, France, Italy, Turkey, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, the United States and Sweden, the group said. None of those charged last week pleaded guilty, Russia's Investigative Committee said. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. Lawyers acting on Greenpeace's behalf have filed appeals in court seeking the defendants' release, Greenpeace said Thursday. Greenpeace International's General Counsel Jasper Teulings said Friday he welcomed the Dutch government's ""strong stance in support of the rule of law and the right to peacefully protest. Russian officials will now be called to explain their actions before an international court of law, where it will be unable to justify these absurd piracy allegations."" Russian authorities accuse the defendants of trying to commandeer the platform. The authorities and Gazprom also say the activists endangered the lives of the company's employees and that their action could have led to an environmental disaster.

"(CNN) -- Sports venues in the United States have come full circle, going from embodying the history of a city, its teams and fans to multipurpose cookie-cutter structures and back to sport-specific complexes designed with a retro look and feel. There are movements afoot to save some of these unused and often-forgotten places. Some are successful, some fail and some are yet to be decided. Here are some of the most endangered well-known sports sites in the United States and a couple that were sacrificed in the name of progress, selected by CNN.com in conversation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Miami Marine Stadium . The Miami Marine Stadium was built on the tip of Key Biscayne during the early 1960s to help boost Miami tourism and is the only venue in the United States designed for watching boat races. Over time, it became a multipurpose spectator facility, also hosting concerts and sunrise Easter morning services. Its floating barge stage was the setting for Sammy Davis Jr.'s hug of Richard Nixon during the 1972 Republican National Convention. Though closed for 20 years and facing demolition for development, Miami Commissioners voted this summer to give the nonprofit group Friends of the Miami Marine Stadium control of the property while it creates a plan to renovate and reopen the facility. The canopied structure has more than 6,500 seats, and the man-made basin that serves as the ""track"" for boat races is longer than the National Mall in Washington, according to the stadium's modernist-influenced architect, Hilario Candela. Astrodome, Houston . The Astrodome was tagged the ""eighth wonder of the world"" when it opened in 1965. It was the first multipurpose, domed sports facility and its name also became synonymous with artificial turf. The former home of the Houston Astros and Houston Oilers altered the course of sports venues in the United States: many professional sports cities -- Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, San Francisco, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Oakland and Seattle -- built similar multipurpose stadiums -- some covered and some open-air -- for both football and baseball. The future of the Astrodome has been up in the air since 2009. The Oilers left Texas for Tennessee in the late 1990s and the Astros played their last game at the dome in 1999. Harris County voters will vote this November on a bond initiative to renovate the dilapidated structure, which once hosted Muhammad Ali, Evel Knievel and the 1992 Republican Party Convention, into a modernized civic center. Nation's most endangered historic places . Joe Frazier's Gym, Philadelphia . The building that houses Joe Frazier's Gym has stood in North Philadelphia since 1895, according to the National Park Service. Born in South Carolina, Frazier made his way to New York City and, despite being diagnosed with cataracts, became a boxer, won a gold medal in Tokyo in 1964 and settled in Philadelphia. In 1968 he turned the three-story structure into his personal gym, living upstairs and training downstairs. ""Smokin' Joe,"" who defended the heavyweight championship in 1971 by becoming to the first person to beat Muhammad Ali as a professional, also won an Olympic gold medal in boxing in 1964. Frazier sold the building in 2008 and died of liver cancer in 2011. The structure was on the brink of oblivion until this year, when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Hinchliffe Stadium, Paterson, New Jersey . Hinchliffe Stadium opened in 1932 in Paterson, New Jersey, and was home to the New York Black Yankees, the New York Cubans and the Newark Eagles of the Negro League. Larry Doby, the man who broke the color barrier in the American League, played there during high school before joining the Newark Eagles. Several other professional baseball teams played in the 10,000-seat venue, which also hosted football, boxing, auto racing, track and field meets, international soccer and concerts. The facility has been vacant since 1997 when a lack of upkeep forced local schools to stop using it. Also referred to as City Stadium, it was named a National Historic Landmark this year. New Jersey representatives have introduced legislation to have it included as part of Paterson Great Falls National Historic Park. Tiger Stadium, Detroit . The decision to vacate Tiger Stadium in Detroit was controversial from the start -- and despite making the list of National Register of Historic Places in 1989, multiple efforts failed to save it. Tiger Stadium opened on the same day in 1912 as Fenway Park in Boston, and professional baseball was first played on the site in 1896. The Tigers moved to Comerica Park after the end of the 1999 season, but demolition didn't begin until 2008, taking more than a year to complete. The baseball diamond is still there, maintained for the last three years by group of volunteer weekend warriors named the Navin Field Grounds Crew, after one of the stadium's previous monikers. The Kingdome, Seattle . The Kingdome opened in 1976 and was home to the Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Mariners, Seattle Supersonics and Seattle Sounders. In 1994, the building started crumbling, when ceiling tiles fell from the roof, forcing the Seahawks to play several games at the University of Washington. The Mariners moved to Safeco Field in July of 1999. The facility was demolished in 2000 and the Seahawks returned to the University of Washington for two years before moving into to CenturyLink Field in 2002. The venue was considered hideous by many and the movement to save the Kingdome was primarily financially based, as taxpayers still owed $125 million when it was demolished in 2000. Still, notable athletes played there, such as former U.S. Rep. Steve Largent, a Hall of Fame receiver for the Seahawks, and Randy Johnson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, who all starred for the Mariners.","Miami Marine Stadium is the only venue in the U.S. built to watch boat racing .

"(CNN) -- The goals just keep flowing for Lionel Messi, who on Sunday surpassed soccer legend Pele's mark of 75 in a calendar year to help Barcelona bounce back from a rare defeat. The Argentina star netted twice in the 4-2 win at Mallorca that kept the Catalans three points clear in Spain's La Liga, leaving him just nine short of Gerd Muller's all-time record. The 25-year-old, who became a first-time father earlier this month, was able to put a bit more enthusiasm into his new thumb-sucking celebration than when he scored late in the shock midweek Champions League loss to Scottish side Celtic. ""Leo continually breaks records. His goal tally is spectacular,"" said Barca manager Tito Vilanova, who has yet to experience a domestic league defeat after his first 11 matches in charge, equaling the best start to a season set by Real Madrid. ""It takes other great players seven or eight seasons to score the amount of goals he scores in one season. Also, some of his goals are absolute beauties."" Read blog: Is loyalty Barca's biggest strength? Messi has now scored 64 goals for his club and 12 for his country this year, from just 59 matches overall. Pele managed 75 from 53 as a 17-year-old in 1958, helping Brazil to win the World Cup for the first of a record five times. Muller, a World Cup winner in 1974, surpassed Pele's record in a year that West Germany won the European Championship. Messi has yet to win a senior title with Argentina, though he won Olympic gold with the under-23 side in 2008. He has nine matches left this year to catch Muller -- six in La Liga, two in the Champions League and one in the Spanish Cup. His two goals against Malaga gave him 15 in the league this season, three clear of his big rival Cristiano Ronaldo -- who scored the opener in Real Madrid's 2-1 win on a waterlogged pitch at Levante in Sunday's late match. Ronaldo, switched to a central attacking role with Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuain out injured, suffered an early blow above the eye and was taken off at halftime. The Portugal captain is now Real's seventh highest league scorer with 124 goals since his arrival from Manchester United in 2009 in a world-record $130 million transfer. Levante leveled in the second half through Angel Rodriguez, but 20-year-old Alvaro Morata headed an 84th-minute winner with his first touch of the ball on his debut to keep Jose Mourinho's third-placed defending champions eight points behind Barcelona. Real inflicted Levante's first home defeat this season, hitting the crossbar twice and missing a penalty by Xabi Alonso, whose late freekick set up substitute Morata's winner. Atletico Madrid retained second place after beating Getafe 2-0. Adrian Lopez scored a first-half opener after his initial attempt was saved, while Arda Turan's second-half effort was allowed to stand despite a clear handball in the buildup. In Italy, Inter Milan failed to reduce Juventus' four-point lead after suffering a surprise 3-2 defeat at Atalanta. Veteran striker German Denis netted in the 60th and 67th minutes to put the home side 3-1 ahead, while Inter reduced the deficit through his fellow Argentine Rodrigo Palacio before Atalanta substitute Facundo Parra was sent off in time added on. Napoli stayed third with a 4-2 win at Genoa, while fourth-placed Fiorentina won 3-1 away to troubled 2010-11 Serie A champions AC Milan. Milan's sixth defeat in 12 league games left last season's runners-up in 13th place, with coach Massimiliano Allegri's future increasingly in doubt. Lazio consolidated fifth place with a 3-2 win in the capital derby against Roma, as both teams had a player sent off. In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen missed the chance to go above fourth-placed champions Borussia Dortmund after losing 3-1 to third-bottom Wolfsburg. Leverkusen stayed a point above Hanover, who won 4-2 at Stuttgart.","Lionel Messi scores twice as Barcelona beat Mallorca 4-2 on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A paramedic who responded to a horrific, deadly fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas -- and who later spoke at a memorial for its victims -- was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for conspiring to make a pipe bomb, a prosecutor's office said. Bryce Reed pleaded guilty earlier this fall to conspiracy to possess an unregistered destructive device and attempted obstruction of justice. Reed, 31, was sentenced on those charges Wednesday afternoon in Waco, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas. He will be subject to three years of supervised release after getting out of prison and must pay a $2,000 fine. Reed was among the emergency workers who responded to an ammonium nitrate explosion that killed 15 people -- most of them firefighters and paramedics -- and devastated West, a town about 20 miles north of Waco and 75 miles south of Dallas. He was vocal afterward as well, speaking to reporters and at a memorial service at Baylor University for the blast's victims. In a previous statement, Reed's lawyers stressed that neither the charges nor the resulting plea agreement ""have anything to do with the tragic explosion"" that damaged dozens of homes, two schools and a nursing home and was so big that seismographs registered it as a small earthquake. DA sees no link so far between weapons possession and Texas blast . Yet the blast did play a part in his arrest, according to the federal prosecutor. Reed's home was among those affected by the April 17 explosion, prompting him to stay in a hotel in West. Before that, authorities say, he'd bought pipe bomb components and had them shipped to his house. There, with the help of another person, he built a place for the pipe bomb, storing it ""inside two ammunition cans."" On April 26, believing authorities going through explosion-damaged West homes might find the pipe bomb, Reed asked two people to go to his house, ""retrieve the ammunition cans and bring them to him, which they did,"" reports the U.S. attorney's office. The paramedic then packed the cans and bomb-making materials in a box to give to another man, telling him to ""get rid of this."" This man took the box and put it in a spare bedroom in his Abbott, Texas, home, finally opening it on May 7, the prosecutor's office said. ""He immediately notified the McLellan County Sheriff's Office, who took possession of the items,"" the U.S. attorney's office added. It was then that Reed became a focus of investigators, who saw the materials, including galvanized metal pipe, a fuse, coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders. Reed chose to plead guilty, his lawyers said in October, ""to accept full responsibility for what he believes is his role in the allegations against him"" and to avoid a long trial. ""Finally, ... Mr. Reed believes that continuing to draw out this process will be a distraction to the most important issue, the losses suffered by the heroes, friends and loved ones in the West community,"" the attorneys added.","Bryce Reed is sentenced to 21 months in federal prison, a prosecutor's office says .

"(CNN) -- A year ago in an interview with CNN's Carol Costello, I said it would take a difference-maker, a Rosa Parks or a Jackie Robinson-like figure, to stand up for what is right and break the ice so real progress can be made in the battle for equality in professional sports. Twelve shorts months later, we get to meet that courageous person, the one who is creating positive change and breaking down barriers before our very eyes. Like Parks or Robinson, Michael Sam is a difference-maker. Never before has there been an openly gay player active on a roster in the three biggest professional sports leagues -- NFL, MLB and NBA. With his decision to come out publicly as he begins his professional football career, Michael Sam will forever be seen as an iconic figure to professional athletes and the LGBT community. He is a bold spirit who has just accelerated the process of acceptance of homosexuals in professional sports. Is the NFL ready for a gay player? Truthfully, it doesn't matter. The time has come. There will, however, be players, fans and organizations who directly or indirectly express their ignorant, homophobic and antiquated views on homosexuality. As a former professional athlete, I can imagine what it is like to anticipate receiving the league's first openly gay player, and it should be a great honor for any player to gain Sam as a teammate. It would allow them to be a part of this movement into a new era. Conversely, there will be players such as Jonathan Vilma who will express concern about how to respond if gay teammates tried to look at them while they are naked in the locker room or shower. There will be baleful fans who hide behind screen names in chat rooms and on Twitter and Facebook who ""shout"" in all caps hateful, derogatory and homophobic slurs at gay athletes. This type of person matters not, and they should just continue to be ignored and remain as nameless, faceless, irrelevant cowards. There may be NFL teams who will not draft Sam in the upcoming draft now. You may hear that some general managers of NFL teams think that a gay player would be a distraction for the team. When you hear these types of comments, just chuckle and remember that the Missouri Tigers finished the 2013 season ranked No. 5 in the nation, went 12-2 in the Southeastern Conference, or SEC (arguably the best conference in all of college football), while their star player, Sam, was named First Team All-American, SEC co-defensive player of the year -- and he happened to be gay. Sam told his team about his sexuality before the 2013 season, and I am blown away by the incredible example that has been set by his teammates, his head coach Gary Pinkel, and the entire Missouri football staff. They embraced him, supported him, rallied behind him and respected him enough to let him come out to the public on his own terms. Their example is a microcosm of what homosexuality in sports can and will be. Will Sam's decision to come out before the NFL draft have a negative effect on his draft status? Perhaps, but if teams pass on Sam because of his sexual orientation, they did not deserve him. Courageous difference-makers deserve to be surrounded by bold, brave and like-minded leaders. I reiterate: It will be a boon to gain Sam as a teammate. Many of us grew up in households where we learned that that everyone is created equally, but as we discovered the world and some of the ignorant and hateful people in it, we learned that everyone is not treated equally. History shows us that many groups were unjustifiably treated differently. It is baffling and unthinkable today that some ""minority groups"" were ostracized and mistreated because of their race, religion, gender, height, handedness, and even because of their birthmarks. Ignorance can be overcome. Equality can be achieved. Complete acceptance of homosexuals in professional sports will not come easy. Great things rarely do. There will be much backlash and discussion. Some will call Sam ""crazy"" for coming out. But the same adjective could have been used to describe some of the greatest minds and difference-makers the world has ever known. Martin Luther King Jr., Florence Kelley, Eleanor Roosevelt and many others have stood up for what is right, and the rest of us have benefited. We can all contribute to our society as the greats before us have, but to do so, we have to be willing to smash the status quo and perhaps be called ""crazy.""

"(CNN) -- Utah's roller coaster few weeks regarding same-sex marriage has taken yet another sharp turn, with the state tax board announcing that legally married gay and lesbian couples -- even those wed in the brief period of limbo in Utah -- can file joint returns. The Utah State Tax Commission detailed the apparent policy change posted on its website, explaining that same-sex couples who are eligible to file a joint federal income tax return can likewise file joint returns in Utah. In other words, the state -- for tax purposes -- will treat them just like heterosexual couples. The state agency, in an official notice dated Wednesday, said this decision isn't necessarily permanent: If federal courts side with Utah officials arguing that the state law limiting marriage to one man and one woman be upheld, then same-sex couples will not be able to file joint state tax returns next year in Utah. ""This notice is limited to the 2013 tax year,"" the commission said. ""Filing information for future years will be provided as court rulings and other information becomes available."" Charlie Roberts, a spokesman for the state tax agency, said the decision put Utah's tax outlook on same-sex couples on par with that of the federal government, which has said it will recognize such legal unions. It does not, however, mean that the Utah government -- as a broader entity -- is right now recognizing same-sex marriage. ""This is just one agency, one decision,"" Roberts said. Whatever the rationale, this shift marks a significant milestone for LGBT supporters in the traditionally conservative state. It comes after U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby ruled on December 20 that Utah's law prohibiting same-sex marriage -- which voters approved in 2004 -- conflicted with the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Afterward, many couples in the state sought and got marriage licenses. Officials said more than 1,000 such licenses were issued in a 17-day period, though it's not clear if all those people actually wed. Judge's ruling ignites same-sex marriage frenzy . The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals declined to immediately stay the lower court ruling, leading Utah officials to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. The high court did just that in a two-sentence order on January 6 that, without comment, put same-sex marriages on hold in Utah until the constitutional questions are fully resolved. That apparently unanimous order in favor of the state sends the matter back to an appeals court for expedited consideration. The Denver-based appeals court is expected to consider the case again in coming weeks more thoroughly, with a ruling possibly affecting all states in its jurisdiction: Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. That last state, Oklahoma, is in a similar situation after a federal judge struck down its same-sex marriage ban. But he immediately stayed his own ruling, as the matter works its way through the courts. Judge: Oklahoma gay marriage ban unconstitutional . Still, what's happening in Utah was and remains less clear-cut. While the federal government has said it will recognize same-sex marriages performed between late December and early January in the state, the state had hinted that it would not. This indication came in a January 8 letter from the office of Utah Gov. Gary Herbert to cabinet officials saying that, based on advice from the state's attorney general, ""state recognition of same-sex marital status is ON HOLD until further notice."" ""Please understand this position is not intended to comment on the legal status of those same-sex marriages -- that is for the courts to decide,"" wrote the governor's chief of staff, Derek Miller. ""The intent of this communication is to direct state agency compliance with current laws that prohibit the state from recognizing same-sex marriages."" This week's tax commission announcement, though, does signal at least parts of the state government are recognizing such unions. It applies not just to the hundreds married in Utah, but also to those gay and lesbian couples who might have gotten legally married in other states then moved to Utah. Roberts, the state tax commission spokesman, explained that authorities -- including his group's director and the attorney general -- decided over the past 10 days that it made sense to have Utah play by the same rules, tax-wise, as the U.S. government until the legal situation plays itself out. ""We feel this brings us in line with the current judicial situation,"" Roberts said. This shift may surprise some given Utah's reputation politically. It's the home of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as Mormons, whose leaders have been vocal in efforts to limit marriage to a man and woman. Its voters have voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election since 1968. And its officials now have stood behind the legal efforts to defend their state's existing law. But there are also some signs that the situation in the state on this issue may not be crystal clear. A recent poll commissioned by the Salt Lake Tribune, one of the state's biggest newspapers, found an even split -- 48% for and 48% against -- of people asked if same-sex couples should be allowed to get state-issued marriage licenses. It's margin of error is +/- 4.1%. In the same survey, 72% of respondents said same-sex couples should at least be allowed to have civil unions or domestic partnerships. CNN's Drew Iden contributed to this report.","Utah's tax commission says that same-sex couples can file joint returns for 2013 .

"(CNN) -- The Copa del Rey provided some respite for Barcelona after a double dose of defeats. The Catalan giants, who are without the talents of their mercurial striker Lionel Messi, had fallen to consecutive defeats to Ajax, in the Champions League, and to Athletic Bilbao in La Liga. This time, Barcelona survived an early scare in Spain's domestic cup after Division 2B side Cartagena took the lead when Fernando found the back of the net. Pedro Rodriguez put the Spanish league leaders back on level terms in the first leg of the fourth round tie before half time. He doubled his tally after the break with Cesc Fabregas and Cameroon teenager Jean Marie Dongou wrapping up a 4-1 victory. It was Dongou's first senior goal for the club. Barcelona got as far as the semifinals in last year's domestic cup -- the so-called ""King's Cup"" -- with Atletico Madrid lifting the trophy. Juventus stretched their lead at the top of Serie A in the Italian league's only match Friday. The defending champions remain unbeaten in the domestic series this season after ticking off a 2-0 away win in Bologna. Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal followed up his Champions League hat-trick against FC Copenhagen with an opening goal for Juventus, volleying Federico Peluso's pass into the roof of the net. Bologna came close to an equaliser in the first half when Alessandro Diamanti had his shot from outside the box blocked by Gianluigi Buffon. The Italian keeper can feel pleased with his safe hands as Juventus have not conceded a goal in Serie A for seven matches. Juve had to wait until the dying minutes of the match to double their score which came when Giorgio Chiellini headed in Carlos Tevez's corner. The victory was a nice tune-up ahead of their final Champions League match at Galatasaray next Tuesday. Antonio Conte's side may be six points clear at the top of Serie A but they still need a point against the Turkish champions to reach the last 16 of the elite European competition. The result in Bologna left the home side hovering near the foot of Serie A with only Sampdoria and Catania below them. In France, Marseille were leap-frogged by Nantes as the home side nicked a 1-0 victory thanks to a solo strike from American midfielder Alejandro Bedoya. The win saw Nantes move up to fourth in the Ligue 1 table while Marseille dropped back to fifth.","Barcelona return to winning ways with 4-1 win in Spain's Copa del Rey .

"(CNN) -- After losing a close friend to liver failure, Candy Chang spent a lot of time thinking about how she wanted to live out her days. Contemplating death brought clarity to her life, but she struggled to maintain perspective amid the daily grind. She wondered whether other people went through the same struggle, and what mattered to them. She decided to invite others to share those thoughts by painting a chalkboard on the side of an abandoned house in New Orleans stenciled with the sentence ""Before I die I want to ________."" What began as an experiment in making a public space into a shared space has become a global art project, with more than 400 ""Before I die"" walls in 60 countries and 25 languages. It's been quite the journey for Chang, who did not launch the project with plans to expand beyond New Orleans. But it resonated among pockets of passionate people around the globe. ""Our public spaces are as profound as we allow them to be,"" Chang, an artist, designer and urban planner, said in an e-mail. ""Our public spaces are our shared spaces, and they have a lot of potential to offer us a more valuable and meaningful kind of life. I think about why we came together in the first place. Some of the earliest gathering places were graves and sacred groves. We gathered so we could grieve together and worship together and console one another and be alone together."" Many of the walls disappear a few months after they're ""born,"" just like Chang's did, after someone bought the building and renovated it. Then, others pop up. Such is life. In honor of the release of the first book celebrating Before I die's global footprint, we asked Chang to reflect upon the most common themes expressed in the walls. Hopefully, they inspire you to reconsider your hopes, dreams and aspirations. 1. Well-being . ""Before I die"" came out of Chang's grief and depression, and the responses ""have reassured me that I'm not alone as I try to make sense of myself,"" she said. ""Carl Jung said it's easier to go to the moon than it is to penetrate one's own being. Mental health takes as much exertion as physical health,"" she said. Examples: . ""Abandon all insecurities"" (New Orleans) ""Come to terms with who I am"" (Washington) ""Slow down for a moment and maybe even stop"" (Portsmouth, Hew Hampshire) ""Find serenity"" (Vicenza, Italy) ""Stop being afraid"" (Jerusalem) ""Overcome depression"" (Newport News, Virginia) ""Lose my fear of death"" (Trujillo, Peru) ""Find what I'm looking for (San Francisco) ""Heal"" (Montreal) ""Find closure"" (Erfurt, Germany) ""Keep getting better every day"" (Chung-Li, Taiwan) ""Feel comfortable in my skin"" (Burning Man festival) ""Reach my constant happiness"" (Berlin) ""Learn to be brave"" (Almaty, Kazakhstan) ""Right all my wrongs"" (Brooklyn) ""Learn how to enjoy myself and let go"" (Savannah, Georgia) ""Feel that nothing was missing or left over"" (Santiago, Chile) 2. Love . ""Love and be loved"" is one of the most common responses on walls around the world, Chang said. She's also seen budding romance on walls. ""In New Orleans, someone wrote, 'Before I die I want to eat a salad with an alien,' and someone else drew an arrow and wrote 'Before I die I want to marry this person,' "" she said. Examples: . ""Love her until the end of the world"" (Cordoba, Argentina) ""Sleep with a harp player"" (Lisbon, Portugal) ""Get married for the 10th time"" (Dublin) ""Find and kiss her one last time"" (Chicago) ""Find my true love"" (Beijing) ""Love recklessly again"" (New Orleans) ""Find my other half"" (Madrid) ""Accompany him forever"" (Chung-Li, Taiwan) ""Be loved unconditionally"" (Jersey City, New Jersey) 3. Travel . Who doesn't have a long list of places they'd like to visit? Travel can be the hardest thing to find the time and money to invest in, but that doesn't stop us from dreaming and plotting adventures. ""My family had a big white van that we drove all over the place when I was a kid,"" Chang said. ""Ever since, traveling has been my school and my therapy. I've taken many road trips across America, and I worked in Nairobi, Helsinki, Medan, Johannesburg and beyond. Those experiences deeply shaped who I am today. It's made me more open-minded, reflective, compassionate, and grateful."" Examples: . ""Travel around the world by foot"" (Almaty, Kazakhstan) ""Ride a motorcycle across South America"" (Cordoba, Argentina) ""Take my wife to Liverpool"" (Portsmouth, New Hampshire) ""Ride my bike up the top ten highest mountains in Thailand"" (Chiang Mai, Thailand) ""Visit Venice with the love of my life"" (Auckland, New Zealand) ""Drive Route 66"" (Melbourne, Australia) ""Travel across India on a bike"" (Hyderabad, India) ""Straddle the International Date Line"" (New Orleans) ""Finish climbing Everest"" (Reno, Nevada) ""Enjoy a pleasant cruise"" (Pohang City, South Korea) 4. Helping others . Many of us say we'd like to ""donate lots of money,"" ""change a child's life,"" ""help my neighbor"" or ""build a public school and a shelter."" But putting others ahead of ourselves can be a tall order for some, especially in an era of instant gratification. But, it's never too late, said Chang, and even the smallest gesture can last a lifetime. ""I'll never forget a middle school art teacher who encouraged me when I was full of self-doubt, a neighbor who fixed my bike pedal or a stranger who went out of his way to return my lost bag. Compassion lasts much longer than the moment."" Examples: . ""Teach kids to live love and be free"" (Johannesburg) ""Save lives"" (Dubai) ""Help people through neuroscience"" (Portsmouth, New Hampshire) ""Fix Nick's car"" (Cape Town, South Africa) ""Make someone's day"" (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) ""See a just society"" (Madrid) ""Do something for animals and make the world a better place"" (Hyderabad, India) 5. Family . ""Making this project made me realize how much more I want to know my parents,"" Chang said. ""I'm glad we're at a stage where we're good friends now, and I ask them fifty questions for every photograph from their childhood. Each week, my dad sends me endearing stories that only enhance the inspiring mythology of our lives."" Examples: . ""Bring peace of mind to my mom"" (Brooklyn) ""See my youngest fly"" (Minneapolis) ""See where my grandma grew up"" (Townsville, Australia) ""See my parents again"" (Erfurt, Germany) ""Speak with my children one last time"" (Cordoba, Spain) ""Make my parents proud"" (Burning Man festival) ""See my daughter graduate"" (New Orleans) ""Be back in my kid's life"" (Reno, Nevada) ""Build a house for my mother"" (Trujillo, Peru) ""Meet my daughter"" (Montreal) ""Be a grandfather"" (Madrid) ""Take care of my parents"" (Hyderabad) ""Have seven children"" (AsunciÃ³n, Paraguay) ""Raise good kids"" (Charleston, South Carolina)","The ""Before I Die"" global art project invites people to share hopes, dreams on public walls .

"(CNN) -- They said he was crazy. And he knew they were a little bit afraid. When a small Swedish industrial town took in thousands of African immigrants, there were some concerns as to how it would work. The locals in Borlänge, located 200 km north of the capital, were already struggling with the economic realities of modern-day life. The arrival of 3,000 Somalis would swell the population to almost 50,000 -- raising the type of fears that have become all too common across Europe. Last May Sweden experienced its worst riots in years following the death of a 69-year-old man who was shot by police earlier while wielding a machete in the Stockholm suburb of Husby, which has a large number of immigrant residents. But one man thought he had the answer. ""I feared there would be problems with a lot of people coming from Somalia to a little town,"" says Borlange resident Patrik Andersson. ""That can make problems. I thought integration in sport was a good way to work. It's something everyone has in common. If we could just do something that everybody could get together around, it would help. ""I do think people in Borlänge were afraid as they'd not seen that situation before. I think from the start very few people have been angry with me. There have been good vibrations."" Football is often credited with bringing people together, a unifying force -- and indeed a game popular with the Somalis. But Andersson had a better idea. Why not get them to play the local game, Bandy -- a close relative of ice hockey? ""People on the street said I was crazy, the manager said I was crazy, the people of Somalia asked if I was crazy, the national Bandy organization too. But we are nearly there now,"" Andersson told CNN. He has managed to bring together a team of Somali football players, none of whom had ever skated on ice before, and take them to the Bandy World Championships starting in Russia this weekend. ""Just being there is a victory whether we win, lose or draw,"" says Ahmed Hussain, who plays in midfield. ""OK, we want to score once but this is our victory. It will be amazing to play in our national colors, to hear our national anthem."" Hussain, who moved to Sweden five years ago, admits he was not well versed in snow or ice -- which is not surprising, having grown up in an east African country where the temperature gauge rarely drops below 23C (73F). ""Really, I thought ice was just something you put in Coca-Cola,"" he says, almost embarrassed by the recollection. Andersson was well aware of the challenge he faced. The players, most of whom are 18 or 19, were not exactly natural skaters. ""I said to them they were like Bambi on ice -- the problem was they hadn't even heard of Bambi,"" he adds, laughing. For Hussain, it is a welcome relief from the ordeal of living in his war-torn homeland. ""Life in Somalia was awful and tough to handle,"" he admits. ""Every day is like a new day in Somalia. ""You don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or even in the next hour. It was a clash every day. There was war and between that you could still be shot. ""My Mum took care of me, and she would keep me at home, but I have seen things. ""I had a friend who was 10 years old when he was shot in the back, who just wanted to go to the football field. He made it, he didn't die, but it's so hard for him now just to walk. His life is tough. People were just always running. It's so tough."" When not practicing his Bandy playing two hours a day, the 19-year-old is studying with the aim of becoming a doctor or architect. His father Hussein also lives in Sweden, while his mother has moved to Uganda. ""Initially my father saw the sport and said, 'You're going to break your arm or leg,' and he was right,"" he says. ""When I first skated I was terrible. There were children aged five on the ice better than me. I was thinking even if I ice-skate for six years I can't do this, I spent so much time falling over."" Those first tentative, Bambi-like steps took place just six months ago and now his father's perceptions have changed. ""He's OK now, he's happy,"" says Hussain. The Somali players have finally found the target, scoring their first goals in training this week. How the journey ends remains to be seen, but a film is being made of their passage from Somalia to Siberia. A Hollywood ending seems unlikely, though that is hardly the point. ""We want to show the world that everything is possible,"" Hussain says. Coached by Per Fosshaug, who won five world titles playing for Sweden, the Somali team will take on Japan, Ukraine, Germany and Mongolia in the tournament, which starts in the Siberian city of Irkutsk on Sunday. Local Borlange band Apopocalyps even recorded a World Championship anthem for the town's adopted team. Somalia's entry is a contest that makes David versus Goliath look like a fair fight, as the novices take on the powerhouses of a sport played between two teams of 11 on an ice rink the size of a football field, using hockey sticks and an orange ball. ""I'm so nervous just to think about it because I never imagined this would be possible,"" Hussain says. ""I dreamed one day to be a world champion but I never had anything but football. When I was first told about this, I was like, 'Is this serious or a joke?' But it's now real. ""It has made us so proud. I explain it to my family and friends in Somalia. They don't understand Bandy completely but they are so proud of us, the country is proud of us.""","Somali national bandy team set up in small Swedish town made up of refugees .

"(CNN) -- Singapore plans to deport dozens of foreign workers who were involved in the country's first major riot in more than 40 years, authorities said Tuesday. Some 52 Indian citizens and a Bangladeshi national will be sent home soon for their role in an attack on emergency services crews and their vehicles after a fatal traffic accident in Singapore's Little India district earlier this month, according to the police commissioner, Ng Joo Hee. Most of the 53 individuals, who were being held in prison on Tuesday, have been in Singapore for less than five years, Ng said in a statement. About half are construction workers. ""They have been served with stern police warnings and immigration removal orders, and will be repatriated to their home countries shortly,"" Ng said. Another 28 people, who were directly involved in the violence, have been charged and could face up to seven years in prison and caning. ""They were violent, they had attacked uniformed personnel and vehicles, damaged property, and had incited others to do so,"" said the police commissioner. Charges against seven more people will be dropped, he added. The riot broke out among a crowd of hundreds of people on December 8, shortly after a bus ran over a 33-year-old Indian man. According to Singaporean authorities, the mob set fire to vehicles, hurled objects and attacked rescue crews as they attempt to recover the man's body. Around 200 foreign workers who were at the scene of the attack but did not directly participate will be issued an advisory, and will be allowed to stay in Singapore, ""on condition of continued good behavior,"" Ng said Tuesday. Police do not expect to make many more arrests, charges or repatriations over the incident, he added. An investigation into the accident that sparked the riot is ongoing.","Singapore will repatriate South Asian workers involved in a riot in the Little India district .

"Paris (CNN) -- The operation to recover bodies from the crash of Air France 447, which plunged into the Atlantic Ocean two years ago, has ended with 27 more sets of human remains brought to the surface, a French official told CNN on Wednesday. That means 74 bodies will never be found. The last group of bodies was brought to the surface on Friday, Philippe Vinogradoff said Wednesday. A total of 104 bodies were recovered from the remains of the mystery crash during this year's operation, in addition to the 50 that were found in the days after the loss of the plane. Human remains and aircraft parts are headed by ship to the Canary Islands, where they are expected to arrive Thursday, French air accident investigators said. From there, they will be transferred to Bayonne in southwest France, investigators said. All 228 people onboard were killed when the plane crashed in stormy weather en route to Paris from Brazil on June 1, 2009. It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of the wreckage, still containing many bodies, in a mountain range deep under the ocean. Seventy-five bodies were recovered late last month, more than doubling the number of remains that have been found, the vice president of the French victims' association told CNN. The remains have not yet been identified, Robert Soulas said. Soulas got the news from a French government liaison appointed to deal with victims' families, he said. ""Personally, I would have preferred to leave the bodies of our loved ones on the seafloor,"" he added, repeating his long-held view. Other victims' relatives disagree. Details of the doomed plane's last minutes began to emerge last month as French air accident investigators studied data recorders recovered from the wreck earlier this year. The Airbus A330 plummeted 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds amid conflicting information that may have led the pilots to make bad decisions, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said last month. The pilots got conflicting air speed readings in the minutes leading up to the crash, according to an interim report. The aircraft climbed to 38,000 feet when ""the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled,"" the report says. Aviation experts are asking why the pilots responded to the stall by pulling the nose up instead of pushing it down to recover. ""You push down on the wheel to gain air speed, perhaps they (pilots) were getting information that the air speed was too high,"" said Miles O'Brien, a pilot and aviation analyst. ""Pulling the nose up will exacerbate an aerodynamic stall."" The speeds displayed on the left primary flight display were ""inconsistent"" with those on the integrated standby instrument system (ISIS), the report says. The aircraft experienced some ""rolling"" before stalling and then descending rapidly at 10,912 feet (3,300 meters) per minute. At the time of the descent, the two co-pilots and captain were in the aircraft cockpit. The pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence. Air crash investigators at the Paris-based BEA have been working on the theory that the speed sensors, known as pitot tubes or probes, malfunctioned because of ice at high altitude. CNN's Thair Shaikh contributed to this report.","NEW: 74 bodies will never be found .

"(CNN) -- A rogue trader has cost UBS an estimated $2 billion, the Swiss banking giant announced Thursday, revealing what could be the third-largest loss of its kind in banking history. A $2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented, market analyst Ralph Silva told CNN. ""We have only had three or four other situations... in the billions, and that is exactly what happened,"" he said. The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said. Shares in UBS were down 11% on the U.S. stock exchange at midday trading, though, even as European markets closed higher Thursday. Police arrested a man on suspicion of fraud in an early-morning operation in London's banking district hours before the loss was announced, they said. UBS contacted the police at 1 a.m. about an allegation of fraud, and a 31-year-old man was arrested at work two and a half hours later, police commander Ian Dyson said. British media named the suspect as UBS trader Kweku Adoboli, 31. CNN has not independently confirmed his identity, but was told when calling his desk at UBS that he was not available. The bank declined to comment on the arrest. News of the rogue trader comes amid pronounced economic anxiety in Europe. Markets there have been in turmoil in recent weeks as concern has mounted that Greece might default on its huge debt, sending shock waves through the 17-nation eurozone and further afield. Just this week, the credit rating agency Moody's downgraded two French banks. On Thursday -- even as news was circulating of the incident at UBS -- came word that the Federal Reserve and four other powerful central banks announced they were throwing a lifeline to Europe's struggling banks. The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt. European banks have seen U.S. dollars flow out as U.S. financial institutions and money market accounts scale back exposure to European banks, amid fears over those institutions' exposure to debt held by Greece and other European nations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is to attend a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed. Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present. The conference comes ahead of G20 and IMF meetings later this month. As to the episode at UBS, Silva, the analyst, outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place: intentional fraud, ""basic stupidity"" in trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls ""fat fingers,"" which means typing the wrong number by accident. Perhaps the trader ""put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem,"" Silva said. Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job. ""Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year,"" said van Dam. ""With the volatility in banking stocks, commodities and currencies, things can go wrong really, really easily. If you're worried about your job and you try to hide (a mistake or loss), you can see how these situations arise."" A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said. ""He must have done something that he wasn't supposed to do, obviously,"" van Dam said. UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated. But the ""unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank"" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said. The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading. Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year. Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997. Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie ""Rogue Trader,"" lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close. UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said. There is a ""much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up"" into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said. He favors that alternative, he said. ""The banks are too large,"" van Dam said. ""The products are so complicated, and the management doesn't understand it."" UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that. CNN's Nina dos Santos, Irene Chapple, Ben Rooney, Alex Mohacs, James Partington, Laura Perez Maestro, Kendra Petersen, Nick Thompson and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","UBS itself reported the rogue trader to police, officers say .

"(Oprah.com) -- Three women share their stories of how a feeling or hunch changed the direction of their lives. Her little boy found . Nothing signaled distress about the laughing 5-year-old child that Maryam Dilakian saw -- except a strange, insistent feeling in her gut. --As told to Kate Rockwood . I was in Jamaica for a wedding, and I felt the pull to volunteer. The resort manager directed me to a few orphanages that might admit visitors, and one reluctantly said that I could come. The place had three sections, and I ended up spending my time with the infants and toddlers, because I'd heard the bigger kids didn't need help. As I was leaving, I passed three of the older kids running around. One of them was laughing really loudly, and I smiled at him as I walked away. I've never been able to adequately describe what happened next. Outside, the taxi was waiting, at the top of a hill quite far from town, and when I went out, someone locked the gate behind me. I opened the door of the cab, put my bag on the seat, and all at once I knew I needed to help the little boy I'd smiled at -- he was in trouble. It made no sense: He'd been laughing when I saw him; he didn't look like he needed me at all. But my heart started to race and I began to feel physically numb. The thought kept coming again and again -- I need to help him. Oprah.com: What real love looks like . Going back into the orphanage wasn't easy. I had to argue with the driver to wait and then buzz until someone came to unlock the gate. They weren't happy to see me. The schoolers were outside, and the boy I'd seen -- Daniel -- was on the ground, looking absolutely pitiful. He was like a different child. I have never in my life fought back tears so hard as at that moment. I fell to my knees and embraced him and I knew instantly, without a doubt: This is my son. Later I realized that he must have just been punished. On trips that followed, I saw Daniel physically abused when he got in the way. He's a boisterous kid. He runs a lot, he laughs a lot. I learned that children in Jamaican orphanages normally stay six months, until the court decides they can return to their family or be adopted. But Daniel's file had been lost, so he never had a chance. He lived in that home for three and a half years, standing in a crib, looking at a wall. No music -- no nothing. He'd never been out of the orphanage. He didn't even speak. When I went to the adoption agency, the man said, ""You cannot adopt a child that doesn't exist."" I showed him Daniel's photo, and said, ""Here is this child."" It took me six trips to Jamaica to set things right. Two weeks after Daniel came to live with me in New York City, he started speaking. I tell him this story every day. I don't let myself imagine, What if I'd gotten in the cab? It felt inevitable -- he'd always been my son. Oprah.com: A working mom adopts 5 kids . Her trouble went deeper than doctors knew . Her doctor assured her she was in good health, but eerie dreams left Trisha Coburn with a sense of foreboding she couldn't shake.  --As told to Lisa Kogan . I was 46 years old, I had three terrific kids, a happy marriage, and a painting studio where I spent hours every day. Not only was nothing wrong in my life, plenty was incredibly right. But then I had the dream. I was standing at a barbed-wire fence across from five or six terribly frail people with huge dark eyes and ghostly pale skin. They were trying to tell me something in a language I didn't understand. It was intense and disturbing, and it left me rattled. A week later I had the dream again, only this time there were a dozen people trying to get me to grasp what they were saying. The following week the dream returned, but now there were 20 people, and they looked desperate. I woke up crying. I started feeling afraid to go to sleep. Oprah.com: How to tune in to the voice within . Even though my husband thought I was overreacting, I called my doctor to schedule a physical. I didn't know what else to do. The receptionist pointed out that I'd just had a physical six months earlier; the most I could talk her into was some new blood work. At the appointment, I told the doctor I felt that something wasn't right. He smiled. ""You eat well, you exercise, you're healthy. Quit worrying."" Two days later, his nurse called to say my blood work was fine. I relaxed and figured I could put my fears behind me. A week later, the dream was back. There must have been 100 people -- wailing, screaming, pleading with me. I kept saying, ""I don't know what you want from me! Please, please tell me what I'm supposed to do."" A few days later, the fifth and final dream: Back at the fence, only this time nobody is there. I fall to my knees, sobbing, ""Come back. I need you to help me."" And suddenly I hear one voice. And that voice says two words -- in perfect English: ""Look deeper."" How to use your intuition . I called my doctor the minute his office opened. ""What's the deepest place in the human body?"" He said, ""I suppose it's the colon."" And I said, ""Then I want a colonoscopy."" He explained that I had no family history of colon cancer, no symptoms, that insurance would never cover it. I persisted. I told the gastroenterologist I wanted to be awake for the procedure. I watched the camera twisting and turning and following the curves through my colon, and then I heard the doctor draw a breath and say, ""Oh my."" There, on the screen, was a black mass. And the doctor promptly put me to sleep. It was cancer -- aggressive and fast moving. She later told me that if I'd waited even two months, my prognosis would have been...grim. Oprah.com: Listen to your body's early-warning system . Calculating danger . The scariest thing about intuition? Realizing too late that you were right. By Stephanie Pearson . To do research for a magazine story, I once spent a few days at a lodge in a remote part of Chile, on Lago General Carrera. After leaving the lodge, I was scheduled to take a puddle jumper to Balmaceda, a town near the lake's opposite shore. When high winds forced the pilot to cancel the flight, the lodge owner patched together a plan B: His wife would drop me off in the closest village, where an acquaintance would pick me up and shuttle me the final four-hour stretch to Balmaceda. The route would pass through a few towns and two military checkpoints. The rest: empty wilderness. After the woman introduced me to the driver in Chile Chico and waved goodbye, three stocky, good-looking men appeared out of nowhere and jumped into the backseat of the Toyota Hilux. They were bomberos, or firemen, they told me, on their way to a conference in Balmaceda. ""Interesting timing,"" I thought, since it was Good Friday in a Catholic country where all business had ground to a halt for the next few days. We started driving and the buddies started joking, first about my wedding ring -- ""I didn't know she was married,"" one said -- then about my height (I'm 5'10""), then about my hair (I'm blonde). My heart started to beat faster. To distract myself, I flipped open my Lonely Planet guide and landed by chance on the ""Women Travelers"" section. The first sentence I read: ""If you hitchhike, exercise caution and especially avoid getting into a vehicle with more than one man."" Oprah.com: O's worst-case scenario handbook . A dozen ugly scenarios reeled through my brain. Most of them ended with me in a ditch. My heart was racing and my chest felt tight. I opened my window; I couldn't get enough air. And that's how it went for the next hour, the men joking while I tried to breathe and wondered if today was going to be my last day on Earth. As we rolled into the first town, I said I had to go to the bathroom, but after I hopped out of the truck, I told the driver I'd decided to stay in Los Antiguos for the night. ""¡Buen viaje!"" I said, backing away as the bomberos hurled a tirade of unflattering Spanish, cursing me, the ungrateful gringa. The truck idled there for a few minutes, as if the men were deliberating what to do, then squealed off. After spending the night with a local family, I made it to Balmaceda the next day. Maybe the delay was silly. Maybe I'd caved in to an irrational fear and offended four harmless men for nothing. I'll never know. All I could do at the time was act on my internal SOS signals. Had I ignored them and wound up in trouble, my prescient notions would have proved true. But by then it would have been too late.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Doctors have stabilized former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's heart and blood pressure, but he still remains in critical condition, a hospital official said Sunday. The 85-year old is still suffering from multiple organ failure, said Zeev Rotstein, director of the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer. Sharon is known as a highly decorated -- if controversial -- Israeli military figure who became prime minister in 2001. But Sharon has been in a coma since 2006, when he suffered a major stroke that led doctors to put him under anesthesia and on a respirator. His term as prime minister came to an end. News broke on Wednesday that his health had worsened. Rising through military ranks . Born in 1928 in Kfar Malal -- a community that would later become part of Israel -- Sharon graduated from high school in 1945 and began working with the Haganah, a militant group advocating for Israel's independence. He began his rise through the Israeli military ranks in 1953. Sharon helped establish an elite commando unit and was eventually promoted to be an army major general. He held this rank during 1967's Six-Day War, which ended with Israel controversially expanding its territory. Sharon went on to play major roles in subsequent Israeli military conflicts as well, including as head of the Army's Armored Reserve Division during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He then began segueing into government, including stints as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's military adviser, agriculture minister and defense minister from 1981 to 1983. Invasion of Lebanon . Sharon also orchestrated Israel's invasion of Lebanon, an effort aimed at Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters that also left hundreds of Lebanese civilians dead. His actions led many in the Arab world to call him the ""Butcher of Beirut."" An official Israeli inquiry found Sharon indirectly responsible for the September 1982 killings of as many as 2,000 Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside of Beirut, Lebanon. The report -- which led to Sharon's prompt resignation -- determined the then-defense minister did nothing to stop Christian militiamen allied with Israel from entering the camps, despite fears they might seek to avenge the killing of their leader the previous day. Sharon did not stay out of the spotlight for long. His adviser Ranaan Gissin said Sharon ""he felt betrayed by his government."" Sharon also sued Time for a magazine article implying that he had foreknowledge and a greater role in this massacre, with a jury later finding the U.S.-based publisher guilty of defamation but not of malice. Becoming prime minister . Sharon went on to hold a several other Cabinet posts from 1984 to 2001, when he won a special election to become prime minister. By then, as head of the Likud party, Sharon was considered a hawk. And early on, he took the offensive by sending tanks and troops into Palestinian territory and ordering the assassination of militant leaders. But Sharon also took steps toward peace, such as agreeing with the late PLO leader Yasser Arafat on a timeline to halt Israeli-Palestinian violence and resume peace talks. But that effort undermined by Sharon's own party, which backed a resolution to never allow the creation of a Palestinian state. Sharon later participated in talks with regional and world powers to discuss a ""road map"" for Middle East peace. Immediately after he fell ill in early 2006, his power was transferred to Vice Premier Ehud Olmert. Surgeons removed 20 inches of his intestine the following month and, that April, Israel's Cabinet formally ended his run as prime minister after declaring him permanently incapacitated. The former prime minister's health has fluctuated during the time he has been in the coma. In January 2013, doctors said testing on Sharon indicated some brain activity when he was shown photos of his home and heard his son's voice.

"(CNN) -- If you have to ask, you're probably not on the list. U.S. President Barack Obama hosted his French counterpart, Francois Hollande, at a state dinner Tuesday night -- the first of his second term. The event is a highly coveted social soiree. The presidents were joined by Michelle Obama and the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of Washington and Hollywood. The invite list is culled from recommendations from the President and first lady, top government officials, the Pentagon, members of Congress, the Supreme Court and the State Department. Movie stars and community and business leaders are also often asked to attend. Among this year's invited guests were: J.J. Abrams, Bradley Cooper, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jeff Zucker, president of CNN Worldwide, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan and Secretary of State John Kerry. Much like an awards show, guests streamed past a sea of cameras. Some stopped and talked to reporters. The first lady wore a billowing black and blue dress designed by Carolina Herrera, and greeted Hollande along with her husband on the steps outside. When the three came down a staircase inside, she walked behind the two men, because Hollande went to the dinner stag. The main event was to be held in a tent on the South Lawn of the White House. Attendees were expected to dine on four courses of American-grown haute cuisine: osetra caviar and quail eggs, a winter salad ""served in a wonderful glass bowl to make it look like a terrarium,"" Colorado-raised beef and a chocolate dessert sourced from Obama's native Hawaii. Before the dinner, the White House released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course -- a change from the last few state dinners, which listed only ""American"" bottles lest the price shock taxpayers. Reds from California and Washington State and a sparking wine from Virginia were the selections. None retail for more than $50 a bottle. It all sounds very fancy -- and it is -- but state dinners aren't just about pomp and pageantry, according to the White House. Real work gets done. ""Behind the festive exterior of the social scene, the important business of government goes on -- information is gathered -- opinions exchanged -- powerful connections made and appearances upheld. For these reasons White House invitations are the most important and the most sought after in the nation's social whirl,"" the White House website says. Obama and Hollande are in the midst of a diplomatic bromance as they face international challenges that include the Syrian civil war, Iran's nuclear ambitions and economic malaise in Europe. A socialist elected in 2012, Hollande arrived alone for the dinner after revelations in France of an affair with an actress and the subsequent end of his longtime relationship with Valerie Trierweiler, who was considered the equivalent of the French first lady even though the two weren't married. It's not the first time a French president has come to Washington alone. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, attended a formal dinner at the White House shortly after announcing his split from his previous wife. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","The first lady wears a black and blue dress by Carolina Herrera .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he would step aside as the head of football's global governing body in 2015, if he wins the June 1 presidential ballot. Blatter's announcement came on Tuesday after his opponent, head of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Mohamed Bin Hammam, told CNN the time had arrived for a change at the top of world soccer's power base. Bin Hammam -- a 61-year-old FIFA executive committee member -- confirmed last week he would run against Blatter in the election, the first candidate to do so since Africa's Issa Hayatou was defeated by the Swiss in 2002. ""You know very well that I am a candidate for the next four years as FIFA president but these will be the last four years for which I stand,"" Blatter, 75, told a UEFA congress in Paris. Can Bin Hammam change FIFA for the better? Both men were present at a meeting of European football's governing body in the French capital as they looked to secure backing ahead of the vote in Zurich. ""FIFA has been under the same presidency for 13 years,"" Bin Hammam told CNN. ""Mr Blatter has been heavily involved in the administration of FIFA for 35 years. I believe he has contributed a lot to the development of the game, but as I said, this is a long time. ""It is time for a new direction. A lot of fans today have grown up and they have only known Mr. Blatter as head of FIFA, or head of the administration of FIFA, so I think change is not the wrong thing."" Blatter's presidential rival vows reform . Bin Hammam, who has been at the summit of Asian football since 2002, also said greater transparency is needed among the game's decision makers. FIFA became mired in controversy ahead of their decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively, with two executive committee members -- Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarri -- suspended amid allegations of selling votes. ""People would like to see transparency within FIFA,"" said Bin Hamman. ""FIFA is always accused of corruption and it is not (corrupt). What is missing, and lacking, is transparency which over the years we could not provide to the public."" A Qatar native, Bin Hammam also defended the emirates' conduct during the bidding process for the 2022 tournament. ""Qatar played the game according to the law of the game. People were not happy, but people will not be happy with so many decisions taken by FIFA. ""I don't think people were happy about Russia winning the right to host 2018. Now is not the time to cry about something that happened in the past. Let us hope the future is going to be more transparent and more open for the public."" Blatter -- the eighth incumbent of FIFA's top job -- was this month boosted by the news the 2010 World Cup had made the non-profit organization $3.655 billion and said he was not expecting to be challenged in the forthcoming elections. Blatter: 2010 World Cup was a huge financial success . However, Bin Hammam announced he would compete for the role of FIFA chief on March 18 and has not spoken with Blatter since. ""Not since I announced I was running, I spoke to him maybe two weeks back. ""I hope Mr. Blatter realizes our game is about competition and there is nothing wrong with competing. I hope we will understand that competition does not mean we are enemies."" Meanwhile, Frenchman Michel Platini has been re-elected unopposed as president of European football's governing body UEFA on Tuesday. The 55-year-old former European Player of the Year will serve a second mandate of four years, having first been elected in 2007 when he took over from Lennart Johansson.","Sepp Blatter will step down as FIFA president in 2015, if elected for another term .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- The day after Christmas was a tough one for Santa in his ancestral homeland of Turkey. A Muslim youth group held a demonstration Thursday in Istanbul, blasting the ""jolly old elf"" of legend and lore for contributing to moral decay and urging residents to turn against him. ""Traditions such as new year celebrations, Christmas tree decorations, and Santa Claus leaving presents are leading to degeneration of our culture and leading to identity crises in our society. It tears our youth from their own culture and familiarizes them with the culture of the West leading them to embrace those values,"" the Anatolia Youth Association said in a statement. The group used an inflatable plastic Santa as a prop -- littering the ground below it with beer cans, a syringe and a cross to illustrate the dangers of inviting Santa into Turkish homes. They also distributed an image of a man delivering a brutal left hook to Santa's bearded cheek. Three years ago, the same group stabbed a blow-up Santa. Such sentiments are not widespread in Turkey. Many secular Muslims in Turkey decorate their homes with Christmas trees and Santas -- known in Turkey as ""Noel Baba,"" or Father Christmas. They exchange gifts not on Christmas, but rather New Year's Day. Despite Thursday's unpleasantness, Turkey and ol' Claus go way back -- all the way to 4th Century. That's when, as religious tradition has it, the Christian St. Nicholas secretly gifted money and other items to residents around his home in what is now the southern Turkish city of Demre, becoming the model for the modern Santa Claus. CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul.","Turkish Muslim youth group condemns Santa for bringing booze, drugs and immorality .

"(CNN) -- We do a lot for -- and to -- our children in the name of parenting. I know when I get it kinda right, I know when I get it mostly wrong, and I know when I've been lucky. I will tell you that giving my teenage son a debit check card last summer was the best thing I've ever done for him. I will also tell you that move was pure luck. I didn't plan to give him the card in order to teach him some grand lesson about life. I'm not that clever. Truth is, I was dropping him off at a monthlong summer camp and wanted to make sure he had some money in his pocket for pizza. So when I picked him up and he told me he had money left over, I was confused. ""Whose child is this and where is mine?"" This couldn't be my son because my son claims he can barely get by with $50 on a night out with his friends. Clearly I had picked up Suze Orman's kid by mistake. Intrigued, I decided to see if he was really frugal or if he had just misplaced his card for a couple of weeks and didn't want to tell me. So I deposited the money I had set aside for shopping for his school clothes into his account and told him to make it work. And man, did he ever. My son was comparing prices -- hitting the sale racks -- and he even returned items he later deemed too expensive or unnecessary. All on his own. It was like the Hunger Games in a mall. Since then, pizzas only need one topping, chai lattes are few and far between and he packs his own lunch instead of hitting the fast food places down the street from school. ""The first few times I blew it,"" my 15-year-old told me. ""I'd have all of this stuff and the cashier would be, like, 'I'm sorry, sir, your card has been declined.' I'd stand there and look surprised, my response was normally something like 'Whaaaaat? Or 'Really? Hmm, one moment. I need to call my dad.' But you wouldn't always pick up, so I'd have to take stuff back. Now I've learned to keep up with my balance so I can save myself the embarrassment."" In other words, he's gotten cheap. And not because I made him do anything, but because he's figuring life out for himself. It was the first time in my life I knew I was doing a good job. Grades, opening door for strangers, saying thank you, those are all signs that he listens to me. Making good decisions as an independent free thinker, that's a sign that he gets it. Seeing my son's relationship with money transform in less than a year provided me with a snapshot of what his behavior might look like when he's an adult, and all I could do was smile and exhale, thinking ""He's going to be all right. "" Growing up, I didn't know anything about money other than we didn't have any. In retrospect, it would've been helpful if my parents had told me why. But as the research shows, most parents have the money talk in the same way they have the sex talk, and that is to say, they don't. T. Rowe Price released a study last month that found 77% of parents don't always tell their kids the truth about money matters, and nearly a third of parents surveyed said they don't talk to their kids about family finances at all. I guess part of the reason is that the picture isn't always very pretty. In 2007, U.S. household debt was equal to the GDP. But just because the money talk isn't comfortable doesn't mean we should avoid it, and a debit check card is a good way to bring it up. I have found since my son has started to feel the pain firsthand, when I talk to him about the bills around the house, he listens with empathy. When I remind him to turn the lights off when he leaves a room, he has an understanding of why that goes beyond ""because I said so."" I still run him to track practice, the movies, anywhere he wants to go, but he gets why I plot out the errands ahead of time so I can use the least amount of gas possible. Best of all, when he asks for something I think is unreasonable, I don't lie and tell him we can't afford it -- as nearly 33% of parents do. Rather I tell him the truth: It's not worth it. And I tell him why. You know for years, I've heard financial experts stress the importance of teaching your kids about money, but it wasn't until I saw my own son's perspective change that I became a true believer. So, I encourage all parents out there to give it a try with their kids. I promise, even if you open a checking account for them and only deposit $10, the return in their lives will come back a hundredfold in wisdom. Over spring break I read him the story about Warren Sapp, the former NFL star who recently filed for bankruptcy. I didn't mean to laugh at someone else's misfortune, but we both couldn't help but crack up when I told him among Sapp's listed ""assets"" were 240 pairs of Jordan athletic shoes worth an estimated $6,500. ""How is that an asset?"" my son asked. ""It's not,"" I said. And then we started laughing again -- him because the story was funny, me because I know I just got lucky.

"(CNN) -- Three-month-old Elayna Nigrelli has redefined what it means to be a miracle baby. She was born while her mother was technically dead. In February, Erica Nigrelli was teaching at a high school in Missouri City, Texas, when she walked into a co-worker's classroom. Nigrelli said she felt faint, placed her hands on a table to steady herself and then passed out. Three teachers immediately grabbed a defibrillator and also began performing CPR. Kids in the classroom ran out, yelling for help. Nigrelli's husband, Nathan, also a teacher, was just two doors down. He rushed into the room. ""Erica was lying on the floor, she was foaming and making gurgling sounds and just staring up,"" he told CNN affiliate KPRC. He called 911. ""My wife is pregnant,"" he said, his breath heavy with panic. ""She's having a seizure! The baby's due in three weeks!"" ""Oh my God!"" the 911 operator exclaimed. By the time paramedics rushed the 32-year-old to the hospital, doctors could not find a pulse. Her heart had stopped. Doctors delivered the baby by emergency cesarean section. Technically, it was a postmortem delivery because Erica's heart was not beating. But then something remarkable happened. The doctors turned to Erica, and soon her heart started beating again. 3-D printer helps save dying baby . Over the next five days, she remained in a medically induced coma, she told CNN, and doctors diagnosed her with a heart defect she didn't know she had -- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The condition causes the heart muscle to thicken. The thickening can make it more difficult for blood to leave the heart, forcing it to work harder to pump blood. Baby Elayna was in the intensive care unit for two weeks. On Friday, the couple appeared with her on CNN's ""Early Start,"" with Elayna on Mom's lap, sucking on a purple pacifier. She weighs 8 pounds and is healthy. ""We feel great,"" Nathan Nigrelli said. ""We have a wonderful baby. My wife is back to 100%. The baby hasn't shown any signs of trouble but is still on oxygen. The child will undergo therapy soon, but by all accounts her recovery looks to be on track and she'll be fine. Erica Nigrelli believes that God was protecting her. She told CNN that she has a memory of being in the ambulance. ""I remember being bounced up,"" she said. And she remembers seeing sunlight. When she came to in the hospital, she remembers the doctors telling her, ""You have your baby. She is in the hospital."" She saw Elayna three weeks after she was born. The two joked that if Elayna ever gets out of line, all her parents have to do is remind their daughter what they went through to bring her into the world. ""I have got, like, the best ammunition for the rest of her life,"" Erica Nigrelli laughed. ""She can never do anything wrong.""

"(CNN) -- In late May 2011, Mitt Romney made his first campaign jaunt to South Carolina, a primary state that bedeviled him during his first presidential campaign and would prove just as vexing in his second. Romney's difficulties with the conservative base are now well-documented. But among his many problems on the right, immigration wasn't one of them. On that May afternoon in South Carolina, Romney, his sleeves rolled up and shirt tucked neatly into bluejeans, came prepared to answer a range of tough questions. He delivered a defense of his health care law and equivocated on a controversial Medicare plan being debated in Congress. He didn't expect to have to talk about immigration, But one activist who felt like a party crasher in the small, hand-picked audience wanted to know if Romney backed amnesty for ""illegals."" Romney said no, matter-of-factly outlined his positions, and the voter departed seeming satisfied. The point is this: Even if immigration fails to register as a top issue in the polls -- only 3% of Americans called it the country's ""most important problem"" in a recent Gallup survey -- the topic continues to burn white hot as a litmus test among a passionate and vocal slice of the GOP primary electorate. Opinion: Big surprise ahead on immigration . Even when immigration reform is not on the calendar in Congress -- and it wasn't during the 2012 campaign -- it routinely bubbles up in Republican primary campaigns, popping up in town hall meetings, on talk radio and online. And it's not just the dreaded ""comprehensive"" immigration reform effort that roils grassroots activists; for a defiant portion of the GOP base (looking at you, Steve King), any kind of reform is non-negotiable. Despite efforts by top Republicans in Washington to improve the party's miserable image among Hispanic voters, not much has changed since the 2012 primary campaign, when GOP voters tore down Texas Gov. Rick Perry for telling a debate audience that they didn't ""have a heart"" if they opposed in-state college tuition for young illegal immigrants. Undocumented immigrant lawyer speaks out . A sweeping Senate immigration bill is stalled in the House, effectively dead and nailed into its coffin by its own Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio, who now opposes it. House Speaker John Boehner says he is open to passing a series of smaller fixes. At the same time, numerous elected GOP officials made intemperate comments about Hispanic immigrants. This is the party that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who will ceremonially sign a New Jersey version of the DREAM Act this week, must face if he decides to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. And at first glance, his support for the bill, which allows undocumented immigrants who have attended New Jersey high schools for three years to pay in-state college tuition rates, is problematic. Christie reaches immigration deal with New Jersey Democrats . Having won re-election last November with a majority of Hispanic voters, Christie's support for the so-called tuition equality bill is another notch in his belt as he cultivates an image as a Republican who can appeal to independent voters and nontraditional constituencies. He is, his supporters believe, a GOP candidate who can actually win a national election. But in the hothouse context of a Republican primary, which he must win to get to a national election, signing the tuition bill seems like yet another example of Christie unfurling a giant middle finger to the very voters whose support he will need once the presidential race begins in earnest this November. The biggest sin conservatives point to when discussing Christie is symbolic: his arm-in-arm tour of the New Jersey coastline with President Obama after Hurricane Sandy, lending the president a veneer of bipartisan street cred just days before the 2012 presidential election. There are other apostasies: Gun control measures signed in Trenton, a gushing buddy-buddy appearance with Bill Clinton at a policy conference in Chicago last summer, and his spirited defense of the country's surveillance and drone efforts, a position that rankles libertarians. Brandon Patterson, a 23-year-old student at the Pat Roberston-founded Regent University in Virginia, summed up the prevailing conservative attitude toward Christie at last summer's Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington. ""He is not very popular here,"" Patterson said. ""Nobody is excited to support him at all. Nobody that I know of. He's a moderate."" Talk to any strategist backing his potential GOP opponents, and you'll hear a similar take on Christie's decision to sign the DREAM Act: Supporting tuition breaks for illegal immigrants burnishes his reputation with the Amtrak corridor pundit class, but it cements Christie's status as persona non grata at the Pizza Ranches of western Iowa and diners of New Hampshire. ""This amnesty bill is just another in a really, really long list of reasons why Republican primary voters don't trust Christie,"" said a national GOP operative working for a likely 2016 rival. ""From guns, to Sandy spending, to hugging Obama, he'll have a tough time winning any early state primaries. Unless, of course, 'Morning Joe' holds an early state Republican primary that I'm unaware of."" But there's another way to look at it: The conservatives who despise Christie for signing the tuition bill probably wouldn't support him anyway. They might not like him, but he doesn't need them, either . Let those conservatives flock to Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Rick Santorum. The silent plurality of Republican primary voters -- the blue hairs, the country clubbers, the Rotarians -- don't garner the kind of media attention ginned up by tea party groups and outspoken pastors, but they vote. After all, Mitt Romney, that squishy scion of the hated ""establishment,"" lost the Iowa caucuses by only 34 votes. And whatever failings Christie may have, few dispute that he has natural political talents and a rapport with voters that Romney never had. Reid says Boehner will compromise on immigration reform . The dynamics of the 2012 race were different than they will be in 2016; a fiscal conservative like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker could clog Christie's lane in the business community. But early state operatives sympathetic to Christie are hopeful that there will be even more space in 2016 for a candidate who wants the party to expand its popular appeal. Tim Albrecht, a Republican operative in Iowa and former adviser to Gov. Terry Branstad, pointed out that the Iowa House passed a version of the DREAM Act way back in 2004. (The bill, however, did not become law.) ""Led by a Republican majority, the Iowa House unanimously passed the Dream Act in 2004,"" Albrecht said in an e-mail. ""Iowa has been ahead of the curve on this issue, and Republicans value fairness. While there will be a vocal minority speaking out against immigration reform, a majority of Republicans and caucus-goers will not take issue with Gov. Christie's position on the DREAM Act, and in growing circles it will gain him support."" And for those without long memories, one only needs to look back to 2008 to find a Republican candidate who bucked the party faithful on a range of issues, including immigration, and won the presidential nomination. John McCain ran for president while the immigration overhaul he backed was collapsing in Congress. His campaign fell apart in the process, but McCain recovered and mounted a remarkable comeback, facing questions about immigration all the while. In a crowded Republican field, he even won South Carolina, that conservative bastion, by courting the party establishment and cobbling together a coalition of coastal newcomers, moderate suburbanites and national security hawks in a state loaded with military families and veterans. Ever since the Barry Goldwater wipeout of 1964, no Republican candidate has won the Republican nomination without having at least one foot planted firmly on the establishment side of the party divide. This is the bet Christie is making, so don't expect him to back away from signing the tuition bill, or any of piece of legislation, once he makes his barely concealed presidential campaign official. As long as Christie is up front about where he stands, his positions may not hurt him as much as the right claims, said Robert Cahaly, a longtime Republican operative in South Carolina. ""It's running over a political speed bump, not into a brick wall,"" Cahaly said of Christie's support for the tuition bill. ""He's got to do what he thinks is right and not apologize for it. Sort of his schtick."" ""Now is as good a time as any to get it out of the way,"" Cahaly said. ""It's kind of like that fight you've got to have with your bother over that lawnmower he wrecked. Don't put it off all summer. It's better for the Thanksgiving table. South Carolina GOP voters have forgiven and forgotten much more. Ask John McCain.""","Immigration reform remains a litmus test among GOP primary voters .

"(CNN) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday directed the nation's armed forces not to strike residential neighborhoods in Falluja after reports of weekend clashes there between al Qaeda-linked fighters and government troops, Iraqi state TV said. But al-Maliki also appealed to Falluja's residents and tribes to expel the ""terrorists"" from the central Iraqi city in order to save their neighborhoods from the risk of confrontations between militants and government forces. Conflicting reports have emerged over who is in control in Falluja, the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents during the Iraq War. Some suggest the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), formerly the group commonly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, is in partial control of Falluja, which is situated roughly 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad, in the volatile province of Anbar. The government said this weekend that the Iraqi army shelled Falluja in an effort to clear out the al Qaeda-linked fighters. The recent fighting in Anbar, whose population is predominantly Sunni, has posed a serious challenge to al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government. It has raised questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency. No U.S. troops . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that the United States will help the Iraqi government in the battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but stressed it won't send troops. ""We're not contemplating putting boots on the ground,"" Kerry said in Jerusalem during a visit to the Middle East. ""This is their fight, but we're going to help them in their fight."" U.S. military forces, which invaded Iraq and toppled the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003, fought insurgents there for years until they withdrew at the end of 2011. American officials say they are keeping a close eye on the current unrest. ""This situation remains fluid, and it is too early to tell or make conclusions about it,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday. ""But we are accelerating our foreign military sales deliveries and are looking to provide an additional shipment of Hellfire missiles as early as this spring."" Vice President Joe Biden spoke with al-Maliki by phone on Monday and stressed that ""the United States stands with Iraq"" in the battle against the al Qaeda-linked fighters, the White House said. Biden also spoke to Osama al-Nujaifi, the speaker of the Iraqi Council of Representatives. Kerry: We'll help Iraq but won't send in troops . Sunni ire in Anbar . The current conflict in Anbar is not a simple matter of al Qaeda against pro-government troops, according to local officials, political analysts and tribal leaders in Falluja and Ramadi. They say al-Maliki is spinning the strife to his political advantage. These sources say al-Maliki is trying to cite al Qaeda as a pretext to crush Sunni protesters and is using the same tack to get international support for his fight. They say he's trying to create the false impression that ISIS fighters control much of Falluja. ISIS has been working doggedly to exploit a security vacuum across Iraq. While there are pockets of al Qaeda-linked militants in Anbar cities such as Falluja, most regions in Anbar, including Falluja, are under the control of local police and Sunni tribes not aligned with militants, they explained. Fighting also has raged between these local tribes and the Iraqi army in Falluja. Violence has flared in recent days because of the arrest of a Sunni lawmaker in Ramadi and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in Falluja and Ramadi. Most Sunnis in Anbar have simply been angry at being regarded as second-class citizens in the majority Shiite country. They have been upset with the local and central government authorities, and these grievances have spurred an ongoing uprising against the Shiite-led government. Echoes of earlier conflict . Things are a bit more stable in Ramadi, Anbar's capital, because the local government struck a deal with tribes to fight against ISIS. Al-Maliki is more supportive of local government in Ramadi than Falluja, according to these sources. Soldiers have not been stationed inside Anbar cities for nearly a year. Now, al-Maliki is trying to bring the soldiers back, a move prompting Sunni resistance. The deal the government made with some Sunni tribal fighters was comparable to a 2007 U.S. pact that saw Sunnis turn on al Qaeda, siding with American and Iraqi forces to bring about an end to the terrorism. The fighting between Sunni militants against Shiite-dominated forces was reminiscent of fighting during the height of the Iraq War in 2006 and 2007, when sectarian violence nearly tore the country apart. The analysts who spoke to CNN said that Shiites have more to fear in the conflict with Sunnis because they risk losing their newfound and widespread power after decades of domination by a largely Sunni regime led by Saddam Hussein. CNN's Steve Brusk, Joseph Netto and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. Vice President Joe Biden talks to al-Maliki by phone, stressing support .

"(CNN) -- Abraham Lincoln once said, ""In life, what counts is the size of a man's heart, not the size of his disproportionate willie."" Lo, there was an awkward moment of silence among those standing in the open shower at the old White House CrossFit gym, as the 16th president nervously added, ""I'm serious, guys. That's what counts. Seriously."" But despite Lincoln's largely unknown and forgotten ""Wee-man-cipation Proclamation"" -- which I may have just completely made up -- a recent study appears to have proven this belief scientifically incorrect. Yes, gentlemen, when it comes to the preference of heterosexual women, perhaps our worst fear is true. Size does matter. At least according to a new study that quickly found its way around the Internet. Because, of course it did. We like this kind of stuff -- anything about genitals or cats. Whereas, if they found a cure for cancer, maybe six people would give it a tweet. ""They cured cancer. But check out this cat! LOL. #Kitteh"" You're all weirdo sinners. And I like that. The big buzz about this study started when research results appeared this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Which is one of those fancy journals where normal people understand about every 15th word. And even fewer if you cheated your way through Mr. Ware's high school physiology and anatomy class. ""Psst. What bone is this?"" ""Dude, Bellini, that's not a bone. That's your pencil."" The point is that it's a super-science-y journal. And it's difficult to read. But, on the plus side, for those of us more intellectually suited to watching a good episode of ""Cops,"" if you sound out the publication's acronym, PNAS, it makes a delightfully funny word that brings us right back to the topic at hand. Package size. And why it matters. Brian Mautz, an American biologist now at the University of Ottawa, was the lead author of the study, and conducted his research while in Australia. Which I believe completely invalidates the results. Not for any particularly scientific reason, but it helps me sleep at night. Even Conan O'Brien took solace in the technicality: ""The Good news? My wife isn't Australian."" Regardless, just how does one come to a scientific, unbiased conclusion on the importance of large manhood? You know, without mixing in other result-skewing personal features like a lush ginger beard and a bald head. Those kind of horrible things. Well, that's where the computer models come in. Down in Australia, 105 lucky ladies were asked to rate the sexual attractiveness of about 50 life-sized computer-generated, naked male figures with different body structures. Some were tall. Some were short. Some were thin. Some of them may have been John Candy. (Full images of the figures here. Warning: Featureless, gray full-frontal) We'll never know, because the gray-colored figures did not possess any other features. Just unique body types and varying amounts of Speedo filler. The figures were then projected on a screen so the women could rate them from 1 to 7. Which absolutely bothers me. All rating scales should go to 10. I'm a metric guy, and it's just the natural order of things. Especially when it comes to rating attractiveness. Otherwise, there's not enough wiggle room for minor beauty flaws. Like fuzzy earlobes. Always a three-point deduction. But never mind such little things. For these women, overall height and body shape seemed to be the most important factors. Which isn't a big surprise. However, a man's nether region was definitely an important factor. And as the overall size down below increased, so, too, did the sexual attractiveness scores. The women also spent more time actually staring at the goods. Which is so rude. Hello? Our eyes are up here! Just kidding. Enjoy the view. We'll just watch some baseball. But here's the thing. For taller men, size was even more important. Quite simply, it's a matter of proportion. When your canvas is bigger, Waldo is harder to find. That said, if it actually LOOKS like Waldo, you need to see a doctor. Today, if they can schedule you in. (But put it on Reddit first. They're into that. Mega up-votes!) Now, for shorter men, being bigger downstairs was also important. But only when compared to other short men. If you bring a taller man into the mix, not even an actual Ponderosa Pine will help you compete. Though you might make it on TV. Sadly, even if the tall guy has but a sapling, he still has the advantage. So long as he's fit. Because, under these scientific conditions, that's still the biggest factor. Body shape. Fortunately, though, humans aren't computer-generated gray figurines projected on walls. We have skin. And hair. And courtside seats to the Lakers. And that's what really counts. Just as long as you don't have fuzzy earlobes.","New study confirms that when it comes to male anatomy, ""size does matter""

"(CNN) -- It's the biggest stage in the world of college football. The talented students from Florida State and Auburn who charge onto the field Monday night in Pasadena, California, will know that nothing in their lives may ever top this feeling. For the great majority of the seniors who won't go on to play professionally, this will be the last time in uniform. I'm not referring to the football players. The Florida State Seminoles and the Auburn Tigers will be competing for the national championship, and their head coaches, Jimbo Fisher and Gus Malzahn, have been getting them ready for the game. But there are two other groups of students from those schools who also will step onto the bright green floor of the Rose Bowl on Monday night. Those squads are even larger in number than the football teams, and, although they draw considerably less national attention, they have been preparing just as diligently. ""It starts with practices in the heat of the Alabama summer,"" said Corey Spurlin, associate professor of music at Auburn and director of the 380-member Auburn University Marching Band. ""Just like the football players, our musicians are at the very peak of their abilities,"" said Patrick Dunnigan, professor of music at Florida State University and director of bands, including the 400-member Marching Chiefs. With kickoff approaching, I got in touch with Spurlin and Dunnigan because the months of work put in by marching band members at schools across the country often gets overlooked. They are a major part of the pageantry of college football, but in recent decades the television networks have all but ignored them most of the time. If the performance of the marching bands at college games each Saturday gets a few seconds on the TV broadcasts, they count themselves lucky. ""Generally, if we do get airtime, it's very brief, minimal,"" said Auburn's Spurlin. ""We'd love to be able to share what we do with more people."" Florida State's Dunnigan said: ""The kids in the band don't know any different. I grew up in a world where the halftime shows were seen on TV, but that's over."" The replacements on television have been studio shows with analysis, replays and highlights of other games; the studio shows are lucrative revenue generators, attractive for commercial sponsors, and the switch away from the field at halftime is almost instant on most telecasts. Still, the audiences inside the stadiums are massive. Florida State's home stadium seats more than 82,000; Auburn's seats more than 87,000. The Rose Bowl, where Monday's national championship game will be played, seats more than 90,000. Few bands of any kind ever get to play in front of that many people. Bruce Springsteen and the Rolling Stones might even be a bit envious. The musicians, although they do their work on the same gridirons as the football players, are not recognized around campus the way the star quarterbacks or linebackers are. ""With 380 musicians in the band, not many people can pick out their faces,"" Spurlin said. And as far as the scholarships and perks that go with big-time college football programs: Forget it. At Florida State, Dunnigan said, not only are there no marching band scholarships, but ""the student musicians pay for the work they do -- the band is a one-credit class, so they're paying tuition to be in it. We're kind of proud that the members of the band are there by choice."" At Auburn, Spurlin said, the budget that is available for the marching band's expenses goes only so far; the university provides the band's uniforms, ""but the members of the band have to pay for the cleaning,"" and they have to get their uniforms to the laundry after the games. The intangible rewards, however, are ample. ""The individual challenge is to play the instruments as well as they can, to lock into the formations as well as they can,"" Dunnigan said. ""The big picture is when they look at the crowd, see the fans clapping, watch the football team waving at them. The feeling is being a part of something huge."" Spurlin said the friendship and the time together is something irreplaceable, something the band members will take with them for the rest of their lives. Very few members of the marching bands go on to careers as professional musicians. ""Some will go on to teach music,"" Spurlin said, ""but for most, they bless us with their talent while they're here, and then they graduate and do something else for a living."" Dunnigan said: ""I hope that, in 10 years, some who are in the band now will still play their instruments in church, or in a community musical group."" The physical challenges can be daunting: ""We come onto the field in a high-step jog, with legs all the way up,"" Spurlin said. ""They're wearing long-sleeved cadet-style uniforms, heavy hats, and carrying their instruments, and for a 1 o'clock game in Alabama, it can be 98 degrees down on the field."" Dunnigan and Spurlin both said that, each year, there are some musicians who are supremely talented, but who just can't play their instruments well while marching quickly in formation. There also are some who are brilliant at close-order drills, but whose musicianship does not match their strutting skills. The directors have to tell them that they haven't made it onto the bands. With hundreds of band members on the field, if one musician hits a clunky note or takes a false step, the football fans up in the seats may not notice. But the other band members do, as do the band directors. ""We're all attuned to it, and we know,"" Dunnigan said. ""The accuracy of the notes, the formations to lock into, the crescendos -- we know right away when something's off."" Spurlin said: ""Our standards for ourselves are high. We teach a precise work ethic, a pride, that we hope will carry over to whatever the musicians do after they leave here."" As the seniors in both schools' bands, like the seniors on both schools' football teams, soon will do. But first there is Monday night's game. Each band has been allocated six minutes to perform before kickoff, when, as they march, they will play their schools' traditional fight songs. At halftime, each band gets eight minutes; among Auburn's selections, Spurlin said, will be music from stage shows that became popular movies. Dunnigan said that the Florida State band will also include movie music: the James Bond theme, among other songs. And then, for the musicians whose final season this is, it will be over. ""The value of all this will become more apparent to them as the years go on,"" Dunnigan said. Spurlin said that when graduating band members tell him that being on the squad has been the time of their lives, he tells them he hopes that turns out not to be true. ""I thank them, but I tell them that I don't really want that for them. I tell them that I hope they will have many, many special moments after they leave college. I tell them that I hope the times of their lives -- the spine-chilling, best moments -- are still ahead of them."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Two other teams will take the field at Monday's college football championship game .

"CERN, Switzerland (CNN) -- Scientists Wednesday applauded as one of the most ambitious experiments ever conceived got successfully underway, with protons being fired around a 27-kilometer (17-mile) tunnel deep beneath the border of France and Switzerland in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe. The Large Hadron Collider -- a $9 billion particle accelerator designed to simulate conditions of the Big Bang that created the physical Universe -- was switched on at 0732 GMT to cheers and applause from experts gathered to witness the event. While observers were left nonplussed by the anticlimactic flashing dots on a TV screen that signalled the machine's successful test run, among teams of scientists involved around the world there were jubilant celebrations and popping champagne corks. In the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. Skeptics, who claim that the experiment could lead to the creation of a black hole capable of swallowing the planet, failed in a legal bid to halt the project at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Others have branded it a colossal waste of cash, draining resources from its multinational collaborators that could have been spent on scientific research with more tangible benefits to mankind. Sound off: What do you think of the experiment? French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed the project as a major achievement for Europe. ""The repercussions of this scientific investment without precedent in the history of humanity will be essential not only for the intimate knowledge of our universe, but also for the direct applications in fields as varied as intensive calculation or even medicine,"" he said.  Watch as Big Bang experiment gets underway » . The collider will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year, potentially generating enough data to make a discovery by 2009, experts say. They say the experiment has the potential to confirm theories that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions. They also hope to find a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson -- sometimes referred to as the ""God particle,"" which has never been detected, but would help explain why matter has mass. The collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, when there was a hot ""soup"" of tiny particles called quarks and gluons, to look at how the universe evolved, said John Harris, U.S. coordinator for ALICE, a huge detector specialized to analyze that question. Since this is exploratory science, the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories, but which are just as interesting, said Joseph Lykken, theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. ""When Columbus sails west, he thought he was going to find something. He didn't find what he thought he was going to find, but he did find something interesting,"" said Lykken, who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. Why should the layperson care about this particular exploration? Years ago, when electrons were first identified, no one knew what they were good for, but they have since transformed our entire economy, said Howard Gordon, deputy research program manager for the collider's ATLAS experiment. ""The transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better,"" said Gordon, at Brookhaven National Laboratory. ""It's important for just who we are, what we are."" Fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole Earth. Such fears prompted legal actions in the U.S. and Europe to halt the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge. Although physicists acknowledge that the collider could, in theory, create small black holes, they say they do not pose any risk. A study released Friday by CERN scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny, and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving. Five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told CNN there would be no danger from potential black holes. John Huth, who works on the collider's ATLAS experiment, called such fears ""baloney"" in a recent interview, and noted that in normal physics, even if the black hole were stable, it could just pass through the Earth without being detected or without interacting at all. ""The gravitational force is so weak that you'd have to wait many, many, many, many, many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could [get] big enough to even get close to being a problem,"" said Huth, professor of physics at Harvard University. CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this story .","Startup has been eagerly awaited by 9,000 physicists around the world .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration wants to keep the International Space Station open for another decade, keeping the orbital research platform open through 2024, the White House and NASA announced Wednesday. The decision extends U.S. support for the station by four years. In a joint statement Wednesday afternoon, White House science adviser John Holdren and NASA administrator Charles Bolden said the station ""offers enormous scientific and societal benefits."" NASA hopes to use the station to study the effects of long-duration space flight on astronauts in preparation for new missions beyond Earth in the coming decades. The ISS is also needed for studies of long-range space flight, as a platform for Earth science studies and to boost a growing private space industry, Bolden and Holdren said. Funding for the space station must go through Congress. The 15-year-old station currently houses six crew members, including three Russian cosmonauts, two U.S. astronauts and one Japanese astronaut. NASA currently contributes about $3 billion a year to its operations, which are also supported by Russia, Canada, Japan and members of the European Space Agency. ""With a partnership that includes 15 nations and with 68 nations currently using the ISS in one way or another, this unique orbiting laboratory is a clear demonstration of the benefits to humankind that can be achieved through peaceful global cooperation,"" Holdren and Bolden said.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz's planned visit to India next week has been delayed, an Energy Department official said Wednesday. The postponement of the trip comes amid tensions between New Delhi and Washington over the treatment of an Indian diplomat who was arrested in New York last month on charges of fraud and making false statements on a visa application for her former housekeeper. ""I can confirm that Secretary Moniz is no longer traveling to India next week,"" the Energy Department official said. ""We have been in conversation with Indian counterparts about the dates, and we have agreed to hold the dialogue in the near future at a mutually convenient date."" Indian officials expressed outrage last month when news emerged that Devyani Khobragade, the country's deputy consul general in New York, had been strip-searched by U.S. law enforcement officials after her arrest. They have demanded that the United States apologize and drop the charges against Khobragade, whose lawyer says she is innocent and entitled to diplomatic immunity. Amid the uproar over the issue in the local media last month, Indian authorities expressed their displeasure by removing concrete barriers from outside the U.S. Embassy and taking away American diplomats' identification cards. Moniz's postponed India trip appears to be a high-profile result of the fallout from the dispute. In another move, Indian authorities ordered the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi to halt commercial activities at a club on its property by January 16, an Indian external affairs official said Thursday. The official said the multipurpose American club in the embassy compound was being used by nondiplomats, which contravenes an article of the Vienna Convention. Despite the pressure, U.S. officials say there are no plans to drop the case against Khobragade, who is accused of paying her former housekeeper, Sangeeta Richard, a fraction of the amount promised in the visa application and telling Richard to keep quiet about the situation. They have said Khobragade is entitled to consular immunity, which is less broad than diplomatic immunity and covers only actions carried out under official duties. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" about the situation last month, but stopped short of saying the United States had done anything wrong. Human rights activists say Indian authorities' anger about Khobragade being strip-searched misses the bigger issue of her alleged wrongdoing with regard to Richard. They say the mistreatment of domestic workers is a widespread and often overlooked problem around the world. Indian and U.S. officials have repeatedly said that they hope the situation won't undermine relations between the two countries in the long term. ""We place great emphasis on the U.S.-India energy partnership, which is a key element of the overall strategic partnership,"" the Energy Department official said Wednesday. The talks between the two sides are aimed at exchanging views ""on clean and renewable energy, civilian nuclear energy, regional energy projects, and a host of other topics that are essential to the well-being and prosperity of both our peoples,"" the official said.

"(CNN) -- Two ships broke free Tuesday from the Antarctic ice that had trapped them off the continent's coast. Cracks in the ice allowed the Russian research ship Akademik Shokalskiy to escape the ice field where it had been stranded for two weeks, Australia's Maritime Safety Authority said. The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long, which had gotten stuck in the ice during an attempt to extract the Russian ship, broke free about an hour later, officials said. The Akademik Shokalskiy had been trapped in unusually deep ice since Christmas Eve with scientists, journalists, tourists and crew members on board. A helicopter ferried the ship's 52 passengers to an Australian icebreaker last week. ""We continue to sail northward, changing courses and speed. The speed is 7 knots,"" the Russian ship's captain, Igor Kiselev, told the ITAR-TASS official news agency Tuesday. The captain reported that his ship is now headed to New Zealand, the maritime authority said. The Xue Long will remain on its original mission in the Antarctic, China's state-run Xinhua news agency said. A U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker had been dispatched to help free the stranded ships over the weekend, but they broke loose before it arrived. Meanwhile, the international team of researchers who were flown off the stranded Russian ship are on board the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis, which is ferrying them to Australia's Casey Station on Antarctica. ""All well on @AusAntarctic Aurora,"" team leader Chris Turney reported via Twitter.","NEW: Cracks in the ice allowed a Russian research ship and a Chinese icebreaker to escape .

"(CNN) -- Benjamin Scot Miller and his wife, Lyndsey, didn't expect to be parents on July 16, 2012. The Ohio couple's son wasn't due for another 3Â½ months. But the cramps that Lyndsey felt that day at work were actually contractions. Doctors could not stop the baby from being born that day. Ward Miles Miller was a delicate 12 inches long. He weighed 1 pound, 13 ounces, but soon dropped to 1 pound 7 ounces. ""One doctor told us straight up the first night that there was a 50/50 chance that he would be normal,"" said Benjamin Miller, a professional photographer. ""We definitely prayed and prayed."" Miller captured some of the key moments in Ward's journey and stitched them together in a video running almost seven minutes long, now hugely popular on Vimeo. Watch the video of Ward's first year . Miller's footage shows how Lyndsey Miller first held her son, at 4 days old, when Ward was covered in tubes and cords. Hospital staff helped position the baby and the medical equipment so he could nestle against his mother's chest. In the video, Ward's mother looks straight at the camera and smiles, gently stroking the baby, then suddenly tilts her head down and covers her mouth with her hand in a flood of tearful emotion. The early birth wasn't Ward's only challenge. At 10 days old, a scan revealed blood in his brain tissue, meaning blood had gotten in there at some point. His father remembers crying and praying the whole way to the hospital that day. ""And then you get there and you see him, and he's laying there. He's still the same old self,"" he said. ""We just felt so bad. He has no control over this. It's not his fault."" Over time, the bleed didn't grow, and the blood was slowly reabsorbed by the brain. The problem has not persisted. Ward finally got to go home after spending more than 100 days in the NICU at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. ""HOME"" is displayed in large capital letters in the video. ""When we finally brought him home, it was amazing,"" Miller said. ""That was the day. Everything was leading up to that day, and to have him there was amazing. It was how it was supposed to be from the get-go. We had to wait 107 days before we could experience that, so it was just amazing."" Miller had originally wanted to prepare a video for his son's first birthday, but after that day went by, he found the next best opportunity: October 31, the anniversary of Ward's homecoming and one day before Lyndsey's birthday. The video found a large audience online; it's been watched more than 3.6 million times. ""It's definitely spreading awareness about NICUs,"" Ward's dad said. ""People have no idea ... that there are these NICUs with these babies holding on and parents scared out of their wits, and it's going on every day all around the nation."" The main comments Miller has been getting on the video are from other fathers who sharing their stories. Miller is struck by how similar their tales are. ""Pretty much everyone is saying, like, 'That was me. This video could have been me. That is exactly what I went through,' "" Miller said. Today, Ward is technically 16 months old, but since he wasn't supposed to be born until October 27, 2012, he seems just over a year old, Miller said. ""All the doctors who meet him and we say he was 15 weeks early, they just can't believe it,"" Miller said. ""He doesn't even look like he was a preemie."" It's possible that the brain bleeding could result in problems later on, Miller said, but so far Ward doesn't need any speech or physical therapy. ""He just had his 15-month developmental assessment, and he's right on track with his age group,"" he said. The child has no major health issues except for one: an inflammation in his throat. He sometimes vomits once every two days, which may be related to an allergy, but the family isn't sure. They have ""a great doctor"" helping, though, Miller said. Ward has seen the video on his mother's iPad and likes watching himself, Miller said. ""But yeah, he doesn't understand it,"" Miller said, ""and it's not going to be until he's probably 16, 17, 18 that it really sets in, what's happened.""","Benjamin Miller made a video of his son's first year of life .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer continued their preparations for the first grand slam of the season with contrasting victories Friday at tournaments in Doha and Brisbane. World number one Nadal has never won the Qatar Open and stands just one match away from achieving that ambition. But he was fully extended by German qualifier Peter Gojowczyk before prevailing in three sets. Earlier, Federer dropped just two games on the Gold Coast as he dismissed Marinko Matosevic 6-1 6-1 in just 58 minutes to reach the last four. Nadal, who is the only seed left in the tournament after the shock departures of Andy Murray and David Ferrer, could have been headed that way as he dropped the opening set to Gojowczk, who had enjoyed a dream run to his first ATP Tour semifinal. But the Spaniard hit back to level in typical style and closed out the match 4-6 6-2 6-3 in just under two hours. ""The positive thing is I am in the finals the first week of the season without arriving here with big preparation,"" Nadal told the official ATP Tour website. ""Without playing my best, I was able to find a solution. It's true that I finished the match playing better than what I started,"" he added. Nadal is likely to have his work cut out in Saturday's final at the Khalifa Tennis Complex, with France's Gael Monfils his opponent. Monfils, something of a Doha specialist and twice a losing finalist, showed his quality with a straight sets 6-3 6-2 win over Florian Mayer of Germany in a little under an hour. He has twice beaten Nadal in the same tournament and showed enough against Mayer to suggest he could repeat the hat-trick. Federer is playing in Brisbane for the first time in his glittering career and treated the crowd on the Pat Pat Rafter Arena to a tennis master class against his Australian opponent. He was briefly troubled in the opening game, facing three break points then took firm control. The top seed will next play France's Jeremy Chardy, who beat another Australian, wildcard Sam Groth, 7-5 6-4. The second semifinal will be between second seed Kei Nishikori of Japan and home favorite Lleyton Hewitt. Nishikori ground out a three set win over Croatia's Marin Cili, while Hewitt continued his fine run with a straight sets dismissal of Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, 6-4, 6-2.","Rafael Nadal into final against Gail Monfils at Qatar Open in Doha .

"(CNN) -- With the debut of Aaron Sorkin's new show The Newsroom on HBO this Sunday, I've been thinking about the best film depictions of journalism in American history. Any 'best-of' list is inherently subjective, but you definitely don't need to be a journalist to appreciate the sense of purpose these classic films provide. So without further ado and just for fun on a summer weekend, below are my nominations for the top five journalism films of all time. ""Network"": Paddy Chayefsky's satire is still razor sharp after almost 40 years, offering a prophetic look at what would happen when news desks started answering to entertainment divisions. The film also managed to anticipate the rise of Reality TV, with one surreal side plot in which a self-styled ""liberation army"" gets its own television show and immediately goes from talking about the proletariat to negotiating net versus gross contracts. But in the end it is a morality play, featuring William Holden, Faye Dunaway and Peter Finch as Howard Beale, a network anchor over the edge of a nervous breakdown who shouts the immortal line ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" During the meteoric rise and fall of Glenn Beck, I was half convinced that he'd announce he was punking us by trying to make Howard Beale come alive. Entertainment: What Aaron Sorkin learned from CNN for ""Newsroom"" ""All the President's Men"": The genius of this dramatic depiction of Watergate is that the movie keeps you in suspense even when everybody knows how the story is going to end. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are a perfect pairing as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, with Jason Robards playing Ben Bradlee, all capturing the chase of a great story as it unfolds. The film was made just a few years after Nixon's resignation, but somehow it does not sacrifice the film's sense of perspective on a time when journalists uncovered a corrosive conspiracy at the highest level of the government and toppled a president who only 20 months before had won a 49-state landslide. ""Good Night, and Good Luck"": This George Clooney-directed 2005 film is a small masterpiece, filmed in black and white. David Strathairn perfectly captures the integrity of Edward R. Murrow facing down Joe McCarthy at a time when the witch hunt for the Communist enemy within was ending careers and creating an atmosphere of fear. The film is funny and smart, with tight construction and an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. and a chubbed-up Clooney as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly. The opening scene speech, taken from Murrow's own words, should be regular required viewing for anyone in the news industry. Key line: ""To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; to be credible we must be truthful."" ""Broadcast News"": Armed with a perfect cast of Albert Brooks, William Hurt and Holly Hunter, ""Broadcast News"" is a brilliant comedy that captures the outsized influence of the anchorman -- played by Jack Nicholson -- back in the days of the Big Three. Adding depth are cutaway scenes depicting the characters as neurotic children. It is ultimately a story about ambition and unrequited love, offering a useful, if not particularly uplifting, meditation on the unsteady boundary between infatuation, love and trust. ""His Girl Friday"": Howard Hawk directed this 1930s slapstick comedy, which is based on the Ben Hecht-penned screenplay for The Front Page. Cary Grant plays editor Walter Burns trying to woo his ex-wife and fellow journalist Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) back to the world of the newsroom, with its roll-top desks, three-martini lunches, rotary phones and manual typewriters clacking away. In a nice bit of symmetry, the film debuted the overlapping dialogue technique that Aaron Sorkin later perfected. Honorable mentions: Falling outside this list include ""The Year of Living Dangrously,"" ""Ace in the Hole,"" Will Ferrell's epic, hilarious performance as Ron Burgundy in ""Anchorman,"" and the fifth season of ""The Wire."" Buy them, rent them, download them - but most of all, enjoy them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jon Avlon.","John Avlon: ""The Newsroom"" debuts this Sunday, a modern depiction of journalism .

"(TIME.com) -- With pollen and other spring allergens in the air, researchers investigated whether place of birth affected the risk of developing allergies, and the answer turns out to be — yes. Having an allergic reaction — with its sneezing, wheezing, itchy eyes and runny nose — is an all too familiar experience for many Americans, particularly children. About 11% of youngsters suffer from asthma, and up to 20% may experience some immune-based reaction to allergens such as pollen, dust, animal hair and even foods. But this relatively high prevalence seems to be unique to the United States, so researchers delved into whether different environmental exposures, dictated by where children were born, could affect risk of allergic disease. Reporting in JAMA Pediatrics, the scientists studied 91,642 kids between the ages 0 to 17, all currently living in the United States, who participated in the 2007- 2008 National Survey of Children's Health. The children or their parents answered questions about where they were born, and if they were born outside of the country, they were asked to note how long they had lived in the United States. The researchers also collected medical information about the children's allergic diseases, including asthma, eczema, hay fever and food allergies. TIME.com: Bullying over food allergies . When they compared place of birth with allergic-disease prevalence, the scientists found that children born outside of the United States were less likely to develop asthma or allergies compared with those born in the United States: 20% of foreign-born kids developed allergic diseases compared with 34% of the American-born children. The prevalence of asthma was even lower, with those born outside of the country 47% less likely to develop the condition than those born in the United States. Even after the researchers accounted for factors that could affect rates of allergies, such as race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status, the strong association between being born in the United States and the higher risk of allergic diseases remained. TIME.com: Why we're going nuts over nut allergies . In fact, it was clear that the U.S. environment played some role in the trend, since foreign-born children who had lived in America for more than 10 years were three times as likely to develop allergic diseases as those who spent less than two years Stateside. And foreign-born children whose parents were also born outside of the United States seemed to benefit from additional protection from these conditions: 18% of these children developed allergic disease compared with 33% of foreign-born children whose parents were born in the United States. The results confirm those of previous studies that found higher rates of asthma among American children compared with kids from other countries, and investigators have also reported similar differences in allergic diseases between immigrants and native-born citizens in Italy, Israel and Australia. What does birthplace have to do with how the immune-system functions? The most likely explanation could involve the ""hygiene hypothesis,"" which suggests that improved sanitation methods and efforts to keep germs at bay may deprive young, still-developing immune systems from being trained to recognize and react appropriately to the right types of irritants. ""The hygiene hypothesis suggests that early-life exposures to infection or an unclean environment may protect against allergies. Children born and raised outside the U.S. likely have more and/or different infectious exposures than those born in the U.S.,"" says study author Dr. Jonathan Silverberg of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York. ""That American cities are 'too clean' may be overstated. However, previous studies suggest that rolling in the dirt from time to time may be a good thing for kids."" TIME.com: Why kids with known food allergies are still at risk . Parental behaviors and cultural practices may also play a role. ""Parents born and raised outside the United States may, for example, follow a healthier diet or have foods with a different antigenic profile than typically encountered in the Western diet,"" the authors write. ""Some cultures more commonly use spices, such as curcumin, and green tea that have antiallergy and inflammatory properties."" Such factors could explain why having foreign-born parents seemed to lower risk of allergic disease in their children even further; the finding held even after the researchers accounted for differences in race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and whether or not the child lived in a metropolitan area. Sneezing and wheezing solutions: Surprising ways to relieve spring allergies . In terms of what features of the American lifestyle or culture could be contributing to an increased risk of these diseases, previous studies from the same team of scientists suggested that factors such as climate, obesity, the Western diet and various types of infections could play a role. The current study wasn't designed to identify which specific environmental factors might be the most influential, but Silverberg says, ""one of our goals is to determine which factor [or factors] have the greatest impact on allergic disease, and to help develop public-health interventions to decrease rates of allergic disease in the U.S."" — because those influences would likely be far easier to change than where you're born.

"(CNN) -- No-one can fault U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry for lack of effort. He has just wrapped up his 10th visit to the Middle East in pursuit of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority -- the most elusive prize in international diplomacy. Kerry has a vision, according to U.S. diplomats -- to climb the mountain with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and to peer down from the summit on the valley of peace to see what a two-state solution would look like. It is a poetic metaphor, but more than half-way into the nine-month timetable for reaching a framework agreement, Kerry's partners are still bickering in the foothills. The more pessimistic observers -- with history on their side -- say both the Israelis and Palestinians are positioning themselves to be able to blame the other for failure. Kerry's aim is to gather together all the issues -- ""borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, mutual recognition, and the end of conflict and of all claims"" -- in this framework agreement, which would in his words ""lay out the end-game,"" the parameters for a final peace settlement. The U..S and its partners would then help the two parties hammer out the details. Kerry himself has acknowledged how difficult the climb would be -- choosing another metaphor while shuttling through the region last week. ""In the end all of these core issues fit together like a mosaic, like a puzzle and you can't separate out one piece or another,"" he said. ""The last pieces may decide to fall into place, or may fall on the floor, and leave the puzzle unfinished."" Kerry dropped hints about progress last week, saying after meeting Abbas that talks had ""fleshed out and even resolved"" certain kinds of issues. U.S. envoy Martin Indyk will stay in the region to follow up on last week's talks and the secretary himself will likely return within weeks. But at the same time, both parties are busy blaming the other for obstructing the process. Netanyahu, with Kerry at his side, accused the Palestinian Authority of continuing ""unabated incitement against the State of Israel"" over the past six months. ""A few days ago in Ramallah, President Abbas embraced terrorists as heroes,"" he said, referring to the welcome given to Palestinian prisoners released by Israel. Borders and Jewish settlements are likely to be the most difficult piece of Kerry's puzzle. The Israeli government is expected to announce plans in the next few days for building 1,400 new homes in the West Bank, a move guaranteed to infuriate the Palestinians. A senior U.S. State Department official said last week that ""the settlement activity that has been going on has created a lot of questions on the Palestinian side and in the international community about the intentions of the Government of Israel."" Nearly half-a-million Jews now live in settlements in occupied territory, and Israeli sources maintain that the largest -- such as those in Hebron and Beit El -- would not be surrendered on any settlement. President Obama laid out Washington's principles two years ago, saying that ""the Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves, and reach their potential, in a sovereign and contiguous state."" That state should be based on the 1967 land boundaries -- before Israel seized east Jerusalem and the West Bank -- plus swaps to take account of developments since. Netanyahu shot back that a return to such borders would imperil Israel's security. ""Remember that before 1967, Israel was all of nine miles wide, half the width of the Washington beltway,"" he said while meeting Obama. Many Israeli officials insist that today -- in the face of growing instability in the region and a resurgence of militant Islamist groups -- the Jewish state must maintain a military presence in the Jordan Valley as the only way to defend the country's eastern border, providing some strategic depth. And that presence, they maintain, could only be sustained by a secure road cutting through the heart of the West Bank. Some within Israel's coalition government even want to annex Jewish settlements in the fertile Jordan Valley, potentially the bread-basket of a new Palestinian state, and home to nearly 30% of Palestinians living in the West Bank. The proposal is unlikely to go anywhere, but demonstrates the internal difficulties that face Netanyahu in any push toward a final settlement. Whatever is going on behind closed doors, Israel and the Palestinians seem in public no closer to compromise on other core issues. Both continue to claim Jerusalem as their capital. The Palestinians reject outright Netanyahu's demand that they recognize Israel as a Jewish state, fearing that to do so would disenfranchise 1.5 million Israeli Arabs. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman says he has an answer for that -- move the border so that the main concentrations of Israeli Arabs will live within a Palestinian state. In Kerry's favor is a recognition among many Israelis that the current environment may offer the best opportunity to strike a deal, with much of the Arab world in disarray and long-term population trends threatening to leave the Jews a minority in their own homeland. Lieberman himself said on Friday that Kerry's framework was the best Israel could expect and ""any other proposal from the international community won't be as good."" Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert chimed in, saying ""there's nothing that will change our lives so substantially, nothing that could negatively impact our lives, more than the existence or absence of a peace agreement between us and Palestinians as soon as possible."" And in an editorial, the Israeli daily Haaretz said Netanyahu -- and Israel -- could not afford to be seen as the spoiler. ""An Israeli refusal would put Israel on the South African track, banishing it to the punishment corner, a disgrace to the family of nations. An Israeli refusal would endanger its intimate alliance with the United States, on which its national security and economic wellbeing are based. An Israeli refusal would play into the Iranians' hands,"" Haaretz wrote. Kerry seemed to hint at this dilemma when he said: ""The time is soon arriving where leaders are going to have to make difficult decisions."" Through intensive diplomacy the U.S. Secretary of State is trying to build momentum and to get both Netanyahu and Abbas to make a leap of faith despite the skepticism and outright opposition they both face at home. By phone, in person, through his support team, Kerry is not giving either party a moment to drift backwards. The self-imposed timetable calls for a framework agreement to be reached by April. Publicly, that remains the target. But one senior State Department official says with masterly understatement: ""From my 35-year experience on this particular conflict and the efforts to resolve it, it always takes longer than you think.""","Through intensive diplomacy the U.S. Secretary of State is trying to build momentum in Middle East peace talks .

"London (CNN) -- Shopping is a serious business in London whatever the season -- but it doesn't get much more serious than this time of year. The UK capital's January sales sees throngs of dedicated shopaholics cram its countless department stores, quirky boutiques and market stalls, keen to get their hands on the latest fashion trends and product offers. But it's not just domestic spend that's keeping the tills ringing in London. While the vibrant city's high-end stores are no strangers to overseas visitors, with those from the Middle East typically spending the most, a surprising new contender has emerged in recent times as a big spender in the international market -- Nigeria. ""Africa is growing from strength to strength and particularly in the last 12 to 18 months we've seen Nigeria come through incredibly strongly,"" explains Sue West, director of operations at up-market London department store Selfridges. ""It is a very broad base so we still very much have a strong Chinese base, a strong Middle East base, Russia is there, the BRICs nations as you imagine, but Nigeria seems to be coming through very strongly at the moment as well,"" she adds. Read: Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . The former British colony is Africa's most populous nation as well as the continent's top oil producer. According to African Economic Outlook (AEO), Nigeria's economic growth has averaged about 7.4% annually over the past decade, creating a wealthier Nigerian elite with a large spending power. At the same time, however, AEO says that robust economic growth has not reduced poverty in the country, with about two thirds of its population living on less than $1 per day. Home to a large African diaspora, the UK is a popular travel destination for Nigerians visiting friends and relatives, going on holidays or conducting business. Daily flights between Nigeria and the UK have increased in recent years, with airlines such as British Airways allowing Nigerian customers an additional 23kg of baggage free of charge. Read: Private jets spread their wings in Africa . According to the UK's Office for National Statistics, some 142,000 Nigerians visited the UK in 2011, spending an average Â£107 ($172) per day. From January to September last year, Nigeria's tax-free spend in the UK grew by 11% year on year, according to tourism services provider Global Blue. The trend has not gone unnoticed by UK retailers, some of which have responded by tailoring their offerings to their growing Nigerian customer base. ""More recently we're starting to introduce a lot more niche brands,"" says West. ""We've worked in collaboration with some very popular Nigerian brands,"" she adds. ""I think it's not only important to demonstrate we can bring the big brands such as Louis Vuiton and Chanel, but we can also really appeal to more of a niche market too."" Read also: Rise of Africa's 'repats' One such collaboration helping Selfridges further engage with its growing number of Nigerian customers is its recent team-up with Style House Files. The Lagos-based fashion company has just opened an installation inside Selfridges, giving Nigerian designers a chance to widen their market and showcase their creations outside the West African country. Omoyemi Akerele, director of Style House Files, says that Nigeria is an emerging market, with Nigerians are among the five biggest spenders at the department store. Akerele argues the collaboration is a win-win situation for both parties. ""This will give our designers a platform, an opportunity for their pieces to be in Selfridges, that's a dream come true,"" says Akerele. ""For Selfridges, on the other hand, it would endear their Nigerian customers -- and not just Nigerian customers, African in general -- more to the brand."" Read: African CEOs look to bright future . Akerele says that although the reality in Nigeria is that most people live in poverty, the rise of sectors such as telecommunications and the diversification of the Nigerian economy beyond oil and gas has created an emerging middle class with bigger spending power. ""Their earning capacity is increasing and they're spending on more things and not just the basic food and clothing,"" she explains.

"Toronto (CNN) -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford would have admitted to smoking crack cocaine long before his eventual admission, he says. It's just that no one asked him the right question. After more than five months of denials, Ford admitted that he had indeed smoked crack in a ""drunken stupor"" about a year ago. The admission came amid a drug investigation that has led to charges against a friend and occasional driver, though not so far against Ford himself. In a weekend interview with CNN, the leader of Canada's largest city repeated his insistence that he would remain in office and let voters decide his fate next year. And he defended his earlier denials, saying he never lied to reporters who asked about his drug use. ""If someone would have said, came up to me and said, 'Have you ever smoked crack? Have you ever smoked weed? I would have said, 'Yeah, I have,' "" Ford said. ""But when you come and accuse me of being a crack addict and say, 'Do you smoke crack?' No I don't. Have I? Yeah, OK. Have I drank, have I acted like an idiot when I drank? Yeah, I did."" Ford said he's not a drug addict. He said his conduct was ""absolutely wrong,"" but added, ""I am moving on."" A man of contrasts, Ford leads his 'nation' in controversy . Speaking at a weekend toy drive in the blue-collar City Council district that his brother Doug now represents, Ford said he was ""sick and tired of all the allegations and all this bulls--t."" ""Sorry, kids -- I shouldn't have sworn in front of the kids,"" he said. ""But after a while, I know what I'm doing is right. I'm serving people. I'm saving taxpayers money. And you know what, I made mistakes, I drank too much, I smoked some crack sometime. What can I say? I made a mistake, I'm human."" The Toronto Star has reported that Ford was asked ""countless times"" whether he had used drugs while mayor, without an answer. Ford accused the newspaper of mounting a vendetta against him on behalf of his ""rich and elitist"" political opponents. Ford was elected to a four-year term in 2010 and has touted tax cuts and streamlined government under his administration. But while he's often characterized as conservative, Doug Ford said his brother is ""a huge, massive social liberal"" who loves U.S. President Barack Obama. Reporter's notebook: In the heart of Ford nation with embattled mayor . Rob Ford added, ""My specialty is taking care of people that have been totally ignored their whole life, and I'm not going to stop doing it."" Since his November 5 admission, documents released by a court have outlined more allegations of drug use, drunkenness and alleged verbal and physical abuse of aides. In the course of answering those allegations on Thursday, he denied a female staffer's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own, stunning reporters and leading to another apology. On Wednesday, Toronto's City Council called for him to take a leave of absence. On Friday, the council voted to strip him of his ability to govern in an emergency and to appoint and dismiss committee chairs. Monday, members are expected to take up a measure that would delegate duties not assigned by statute to the mayor, effectively stripping Ford of most of his responsibilities. But in the northwestern neigborhood of Rexdale, a diverse community in the heart of the ""Ford Nation,"" the mayor and his brother were met with cheers by the knot of well-wishers who joined him at the toy drive.

"Santa Ana, California (CNN) -- A jury of eight women and four men on Thursday began deliberating the fate of two former Fullerton police officers in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man. The beating of Kelly Thomas in a transit parking lot was recorded by security cameras on the night of July 5, 2011. The surveillance camera footage shows Thomas being beaten, clubbed, and stunned with a Taser by police. The video sparked a nationwide outcry. Former Deputy Manuel Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. A second former Fullerton officer, Jay Cicinelli, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force. In closing arguments, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told jurors that Ramos bore responsibility for Thomas's death because he issued a threat to the uncooperative homeless man. Ramos can be seen on the surveillance video putting on gloves and shaking his fist in Thomas's face. ""See these fists,"" Ramos says, ""They will f*** you up."" What followed was a struggle involving Thomas and several officers that had a badly battered Thomas pleading for mercy. Thomas was taken to a hospital and later declared dead. But defense attorney John Barnett earlier told jurors that Ramos's statement was not meant literally. It was a ""verbal strategy"" to elicit cooperation from a combative Thomas, according to Barnett. Outside the courthouse, Barnett told the press that the case had caused great harm to Southern California law enforcement, ""All law enforcement has to look over their shoulders now, because they fear they can be prosecuted for doing their job."" Michael Schwartz, attorney for Cicinelli, said, ""We have a tragedy in this case. Someone died. We don't convict people in this country to find closure."" The defense has argued that the officers did not use excessive force and other measures had failed to subdue a combative Thomas. Rackauckas said the case was not a reflection on all law enforcement, but rather an indictment of two officers who, according to him, acted outside the law.","Kelly Thomas, 37, died after being beaten by Fullerton Police Department officers .

"(CNN) -- Verrry scary things as we approached Halloween: . 1. Zombies. 2. Vampires. 3. David Ortiz. It was a dark and bone-chilling night in Boston, Massachusetts. A game of baseball was to be played -- a spine-tingly, goose-bumpy game, Game 6 of the 2013 World Series, in a park fenced in by a Green Monster -- and the visiting St. Louis Cardinals had a particularly petrifying sight to face on Halloween eve when, one by one, those wolfman-hairy Boston Red Sox came to bat: . ""Big Papi."" (Screams. A thunder clap. A lightning bolt.) Oooh, as scary as the walking dead. Up to the plate he stepped, 6 feet 4, 250 pounds, lugging a huge wooden club. A cardinal or two on the front of a St. Louis player's shirt must have flown away in fear. The rest of the Red Sox were eerie enough, with those demented-farmer-from-a-horror-film faces of theirs. Yet it was not the dark whiskers of David Americo Ortiz that were intimidating to anybody. It was that bat. That dangerous, deadly, pitcher's-bloodsucking bat. Sure enough, they tried to take that bat out of Ortiz's huge hands. They walked him ... and walked him ... and walked him .... and walked him. Four times, three of them intentional, but all for naught because the Red Sox took Game 6 anyway, 6-1, to claim the World Series as their own on the green grass of home. He came to Wednesday night's game hitting .733. No, not .333. Not even .533, which would have been a fairly surreal bat stat. The monster masher known in New England to all as ""Big Papi"" already had 11 hits in 15 official times at bat in this World Series, a fiendishly good, sell-your-soul batting average of .733. Which is kind of like playing 18 holes of golf and getting birdies on 14 or 15 of them. Once when he DIDN'T get on base, he walloped a ball to Fenway Park's right-field wall that required a fence-banging, rib-bruising catch on the part of the Cardinals' Carlos Beltran to prevent it from being a grand slam home run. Scary good, this guy has been. (A banshee's cry. A creaking door.) On the opposite wall of Boston's ancient park, the intimidatingly high left-field one nicknamed the ""Green Monster,"" ghosts inside probably were cackling in delight whenever Ortiz lurched up to home plate. Wednesday's game needed to be won by the visitors from Missouri to stay alive. They must have felt Fenway's old walls closing in on them, like anxious villagers finding themselves trapped by Stephen King under a dome. St. Louis came armed with a strong team and a splendid pitching staff. Yet it had to at least consider the possibility of NOT having a pitcher throw a single pitch to Big Papi. At least not one he could hit. Wait ... you mean walk Ortiz on purpose every time up, no matter what? It might beat getting beat by his bat. ""I remember them doing it to Frank Howard,"" the former big-league outfielder Rick Reichardt said when I touched base with him before Wednesday's game. September 2, 1970: Cleveland Indians vs. Washington Senators. The manager of the visiting team, Alvin Dark, had a dread of seeing 6-foot-7, 255-pound Frank Howard stride toward the plate. ""He's the monster man in baseball,"" Dark once said of him. ""I never saw any man feared like this."" So, he intentionally walked Howard time after time. He made pitcher Sam McDowell walk him in the first inning. (Reichardt batted next and made an out.) Walked him in the third inning, even though Howard was the first man up. (Reichardt struck out.) Walked him in the fifth, again with none on base and none out. (Reichardt singled, then Howard scored on a wild pitch.) It got weirder. Sixth inning, two Senators on base, Howard up, so the Cleveland manager decided to finally risk pitching to him. He told McDowell to go from the mound to first base. He brought in the great Dean Chance just to pitch to Howard, who promptly made Dark regret it with a base hit. Reichardt then knocked in a run and Washington won the game. Would you walk the Red Sox's red-hot David Ortiz every time at bat? ""Every at-bat, I would not,"" Reichardt told me. ""But depending on the situation, it could be automatic."" This is the kind of fear that Barry Bonds struck in his foes. Bonds was walked intentionally a whopping 120 times in the 2004 season alone. That is insane. Yet to opposing managers, it felt more logical than letting Bonds have a chance to belt a home run. Sparky Anderson refused to let George Brett hit after being burned by him once too often. ""Anytime I've got first base open,"" Anderson said in the '80s when he was managing the Detroit Tigers, ""that's where he's going."" Walk him even with the bases full? ""You bet,"" Sparky said. ""That's the way they pitched Ted Williams. I'll take my chances with whoever's on deck."" Ah, Ted Williams ... the scariest Red Sox of them all. Willie McCovey of the San Francisco Giants was once walked deliberately by Anderson four times in a game, whereupon he yelled to Anderson in the dugout: ""Who do you think I am, Ted Williams?"" Hmmm, maybe the specter of Ted Williams was there a-haunting Fenway Park as well, watching over Ortiz as the Red Sox went out hunting for the ultimate Halloween treat. The way that Ortiz had been hitting in this World Series, you could definitely describe it as Williams-esque. Big Papi, unlike the man once nicknamed the Splendid Splinter, is a baseball slugger in an era when many fans have become suspicious of a hitter's success. Is his prowess the result of hard work and legitimate talent or are more sinister methods involved: a secret formula from a Frankenstein-like laboratory, perhaps? Ahhh, but almost nobody seems to speculate that a banned steroid has ever passed through David Ortiz's flesh and veins. He seems immune to suspicion, possibly due to his always being a man of considerable size, big arms, big trunk, big head, and not some 170-pound beanpole who transformed into a baseball-crushing beast. ""They pick me (to be drug-tested) every time, I don't know why,"" Ortiz said a few years ago with a bemused shrug. ""All I know is all they are going to find is a lot of rice and beans."" He came to Halloween eve looking to torment and haunt everyone from St. Louis to the very end. (A maniacal laugh. A wolf's howl.) The Cardinals, well, they were looking to do whatever it took, short of garlic or a stake to the heart, to fend off Fenway Park's scary bat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Mike Downey: David Ortiz may have been the scariest thing to face Cardinals this Halloween .

"(CNN) -- He had a distinguished voice like actor Robert Stack and the looks of a Hollywood actor. But it was his investigative and storytelling skills that set longtime CNN correspondent and bureau chief Robert Vito apart from the rest. Vito died Wednesday night at his son's home in Singapore after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Vito was a correspondent for CNN for 17 years. In that time, he served as the first CNN Detroit bureau chief and later was the network's Rome bureau chief But he was better known for the stories he broke and covered. He won two Cable ACE Awards and several national and local Emmys. With CNN, he covered some of the biggest stories of the '80s and '90s, including the Branch-Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas; the Oklahoma City bombing; and the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Few knew it, but he was educated to be a teacher. He taught in a school in Illinois, but he wanted something different. He modeled in print ads and eventually landed a job as a radio reporter in Wisconsin. It was an act of fate and weather that brought Vito into the forefront of television news. In 1968, he had just been hired at WAEO-TV (now WJFW) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, as a general assignment reporter. But high winds knocked down the station's transmission tower. It knocked the station off the air, and Vito out of a job. He took what little he had on a ""demo reel,"" some radio reports from a previous job, and photos from his days as a model, to Milwaukee, where WISN-TV hired him. Vito's reports there led to construction of highway median barriers on Milwaukee County freeways, and a career in TV investigative journalism was launched. In 1973, he went to work for Detroit's WWJ-TV (which later became WDIV). In July 1975, Vito interviewed former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. It was Hoffa's last media interview, broadcast two weeks before his disappearance. In 1982, Vito became the first Detroit bureau chief for CNN, just two years after the fledgling cable network's launch. The auto industry was a major part of his beat, and his reporting on industrial pollution affecting fish and possibly giving them cancer prompted a congressional hearing, where he testified and his reports were shown. In 1988 he became CNN's Rome bureau chief, followed by a move to CNN's Los Angeles bureau the next year. From L.A., he covered some of the top stories of the decade -- the Rodney King beating and the riots that followed, the Branch-Davidian standoff, the terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, the O.J. Simpson criminal trial and the McMartin preschool case. From there he went on to CNN's Miami Bureau, where he covered the trial of attorney F. Lee Bailey, the shooting down of civilian aircraft off the coast of Cuba, and the slaying of fashion designer Gianni Versace. Vito left CNN in 1999 and worked as a jury consultant for a Tampa, Florida, legal consulting firm. He later worked on documentaries before leaving the business to take care of his wife, Nancy, who succumbed to cancer a year ago. Last January, Independent News Service announced The Broadcast Industry recognition given to Vito for over 45 years of dedication to investigative journalism. He's survived by his son John, John's wife, Thanita, and his grandson, Anthony. People we lost in 2013 .","Vito was CNN's first Detroit bureau chief, taking the job in 1982 .

"Panama City, Florida (CNN) -- President Barack Obama toured the waters off Panama City Beach by boat on Sunday as he capped a weekend visit aimed at sparking a recovery in the region hard-hit by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The president, first lady Michelle Obama and their younger daughter Sasha stood at the bow of the excursion boat watching porpoises jump around them before heading back to shore. The family returned to Washington on Sunday afternoon. Speaking before a Saturday afternoon dip with his daughter, Obama said his administration remains committed to ensuring a full cleanup and recovery for a region hard-hit by the disaster -- and expressed hope that his holiday on the beach would change public perception and soften the economic blow of the largest oil spill in U.S. history. ""As a result of the cleanup effort, beaches all along the Gulf Coast are clean, safe, and open for business,"" he said. ""That's one of the reasons Michelle, Sasha, and I are here."" Panama City Beach was hit by scattered tar balls and patches of oil from the ruptured undersea well at the heart of the disaster. But the bulk of the spill hit further west, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, and authorities are still struggling with the cleanup effort. Obama said Saturday that ""Our job is not finished, and and we are not going anywhere until it is."" ""That's a message I wanted to come here and deliver directly to the people along the Gulf Coast,"" Obama said after meeting with government and business leaders in the Florida Panhandle resort. ""Because it's the men and women of this region who have felt the burden of this disaster, who have watched with anger and dismay as their livelihoods and way of life were threatened these past few months."" Visitors spent more than $34 billion in 2008 in congressional districts along the Gulf Coast, sustaining 400,000 jobs. The effects of the oil spill on the region's travel industry could last up to three years and cost up to $22.7 billion, according to an analysis conducted last month by Oxford Economics for the U.S. Travel Association. Sunday marked a month since the BP-owned well was temporarily capped. Efforts to seal the well permanently are awaiting additional pressure tests that could take up to four days, former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Saturday. In Gulf Shores, Alabama, a resort town about 175 miles west of Panama City, Mayor Robert Craft told CNN that the last oil washed up on the white sands about three weeks ago, and visitors were coming back. ""We don't know what to expect and we certainly have no experience in dealing with it -- no training, no background and every day is a different day,"" he said. But he added, ""The beaches are clean, and the water is open, and we still have hope to salvage a good portion of this year."" The disaster began with an April 20 explosion aboard the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 workers. More than 2 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before the well was shut in. Obama said Saturday the government will continue to monitor the oil in the ocean as well as any that hits the shore. ""I won't be satisfied until the environment has been restored, no matter how long it takes,"" he said. CNN's Reynolds Wolf contributed to this report.","First couple and younger daughter Sasha watch porpoises off Panama City .

"(CNN) -- Venezuela is deploying some 15,000 troops to its borders to combat drug trafficking, the country's defense minister says. Operation Sentinel, as it is called, will send troops to the frontiers with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana, the state-run AVN news agency reported Friday. The goal of the operation is to find and dismantle laboratories where illegal drugs are produced, and to root out traffickers, Defense Minister Gen. Henry Rangel Silva said. ""We will carry out intelligence work and patrols to detect the possible camps for processing drugs,"" he said, according to AVN. The announcement by Rangel is notable because the United States considers him involved in the drug trade, too. The United States added Rangel to its kingpin list in 2008, alleging he provided support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC. A statement from the Treasury Department at the time said the general ""materially assisted the narcotics trafficking activities of the FARC"" and pushed for more cooperation between the Venezuelan government and the leftist rebels. After coming to power, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ended his nation's cooperation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Since then, the United States has criticized Venezuela's efforts against drug trafficking, while Venezuela touts what it has achieved without the Americans' help. Rangel said that the operation, which already has about 150 border outposts, has already shown positive results.","Venezuela will send 15,000 troops to bolster border security .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Officials at the hospital in Israel where former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is being treated described him Thursday as being in ""extremely critical"" and ""grave"" condition, with his family is by his side. ""In the last few hours there has been a deterioration in Ariel Sharon's medical condition,"" said a spokesman for Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer. ""He continues to be in critical condition."" Earlier this week, the center's director, Zeev Rotstein, had said doctors were unable to stabilize Sharon's kidney function and other vital systems and that the danger to Sharon's life had grown. The 85-year-old has been in a coma for eight years and is suffering from multiple organ failure. News broke last week that his health had recently worsened. Sharon is a highly decorated -- if controversial -- Israeli military figure who became prime minister in 2001. He became comatose in 2006, when he suffered a major stroke that led doctors to put him under anesthesia and on a respirator. His term as prime minister came to an end. Rising through military ranks . Born in 1928 in Kfar Malal -- a community that would later become part of Israel -- Sharon graduated from high school in 1945 and began working with the Haganah, a militant group advocating for Israel's independence. He began his rise through the Israeli military ranks in 1953. Sharon helped establish an elite commando unit and was eventually promoted to be an army major general. He held this rank during 1967's Six Day War, which ended with Israel controversially expanding its territory. Sharon went on to play major roles in subsequent Israeli military conflicts as well, including as head of the army's Armored Reserve Division during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He then began transitioning into government roles that included stints as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's military adviser, agriculture minister and defense minister from 1981 to 1983. Invasion of Lebanon . Sharon also orchestrated Israel's invasion of Lebanon, an effort aimed at Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters that also left thousands of civilians dead and led many in the Arab world to call him the ""Butcher of Beirut."" An official Israeli inquiry found Sharon indirectly responsible for the September 1982 killings of as many as 2,000 Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps outside of Beirut, Lebanon. The report -- which led to Sharon's prompt resignation -- determined that the then-defense minister had done nothing to stop Christian militiamen allied with Israel from entering the camps, despite fears they might seek to avenge the killing of their leader the previous day. Sharon did not stay out of the spotlight for long. His adviser Ranaan Gissin said Sharon ""felt betrayed by his government."" Sharon also sued Time for $50 million over a magazine article implying that he had foreknowledge of and played a greater role in the massacre. A New York jury in 1985 agreed that the article was negligent and defamatory, but ultimately ruled in the U.S.-based publisher's favor, finding no evidence of actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth. Becoming prime minister . Sharon held several other Cabinet posts between 1984 and 2001, when he won a special election to become prime minister. By then, as head of the Likud party, Sharon was considered a hawk. And early on, he took the offensive by sending tanks and troops into Palestinian territory and ordering the assassination of militant leaders. But Sharon also took steps toward peace, such as agreeing with the PLO's then-leader, Yasser Arafat, on a timeline to halt Israeli-Palestinian violence and resume peace talks. But that effort was undermined by Sharon's own party, which backed a resolution to never allow the creation of a Palestinian state. Sharon later participated in talks with regional and world powers to discuss a ""road map"" for Middle East peace. A significant moment for Sharon was his decision to turn over Gaza and portions of the West Bank to Palestinian control. While he had previously encouraged Israelis to establish settlements on occupied Palestinian land, Sharon pushed for Israel's historic withdrawal, or disengagement, from 25 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. The reaction in his own right-wing Likud Party to his order to the military to drag Israeli settlers from their homes in Gaza led Sharon in November 2005 to form the centrist political party Kadima, Hebrew for ""Forward."" In grappling with the decades-long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, Sharon said a few years before, ""I can talk and look in the eyes of the citizens of Israel and convince them to make painful compromises."" Immediately after Sharon fell ill in early 2006, his power was transferred to Vice Premier Ehud Olmert. Surgeons removed 20 inches of Sharon's intestine the following month and, that April, Israel's Cabinet formally ended his run as prime minister after declaring him permanently incapacitated. The former prime minister's health has fluctuated since then. In January 2013, doctors said testing on Sharon indicated some brain activity when he was shown photos of his home and heard his son's voice.

"(CNN) -- A news anchor and four other people were killed on Monday in a suicide bombing after armed militants stormed a TV complex in Tikrit, Iraq, police said. The violence unfolded when a car bomb exploded outside Salaheddin TV and the local offices of al Iraqiya state TV in Tikrit, a major city in Salaheddin province north of Baghdad. Militants then stormed the offices and a suicide bomber killed five employees inside Salaheddin TV, including a female anchor and the head of its news department, police said. At least two attackers wore explosive vests. Security forces arrived at the scene, fought the attackers and regained control of the building, police said. Authorities imposed a curfew on Tikrit, and Salaheddin TV stopped broadcasting until further notice. Political and sectarian violence has plagued Iraq throughout the year, with thousands of deaths reported. Tensions have pervaded the Sunni community, which has felt marginalized by the Shiite-dominated government. Iraq's unrest reaches world of journalism . Journalists haven't been immune from the terror. Before the latest violence, Irina Bokova, director-general of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, denounced the killings of eight journalists in Iraq this year. ""Violence against media workers undermines the ability of journalists to carry out their work freely as well as the right of citizens to receive the independent information they need,"" Bokova said. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group, said in a report this month that journalists have been subjected to threats and killings. The report focused on unrest in Mosul, the religiously and ethnically diverse city in Iraq's north. ""These killings are a significant deterioration from 2012, a landmark year in which no journalists were killed for their work in Iraq for the first time since the 2003 American invasion,"" the report said. ""That brief reprieve was part of a larger decrease in overall political violence, but that reprieve now seems to be over. And just as the underlying causes of political violence in Iraq were never resolved, neither have the underlying drivers of violence against journalists. There are simply too many triggermen ready to silence journalists, knowing full well that there is little that can stop them."" Other violence . Violence occurred in other regions of Iraq on Monday, police said. At least six soldiers were killed when mortar rounds landed on a military base near Baghdad. Four people died when gunmen attacked pet stores in southern Baghdad, and three people died when a bomb exploded in an outdoor market in the northwestern part of the Iraqi capital, police said. Three people died in shootings in Mosul, and an attack on a bus in Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, left three others dead, police said.","NEW: Suicide bomber kills five employees at a TV station in Tikrit .

"(CNN) -- The bombs used in the Boston Marathon attack were built in the apartment that suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev shared with his wife and child, a U.S. law enforcement official with first-hand knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Thursday. The official was not authorized to release the information. Katherine Russell, Tsarnaev's widow, has remained largely out of view inside her parents' North Kingstown home since her husband's death. It remains unclear what, if anything, Tamerlan's widow might have known or suspected, the source added. According to her attorney, Amato DeLuca, the 24-year-old widow knew nothing of plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an ""absolute shock"" to Russell and her family. Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, initially planned to carry out a suicide-bomb attack on July 4, a U.S. law enforcement official regularly briefed on the Boston bombing investigation told CNN. The source said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators their bombs were ready earlier than they expected and they decided to move up the date. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that the Boston Marathon was chosen as a target only a day or two before the event, the source said. It is unclear which specific event would have been targeted but one of the biggest July Fourth celebrations in the country is held in Boston. The annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular hosts 500,000 spectators, according to the event's website. It is televised live nationally on CBS. The revelation comes the same day the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev was claimed by his family and later was picked up by a funeral home, according to Terrel Harris, spokesman for the Massachusetts office of the chief medical examiner. Harris declined to say which funeral home picked it up. Tsarnaev's cause of death will not be released until the death certificate is filed with the Boston city clerk, he said. The earliest that's expected to happen is Friday morning, Harris said. His parents in Dagestan will not bring the bombing suspect's body back to Russia and will not bury him until an ""independent"" autopsy is conducted, family spokeswoman Kheda Saratova said Friday. His body will be interred ""somewhere in Boston,"" she said. One item that may yield some clues into the bombings case is now in the hands of federal officials. The FBI has a laptop belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Tamerlan's younger brother, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN. The computer was turned over to investigators by one of his friends accused of obstructing justice. A lawyer for Dias Kadyrbayev tells CNN that his client ""turned over the laptop to the FBI."" He didn't say when the laptop was turned over. A law enforcement source confirmed the attorney's account. Three people died and more than 260 were wounded when two explosive devices fashioned from pressure cookers and other materials exploded in separate locations near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15. Four people have been charged in connection with the bombing, including Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of carrying out the attack along with his brother, Tamerlan, 26. The older brother died April 19 after a firefight with police, hours after authorities released images of the suspected bombers. Azamat Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev were charged Wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar's dorm room, including empty fireworks containers, while Robel Phillipos was charged with making false statements to investigators. The Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry said Thursday it was offering consular services to Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, who are citizens of that country and are in the United States on student visas. ""We would like to emphasize that our citizens did not receive charges of involvement in the organization of the Boston Marathon bombings. They were charged with destroying evidence,"" the ministry said in a statement. Dzhokhar, who suffered gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hands, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and could face the death penalty if convicted. Authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone, but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. Of particular interest has been Tamerlan Tsarnaev's 2012 trip to the semi-autonomous Russian republic of Dagestan, home to numerous Islamic militant groups that have warred against Moscow's rule. Russian authorities asked U.S. officials to investigate Tamerlan some months before the trip, saying they believed he was becoming increasingly involved with radical Islam. The FBI investigated, but found no evidence of extremist activity and closed the case. U.S. officials learned after the bombings that Russian officials had intercepted a 2011 phone call between the suspect's mother, living in Dagestan, and one of her sons in which they reportedly had a vague conversation about jihad, a law enforcement official told CNN earlier. Some lawmakers, particularly Republicans, have been critical of how law enforcement officials, intelligence agencies and the administration of President Barack Obama handled the Russian tip. While Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his mother were added to a terror database following the FBI investigation, Tamerlan was allowed to make his Russian trip in 2012 and return six months later. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Marina Carver contributed to this report.","NEW: The family will not bring Tamerlan's body back to Russia, spokeswoman said .

"Lakeside, California (CNN) -- A handwritten note, handcuff box, camping equipment and a DNA swab kit were among the items found by San Diego deputies in the burned home and garage of James DiMaggio. DiMaggio was shot and killed by FBI agents in Idaho after allegedly kidnapping Hannah Anderson,16, this month. The list of items is included in a search warrant and affidavits CNN affiliate KFMB obtained. It detailed what authorities found in the aftermath of the August 4 fire at DiMaggio's home, about 45 miles east of San Diego in the community of Boulevard, and how investigators believe the fire was started. Other items found on the nine-page list of things seized from the home and the adjacent garage include incendiary devices, a gas can, rolls of duct tape, used condoms, ammunition, an arson wire and letters from Hannah. Contents of the letters and the handwritten note were not revealed in the affidavit. When specifically asked about the note by KFMB, the sheriff's department deferred. ""Many portions of this investigation cannot be discussed,"" said spokesperson Jan Caldwell. ""Sorry this is one if them."" Also recovered was a map of Yosemite -- a possible clue as to where DiMaggio intended to take Hannah. The list also contained seemingly benign items such as balloons, a fly swatter and a Popsicle box. The court documents did not specifically tie any of the items to DiMaggio's alleged crimes. DiMaggio flees with Hannah . Hannah went missing after cheerleading practice in San Diego County on August 3. The next day, the bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and brother, Ethan, 8, were found at the DiMaggio property. Affidavits: Teen's mother, brother 'tortured and killed' That horror spurred a manhunt, which zeroed in on central Idaho after two critical clues: the discovery of DiMaggio's blue Nissan Versa outside the city of Cascade, and a sighting of the pair by horseback riders. One of the horsemen recalled noticing multiple ""red flags"" during their brief interaction with the pair, including their brand-new camping equipment and the pajama-like bottoms Hannah was wearing. Father Brett Anderson said Thursday that he'd been able to offer ""our thanks and our love"" to the horseback riders in a phone conversation. ""It was a chance encounter, but it did save my daughter's life,"" he said Thursday. The ordeal ended August 10 after authorities spotted DiMaggio and his teenage captive's campsite near Morehead Lake. Hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene, local sheriffs' departments said. Eventually, they got close enough, and an FBI tactical agent fatally shot DiMaggio, before whisking Hannah away. California teen rescued, her alleged abductor killed . Family fundraiser . Days after being rescued in the Idaho wilderness Hannah attended a fundraiser on Thursday for her and her family near their Southern California home. The teenager could be seen entering the Boll Weevil restaurant in Lakeside, a community of about 20,000 people located 20 miles northeast of San Diego. Hannah didn't speak publicly before entering the building, though her father later did talk to reporters. The media were invited to the fundraiser at the family-friendly restaurant, but were not allowed inside. ""This is a small community that we are a part of, and the community came together putting on this great fundraiser for Hannah and hopefully for her future and healing,"" Brett Anderson said, before he thanked local residents, family and friends, the media and law enforcement. ""This is how Lakeside rolls."" Speaking Thursday about her condition, Brett Anderson said ""she's just happy to be here."" ""Hannah sends her love,"" her father said. ""She's doing good day by day, and we'll keep moving forward from here."" One of her friends, Alyssa Haugum, said from outside Thursday's fundraiser that she was looking forward to seeing Hannah and giving her a hug. They had communicated via Facebook, she said. Haugum described Hannah, whom she knows from school and dance, as strong, funny and ""usually really bubbly."" ""It takes a lot to make her upset,"" she said of her friend. The entire ordeal was surreal and scary, as it hit so close to home, Haugum said. ""It just felt like it was untrue: One day somebody could be with you, and the next day they are missing and you don't know where they're at,"" Haugum said. Then, alluding to her friend Hannah, she added, ""But I knew she was strong. I knew she would come back."" Hannah Anderson discusses kidnapping on social media .

"(CNN) -- In days of yore, comedian Steve Martin said he used to try out jokes in clubs and adjust them based on an audience's feedback. ""Today, the process is faster. It's your brain, a button, then millions of reactions,"" he said on his website. Martin was writing Monday to explain himself after sending a tweet that, by his own admission, was ""unfortunate."" ""To those who were offended, again, I offer a deep, sincere, and humble apology without reservation,"" he wrote. ""But I feel I need to tell you the context and origin of the joke."" The storm started Friday when he invited people to ask him grammar questions on Twitter. Someone wrote, ""Is this how you spell lasonia?"" to which Martin replied: ""It depends. Are you in an African-American neighborhood or at an Italian restaurant."" ""I knew of the name Lasonia. I did not make it up, nor do I find it funny. So to me the answer was either Lasonia (with a capital), or Lasagna, depending on what you meant. That they sounded alike in this rare and particular context struck me as funny. That was the joke,"" he wrote on his website. ""When the tweet went out, I saw some negative comments and immediately deleted the tweet and apologized. I gathered the perception was that I was making fun of African American names."" The story didn't stop there. Martin said his tweet was picked up and quoted, inaccurately, by various outlets, including Salon. ""It depends. Are you in an African-American restaurant or at an Italian restaurant,"" Salon said Martin wrote, suggesting he meant to imply that African-American restaurants can't spell ""lasagna.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is predicting ""sharp disagreement"" as the Supreme Court prepares by month's end to release some of its most-talked-about rulings, including the constitutionality of the health care law championed by President Obama. Speaking to a legal conference Friday night in Washington, the oldest member of the high court offered tantalizing hints about where the court may be heading in coming days. ""The term has been more than usually taxing, some have called it the term of the century,"" she said in remarks at the American Constitution Society's annual review of the court. The ACS is a left-leaning legal advocacy and scholarship group. The court in the next two weeks will rule separately on health care, Arizona's controversial immigration crackdown law, television broadcast indecency enforcement, and a federal law making it a crime to lie about earning high military honors. Ginsburg called the court's frantic race to finish their remaining 15 or so rulings ""flood season."" ""As one may expect, many of the most controversial cases remain pending,"" she noted. ""So it is likely that the sharp disagreement rate will go up next week and the week after."" Ginsburg, among the left-leaning justices, spent several minutes talking about the health care issues, but offered no hints whatsoever on the internal deliberations, or how the court might be leaning. But she said her benchmates were fully aware of the public scrutiny the case has attracted. Ginsburg offers 'greatest hits' summary of past term . ""No contest since the court invited new briefs and arguments in 'Citizens United' (a 2009-10 campaign finance spending case) has attracted more attention -- in the press, the academy,"" she said. ""Some have described the controversy as unprecedented and they may be right if they mean the number of press conferences, prayer circles, protests, counter protests, going on outside the court while oral argument was under way inside."" She then explained-- with a dollop of humor-- the four issues the court was considering, including the main focus: the constitutionality of the individual mandate, which would require nearly all Americans to buy health insurance starting in 2014 or face a financial penalty. ""If the individual mandate, requiring the purchase of insurance or the payment of a penalty, if that is unconstitutional, must the entire act fall?"" she said, then outlining another key question. ""Or, may the mandate be chopped, like a head of broccoli, from the rest of the act?"" That brought laughter to the knowing crowd, since many critics warn giving Congress the power to force the mandate on people would be a ""slippery slope"" -- and that lawmakers could then force people to buy broccoli in the name of ensuring a healthy populace. She then made light of the initial question argued by the justices back in March. Supreme cuisine: New cookbook honors late husband of Justice Ginsburg . ""The big question inviting the answer everyone is waiting for: Do federal courts lack jurisdiction to entertain a pre-enforcement challenge to the individual mandate in light of the anti-injunction act of 1867,"" she said. ""That act prohibits any person from suing the federal government to restrain the assessment or collection of any tax."" While legally dense, the ""anti-injunction"" question was considered the least important issue taken up by the court, and one most legal analysts were sure the bench will ignore, allowing the justices to go ahead and tackle the larger, more vital constitutional questions. The final issue being debated internally is whether the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid exceeds Congress' power. Some of those watching Ginsburg's speech noted her remarks regarding the power of dissents issued by the high court, and whether she was signaling how Congress might follow up to however the health care cases are decided. ""I have spoken on more than one occasion about the utility of dissenting opinions, noting in particular that they can reach audiences outside the court and can propel legislative or executive change,"" she said. In this context, the 79-year-old justice was speaking about her much-discussed 2007 dissent in a pay discrimination claim that resulted in an Alabama woman being denied the ability to seek back wages, after alleging her fellow male supervisors were being paid more than her for years, for the same work. Congress changed the rules following that high court ruling, and President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, one of his first acts in office. The Supreme Court will next issue opinions Monday morning, but many court watchers believe the justices will wait until the week of June 25 to bring out the health care opinions, just before they recess for the summer. Ginsburg repeated what many at the court have long known when trying to speculate what the court will do, and when. ""At the Supreme Court, those who know don't talk,"" she said, smiling. ""And those who talk don't know."" Health care reform: Issues round-up .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Dozens of flights were canceled in and out of a northeastern Japanese city on Tuesday after construction workers came across an unexploded shell believed to be from World War II buried near a taxiway. Airport authorities in Sendai said they had canceled all 92 flights, national and international, scheduled to use the airport Tuesday after the discovery of the shell late Monday under an unpaved area beside the taxiway.

Sendai is still recovering and rebuilding after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands of people and caused widespread destruction across northeastern Japan in March 2011. The city is the largest in the region of Tohoku, which bore the brunt of the natural disasters.

"(CNN) -- A massive manhunt that spanned 1,000 miles ended in gunfire in the Idaho wild late Saturday afternoon -- shots that ended the life of the family friend who was suspected of abducting 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and killing her mother and brother. The teenager was rescued near Morehead Lake, Idaho, where an FBI tactical agent killed her alleged kidnapper, James DiMaggio, around 5:20 p.m (7:20 p.m. ET), authorities said. ""It's now healing time,"" Brett Anderson, Hannah's father, said in a message to CNN. Hannah Anderson had last been seen in San Diego County, California, at her cheerleading practice August 3. The bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found the next day about 45 miles east in DiMaggio's Boulevard house; lab tests were needed to identify the boy because his remains were so badly charred. That horror spurred a manhunt, which turned to central Idaho after a telling tip from a horseback rider and the discovery of DiMaggio's blue Nissan Versa in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, about 15 miles outside Cascade, Idaho. By Saturday morning, there were more than 250 law enforcement agents on site scouring 300 square miles of rough terrain. By late Saturday afternoon, they'd accomplished their first mission: finding DiMaggio and his alleged captive. The pair's campsite was first spotted from the air, then law enforcement personnel moved in on the ground, said San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore. He said that there had been a ""confrontation,"" though authorities speaking a short time later in Idaho declined to say whether there had been a shootout. However the scene unfolded, it ended with an FBI tactical agent fatally shooting the suspected murderer and kidnapper. ""Obviously we would have liked for Mr. DiMaggio to surrender and face justice in the court of law,"" Gore said. ""But that's not going to be the case."" Saga starts in California, ends in Idaho . The suspect's car was found after a man on horseback reported he had a brief conversation with two campers in the Idaho wilderness on Wednesday. The horseback rider was not aware of the manhunt at the time, but he called the Amber Alert tip line after he saw a news account that night and realized the pair matched the description of DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson, according to Ada County, Idaho, sheriff's office spokeswoman Andrea Dearden. Why more Amber alerts will be waking you up . The rider's impression was that the pair ""seemed odd,"" though he wasn't alarmed, she said. ""They did speak and exchange pleasantries. I don't think there was a lot of information exchanged,"" Dearden said. ""He left the conversation believing they were camping in the area."" The rider said the man and girl were on foot, hiking with camping gear, Dearden said. DiMaggio's car was found unoccupied Friday -- hidden by brush and its license plate removed -- spurring authorities to intensify their search in that area even further. This massive effort included law enforcement personnel from a host of federal, state and local agencies, with Dearden saying they'd ""use every single resource possible."" Still, despite the numbers, they faced a daunting task given the expansive, rugged nature of the area. Ultimately, DiMaggio was spotted and killed not far from where he left his car, according to Dearden. His alleged captive didn't appear to have suffered significant physical injuries, though she was nonetheless helicoptered from the scene to a hospital, the sheriff's spokeswoman said. ""Hannah is safe, and that was our first priority from the very beginning,"" Valley County, Idaho, Sheriff Patti Bolen said. She should be reunited Sunday morning with her father in Idaho, according to Gore. In his text to CNN, Brett Anderson admitted to feeling a range of emotions upon hearing of his daughter's rescue soon after his wife and son's death. ""I am nervous excited saddened 4 my wife and son and worried what my daughter has been through,"" he wrote. Father of missing teen pleads for daughter's release . Witness: DiMaggio had crush . A friend of Hannah Anderson on Saturday provided a clearer picture of the relationship between DiMaggio and the teen. Marissa Chavez told CNN that she was in a car with Hannah and DiMaggio a few months ago when the 40-year-old told Hannah he had a crush on her. He followed it up by saying if he was her age, he would date Hannah, Chavez said. Hannah was unnerved by the comments, but did not tell her mother because she did not want to ruin the close relationship that her parents had with DiMaggio, Chavez said. After that, however, Hannah did not want to be alone with DiMaggio, Chavez said. In an earlier episode, Chavez recalled a trip that DiMaggio and Hannah took to Hollywood. The trip was supposed to be for one week, but Hannah told Chavez that they came back after two days because DiMaggio was upset that she wasn't paying enough attention to him. ""I don't think she would have gone willingly with him at all,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- They battled on and off court last year and now Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova are locking horns at the earliest opportunity in 2014. The world no. 1 will play Sharapova on Friday for a place in the final of the Brisbane International tournament after both women won through in their quarterfinal matches on Thursday. The American was a 6-3 6-3 winner over Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova while the world no. 4 beat Kaia Kanepi of Estonia in three sets. Williams won both the French and U.S. Open titles last year, but also made headlines for an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in June where she made some unflattering remarks about an unnamed player widely assumed to be Sharapova, calling her ""boring"" and criticizing her choice of boyfriend (Grigor Dimitrov). Sharapova responded saying Williams should concentrate on tennis rather than taking sideswipes at the personal lives of her opponents. Williams has won 14 of her 16 encounters against Sharapova and hasn't lost to the Russian in almost a decade. On Thursday, Williams recalled the moment the tide turned at the semifinals of the Australian Open in 2005 -- a match she won 8-6 in the third set after saving three match points. ""I remember a forehand inside out,"" Williams said. ""I was down match point and I hit this winner and I didn't even blink. ""I hit the a winner and walked right to the other side and was ready for the next return as if it was just a 30-15 point."" Sharapova said her memory of the point was a little more sketchy and stressed the importance of looking forward. ""2005? Oh, my God, I can't go back that far,"" Sharapova said. ""I don't have too much time to look back at '04. I have a lot of things going on in my life,"" Sharapova said. ""Some of the matches were a bit closer than others. When you go out on the court in a new time, you can't really rely on everything that happened in the past. You've got to start from scratch from the first point. ""Of course I know I've tried and I didn't succeed in the last many times that I've played her, but I'm setting up an opportunity to go out there and try to change that, and I'm going to try to do that."" Whatever the outcome of Friday's match, both women will be looking to improve their recent form at the upcoming Australian Open which gets underway on January 13. Williams, a five-time champion, last triumphed in Melbourne in 2010 while Sharapova's solitary success came in 2008. Read more: Federer breezes through in Brisbane .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal may top the English Premier League table going into 2014, but Jose Mourinho leads the way when it comes to post-match performances. After a hard-fought 2-1 win that kept his Chelsea team in touch with Arsenal and Manchester City ahead of the EPL's New Year's Day program, Mourinho sought to deflect any possible criticism of his players with a blustering counter-attack. When questioned about key incidents in Sunday's match, which continued the tense clashes between the two teams in recent years, the Portuguese manager accused Luis Suarez of ""an acrobatic swimming pool jump"" and going down ""like somebody shot him."" This was after Chelsea's match-winner Samuel Eto'o had clearly body-checked the 19-goal striker off the ball inside his own penalty area while Cesar Azpilicueta cleared the ball. ""Suarez lost a duel with Azpilicueta ... and now he's doing an acrobatic swimming pool jump to try to get the penalty, because he's so clever because he's in the area where the Liverpool supporters are behind,"" Mourinho insisted at his press conference. ""But (referee Howard) Webb is 10 meters away. And I think the only mistake Webb did was not to give him a yellow card."" Suarez has a reputation of going to ground too easily, but this season the Uruguayan has been a reformed man -- being named interim captain by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers -- following last season's eight-match ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. ""The player is amazing,"" acknowledged Mourinho, who has yet to suffer a home league defeat in his two spells at Stamford Bridge. ""He does everything to win and Brendan is doing a fantastic job on him because he's changed. There's no doubt that he's changed. ""But when the situation is like this and you are losing comes the nature of the player, the wild nature of the player or the cultural nature of the player. ""Culturally people from that area (South America), they like it. It's not also that area. There's a corner in Europe where I belong to, that they also like diving."" Rodgers, meanwhile, was aggrieved that Eto'o was still on the pitch following a high tackle on Jordan Henderson that provided the free-kick for Martin Skrtel's early opening goal -- the defender pounced from close range after Ivanovic tussled with Suarez. Eden Hazard leveled with a superb curling effort, and Eto'o poked in a 34th-minute winner from Oscar's low cross. ""He should've been sent off,"" Rodgers said of the Cameroon striker. ""I know we scored from it, but that was a wild challenge, where he's raked down his knee and down his shin and didn't even get a yellow card. ""Luis will always provoke a challenge from defenders, that's why he's world-class. What he probably doesn't expect is to provoke a challenge from someone who's not involved in the contact. ""He's running to challenge Azpilicueta and Eto'o is streetwise, he's cute, he blocks him. On another day you could give that as a penalty, because it's obstruction in the area."" Rodgers was measured in his comments after being charged by the English Football Association for criticizing match officials following Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Manchester City on Thursday. His team topped the table last weekend, but a second straight reverse left the Reds in fifth place -- six points behind Arsenal, and four adrift of third-placed Chelsea. The team leading going into the new year has won the title for seven of the past nine years, though Arsenal was one of the exceptions in 2007-08, dropping back to third. The London side was missing record signing Mesut Ozil and top scorer Aaron Ramsey for Sunday's trip to in-form Newcastle, but battled to a vital 1-0 victory thanks to Olivier Giroud's eighth league goal this season. The France striker glanced in Theo Walcott's 65th-minute free-kick to inflict Newcastle's first league defeat since October. ""There is something in the team that is special on the mental front,"" said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. ""We have many times been questioned, but we have shown that at West Ham, where we were 1-0 down, we have shown that again today, where we were a bit backs-to-the-wall in the last 15 minutes. ""Last year in this period, we were out of the championship race, but in 2013, we have been quite consistent."" Arsenal's win allowed London rival Tottenham to move up to seventh place above Newcastle with a 3-0 win at home to 12th-placed Stoke, as Spain striker Roberto Soldado netted a penalty before Belgium midfielder Mousa Dembele and England winger Aaron Lennon added the others. Everton climbed above Merseyside rival Liverpool into fourth with a 2-1 win at home to ninth-placed Southampton, as on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku struck the 74th-minute winner -- the Belgium international's ninth in the league this season.","Third-placed Chelsea two points behind Arsenal after beating Liverpool 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- Basketball star Dennis Rodman seemed to get pretty upset Tuesday when asked whether he should be visiting North Korea with a group of former NBA players as part of his ""basketball diplomacy"" efforts. In the exclusive interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day,"" Rodman supported his controversial trip and called the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, a ""friend"" who he loves. In case you missed it, here are the top five most amazing moments from his interview with Cuomo: . When Rodman explained why he's visiting North Korea: ""It's not a good idea -- the one thing that we're doing -- it's a great idea for the world, for the world. And people always come down on the things I do, and it's weird."" When Rodman compared his trip to the Olympics: ""No one ever, ever asked anyone in the world why we have Olympics. And we have struggles around the world, in all the countries around the world. But when the Olympics come around there's no problems -- it's all about the game. People love to do one thing: sports."" When Rodman semed to imply that Kenneth Bae, an American citizen who has been sentenced to 15 years hard labor in North Korea, had done something wrong: ""Kenneth Bae did one thing. If you understand what Kenneth Bae did -- do you understand what he did in this country?"" (Cuomo asks Rodman to specify exactly what Bae did.) ""You tell me, why is he held captive?"" (The North Korean regime says Bae was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. His mother told CNN in October that Bae has a profound love for the country and its people, and any offense he caused was not intentional.) When Rodman said he was ready to take abuse from Americans: ""You're the guy behind the mic right now. We're the guys here doing one thing. We have to go back to America and take the abuse. Do you have to take the abuse that we're goning to take? Do you, sir? Are you going to take the abuse? We're going to get it."" When Rodman cut Cuomo off to tell him he doesn't 'give a rat's ass' what he thinks: ""You know, you've got 10 guys here, 10 guys here, they've left their families, they've left their damn families, to help this country, in a sports venture. That's 10 guys, all these guys here, do anyone understand that?"" (Cuomo tells Rodman he understands and thanks the group for the cultural exchange but Rodman cuts him off.) ""I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think. I'm saying to you, look at these guys here, look at them. ... They dared to do one thing, they came here."" Rodman's visit comes just weeks after North Korea announced it had executed Kim's once-powerful uncle. Rodman and the former NBA players who have joined him are playing a friendly match against North Korea's basketball team on Wednesday, when Kim is believed to turn 31. Rodman struck up the unlikely relationship with Kim when he traveled to North Korea for the first time in February. He has called Kim a ""very good guy"" and ""a friend for life"" despite international condemnation of the country's human rights record.","Dennis Rodman becomes angry while being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo .

"(CNN) -- From Texas to Tennessee, there's not much relief in sight for people smacked by a frigid winter storm that killed at least four, shut down schools, backed up interstates and left hundreds of thousands without power. The National Weather Service predicted more sleet and subfreezing temperatures in Dallas and Memphis until Sunday and in Little Rock, Arkansas, until Monday. Other parts of the country braced for bad weather. The storm moved east Friday night, with snow expected to accumulate across the central Appalachians through central New England into early Saturday morning. Snow or sleet was expected to hit Washington, D.C., on Sunday. Dallas/Fort Worth took the hardest hit. It was colder in the Big D (26 degrees) than in Anchorage, Alaska (34 degrees), prompting the cancellation of the Dallas Marathon and spurring Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to cancel almost 700 flights, about 80% of those scheduled. About 200,000 customers lost electricity, and a local official urged people to offer shelter to those without power. Southbound Interstate 35 was shut down and traffic backed up for six miles, CNN affiliate WFAA in Dallas reported. The temperature swings were startling. Hot Springs, Arkansas, experienced a record high of 75 on Wednesday. By Friday morning, the city was in the middle of an ice storm. The storm caught a lot of Texans by surprise. Debra Knight, a CNN iReporter, said she ran her defroster 20 minutes but couldn't get rid of the thick layer of ice on top of her car in Dallas. ""This is Texas. We don't have snow tools!"" said her husband, Bobby. Storm deaths . In some cases, the weather has been deadly. In Texas, a passenger was killed Thursday in Hockley County when a vehicle lost control and crashed into another car, Sgt. Bryan Witt of the Texas Department of Public Safety said. An Arkansas man was killed late Thursday when a tree fell on his camper in Pope County, Tommy Jackson, an Arkansas Department of Emergency Management spokesman, said Friday. Jackson said the death was related to the weather but couldn't provide details about the weather at the time. Rain and freezing rain were reported in the area Thursday night. Highway Patrol officials in Oklahoma blamed at least one death, in Muskogee, on the weather. The agency initially said weather had caused another death, that of a 24-year-old man in Owasso, but later said this fatality ""is still under investigation and may not be winter storm related."" No snow had fallen in New Mexico, but drivers dealt with snow and ice. One person died in a semi crash near Clines Corners. About 116 storm-related injuries have been reported in Oklahoma, including 48 falls, the state health department said. When not causing harm, the storm struck fear in residents. In Dallas, iReporter Earl Wallace IV said he when he heard a loud crack and a rush of wind and ran out to find a large tree had fallen on two nearby homes. ""One of the homeowners emerged crying and talking on the phone,"" said the 32-year-old creative director. ""The tree had crashed down into her dining room. I felt nervous, shocked and scared for the families inside."" Two homes were damaged -- one with a giant hole in the roof -- but no one was injured. WFAA in Dallas reported that a portion of the Pier 121 Marina in Lewisville collapsed on top of boats. Two people were taken to hospitals when a carport collapsed in Fort Worth. Getting ready . In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas and Water has 426,000 customers and is preparing for the worst. As of early Friday afternoon, about 5,000 customers were without power. ""MLGW employees have been monitoring this winter storm situation, and we have all of our resources in place should the winter weather hit Memphis and Shelby County,"" said Jerry Collins Jr., the company's president and CEO. ""If indeed a significant storm blankets our city, we are ready to respond."" Memphis called off the annual St. Jude Memphis Marathon, which was scheduled for Saturday. The ice also makes travel messy. Road crews in Memphis are ready to throw down 4,000 tons of sand to give drivers traction, CNN affiliate WMC reported. The governors of Tennessee and Arkansas declared states of emergency ahead of the worst of the storm. ""The most unsettling aspect about Arkansas' weather for most of us is its looming uncertainty,"" Gov. Mike Beebe said. ""During severe weather season, we know when conditions are ripe for tornadoes but never exactly where and when they could strike. In winter, that uncertainty takes a different form but can still create widespread anxiety,"" he said. ""Often, only a few degrees above or below the freezing mark can make the difference between a cold rain, a blanket of snow, an ice storm or a mixture of all of the above."" In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, roads were passable overnight, but it was a fine line as temperatures slipped below freezing. The slushy mess slowly turned into crunchy, bumpy ice. Police urged caution for anyone on the road and reported 21 major car accidents and 32 minor ones Friday. According to energy provider Oncor, more than 200,000 customers were without power in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area as of Friday morning. This is the largest concentration of outages, with scattered outages elsewhere in the state. Nearly 30,000 were without power in Arkansas, energy companies reported. The weather brought traffic at Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport almost to a standstill. Hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed, prompting Southwest Airlines and American Airlines to urge travelers to consider rebooking their flights. A dark cloud over Dallas events . The National Weather Service predicts a wintry mix of precipitation through Sunday. That forecast prompted the cancellation of a downtown Dallas holiday parade scheduled for Saturday for the first time in 26 years. The city also called off its annual marathon slated for Sunday and the accompanying Health & Fitness Expo scheduled for Friday and Saturday. ""We regret that the race will not go on as planned, but are confident this decision is in the best interest of our runners, volunteers, spectators and the general public,"" A Dallas Marathon statement said. While the focus Friday was on the ice storm stretching from Dallas to Memphis, Mother Nature looked ready to throw another punch. A wintry mix was forecast for Washington beginning about noon Sunday. The National Weather Service said it has the potential to be an ice storm from late Sunday afternoon through the evening hours, but temperatures are expected to rise above freezing by rush hour Monday. A new storm entered the West, bringing snow to the Pacific Coast on Friday. The storm brought significant snowfall to Portland, Oregon, and there is a chance for rare snow in Las Vegas on Saturday. This storm will bring another round of wintry weather to the East by late in the weekend.

"London (CNN) -- UK officers have identified 38 ""people of interest"" in connection with the disappearance six years ago in Portugal of British toddler Madeleine McCann, the Metropolitan Police said Thursday. McCann disappeared while her family was on vacation on the Algarve coast in 2007.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Jyoti is the Hindi word for light. It's something Pranav Mehta has never had to live without. And he is lucky. Near where he lives in Gujarat, one of the most prosperous states in India, thousands of rural villages lack electricity or struggle with an intermittent supply at best. Massive solar satellites would beam power back to ground-based receivers on Earth. ""We need to empower these villages, and for empowerment, energy is a must,"" Mehta said. ""Rural India is suffering a lot because of a lack of energy."" By 2030, India's Planning Commission estimates that the country will have to generate at least 700,000 megawatts of additional power to meet the demands of its expanding economy and growing population. Much of that electricity will come from coal-fired power plants, like the $4 billion so-called ultra mega complex scheduled to be built south of Tunda Wand, a tiny village near the Gulf of Kutch, an inlet of the Arabian Sea on India's west coast. Dozens of other such projects are already or soon will be under way. Yet Mehta has another solution for India's chronic electricity shortage, one that does not involve power plants on the ground but instead massive sun-gathering satellites in geosynchronous orbits 22,000 miles in the sky. The satellites would electromagnetically beam gigawatts of solar energy back to ground-based receivers, where it would then be converted to electricity and transferred to power grids. And because in high Earth orbit, satellites are unaffected by the earth's shadow virtually 365 days a year, the floating power plants could provide round-the-clock clean, renewable electricity. ""This will be kind of a leap frog action instead of just crawling,"" said Mehta, who is the director of India operations for Space Island Group, a California-based company working to develop solar satellites. ""It is a win-win situation."" American scientist Peter Glaser introduced the idea of space solar power in 1968. NASA and the United States Department of Energy studied the concept throughout the 1970s, concluding that although the technology was feasible, the price of putting it all together and sending it to outer space was not. ""The estimated cost of all of the infrastructure to build them in space was about $1 trillion,"" said John Mankins, a former NASA technologist and president of the Space Power Association. ""It was an unimaginable amount of money."" NASA revisited space solar power with a so-called ""Fresh Look"" study in the mid-90s but the research lost momentum when the space agency decided it did not want to further pursue the technology, Mankins told CNN. By around 2002 the project was indefinitely shelved -- or so it seemed. ""The conditions are ripe for something to happen on space solar power,"" said Charles Miller, a director of the Space Frontier Foundation, a group promoting public access to space. ""The environment is perfect for a new start."" Skyrocketing oil prices, a heightened awareness of climate change and worries about natural resource depletion have recently prompted a renewed interest in beaming extraterrestrial energy back to Earth, Miller explained. And so has a 2007 report released by the Pentagon's National Security Space Office, encouraging the U.S. government to spearhead the development of space power systems. ""A single kilometer-wide band of geosynchronous Earth orbit experiences enough solar flux in one year to nearly equal the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on Earth today,"" the report said. The study also concluded that solar energy from satellites could provide power for global U.S. military operations and deliver energy to disaster areas and developing nations. ""The country that takes the lead on space solar power will be the energy-exporting country for the entire planet for the next few hundred years,"" Miller said. Russia, China, the European Union and India, according to the Pentagon report, are interested in the concept. And Japan, which has been pouring millions of dollars into space power studies for decades, is working toward testing a small-scale demonstration in the near future. But a number of obstacles still remain before solar satellites actually get off the ground, said Jeff Keuter, president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a Washington-based research organization. ""Like any activity in space, there are enormous engineering challenges,"" he said. One major barrier is a lack of cheap and reliable access to space, a necessity for launching hundreds of components to build what will be miles-long platforms. Developing robotic technology to piece the structures together high above Earth will also be a challenge. Then there is the issue of finding someone to foot what will be at least a billion-dollar bill. ""It will take a great deal of effort, a great deal of thought and unfortunately a great deal of money,"" Keutersaid. ""But it is certainly possible."" And Miller, of the Space Frontier Foundation, said he thinks it will be possible in the next 10 years. ""We could see the first operational power satellite in about the 2020 time frame if we act now,"" he said. ........................... Do you think beaming solar power down from space is feasible?

"(CNN) -- The World Bank's most recent report that ranks economies for ease of doing business has found New Zealand to be the easiest place to start a small and medium-sized enterprise. The rankings look at 185 economies around the world. In measuring how easy it is to start a limited liability company, the report looks at how many steps are officially required or commonly done by entrepreneurs, as well as how many days it takes to go through those procedures. The report also factors in the cost and the minimum capital required, with 0% of income per capita being best. In New Zealand, it takes only one step and one day, the ideal number, to incorporate a company. Someone who wants to open a business just has to apply for registration online. According to the report, the process costs 163.55 New Zealand dollars (US$129) and does not have a minimum capital requirement. By contrast, the U.S. ranks 13, needing six steps in order to start a business with no minimum capital. The report based the U.S. statistics on requirements in New York City, as it used the largest business city of each country it studied.","The World Bank's annual ""Doing Business"" report ranks countries and territories for how easy it is to run a company there .

"(CNN) -- Qatari football fans had a tantalizing glimpse into the future as some of the best players in world strutted their stuff in a special friendly match in Doha Thursday night. Cristiano Ronaldo for Real Madrid and Paris Saint Germain's Zlatan Ibrahimovic topped the bill for a prestige friendly, which Real won 1-0. The pair had last locked horns in Portugal and Sweden's 2014 World Cup playoff match last November where Ronaldo's brilliance proved the difference over the two legs. Qatar has won the right to host the 2022 finals and although Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic are unlikely to have extended their careers to play in that World Cup, similar quality is sure to be on view. What time of the year the competition will take place is the big question that has proved so controversial, with FIFA examining the possibility of switching from the traditional summer slot to the European winter. Conditions for Thursday's friendly in front of a capacity crowd at the Khalifa International Stadium were near perfect for football, with a cooling light drizzle. Ideal for Ronaldo and his like, but just down the road fellow superstar Rafael Nadal was kept waiting for his quarterfinal match in the Qatar Open tennis against Ernests Gulbis, before winning in straight sets. Temperatures during the summer in Qatar can sometimes reach 50 degrees C, which is perplexing football's administrators as well as local organizers, who have promised air-conditioned stadiums should the original dates be kept in the footballing calendar. Real, who resume competition in Spain's La Liga at the weekend, fielded a mixture of established first teamers like Ronaldo, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos with some fringe players and youngsters. It was two of them that combined to score the only goal of the match in the 19th minute as Alvaro Morata produced a clever defense-splitting pass for young striker Jese to convert past PSG goakeeper Salvatore Sirigu. Ibrahimovic, who scored 47 goals in 58 games in 2013, showed his quality as French champions PSG looked to equalize. He twice set up Edinson Cavani, but the Uruguay striker wasted both opportunities. Ibrahimovic might have got on the scoresheet after the break but he headed over, the first of a number of chances for PSG, who had the better of the play. Ronaldo also gave some thrilling glimpses of the quality which could earn him FIFA World Player of the Year accolade later this month, but failed to increase Real's slender lead. At the final whistle Real's coach Carlo Ancelotti shook hands with the man who replaced him at PSG, Laurent Blanc and both looked satisfied with a run-out for their teams ahead of weekend competitive action. PSG are Qatari-owned and will likely repeat the exercise next year with reports suggesting Real are slated again as part of the compensation they paid the Parisian club for acquiring Ancelotti.","Real Madrid beat Paris Saint Germain 1-0 in friendly in Qatar .

"(CNN) -- Jeanne Thomas was sitting at her desk at work when she decided to check the security camera that she installed in her home. The Thomas home had been burglarized before, so she installed a monitoring device where she can watch a live video feed of the camera in her home. Steven Morales, 19, was arrested in the invasion of a Boynton Beach, Florida, home. When Thomas decided to pull up the feed of her house Wednesday morning, she couldn't believe what she saw. There was someone inside her home, someone she didn't know. Thomas picked up the phone and called 911. ""I'm watching my home on live monitor, and there is a black man in my house, and he is robbing it,"" she told the dispatcher. The woman on the other end of the call asked Thomas where she was, and Thomas replied, ""I'm in Fort Lauderdale, at my work."" Thomas' home is in Boynton Beach, Florida, more than 20 miles away, yet she was watching over the Internet as two men walked through her home, picking up items.  Watch the video from Thomas' home » . Police later arrested Curtis Williams, 20, and Steven Morales, 19. According to the Boynton Beach Police, Williams and Morales entered the house through a pet door. As the 911 dispatcher was calling police to the scene, Thomas stayed on the line, giving a play-by-play of what she was seeing. ""He's in my house. I am seeing him walk around my house. He's in my bedroom right now,"" she said. The bedroom cannot be seen in the video, but the door from the living room into the bedroom is visible. Thomas watched as the men wandered through her home, taking valuables such as her TV and Wii gaming console. ""This is unbelievable,"" she told the 911 dispatcher. ""The cat is freaking out. The dogs are hiding."" One of the burglars took a bag of shredded cheese from the refrigerator and could be seen on the video stuffing it in his mouth. None of them noticed the small camera that resembles an air freshener. ""They walked right up to it and didn't know what it was,"" Thomas said later. A few minutes after Thomas called 911, the video shows police officers entering the home. According to the police report, ""Williams and Morales had placed the victim's 37 inch flat screen TV, a safe, gaming machine with several misc. games (total value approx. $3000) on the victim's bed."" Williams and Morales told police that two other people, not seen on video, were also involved in the incident. All four suspects were arrested and charged with burglary of a dwelling and attempted grand theft. Thomas' husband thought she was nuts for spending $250 on the webcam system, telling her she would never catch anyone. But to her, it now seems like a smart investment. Thomas hopes it will be a lesson for burglars. ""You never know who is watching you,"" she said.","At work in Fort Lauderdale, woman checked on home and saw unknown men .

"(CNN) -- You've probably heard by now about the Afropolitans and the Afropreneurs -- but what about the Africapitalists? It's the term created by Nigerian entrepreneur Tony Elumelu, one of Africa's most successful businessmen, to describe what he believes holds the key to the continent's future well-being. According to Elumelu, Africapitalism is the economic philosophy ""that the African private sector has the power to transform the continent through long-term investments, creating both economic prosperity and social wealth."" Elumelu champions the idea that long-term focus on key sectors such as infrastructure and power does not only offer high returns but, in the process, can also help Africa deal with pressing problems such as unemployment and food security. ""The information people have about Africa in America and the western world is one of aid, one of squalor, one of poverty, one of religious crisis,"" says Elumelu, who first found success after turning a struggling Nigerian bank into a global financial institution. ""They need to begin to see that Africa is a continent of economic opportunities -- a lot of potential and the returns on investment in Africa is huge."" Read this: Africa's mega projects . Backing his words with actions, Elumelu, the former chief executive of the United Bank for Africa, who went on to create investment company Heirs Holdings in 2010, has pledged $2.5 billion to U.S. President Barack Obama's ""Power Africa"" initiative -- a campaign aiming to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. CNN's African Voices spoke to Elumelu about Africapitalism, doing business in Africa and his goals for the future. An excerpt of the interview follows. CNN: What is Africapitalism and how does it work? Tony Elumelu: From interacting with customers, with communities, with local governments, state governments and national governments, I started to see a pattern that indeed we can as a private sector help to develop Africa in a manner that's truly sustainable. I also, as a good student of economic history, have observed the development of the African continent and come to realize that despite all the aid inflows into Africa and despite our sovereign government commitment to develop in the continent, not much was achieved. But ... if we can mobilize the African private sector and non-African private sector operating in Africa to think long-term, to invest long-term in Africa in key sectors, then we might end up creating economic wealth, economic prosperity and social wealth. That is Africapitalism. CNN: Which areas does the private sector in Africa focus on? TE: The private sector in Africa was largely dependent on government patronage, government contracts. But today, it has changed significantly. You have the private sector in Africa today that is adding real value to the economy through engagements in payment systems; through engagement in key infrastructure projects; through engagement in manufacturing and processing of raw materials in Africa and exporting this within the continent. Read this: Ghana plans $10 billion tech city . So it's a significant shift from where the private sector was before to where it is today and we're beginning to see a new crop of private sector people in Africa who believe under the sun that they have a role to play in the development of the continent. CNN: Why did Heirs Holding decided to commit $2.5 billion to the ""Power Africa"" initiative? TE: Because we understand as Africapitalists the importance of power, access to electricity, in unleashing the economic potential of Africa. Because of that, we felt since we preach that the private sector should do long-term investment in Africa in key sectors, there is no sector at this point in time to us that is as strategic as power sector in dealing with the issue of economic empowerment, democratization of economic prosperity across the continent than power. CNN: Looking ahead, what do you think is going to be the most important source of power? TE: Africa is coming from a deficit position -- only 20% of 1.2 billion people have access to electricity. So we need to think of the kind of projects that will help us create the quantum leap we need in power. And I think that that is what should guide the options that we take. Read this: Can Africa unlock solar potential? So for me, I believe that we need five years of sustained, massive billion dollar investments (in the) power sector in Africa before we come to the level where we need to discriminate, is it this kind of power or that type of power? But let there be light first in Africa. CNN: What are your goals for the future? TE: My goals for the future are twofold -- one is personal and two is about the continent. For my personal goal I would like to continue to impact my team. Because you get to a certain level where you wake up in the morning not necessarily because you want to earn a living -- you wake up in the morning I think about impact, about legacies, what impact am I going to leave behind? And so I decide to look at the African continent and I tell myself this is a continent that is about to explode but lacks certain vital ingredients. And so what role can I play in making sure that some of those challenges are addressed in my lifetime, so that my children will not as a kind of question I asked of my parents and grandparents, where were they when the war started? So that's important to me. And that is why we invest in power. Not just because I want to make more money, which is good, but because we touch lives significantly making that money.","Nigerian entrepreneur Tony Elumelu is pioneering the concept of Africapitalism .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine a more bizarre juxtaposition than Dennis Rodman and the North Korean regime. We can't look away and, surely, that's part of the plan. Rodman, the fantastically strange former basketball player, loves the spotlight and he knows how to draw our attention. He can be outrageously entertaining. Usually, it's all relatively harmless and inconsequential. But Rodman's North Korean visits and his avowed friendship with Kim Jong Un, the country's dictator -- ""I love the guy,"" he has said repeatedly -- have placed him in the middle of something deadly serious. Rodman's trips to North Korea, ruled by the world's more repressive regime, bring up a moral controversy over one of the most fundamental questions faced by society, by countries, and by each human being: . What is our responsibility in the face of terrible injustice and great suffering? The dilemma was framed succinctly in biblical times: Are we our brother's keepers? In some respects, Rodman's interaction with Kim and his regime overlap with the issues we must wrestle with when we hear about the killing in Syria, the turmoil in the Central African Republic, even the plight of the homeless in the U.S. Simply -- what, if anything, are we going to do about it? Rodman has come under withering criticism for befriending the young dictator. A member of Congress likened the visits to sitting down to lunch with Adolf Hitler. For his most recent visit Rodman has organized an exhibition basketball game with former NBA players to celebrate Kim's birthday. Critics say he has helped legitimize, and thus strengthen, the regime. Rodman sang ""Happy Birthday"" and bowed to North Korea's absolute ruler, behavior that no doubt will serve Kim's massive propaganda at home. Even if he would rather ignore it, Rodman rightly faces sharp questions because of the sheer brutality of the regime with which he is interacting; because Kim is a big fan of his. Because he might, just might, be able to make even a small positive difference. It's hard to know precisely what Rodman's views are on the issue of his responsibility to intercede on behalf of Kim's victims. The pressure of reflecting on the matter, of facing questions about his views and his intentions, is visibly getting to him. On Tuesday, when CNN's Chris Cuomo asked him if he planned to bring up with his North Korean hosts the case of Kenneth Bae -- an American imprisoned without charges for more than a year by the North Korean regime -- he became practically incoherent with anger, declaring, cigar in hand, that he didn't ""give a rat's ass"" what Cuomo thought. His suggestion that Bae is guilty of some unspecified crime makes his behavior even more reprehensible. Bae's family was dismayed. In a press release, his sister said, ""Rodman could do a lot of good ... but instead he has decided to hurl outrageous accusations at my brother."" By all appearances, Rodman views his unique opportunity to meet with the North Korean leader, the result of Kim's passion for basketball, as little more than a chance to bask in the warm limelight that has become more elusive with the passage of time. The complicated problems are not his concern, despite his suggestion that basketball might ""open the door a little bit."" With him, it's about hedonism and fame. That's his philosophy. Rodman says he has no interest in the politics of North Korea. ""Whatever (Kim) does political-wise, that's not my job. I'm just an athlete."" Saying you don't like politics, as so many do, is a transparent excuse for inaction, for ignoring our responsibilities as human beings. For his part, Rodman has done much worse than completely ignoring the suffering of the North Korean people. If he had kept quiet, we might have given him the benefit of the doubt and chalked it all up to sports diplomacy, an elusive effort to thaw tensions. But Rodman has gone out of his way to praise the ruler of an imprisoned, starving nation. Not only has he showered praise on Kim, but he has extended it to his father and grandfather, the previous dictators who handed the country down as if it were a private family heirloom. ""They were great leaders,"" he said, adding that he is not the only one who loves the young Kim. ""His country likes him -- not like him, love him."" That's because, as Rodman explains, ""the guy's really awesome."" There is no such thing as a neutral stance on a situation like North Korea's. Kim inherited a regime whose brutality defies belief. More than 150,000 people are imprisoned in a network of gulags -- camps where entire families, generations of individuals deemed a threat to Kim's authority, are kept in horrific conditions. Famines have plagued the nation, killing hundreds of thousands, as resources are diverted toward the military, including the buildup of a nuclear arsenal. Kim has threatened his neighbors (and the U.S.) with nuclear war and has detonated nuclear devices as recently as last year. We all have a responsibility to speak up, to do what we can when weak people are so clearly victimized. For most of us, there are limited opportunities to help, and there are many issues competing for attention. Rodman, on the other hand, has a unique chance to at least try to make a difference. Choosing to do nothing when you may have the ability to help is an even greater moral failing than ignoring a crisis when it is more difficult to intercede on behalf of the powerless. Perhaps Dennis Rodman will have a moment of lucidity and do something meaningful. Perhaps he will surprise us. For now, behind his permanent sunglasses and shining lip rings, he is offering only weird entertainment, and an unintentional reminder that human beings have larger responsibilities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","People are captivated by the spectacle of Dennis Rodman's trip to Korea .

"(CNN) -- The new year emerges from the depths of winter. In many countries bells ring out at midnight on New Year's Eve -- a sound that the writer Charles Lamb described nearly 200 years ago as the most regretful sound he ever heard, reminding him of everything he had suffered or neglected in the past 12 months. More recently, though, fireworks have usually taken over this role in providing a fanfare for the coming year all over the world, from Times Square to the beaches of Rio, to hamlets deep in the English countryside. This shift from peals of bells to spectacular explosions is suggestive. We live now in a world that is turning its back on the old traditions and the old skills and replacing them with something far bigger and much louder, far more brash and much more expensive; a reminder too of technology and military might. My new book, ""The Seasons,"" investigates how we are becoming cut off from the rhythm of the natural world and the ways in which the annual cycle has been celebrated for centuries. In the past, the customs and rituals that marked the passing of the year linked society and culture to the environment, and in doing so reflected their values of community and ecology. Today, however, we are witnessing the eradication of the seasons with all-year produce and the replacement of local festivities with mass celebrations of a tiny handful of uniform events, turning contemporary society into an identikit culture with a standardized marketplace. My answer is not only that we should revive forgotten customs, but that we can also establish new traditions that properly reflect today's values and ambitions. In fact, the celebration of the new year is an excellent example of how quickly major festivals can be established. Just as many old English festivals have their roots in the classical Mediterranean culture of ancient Greece and Rome, so much of the English-speaking world still follows customs that originated in northeast Atlantic Britain and Ireland 200 or 300 years ago, adapting these traditions to their own climate and culture. The practice of kissing and singing to welcome in the new year was noted in England by the American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1856, but there are in fact very few English traditions for New Year's Eve and Day -- not least because until 1752 the new year in England was celebrated March 25. But in Scotland the practice was to begin the New Year on January 1 with ""Hogmanay,"" which the Scots celebrate with new year customs such as ""first-footing."" New year celebrations in the English-speaking world are consequently cosmopolitan affairs, mixing Scottish festivities with other European traditions. Setting the tone . The month of ""January,"" deriving from the Latin ""janua"" meaning ""door,"" is a transitional time between the old and new, the past and the future. For centuries, January was a key time for setting one's house in order and making plans for the forthcoming year. Eat a hen in January, for instance, if you wish to live through the year; observe the weather on January 12, to get a taste of the weather for the next 12 months; and note that activities undertaken on January 1 set the tone of work for the rest of the year -- an early version of new year resolutions. Settle down to some seasonal fare, from nutmeg cakes with currant eyes known as ""Pop Ladies"" to the wassail cup, a spiced drink shared among family and friends. And there's no need to take Christmas decorations down on the Twelfth Day (January 6) -- that became common practice in the nineteenth century to get everyone back to work. Before then, it was felt that during the bleakest months of the year in the northern hemisphere there was good reason to keep one's house decorated. So the holly and the ivy, bay leaves, and mistletoe, stayed up until Candlemas on February 2, a tradition that has survived in parts of Canada. Easter the joker in the pack . The new year also presents a more profound opportunity to reclaim our individuality and our humanity. As we look forward to the coming year, we cannot but be reminded that the calendar of every year is different: days and dates shift (will you have a weekend birthday this year?), leap days and leap years can disrupt the best-laid plans, and Easter is ever the amiable joker-in-the-pack. The hair-raisingly complicated calculation of Easter, based on both the spring solstice and the lunar cycle, is currently computed by Catholic astronomers using a 14-step algorithm. Even so, minor variations in the Earth's orbit mean that Easter cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy. It is a humbling reminder of the limits of human control -- and also wonderfully appropriate that such unpredictability can still structure everything from university terms to television schedules, let alone family customs in making and hiding Easter eggs. Quirky and changeable the year may be, but then so are we -- let's celebrate that. ""The Seasons: An Elegy for the Passing of the Year,"" by Nick Groom is published by Atlantic Books .

For in an unexpected move, the world governing body extended the deadline for national team coaches and captains, as well as participating journalists, to vote for their top three players of 2013. The initial date had been last Friday, just hours after the first legs of the European play-offs had ended, but the closing date to vote for this year's Ballon d'Or winner is now November 29. The reason given for the delay has been the 'low turnout of votes' so far. With Lionel Messi, who has won the last four crowns, out injured, Ronaldo will never have a better chance to impress a panel for an award where form at voting time often counts as much as previous exploits in the year. Fresh from his stunning hat-trick which fired Portugal to the World Cup when eliminating Sweden 4-2 on aggregate (with Ronaldo scoring all his nation's goals in the tie), the Real Madrid star may begin to feel that his recent row with FIFA is beginning to turn his way. Last month, Blatter was involved in an extraordinary impersonation of the Portuguese star while addressing the famous Oxford Union in England, during which he claimed Ronaldo spent ""a lot more at the hairdresser's"" than his Barcelona rival Messi. Ronaldo swiftly hit back, writing on his Facebook page how the video showed ""the respect and consideration that FIFA has for me, my club and my country. Much is explained now."" On Tuesday night, Blatter -- who has been watching his words carefully since -- was effusive in his praise for the former Manchester United player's match-winning display in Sweden. ""Fantastic performance by @Cristiano,"" the Swiss tweeted. Hours later, it was announced that the voting had been extended, meaning Ronaldo's stunning Solna display can now be taken into account. Quite what France international Franck Ribery makes of it all is anyone's guess, with the Bayern Munich star having been tipped to win the award when voting was thought to have ended last week. He is now behind the Portuguese in the running according to widespread opinion, as is Messi -- with the Argentinian seemingly a victim of his own staggeringly high performances of recent years. Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazilian Neymar are outsiders to win the award, with FIFA having named a 23-man list of players to be considered for the prize in October. The three-man shortlist for the award will be announced next month, with the winner of the 2013 Ballon d'Or set to be unveiled at an awards ceremony in Zurich in January. In a separate development, FIFA announced on Wednesday that ""fair working conditions must be introduced quickly, consistently and on a sustained basis in Qatar,"" the 2022 World Cup host nation. The statement followed a meeting in Zurich between Blatter and the International Trade Union Confederation, and came shortly after an Amnesty International report suggested that worker abuse is rife in Qatar's construction sector. In response to Amnesty's allegations, the director of the Human Rights Department at Qatar's Foreign Ministry said laws are in place to protect workers from mistreatment.","FIFA surprisingly extend voting for Ballon d'Or by two weeks .

"Mthatha, South Africa (CNN) -- Nelson Mandela's grandson lost a court battle Wednesday against other members of his family over where three of the former South African leader's deceased children should be buried. A judge in Mthatha, South Africa, dismissed an application by Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela, which means the grandson must return the remains of the three Mandela relatives to their graves in Qunu. The grandson, also known as Mandla, is accused of exhuming and relocating the bodies in 2011 to Mvezo, Nelson Mandela's birthplace. He issued a statement saying he'll abide by the court decision but continue ""to fight for his right to put on record his side of the story."" A statement issued on Mandla's behalf said he is ""disappointed that to date he has not been granted an opportunity to respond to the court order granted against him by the Mthatha High Court. He has maintained that the papers were not properly served on him and therefore he has as a result been denied the right to respond to the contents of the court application against him.""

"(CNN) -- A tanker ship loaded with oil in the Port of Port Arthur, Texas, collided with two barges being towed by a tug boat, resulting in a spill of about 450,000 gallons of crude, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. No injuries were reported, but a 50-block area around the port was evacuated out of caution, as the tanker was carrying a type of oil containing sulfide. The portion of the port where the collision occurred will remain closed until it is deemed safe for workers and other vessels to return, Petty Officer Richard Brahm said. The Coast Guard has deployed 4,000 feet of boom, which helps corral the oil, with 10,000 more feet available for cleanup. Also on the scene are oil skimmers, three boom vessels, four 25-foot Coast Guard boats, the Coast Guard cutter Manowar and authorities from the local police and fire departments. Photos show gash in tanker's side . The spill is in a ""very still"" area of the waterway, which is helping contain it, Brahm said. ""There is almost no water flow in the area, so the oil isn't spreading out,"" he said. The port is primarily for industrial use, but Coast Guard Capt. John J. Plunkett said there are environmental concerns to marsh areas both up- and downstream of the spill. He said the spill hadn't reached those areas. The Coast Guard did not indicate how long cleanup will take. The investigation into the cause of the collision is ongoing. Port Arthur is about 100 miles east of Houston, near the Louisiana border. The biggest oil spill in U.S. history occurred in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in the Gulf of Alaska, resulting in the spill of 11 million gallons of crude.","Coast Guard did not indicate how long cleanup will take; investigation ongoing .

"(CNN) -- Men in glitzy shirts and outrageous hairstyles walk down the red carpet alongside a cheerleader while 2,500 people sing ""stand up if you love the darts."" These are not your groomed and glamorous stars like David Beckham -- these are men of the people. Welcome to the world of darts. A world where men like Peter Wright, who sports a multi-colored mohawk with a snake painted on the side of his head -- and parades around in shirts which would be more at home at a 1970s psychedelic disco -- is hero worshiped. Where men with paunches, who appear to have spent more time lifting pints than weights, thrill millions -- including Prince Harry. Once played by as many as 10 million Britons in pubs each year, darts has long since escaped the stereotype of a working class leisure pursuit. It's been rebranded, revamped and then some. And what a success the marketing men have had. The World Championships, which concluded in style on New Year's Day at London's Alexandra Palace, was broadcast live across the globe as far as Australia, New Zealand, Asia and the Far East. Real skill . As well as its larger than life sporting characters, what television loves most about darts is the atmosphere a couple of thousand men and women -- many in fancy dress and imbibing liberal amounts of alcohol -- generate at the ""Pally."" ""It's quickfire and entertaining -- you get a result on the night and you don't have to wait around for five days or so,"" Matthew Porter, chief executive of the Professional Darts Corporation, told CNN. ""Then there's the crowd aspect. It's non-partisan, it's not like football where people have teams. They have their favorite players but it's different atmosphere. ""The social element is hugely important,"" added Porter. ""People can go out in fancy dress, they can be on television and that all serves to make it an enjoyable night out. They're not just going to a sporting event. The argument over whether darts is really a sport has seemingly become redundant, with Clive Woodward, a leading sports scientist and coach, who has worked as Sporting Director of Team GB and the England rugby team, arguing it should be in the Olympics. With 72 players from 20 different countries taking part, the reach of the sport has grown immeasurably since the inception of the World Darts Council in 1992, which is today known as the PDC. The move, which came after a number of top players voiced their concern at the lack of progress being made by the game under the auspices of the British Darts Organization. The split brought about a new era with the creation of the PDC, now led by sports promoter Barry Hearn, who helped to revolutionize the game by giving it a complete facelift. England's answer to American promoter Don King, Hearn, who also owns a lower division English football club, has also helped revamp snooker as well working as a boxing supremo. 'Arrows' Darts is now a lucrative business with players competing in front of packed arenas with a total prize fund of $8 million on offer throughout the year. The game's origins remain a mystery. ""Javelins, crossbow bolts and archery have all been considered,"" according to darts historian Patrick Chaplin, known as 'Dr Darts', the author of eight books on the sport. Historically England has always excelled at archery, notably at the battle of Agincourt in 1415 when despite being outnumbered by French soldiers, Welsh and English archers overwhelmed the enemy with a storm of arrows. ""Of these the most likely scenario is that the game has its roots in archery,"" added Chaplin. ""Glance back to the earliest type of dartboards and you will see that these were concentric targets -- miniature forms of the archery target. ""Moreover, darts is most commonly known as 'arrows.' Some would say that these two points alone are sufficient to confirm our sports' heritage."" While darts was always a pastime enjoyed in pubs across Britain in the 1930s, it was not until the BDO was established in 1973 that it became a professional sport. By January 1979 over eight million people tuned in to watch John Lowe win the Embassy World Professional Darts Championship on the BBC. While TV coverage was scaled back in the 1980s, the advent of satellite television brought about new opportunities for the game with both parties enjoying huge success. Porter is now targeting the U.S. and Asia. ""All the hard work of the past 10 years or so has come to fruition and we're now trying to continue our global expansion. ""We started a world series last year with Dubai and Australia and we're now trying to expand in North American and Asia,"" said the PDC chief executive. ""America is a tough nut to crack because it's such a vast market but we've got TV coverage over there. ""We don't have an elite U.S. player and they like to watch their own."" Porter is equally keen to draw in new fans. ""To any new fans who want to come, I'll give them my personal guarantee that I'll refund their money if they don't enjoy it. ""I don't know anyone who hasn't enjoyed an evening at the darts.""","Darts is one of the fastest growing sports in the world .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Graeme Le Saux played more than 400 matches for Blackburn, Chelsea and Southampton, winning a Premier League title and 36 international caps. CNN's Don Riddell talks to the former England star about homophobia and racism in the game. Graeme Le Saux, pictured here playing for Chelsea, endured homophobic abuse throughout his career due to false rumors he was gay. Don Riddell: Graeme, you're happily married with two children but during your football career everyone thought you were gay and the experience was pretty miserable. Graeme Le Saux: The culture of football back in the 80s was very different, something I found very hard to relate to and subsequently I found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people. That eventually led to rumors being spread that I was gay. In the context of modern life that's not defamatory but in terms of the dressing room culture that existed then -- and to an extent now -- it was very difficult for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career. I think that the joke very quickly got out of hand. And I think where I was at fault was that I was probably a little sensitive about it, because I could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control. And it did. We played in a game at West Ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and I remember being, you know, really, really shocked that it got to that level so quickly. DR: And that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving Robbie Fowler. Tell me about that? GS: It all culminated in a game that we played at Stamford Bridge against Liverpool and Robbie Fowler, he stood in front of 40,000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him... That's the politest way I can put it! That really was the point at which it couldn't get any worse. It wasn't just people singing on the terrace, it was a colleague -- an international colleague -- humiliating you in front of all those people, an international audience. He will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point. If you look at anything like this, whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever, as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue. I'm all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you can't hide behind that as an excuse. Does homophobia in soccer exist? Have your say . DR: It's thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay. That was the Englishman Justin Fashanu and he committed suicide a decade ago. John Amaechi became the first gay player to be associated with the NBA last year, but such declarations are extremely rare. In many cases homosexuality remains pro sport's last taboo. GS: It's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport. If you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics, across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still isn't and I find that disappointing. There may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment. DR: Football's obviously made great strides, certainly in Britain, in the last 10 years with regards to racism, but how much prejudice is there generally in the game? Do you think we'll ever be free of it? GS: I think there's always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice. But ultimately I think it's important for any business really to be responsible, inclusive and representative of its employees. And football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example. And so I hope that, you know, the people in authority really make some serious attempts, I suppose to create parity between all walks of life. DR: We've come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse aren't really racist, they are just trying to put us off our game. How much do you buy into that approach? GS: Well, I can't speak for individual black players! But sometimes I think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual. It used to baffle me when I first started playing that you'd have Chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the Chelsea's team. And if you spoke to them or confronted them about it, they would be like, ""Oh yeah, but we know them... they are, you know, they are fine."" And it's like, well how do you pick the bones out of that? Because there is just no logic. But then you know prejudice is built on ignorance. You know it really is. I think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say, ""Well, would I like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse?""","Graeme Le Saux says an ""undercurrent of prejudice"" exists in football .

"(CNN) -- Longtime ABC News personality Barbara Walters will retire from broadcasting next year after a half-century trailblazing career, according to several media reports Thursday. ABC, where Walters has worked as a news anchor and talk show host since 1976, answered with ""no comment"" when CNN called about the reports quoting unnamed network sources in the New York Times and on Deadline.com. Viewers see Walters, 83, mostly these days as co-host of ABC's daytime talker ""The View,"" which she helped create in 1997. The plan is for her retirement to be announced in May, giving a year for ABC to pay tribute to her before she stops working in May 2014, Deadline.com reported. Walters went through a health scare in January when she suffered a cut on her forehead after falling on a stair while visiting the British ambassador's residence in Washington. She underwent surgery to repair a heart valve three years ago. Walters' national broadcast career began in 1961 as a reporter, writer and panel member on NBC's ""Today Show."" She was promoted to co-host in 1974, but she was hired away by ABC in 1976.

"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) -- The investigation into the shooting of a baby in Brunswick, Georgia -- a crime that's grabbed national headlines -- has taken yet another turn with the arrest of a local politician. The arrest stemmed from a verbal exchange between Brunswick City Commissioner James Henry Brooks and the family of one of the teen suspects in the slaying during the suspects' first court appearance on Monday. According to his attorney, Brooks told the family of De'Marquise Elkins, 17, that they didn't have to talk to police. ""What he was trying to do, at the point and time that he was approached here at the courthouse, was just tell these folks you have a right to remain silent,"" Brooks' attorney Alan Tucker told reporters Friday. Brooks is a distant relative of the Elkins family, his wife, Alicia Brooks, told CNN. She did not know exactly how they are related. The 59-year-old commissioner was charged with influencing a witness and obstructing law enforcement in an investigation, the Glynn County Sheriff's Office said. Brooks was arrested Thursday, posted $5,000 bond and left jail Friday afternoon. Tucker said his client was not trying to interfere with the investigation. ""I don't know why he spoke with the Elkins family other than the fact that they are constituents of his,"" the attorney said. ""The public defender's office put a statement out earlier in the week, and I think that there were many people in the community who maybe thought that these two young men had not committed the crime with which they are charged with, and evidence has come to light and the gun was found."" Under the terms of his bond, Brooks is not allowed to have any contact with the victims, witnesses, potential witnesses or investigators involved in the investigation of the murder of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago, who was killed March 21. The child's mother, Sherry West, has said that two teenagers came up to her in the street in broad daylight. One pointed a gun at her and told her that if she didn't give him her money he would shoot her and shoot her baby. West said that the teen fired at her, hitting her in one leg and barely missing her head. The teen, she said, then shot her baby in the face. Elkins and Dominique Lang, 15, have been charged with murder. Elkins' mother, aunt and sister have also been arrested on various charges alleging that they have hindered the investigation. The sister, 19-year-old Sabrina Elkins, was arrested on an evidence tampering charge, the Glynn County Sheriff's Office said. She was named in a grand jury indictment, released Wednesday, accusing her of helping her mother get rid of the gun authorities say was used to kill the child. Authorities did not reveal her alleged role in disposing of the gun, which police found in a pond 2.3 miles from where the baby was shot. Baby's death marks second time mom loses a son to violence . Sabrina Elkins ""was part of that, and that's the most I can answer of that question right now,"" Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said Thursday. The grand jury also indicted Elkins' mother, Karimah Aisha Elkins, 36, and aunt, Katrina Latrelle Elkins, 33, on charges of making false statements or writings, among other things. Elkin's mother, Karimah Aisha, and his sister, Sabrina, made their first court appearance Friday and were ordered held without bond, according to Ron Corbett, the Glynn County's undersheriff. None of the women is accused of involvement in the shooting itself. The same grand jury that indicted the women also named De'Marquise Elkins and Lang as being involved in the shooting, prosecutors said. Elkins is accused of malice and felony murder, along with other charges. Lang is accused of felony murder. Although Lang is a minor, CNN is identifying him because he is charged as an adult and media in the community have been naming him since his arrest. Investigators are looking into the possibility of a gang tie to the shooting, Doering said. ""That's being explored, whether a gang involvement was part of this,"" he said. ""And that's all that I can say right now."" Doering declined to say whether more arrests were possible as the investigation continues . West gave this account to police about the shooting: . One of the boys pointed a gun at her and said, ""'Give me your money or I'm going to kill you and I'm going to shoot your baby and kill your baby.'"" The boy tried to grab her purse and opened fire when she told him she had no money. One shot hit her in the leg and one grazed her head. The boy then shot the child. West tried to resuscitate her son as bystanders called 911 for help. Mom to teenage son accused in baby shooting: 'I love you' CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- A Florida woman has been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the death of a lottery millionaire whose body was found buried under fresh concrete, authorities said Friday night. Dorice Donegan Moore, 37, was arrested last week on charges of accessory after the fact regarding a first-degree murder in the death of Abraham Shakespeare, 43, said Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee. She remains in the Hillsborough County Jail, he said. Moore befriended Shakespeare after he won a $31 million Florida lottery prize in 2006 and was named a person of interest in the case after Shakespeare disappeared, authorities said. Before her arrest, Moore proclaimed her innocence during a tearful, impromptu news conference outside her home. She said she was planning to help Shakespeare write a book about the challenges of winning millions and that she was helping him manage the money. ""Abraham had a life of drama because of the money,"" she told CNN affiliate WTSP. ""The money was like a curse to him. And now it has become a curse to me."" Moore might have committed fraud to obtain parts of Shakespeare's fortune, and she bought lime to deal with his body and was trying to find someone to move the corpse to another location, Gee said at the time of her arrest. Shakespeare was killed on April 6 or April 7, and Moore has admitted trying to convince Shakespeare's family members that he was still alive, Gee said. Deputies found Shakespeare's body outside a home in Plant City in late January after receiving a tip from an associate of Moore, Gee said. The investigation is continuing, Gee said.","Dorice Moore says she helped manage Abraham Shakespeare's lottery winnings .

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot admitted in an interview with a Dutch newspaper that he extorted money from the family of Natalee Holloway, but his attorney in a Peruvian murder case suggested Monday that his client's comments may have been mistranslated. Attorney Maximo Alteza said he is not involved in the case of Holloway, the Alabama teenager who disappeared in Aruba after going out on the town with van der Sloot, and was reluctant to comment on van der Sloot's interview with The Telegraph. ""Maybe there were some mistakes in the translation,"" he said. Alteza said van der Sloot was not paid for the interview. ""I wanted to get back at Natalee's family,"" van der Sloot said from prison in the Dutch interview. ""Her parents have been making my life tough for five years."" ""When they offered to pay for the girl's location, I thought: 'Why not?'"" he said. Van der Sloot faces a count of wire fraud and a count of extortion in the United States for allegedly trying to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for the location of her body. He has denied responsibility for her disappearance. He was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with the Holloway case but has never been charged. The 22-year-old Dutch citizen is awaiting trial in Lima, Peru, where he stands accused of killing Stephany Flores in a hotel room. Also Monday, a Peruvian court voted 2-1 to reject van der Sloot's contention that he is being held unlawfully, but the court requires three votes to secure a decision. Alteza said that a fourth jurist will hear the case and cast a vote at a public hearing next week. If that judge votes in favor of van der Sloot, a fifth judge will hear the case to break the tie. Alteza said that van der Sloot's constitutional rights have been violated and he ""could be released because of the mistakes made by the police during the investigation.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Several members of Congress ripped Attorney General Eric Holder's decision Friday to try five suspected 9/11 terrorists in civilian court. Holder was accused of risking Americans' security by treating the suspects like ""common criminals"" with a right to greater constitutional protections than they would receive in a military trial. Five Guantanamo Bay detainees with alleged ties to the September 11, 2001, attacks -- including confessed mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- will be tried in civilian court in New York, Holder announced Friday. ""These terrorists planned and executed the mass murder of thousands of innocent Americans. Treating them like common criminals is unconscionable,"" Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn said in a written statement. ""The attacks of September 11th were an act of war. Reverting to a pre-9/11 approach to fighting terrorism and bringing these dangerous individuals onto U.S. soil needlessly compromises the safety of all Americans."" Cornyn asserted that Holder had irresponsibly put ""political ideology ahead of the safety of the American people just to fulfill an ill-conceived campaign promise."" Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said the decision meant Mohammed and the other defendants would be able to claim new protections, including Miranda and Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. ""Bringing terrorists to U.S. soil expands their constitutional rights and could result in shorter sentences,"" Smith claimed in a statement. ""America already gives terrorists more constitutional rights than any other country. The administration should not prioritize the rights of terrorists over the rights of Americans to be safe and secure,"" he said. Smith argued that trying suspected terrorists in military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is the ""most appropriate venue and safest option for the American people."" He also said the public needed to be ""reassured that no terrorist will ever be released into our communities."" Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, agreed with Smith that suspected terrorists ought to be tried by military commissions. ""It is inconceivable that we would bring these alleged terrorists back to New York for trial, to the scene of the carnage they created eight years ago, and give them a platform to mock the suffering of their victims and the victims' families, and rally their followers to continue waging jihad against America,"" he said in a statement. The September 11 terrorists ""are war criminals, not common criminals,"" he argued. They are ""not American citizens entitled to all the constitutional rights American citizens have in our federal courts."" Lieberman argued that the updated military commission system recently signed into law by Obama ""provides standards of due process and fairness that fully comply with the requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Geneva Conventions."" Some criticism also came from the Democratic side of the aisle. Moderate Virginia Sen. Jim Webb said he is ""very concerned about the wisdom"" of holding civilian trials instead of military tribunals. ""It will be disruptive, costly, and potentially counterproductive to try (the suspected terrorists) as criminals in our civilian courts,"" he warned. Critics of military commissions, however, offered strong praise for Holder's decision. Anthony Romero, the head of the American Civil Liberties Union, called it ""a huge victory for restoring due process and the rule of law, as well as repairing America's international standing, an essential part of ensuring our national security."" Romero argued that it would ""have been an enormous blow to American values if we had tried these defendants in a (military commission) process riddled with legal problems."" Trying the suspects at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility would have amounted to ""a miscarriage of justice in sham proceedings,"" Romero said. Romero criticized Holder's decision to try five other detainees -- including Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged mastermind behind the 2000 bombing of the destroyer USS Cole -- by military commission. ""Time and again the federal courts have proven themselves capable of handling terrorism cases while protecting both American values and sensitive national security information. Justice can only be served in our tried and true courts,"" Romero said. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-New York, said he supports Holder's decision to hold a trial in the city that bore the brunt of the September 11 attacks. ""Any suggestion that our prosecutors and our law enforcement personnel are not up to the task of safely holding and successfully prosecuting terrorists on American soil is insulting and untrue,"" Nadler said in a written statement. ""I invite any of my colleagues who say that they are afraid to bring detainees into the United States to face trial to come to New York and see how we handle them."" Nadler said the families of the victims of the September 11 attacks deserve the opportunity ""to see these trials and confront these defendants in open court."" Independent New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he supported Holder's decision to hold a trial in the city that bore the brunt of the September 11 attacks. ""It is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site where so many New Yorkers were murdered,"" he asserted in a statement. Bloomberg said he told Holder that ""New York City stands ready to assist the federal court in the administration of justice in any way necessary."" But Rep. Pete King, a New York Republican who represents who parts of Long Island, said holding terrorism trials in New York City could be a security threat. ""We are already the top target of the world. ... They only have to be lucky once,"" said King, whose father was a New York City policeman. Holding the trial in New York would put too much strain on the police force, he said. ""They can do as good a job as possible but there are already a thousand cops working on counterterrorism, and to add to that will be very difficult,"" King said. He added that the trial could last for years. King, the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said it is ""morally and constitutionally"" wrong to try terrorism suspects in civilian courts. ""We are at war,"" he said. ""This is a war."" King also blasted the president for allowing Holder to make an announcement about a politically dicey national security issue, and for releasing it on a Friday as Obama was ""sneaking away to Asia as this is happening."" ""It's like there are two administrations, the Obama administration and the Holder administration,"" King said. Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, however, contended that the decision to hold a civilian trial for some suspected terrorists and a military trial for others sent ""a mixed message about America's resolve in the fight against terrorism."" ""If military tribunals are suitable for the terrorists who attacked our sailors aboard the USS Cole ... then military tribunals are certainly the right venue to try the al Qaeda terrorists, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who murdered thousands of innocent civilians on September 11, 2001,"" he said.","NEW: Democrat Jim Webb questions wisdom of decision .

""The mocking goes along the lines of: Yes, the iPad is small, lightweight and slim. But can you swim with it?"" wrote the Los Angeles Times' tech blog. The term iTampon -- a riff on the fact that the iPad can be taken to sound more like a maxipad than a slick new computer -- was the third most-talked about trend on Twitter on Wednesday evening. Do you think the iPad name is a flop? Some female bloggers wrote that Apple seemed not to have any women on its marketing team. ""With ""iTampon"" quickly emerging as a trending Twitter topic, it's probably safe to say that many women found themselves cringing as they asked, 'Do any women work at Apple?' "" wrote Annie Colbert on the blog ""Holy Kaw!"" The tech community has discussed the name for Apple's new keyboard-less computer for months if not years. Rumor had it that the device might be called the iSlate, but one reporter at Apple's San Francisco event joked that the term ""slate"" might sound too ancient or heavy for a lightweight lap computer. Steve Jobs describes iPad at event . ""Slate is a little bit 'Flintstones,' "" said Stephen Hutcheon, an editor at The Sydney Morning Herald, a newspaper in Australia. It's also unclear what people should call the category of computers that now includes the iPad. Some refer to computers without keyboards and with touch-screens as ""slate computers."" Others call them tablets, a term that also can refer to '90s devices with keyboards and pens attached. After Apple unveiled the iPad at an invitation-only event, some tech journalists said they thought the jokes about feminine hygiene would dissipate soon. The name ""iPod"" sounded strange at first, for example, and now is a part of the standard vocabulary, said Hutcheon. ""If you think of iPods in 2001, we probably got the same smirks,"" he said. ""I think the jokes will disappear."" He added that one could take ""pad"" to mean ""home,"" which is where Apple CEO Steve Jobs hopes many people will use the iPad to read books, watch movies and the like. Andy Ihnatko, a tech columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times, said Apple could call its new gadget a ""mangled baby duck"" and people would still buy it, both because Apple has sex appeal and because the iPad is a good product. ""With the right device, marketing doesn't really matter,"" he said. The name iPad sticks with Apple's ""i"" line of branding and is therefore a smart move, said Jacqui Cheng, a senior writer at the tech site Ars Technica. ""I don't hate it,"" she said of the name. ""I don't know if I love it, but it's OK."" Share iReport reaction of the iPad . Still, the torrent of online jokes about the iPad could stick in consumers' minds. It seems particularly damaging that MADtv was making fun of the iPad name long before Apple ever introduced its new product. A years-old comedy skit from the show circulated the Internet on Wednesday. It shows two women discussing an Apple period-maintenance device called the iPad. As Twitter user @DontStealMyPen notes snarkily, the botched iPad name has the potential to alter shopping habits: . ""Will women send their husbands to the Apple store to buy iPads?"" the user wrote.","New Apple product called the ""iPad"" is mocked online .

"(CNN) -- The ""West"" and the majority of the Muslim world appear to have divergent views on two things about the Syrian civil war: the centrality of the conflict and what constitutes the ""worst case scenario."" For the West, the prospect of al Qaeda or other Islamist militants prevailing is a nightmare. But for many Sunni Muslims, the nightmare is already here. Two years ago, I cautioned that given Syria's religious, sectarian and ethnic cleavages, and the minority Alawite regime's preference for brutally suppressing the majority Sunni population rather than placating it by accommodating its Arab Spring-inspired demands for reform, the turmoil there could morph into a protracted war pitting a ruthless dictator against an armed insurrection that could be usurped by Islamist militants. That scenario come to fruition -- but that's not all. The war in Syria has divided the Arab world, inflamed sectarianism across the Muslim world, revived al Qaeda and even turned into a juncture where the West and the Islamic world went in seemingly opposite directions. Unless the international community recognizes the repercussions of this conflict and makes ending it its top priority, these fissures will continue to deepen, leaving many relationships in tatters and the international institutions mandated to maintain peace looking ineffectual. Faced with such a grim reality, the wide spectrum of players involved in the conflict will continue to resort to violence and to view the conflict through a zero-sum framework that will only add to the suffering of the beleaguered people of Syria. More than 100,000 people have died in the conflict, which has turned millions more into refugees. Assad's forces have had the temerity to capture their atrocities on camera, and these hours of gut-wrenching footage have proved a treasure-trove for al Qaeda and other Islamist militants. They have capitalized on Assad's brutality to construct a Jihadist narrative that, unlike other places where Islamist militants had tried to establish a foothold, has resonated with many Muslims around the world. The onslaught against the Sunni majority turned Syria into the favorite destination of militant Islamists worldwide. It has provided al Qaeda, which boasts not one but two affiliates there -- the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and the al Nusra Front -- an opportunity to rebrand itself and given its recruitment efforts a shot in the arm. While estimates vary, analysts agree that thousands of Muslims from places as varied as Kuwait, Chechnya, Morocco, Belgium, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, France, and even the U.S. have traveled to join the fighting in Syria, and the inflow is continuing. Other individuals have donated thousands of dollars to support the armed opposition which, by all accounts, is slowly becoming dominated by Islamists of varying degrees of militancy. As the secular Free Syrian Army (FSA) continues to be plagued by internal divisions, it is the Islamists who are taking the fight to Assad. Some, especially the al Qaeda affiliates, have even attacked the FSA and driven them out of areas they fought long and hard to control. While regional players like Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq and Hezbollah appear to be treating the conflict as a defining moment in the history of the region that could determine its political trajectory for years, the West, with the US at its helm, seems to be losing interest. Even more worrisome for many in the Middle East, recent reports in the American media suggest U.S. officials are increasingly viewing the prospect of Islamist militants displacing Assad or controlling large swathes of Syrian territory as a ""nightmarish"" outcome. Continuing carnage . But for many of the roughly 1.3 billion Muslims around the world, especially the majority Sunnis -- estimated to be around 85% -- exactly who ousts Assad is immaterial. If it is the Islamists, or even the terrorists of al Qaeda, then so be it. To them, the nightmare is what's happening now; practically nothing could be worse. Last week, 72 prominent Saudi clerics issued a statement calling on Muslims around the world to support a recently formed Islamist coalition in Syria known as the ""Islamic Front."" The good news is that the Front does not include the two al Qaeda affiliates, and the clerics did not call on Muslims to travel to Syria. However, the characterization of the conflict as a ""Jihad,"" or holy war, is a troubling development, given that the Saudi government prohibited its Imams from delivering politically-charged sermons and that its highest religious authority issued an edict enjoining Saudis not to go to Syria, and that doing so would contravene the religious sanctions of Jihad. While it's not surprising that the war is proving irresistible to hardened militants who have fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, it is disconcerting that it is also attracting recent converts to Islam from the West, underage boys who are traveling without their families' knowledge and even some women: the case of a Saudi woman who announced her triumphant arrival in Syria on Twitter last week sheds light on the powerful gravitation force of Syria amongst the religiously devout. But it is not only the devout or the militant who are heeding the call. In one video, a militant Saudi who joined the fighting in Syria holds back tears as he proudly boasts that he has encountered ""mujahideen"" there who confided in him that they did not know how to pray. In the minds of some Sunni Muslims around the world, the trepidation that the West is voicing over the prospect of Al Qaeda or other militant Islamists coming to power in Syria and the implications of such a scenario for religious and ethnic minorities is read as tacit acquiescence to what they see as a ""genocide"" -- a term the usually-reserved Saudi foreign minister has been using lately -- against their Sunni brethren. To them, the West is saying ""better the Sunnis than the minority Christians, Alawites, Shia and Druze."" This perception has already led to a serious rift between Saudi Arabia -- the leader of the Sunni world -- and the U.S. In a strongly-worded statement explaining why it was declining a coveted two-year seat on the United Nations Security Council a few weeks ago, Saudi Arabia cited the continuing carnage in Syria as one of the main reasons why it felt the international body was not fulfilling its mandate. It also accused the world of standing ""idly"" by. These two divergent assessments must be reconciled. The truth is that Assad and al Qaeda are two ugly faces of the same coin. The sooner the international community realizes that, the sooner the only viable option becomes clear: both of them have to go. Read more: Polio threat stalks Syrian refugees in Lebanon .

"(CNN) -- The family of an American woman who went missing in Istanbul nearly two weeks ago is in mourning after learning that Turkish police found her body Saturday. Steven Sierra wept during a phone call with CNN, as he waited in Istanbul to go with police to identify the body of his wife, Sarai Sierra. Turkish police found the New York woman's body near ancient stone walls in Istanbul's Sarayburnu district, the semi-official Anatolian Agency reported. Police suspected she had been killed at another location. Police told CNN's sister network CNN Turk that the body of the 33-year-old mother of two showed signs of stab wounds. However, the police chief of Istanbul, Huseyin Capkin, said Sierra died from a blow to her head. At least nine suspects had been detained in connection with Sierra's disappearance and death, Anatolian reported. Sierra's family and friends first sounded the alarm last week after she did not arrive on a return flight from Istanbul on January 22. ""The last we heard from my wife was Monday morning on the 21st. She had spoken with her sister and the last thing she said was, 'I'm coming home tomorrow,' and she was excited and put a little smiley face at the end of her statement,"" said Steven Sierra in an interview with CNN earlier this week. Steven Sierra spoke to CNN in Istanbul on Wednesday, after he and Sarai Sierra's brother, David Jimenez, traveled to Turkey to assist in the search. The worried husband was periodically overwhelmed with emotion throughout the interview. ""You're hoping that she's OK wherever she's at, that she's not hurting, that she's not cold, that she's being fed,"" Steven Sierra said, choking back tears. ""Its difficult what's going through my mind, if our hopes and prayers are not answered. It is difficult when you have two children that look up to you, and you have to do your very best to stay strong regardless of what happens."" Sarai Sierra flew alone to Istanbul on January 7 after a friend at the last minute canceled plans to accompany her. ""She did a lot of researching about the area, about where she was going to stay, the safest places to go and the time of day to travel,"" friend Magalena Rodriguez said. Sierrra was an amateur photographer who had amassed more than 3,000 followers since she joined the photo sharing app Instagram last year. Some people she met through the service encouraged her to visit the ancient Turkish city, her husband said. They offered to act as tour guides. ""You're admiring pictures, but you're getting acquainted with people that you've never met before,"" Steven Sierra said. Sarai's brother said he had been worried about his sister's solo trip. ""We were nervous. Were just like 'always be mindful of what you do, be aware of your surroundings. Don't get too comfortable to the point where you drop your guard down,'"" David Jimenez said. But Jimenez and Sierra's husband said Sarai was determined to complete challenges that she set for herself. As an example, they described how she competed in a triathlon several years ago, despite being a weak swimmer, and despite the fact that she did not own a bicycle. Instead, Sarai completed the cycling leg of the competition by borrowing a mountain bike from her husband. After arriving in Istanbul, Sierra's photo feed displayed images of Istanbul's beautiful skyline and historic landmarks. She also squeezed in an excursion to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and to Germany, starting January 15. ""She chose to go to Amsterdam for the graffiti,"" her husband said. ""She informed me as far as how her time was out there. And she also had a tour guide that was helping her out there as well, who I know about and who I've spoken with personally."" Sierra returned to Istanbul on January 19. Three days later, she went missing. Sierra had rebooked her flight to arrive back early, on January 22, in part to surprise her two sons, 9 and 11. Days before her scheduled trip home, Sierra spoke with her father, Dennis Jimenez, via Skype to remind him of her flight number and arrival time. When Dennis Jimenez went to the Newark, New Jersey, airport to pick Sierra up, she didn't show, he said. The airline told him she had never checked in for the flight. ""She kept in contact with us all the time,"" Sierra's mother, Betzaida Jimenez, said. ""And then not to hear from her? It's not like her."" After the tourist went missing, Turkish police released a surveillance camera video of Sarai at a shopping mall in Istanbul, flipping through her iPad. The scenes from January 20 are the last known images of her. The manager of the small private hotel where Sierra was staying reported last seeing her the day the surveillance video was shot. That was a Sunday. Her Skype account, which she avidly used, went silent a day later. A day after that was when she missed her flight home. The time she last talked with her family, Sierra was planning on January 21 to see the Galata Bridge and visit the Asian side of Istanbul, her husband said. The former capital of the Byzantine and East Roman empires straddles the continents of Europe and Asia. After Sierra's family raised the alarm that she was missing, some of her belongings -- including her passport and medical cards -- were found in her room in Istanbul, though her iPhone and iPad were not there, according to her husband. Since Sierra's disappearance, Turkish police detained a Turkish man she had been in contact with who was identified only by the first name Talan, according to CNN Turk. Millions of foreign tourists visit Turkey every year. While it is not unusual to hear about foreigners being targeted by pickpockets and bag snatchers, violent crime involving foreign tourists is relatively rare.","NEW: Turkish police chief says tourist died from blow to her head .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona mother has admitted to suffocating her 13-year-old daughter and trying to kill her other children by poisoning them, police said Tuesday. Officers in Casa Grande, Arizona, responded to a 911 call on Christmas Day. A man said that his ex-wife, 35-year-old Connie Villa, had stabbed him but that he had managed to escape and was driving himself to a hospital. When officers arrived at the home, they found Villa with stab wounds, holding a knife to her chest. They managed to subdue her and conducted a sweep of the home. Police found the body of Aniarael Macias, Villa's daughter, in the bathroom. ""Although an autopsy for Aniarael was conducted ... the results of which did not identify a cause of death, investigators feel the evidence found at the scene of the crime along with interviews and medical information of the surviving children, give our Department cause to believe Connie Villa was attempting to end the lives of all of her children and her ex-husband, Adam Villa,"" police said in a statement. Connie Villa faces one count of first degree murder in the death of her daughter. She is also being charged with four counts of attempted murder of her ex-husband and her three surviving children, ages 3, 5 and 8. In an interview, she admitted she tried to kill her children by forcing them to ingest prescription narcotic drugs, police said. The kids had trace amounts of opiates in their systems. Police also said that she told them she was unsuccessful in forcing her oldest daughter to ingest the drugs, and so she suffocated Aniarael. Connie Villa reportedly told investigators she wanted to kill her children and ex-husband because she did not want him to have custody of them. The surviving children are all in good condition and were placed with the family of their father, Adam Villa, 33. He is in stable condition. Connie Villa was released Sunday from Maricopa Medical Center, where she was treated for what investigators believe were self-inflicted stab wounds. She was arrested the same day. According to Thomas Anderson, a police spokesman, she has made an initial appearance in court. No bond was given. Aniarael's father released a statement asking for privacy and prayers. ""On behalf of Michael Macias, Ania's father, Vera Macias, Ania's grandmother and extended family, we request that the focus of this tragedy be a celebration of our precious Ania's life. She was a gentle, kind and beautiful spirit who was taken from us much too soon. Michael and his family are heartbroken,"" it read. ""We are writing this statement in hopes that the media and other outlets will allow Michael and our family to grieve peacefully. We thank everyone for the outpouring of support for our family. We appreciate your prayers and positive thoughts. We pray that justice will be served.""","Connie Villa told police she suffocated her daughter, Aniarael .

"Washington (CNN) -- An Arkansas pipeline spill that coated streets and lawns with a smelly, asphalt-like crude oil provides opponents of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline with new ammunition to combat the project that would bring more of the tar sands bitumen from Canada. The Obama administration is expected to issue a decision on expanding the Keystone pipeline in coming months, after an upcoming public hearing that is part of the State Department's assessment of the border-crossing proposal. The project has become a flashpoint in Washington and a dilemma of sorts for President Barack Obama, who will anger the liberal Democratic base if he approves the pipeline or face condemnation from Republicans and pro-business moderates if he nixes job creation by opposing it. A recent report by the State Department said the 800-mile Keystone pipeline expansion should have no significant effect on the environment along its proposed route, causing supporters to ratchet up pressure on Obama to approve it. In Saturday's weekly Republican address, Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska said the Keystone pipeline ""is primed to give our economy a shot in the arm and make energy more affordable -- and it won't cost the taxpayers a dime."" Terry spoke a day after the apparent pipeline rupture in the Arkansas town of Mayflower, about 20 miles north of Little Rock, that demonstrated the exact kind of environmental threat predicted by opponents of the Keystone project. Keystone XL pipeline public meeting set . Black torrents of diluted bitumen -- the tar-like oil dug up in northern Alberta that is thinned with chemicals to make it transportable by pipeline -- flowed through the community, forcing the evacuation of 22 homes. Pipeline owner ExxonMobil was barred Tuesday from restarting the pipeline ""until the agency is satisfied with repairs and is confident that all immediate safety concerns have been addressed,"" according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. ""When I got here, you could have canoed down the street, there was so much oil running down through there,"" said Mayflower resident Chris Harrell. Another resident, Amber Bartlett, described the smell of the black sludge on part of her yard as ""very intense."" State Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said Tuesday he was launching an investigation and asked ExxonMobil to preserve all documents and information related to the spill and cleanup efforts. Daily updates by ExxonMobil show the scale of the spill designated as ""major"" by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the struggle to clean it up. The company said Tuesday it had deployed 15 vacuum trucks, 33 storage tanks and 330 workers that recovered roughly 12,000 barrels of oil and water so far. It also mentioned that 14 oiled ducks, two turtles and one muskrat had been found. Two ducks were killed by the spill. To Glen Hooks, who was in Mayflower on Tuesday for the Sierra Club, the Arkansas incident portends similar problems with the Keystone pipeline. ""We are connecting the two because this is a great example of what could happen if the Keystone XL pipeline is permitted and built,"" Hooks told CNN, noting it would be transporting the same ""viscous, thick, nasty stuff."" Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said the Arkansas incident was ""a troubling reminder that oil companies still have not proven that they can safely transport Canadian tar sands oil across the United States without creating risks to our citizens and our environment."" Markey has lobbied for legislation ending a tax loophole that protects oil companies from a fee to pay for the costs of tar sands oil spills, and his statement Sunday said ExxonMobil should ""be forced to pay for all cleanup costs and assist affected Arkansas homeowners in whatever way they need."" ""Whether it's the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, or this mess in Arkansas, Americans are realizing that transporting large amounts of this corrosive and polluting fuel is a bad deal for American taxpayers and for our environment,"" he added. Political tensions over the pipeline run deep. Protestors call on Obama to reject Keystone XL pipeline . Supporters including Republican leaders, the business community and some oil state Democrats argue it will create at least 5,000 jobs and carry more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day from U.S. ally Canada, reducing American dependence on less friendly and less stable countries. Environmentalists and Democratic allies opposing the project contend the tar sands oil from Canada produces up to 30% more greenhouse gases, and extracting it causes deforestation and other problems. However, a traditional political ally on the left -- organized labor -- is generally siding with pro-pipeline arguments because of the jobs it would create. The opponents also cite the risk of spills, which they say are more prevalent for the heavier tar sands oil. In response, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall told CNN that the tar sand oil from neighboring Alberta will get to market whether or not the pipeline gets built. ""This is transitional energy,"" Wall said. ""We all want to get to the point where hydrocarbons don't play the role they play today, but in the meantime, they do."" The Obama administration initially rejected a permit for the Keystone pipeline in January 2012 after Nebraska's governor, a Republican, complained it would cross the vital Ogallala Aquifer in his state. Obama later accelerated approval for a southern portion of the project that runs from Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast, but critics accused him of avoiding a politically sensitive decision on the northern leg. Nebraska officials have since approved a revised route for the pipeline, and supporters of the plan now complain that the administration's continued vetting was unnecessary after previous years of review. CNNMoney's Steve Hargreaves and CNN's Jason Hanna, Lisa Sylvester and Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.","The Obama administration will decide on the Keystone XL pipeline this year .

"(CNN) -- Hotel guests, be warned: Your bathrobes may be under surveillance. Linen Technology Tracking, a Miami-based company, recently patented a radio-frequency identification chip designed to keep real-time inventory of frequently misplaced or stolen goods. Three hotels -- in New York, Miami and Honolulu -- now use Linen Trackers, said William Serbin, the company's executive vice president. ""After being in the industry for many years, I understand the challenges hotels face in monitoring linen,"" he said. ""Any given month, they can lose 5 to 20 percent of towels, sheets and robes. That gets expensive with the rising cost of cotton."" Beyond policing freebie-hungry travelers, the chips help managers properly stock rooms and order supplies. ""Keeping track of everything is an arduous task, and there's never been a clear system,"" he said. ""The chips introduce accountability, make things easier."" It was an idea he considered when driving Florida's toll roads. Sensors, a widely used automatic technology, made sure everyone paid and maintained order. Serbin pondered: How do we take a similar concept and make it waterproof? ""We tweaked the technology, went through trial and error with different types of chips and put them in the correct place,"" he said. ""Now, chip life exceeds 300 wash cycles."" And it works, Serbin said. Trackers have busted several robe and towel thieves, who were politely asked to return hotel property. ""It's been phenomenal,"" he said.

"We've learned that some varieties of fish are low in fat and contain oils that keep the heart healthy. But recent reports about contaminants such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, have prompted some health experts to rethink their advice about seafood. Lots of varieties of fish are safe, but some types of seafood can be risky for certain groups of people. For Seattle cardiologist Florence Sheehan, M.D., it isn't just her patients she worries about. It's her family, too. ""Ours has a history of high cholesterol,"" Sheehan says. ""So I eat fish frequently to keep my cholesterol down."" Lately, she finds herself scanning medical journals and government advisories to stay abreast of fish safety issues. She says that untangling the facts behind the latest seafood scares isn't as complicated as it seems. ""The key is to place the benefits and risks into perspective,"" Sheehan says. ""Lots of varieties of fish are safe. It's just that some types of seafood can be risky for certain groups of people."" Here's a look at which fish pose risks, and which ones are safe -- and good for you, too. The truth about salmon . A 2004 study in the journal Science raised concern among fish lovers with news that farm-raised salmon, the type found at most supermarkets, contained higher levels of cancer-causing pcbs than wild salmon. (Banned in the 1970s, PCBs still contaminate the environment. They are released by incinerators and toxic waste sites.) But two more recent studies, one on farm-raised salmon and the other on wild, found that both harbor similar levels of this pollutant. The first study, done with Chilean- and Canadian-farmed salmon, found an average of 11.5 parts per billion PCBs. The second, conducted by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, sampled 600 wild salmon from the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, and found 8.2 to 10 parts per billion PCBs. It's important to realize that the amount of PCBs being talked about is very small, says Cornell University seafood specialist Ken Gall, who has studied fish safety issues for 22 years. ""High doses of PCBs, like the kind of contamination that occurs with an industrial accident, can be dangerous,"" Gall says. ""But it's uncertain whether the tiny amounts of PCBs found in many foods such as fish, meat, or milk can cause cancer."" Most health experts feel the health benefits of salmon far outweigh the risk posed by minute levels of PCBs. William Connor, M.D., a professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland, who has spent most of his career studying the health benefits of the omega-3 fats found in salmon, says he has no qualms about recommending farm-raised salmon. ""I would rather my patients not miss out on the benefits of salmon, a fish with some of the highest levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fats around, than fear PCBs,"" he says. Connor adds that for most people, farmed fish might be all that's available in the local supermarket. Indeed, the majority of the 16 pounds of fish the average American eats annually is farmed. Another benefit of farm-raised salmon and other fish, he says, is that they're typically low in mercury. CookingLight.com: 7 salmon main dish recipes . Minding mercury . Since exposure to high levels of mercury can cause neurological damage in a growing fetus, the Food and Drug Administration continues to issue related seafood safety advisories to pregnant women and young children. In March of 2004, the FDA updated that advice with stricter, more specific rules: Pregnant women, or women who plan to become pregnant, should avoid eating four fish with high levels of mercury: swordfish, shark, tilefish, and king mackerel. While fresh and canned tuna didn't make the FDA's list, many experts say pregnant women may be better off limiting fresh tuna steaks and canned albacore, or ""white,"" tuna to one meal per week or less, since these large fish can harbor mercury levels close to the one part per million threshold the FDA deems safe. (Canned light tuna is considered safe since it is made with smaller skipjack fish that are low in mercury.) The American Medical Association recently encouraged the FDA to require supermarkets to post warning signs about mercury near canned tuna as well as at the fish counter. CookingLight.com: Risks, benefits of 8 most popular U.S. seafood . Being aware of mercury is also a good idea for those who aren't pregnant. When internal medicine specialist Jane M. Hightower, M.D., performed a yearlong study of 123 of her patients, she found that a steady diet of high-mercury fish caused serious symptoms such as headaches, hair loss, problems with concentration, and high blood levels of mercury. Fortunately, once these patients switched to eating low-mercury varieties, symptoms began to disappear, and blood mercury levels returned to a safe level. Minimize risk . Purdue University seafood expert Charles Santerre, Ph.D., thinks the key to minimizing health risks for any food is to aim for variety. ""If you ate swordfish or shark or king mackerel every day, you could experience mercury toxicity,"" Santerre says. ""But if you eat them once a month [and trade off with] some other low-mercury fish, it shouldn't be a problem."" However, the ""sensitive population,"" including pregnant and nursing women, should always avoid swordfish, shark, tilefish, and king mackerel, Santerre says. On his list of safe, low-mercury options: shrimp, salmon, pollock, farm-raised catfish, tilapia, flatfish (flounder, sole, plaice), scallops, haddock, farm-raised trout, herring, crawfish, mullet, oysters, ocean perch, sardines, squid, white fish, and anchovies. Connor agrees. He eats seafood three or four times per week and calls the health benefits of fish, particularly the varieties that harbor omega-3 fats, profound. ""These fats prevent heart disease. They lower blood pressure and help prevent strokes. And studies show that eating two meals of fatty fish like salmon or sardines each week can help prevent sudden death,"" Connor says. CookingLight.com: The alphas of omega-3s . There are additional benefits as well. ""[By eating fish] you may be replacing a fatty meal like a bacon cheeseburger with something low in fat,"" Sheehan says. She advises her patients to eat fish at least twice per week, particularly those rich in omega-3s. And after looking at all the safety issues, she feels comfortable taking her own advice. Safe supplements . If fish can harbor toxins, it seems plausible that the oils extracted from fish to make supplements might be contaminated, but that's not the case. ""Fish oils are pure,"" says Connor. One recent study tested 16 fish oil supplements sold in warehouse clubs, pharmacies, and supermarkets, and none contained significant amounts of mercury, PCBs, or the pollutant dioxin. Currently, the American Heart Association recommends 1,000 milligrams of fish oil supplements per week for people with heart disease. According to Connor, supplements are a great way for nonfish lovers to tap into the important heart-healthy benefits of omega-3 fatty acids. Angling for trouble . Freshwater sport fishing brings its own share of safety concerns because of runoff from farms and sewage treatment plants, as well as the same environmental contaminants like mercury and PCBs that are found in ocean fish. ""The risk is different if you're fishing in a lake and eating only fish from that lake,"" says Cornell's Gall. ""Chances are you'll be eating a good amount of the fish you catch, so your exposure levels to a particular contaminant, or the contaminants in the lake, will be higher than exposure levels for someone who eats a variety of commercial fish from many sources."" CookingLight.com: Selecting, storing and cooking fish . Gall advises anglers to check with their local or state environmental health department for the most current warnings regarding the area where they plan to fish. If waters are safe to fish, the Environmental Protection Agency suggests catching the smallest fish allowed -- as a rule, the smaller the fish, the fewer the contaminants. Other safe freshwater choices include bluegill, perch, stream trout, and smelt. Since these panfish feed mainly on insects, they're less likely to harbor pollutants. Pregnant women are advised to eat only six ounces of freshwater fish a week since freshwater predator fish such as walleye, smallmouth and largemouth bass, lake trout, and Northern pike tend to contain higher levels of mercury than other local water varieties.

"(CNN) -- Penn State University will be hit with fines in excess of $30 million as part of ""significant, unprecedented penalties"" expected to be announced Monday by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, a source familiar with the case told CNN on Sunday. While the school's football program will not face the so-called ""death penalty"" that would have prevented the team from playing in the fall, the school might have preferred a one-year suspension because of the severity of the scholarship losses, postseason sanctions and other penalties, the source said. ""If I were Penn State or any other school and were given both options, I'd pick the death penalty,"" the source said, adding the range of sanctions ""is well beyond what has been done in the past"" and ""far worse than closing the program for a year."" The expected punishment is part of the continued fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted in late June of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims. The news came the same day the statue of Penn State's iconic head football coach Joe Paterno was removed from outside the campus stadium. iReporter: This is an end of an era . The NCAA's punishments follow an independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, whose report held four top Penn State officials, including Paterno, responsible for failing to stop the abuse. Everything the NCAA ""needed to know was detailed in the Freeh report,"" according to the source. Monday in Indianapolis, the NCAA plans a press conference ""to announce NCAA corrective and punitive measures for the Pennsylvania State University,"" it said in a statement. The NCAA last imposed the so-called ""death penalty"" to a football team in 1987 against Southern Methodist University's program in the wake of a payments-to-athletes scandal. The source says the sanctions ""will really paint a picture that essentially says that leadership failure and systemic failures can't be tolerated."" NCAA President Mark Emmert wrote a letter to Penn State President Rodney Erickson in November that included four questions he wanted the university to answer. According to the source, the NCAA felt the questions were answered by the Freeh report and therefore it could act before the university responded. The source wasn't sure if the university has been made aware of the penalties yet but says the university was not involved in the decision. It was ""not a negotiated process,"" the source said. While not divulging specifics, the source said, ""The penalties go well beyond the loss of a scholarship or not being able to go to a bowl game."" The source also said the plan includes provisions to provide ""leeway"" and ""minimize the impact"" on current players who had nothing to do with the Sandusky scandal. Photos: Final tributes, Paterno statue removed . Also Sunday, in State College, Pennsylvania, the 900-pound bronze statue of Paterno was removed. Penn State President Rodney Erickson said in a statement the statue is being stored in a ""secure location."" The statue was removed exactly six months after Paterno, the winningest coach in Division I football history, died of lung cancer. Paterno had coached at Penn State for 61 years, 15 of them as an assistant. He died less than three months after he coached his last game, an October 29 victory over Illinois that gave him a record 409 wins. Under Paterno's 46-season tenure as head coach, the Nittany Lions won two national championships, went undefeated five times, and finished in the top 25 national rankings 35 times. The tribute to the coach, who died in January, had become an object of contention after the child rape scandal involving Sandusky. However, Paterno's family said they believe taking down the statue serves no purpose. ""Tearing down the statue of Joe Paterno does not serve the victims of Jerry Sandusky's horrible crimes or help heal the Penn State community. We believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth,"" the family said in a statement. ""It is not the university's responsibility to defend or protect Joe Paterno. But they at least should have acknowledged that important legal cases are still pending and that the record on Joe Paterno, the board and other key players is far from complete,"" it added. Dan Vecellio, a staff writer for the blog Black Shoe Diaries, said there were about 100 people who watched the statue taken down, put on a forklift and driven into the stadium through a loading-dock door. Penn State board member resigns over Sandusky scandal . The Freeh report found several Penn State officials concealed evidence that Sandusky had sexually abused minors. Freeh concluded that Paterno could have prevented further sexual abuse had he taken action. ""I now believe that, contrary to its original intention, coach Paterno's statue has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing in our university and beyond,"" Erickson said. ""I believe that, were it to remain, the statue will be a recurring wound to the multitude of individuals across the nation and beyond who have been the victims of child abuse,"" he added. Sunday, Penn State employees began placing fencing around the statue, as well as a tarp. Local and university police were at the scene, and some students gathered near the football field, Beaver Stadium. Airborne banner: Take down Paterno statue . Another tribute to Paterno -- the university library that bears his name -- will remain as it is, Erickson said. ""The library remains a tribute to Joe and Sue Paterno's commitment to Penn State's student body and academic success, and it highlights the positive impacts coach Paterno had on the university,"" he wrote. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) called Paterno ""a powerful man who acted selfishly"" who ""deserves no public honors whatsoever."" ""We're glad the statue is gone but that's just a tiny step forward,"" SNAP spokesman David Clohessy said in a statement. ""We as a society must learn that a good way to deter child sex cover-ups is to punish, not praise, those who instigate such cover-ups."" NCAA not ruling out tough sanctions on Penn State football . Sandusky is expected to be sentenced in September. His legal team has said it will appeal the convictions. Two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal, and more charges are possible as the state's attorney general investigates what Penn State may have known about Sandusky's behavior.

"Daytona Beach, Florida (CNN) -- For a sport where speed is king, NASCAR's Daytona 500 this year was one long waiting game. First, rain led race officials to pull the plug Sunday -- the first time in Daytona 500's history. Then, continuing showers led them to re-reschedule the start from noon to Monday evening. When the race finally got underway, a massive fire with 40 laps to go red-flagged it for a couple more hours, pushing the race into a third day. In the end, Matt Kenseth crossed the finish line about 1 a.m. Tuesday, claiming the 54th running of ""The Great American Race."" The Daytona 500 victory was the second for the driver, who edged out Dale Earnhardt Jr. and teammate Greg Biffle to take the checkered flag. Those who made it to the end survived multiple accidents, including one on the second lap, and 10 caution flags. Officials shut down the race for nearly two hours after Juan Pablo Montoya careened into the back of a jet dryer that was being used to blow debris off the track during a caution flag. Montoya's car, the jet dryer and the truck pulling it all burst into flames and also set a section of the track on fire. Montoya said he had returned to the race track from pit row before the accident, after having the crew check out a vibration he was feeling in his car. ""I was in fourth gear. I wasn't even going that fast,"" Montoya told reporters. ""It just felt really strange and ... the car just turned right."" Some 24 hours of intermittent rain forced Monday's prime-time start -- the first since the inaugural race in 1959. Before this year, rain had cut short four of 53 previous races -- in 1965, 1966, 2003 and 2009 -- but none had been canceled for the day. The Daytona 500 opens the NASCAR season, but it also is the sport's most prestigious race. Daytona International Speedway announced this month that the race will boast a record purse of more than $19 million. In comparison, last year's Indianapolis 500 had a payout of $13.5 million. CNN's Tom Watkins and Dan Moriarty contributed to this report.","A massive fire delays the race for two hours .

"(CNN) -- With the one-track mind of a 6-year-old, Logan interrogated his mother, Jenny Spencer. Why are the other moms skinnier than you? he asked at the park. If you took weight loss pills, would you be skinny? he wondered during a TV infomercial. Spencer brushed off his questions. He was 6 and curious about the world around him. She was exhausted, trying to care for two young boys and her husband, who had chronic health issues. Her own health had fallen to the bottom of the to-do list. But Logan's last question hit her like, well, the elephant in the room. If you got skinny, would you be able to play with me? ""My heart broke,"" Spencer wrote on iReport. ""And from that moment forward, I began the transformation into a healthier lifestyle for my children."" When Spencer stepped on the scale in June 2012, the number 200 came as no surprise. More than a dozen people had asked her over the past few years whether she was pregnant. Two had rubbed her belly when there was no baby at all. The extra weight caused pain in Spencer's hips when she walked, and the doctor warned that she was on the verge of type 2 diabetes. She had tried dieting after her second son, Brody, was born. Weight Watchers helped her drop 10 pounds, but she quickly gained 20 back. Her sister, ""a health nut,"" encouraged her to try different cleanses. All left her feeling like a failure. She was depressed, anxious and overwhelmed. ""You know, I started every Monday dreaming I could change my life,"" Spencer remembered. ""It was nearly a decade of that."" Logan's question made her realize she was missing her sons' lives -- and her own. Spencer started counting calories, keeping her daily total under 1,500. She also began going on short walks around the block and parked her car in the farthest spot from the grocery store door. A few months later, Spencer and her husband separated. But instead of using food to cope with the rush of emotions as she once would have, Spencer turned to exercise. ""I used that as more motivation to stay healthy for the boys,"" she said. ""My goodness, if I'm going to have to do this on my own and be an example for them, I have to be strong."" Working out was difficult at first; the pain in her hips prevented her from moving very far, very fast. But over time she joined a walking club at work and started strength training one or two days a week. She focused on losing just 5 pounds at a time, because the thought of losing 60 pounds to reach a healthy BMI was intimidating. Reaching each smaller goal inspired her to keep going. By March 2013, she had lost 64 pounds. ""When you're that heavy, you feel like you've lost hope,"" Spencer said. ""When you finally reach your goal, it's the most amazing thing."" Every Sunday, the Spencer family goes on a 10-mile bike ride near their home in Aurora, Colorado. They eat no-sugar cereal and skim milk for breakfast, Lean Cuisine meals or veggie smoothies for lunch, and lean protein with vegetables and brown rice for dinner. Water is Spencer's ""secret weapon."" Her diet has become a lifestyle. She's careful about what she eats but allows herself treats in moderation. Deprivation is not the way to keep the weight off, she knows. Spencer's energy is up, and her pain is gone. But the happiness she feels can't compare to the joy on her sons' faces when she joins them on the playground. ""I am able to take my kiddos to the park and actually play with them instead of sitting on the sidelines.""","Jenny Spencer put her health on the back burner while caring for two kids and her husband .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Secret Service agent at the center of the Colombia prostitution scandal has been identified as Arthur Huntington, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Friday. According to the sources, Huntington was the agent in a seventh-floor hotel room in Cartagena who had a dispute over pay with an escort. CNN also learned that Huntington has left the Secret Service, but it was not clear under what circumstances, according to CNN's Drew Griffin. According to sources, the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at Hotel Caribe. One of these women, Dania Suarez, allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night, which brought the entire incident to light. Suarez, 24, through a statement credited to her attorney, said she was an escort, not a prostitute. At least three agents assigned to rooms on the seventh floor left Cartagena early, according to hotel records. Two agents have been cleared to return to work, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation. Monday, a man who identified himself as Arthur Huntington declined comment to a CNN producer. Thursday, someone at his residence closed the door and made no comment. No one answered the door Friday or responded to phone calls. The residence was just listed for sale this week. Huntington, 41, is married and the father of two boys, according to neighbors. A woman who identified herself as a family friend called the situation ""heartbreaking."" ""I know him and his character,"" she said of Huntington. ""I would question the allegations."" Also Friday, the Secret Service distributed new rules for its agents on assignment intended to prevent a repeat of such alleged misconduct, according to two government sources familiar with the resulting investigation. White House misses Grassley deadline . Called Enhanced Standards of Conduct, the new guidelines given to all Secret Service personnel make clear that standards of behavior required in the United States apply on missions abroad, the sources said. Effective immediately, the new standards require detailed briefings before each trip that will include safety precautions and any necessary designations of establishments and areas that are ""off limits"" for Secret Service personnel, the sources said. Also in the new standards, foreigners are banned from Secret Service hotel rooms at all times, except for hotel staff and host nation law enforcement and government officials on official business, according to the officials, and all Secret Service personnel are prohibited from going to a ""non-reputable establishment."" The new standards specify that U.S. laws apply to Secret Service personnel when traveling, rendering invalid the excuse that specific activity is legal in the foreign country, the officials said. In addition, the new guidelines allow moderate alcohol consumption when off duty, but prohibit alcohol consumption within 10 hours of reporting for duty or at any time when at the hotel where the protected official is staying, the officials explained. An additional supervisor from the Office of Professional Responsibility will now accompany the ""jump teams"" that bring vehicles for motorcades and other transportation, the officials said. Agents involved in the Colombia incident were part of such a jump team. First word of the new regulations came Thursday night, when Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas outlined them on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" after meeting with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan about the scandal that has embarrassed the 147-year-old agency and raised questions about possible security breaches. Allegations of further transgressions by agents have emerged after the initial reports of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes this month before President Barack Obama arrived in Cartagena for the Summit of the Americas. New claims include an account from El Salvador described by CNN affiliate Seattle TV station KIRO as very similar to the Colombia scandal, involving members of the Secret Service and other government agencies. A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of not being identified, acknowledged there had been missteps among Secret Service members. Such problems are to be expected over the agency's long history and don't necessarily reflect a systemic or cultural issue, the official said. ""We have had employees that have engaged in misconduct,"" the official said. ""People make mistakes."" Meanwhile, a congressional source said Thursday that reports of other incidents involving members of the agency, which is charged with protecting the president and other top officials as well as investigating criminal activity, have been brought to the attention of Congress. That includes the alleged incident in El Salvador, which the Secret Service has told Congress it is looking into as well, according to the congressional source. The KIRO report cited an unnamed U.S. government contractor who worked extensively with the Secret Service advance team in San Salvador before Obama's trip there in March 2011. The source said he was with about a dozen Secret Service agents and a few U.S. military specialists at a strip club in the city a few days before Obama arrived. The men drank heavily at the club, and most of them paid extra for access to a VIP section where they were provided sexual favors in return for cash, the source told the station. The station reported that the strip club's owner corroborated the allegations. The owner confirmed that a large number of agents, and some military escorts, ""descended on his club"" that week and were there at least three nights in a row, KIRO reported. The owner said his club routinely takes care of high-ranking employees of the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador as well as visiting agents from the FBI and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, KIRO said. The government contractor source said he told the agents it was a ""really bad idea"" to take the strippers back to their hotel rooms, but several agents bragged that they ""did this all the time"" and ""not to worry about it,"" KIRO reported. KIRO investigative reporter Chris Halsne told the CBS show ""This Morning"" on Thursday that he considers his source very credible, and he later told CNN that he had checked billing records, receipts, credentials and other information to confirm the contractor was with the Secret Service in Central America at the time of the incident. Brazilian ex-prostitute plans to sue U.S. Embassy . The source told him about the alleged scandal last year, while Halsne was in El Salvador on a different story. Halsne said he pressed for details at that time, but the man didn't want any information from him to be used then in a news story. After the allegations involving Secret Service agents in Colombia surfaced, Halsne again pressed his source, who this time agreed to the use of his account in the KIRO report. Sonia Ertel, manager of Lips club and restaurant, said Friday that she cannot be certain Secret Service agents were there. Ertel said: ""It is not ethical for any of our security or for me as a person to be in the entrance and question you: 'Excuse me, where are you from? What nationality do you have? What do you do as a profession? What kind of work do you do?'"" Responding to the KIRO report, Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said, ""The recent investigation in Cartagena has generated several news stories that contain allegations by mostly unnamed sources. Any information brought to our attention that can be assessed as credible will be followed up on in an appropriate manner."" CNN cannot independently confirm the allegations. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Thursday that his department is not investigating any of its troops over the reported incident in El Salvador. But the State Department is questioning its embassy staff in El Salvador about the allegations, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Thursday. The Drug Enforcement Administration also is prepared to look into, ""in an appropriate manner and immediately,"" allegations that it deems ""credible"" regarding its agents in El Salvador, agency spokesman Rusty Payne said. But he added that, while the DEA has seen news reports, ""We are unaware of any allegations of misconduct."" Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa -- the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received a briefing on the Colombia scandal this week by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano -- said the KIRO report ""only reaffirms the need for independent investigations by the (Homeland Security Department's independent) inspector general."" Appearing on CNN on Friday, Grassley said he had yet to get a response from the White House to his request for further information. Nine Secret Service members have resigned or are being forced out as a result of the scandal over the alleged events in Colombia. The military has launched its own investigation into 12 members who were in Colombia in advance of Obama's visit. CNN's Tom Cohen, Brian Todd, Paul Courson, Dana Bash and Shasta Darlington contributed to this report.","Family friend questions the allegations .

"(CNN) -- On separate trips to Guatemala and Zambia in the late 1980s and in the early 2000s, we each saw the devastating effect of the water and sanitation crisis firsthand. We saw a world in which basic needs went drastically unmet -- where a lack of safe water and sanitation robbed men, women and children of health, hope and even life. In the time it takes us to fill a glass of water -- about 21 seconds -- a child in some part of the world has died because of water-related disease. Watch video: Gary White on the ubiquitous force . The disturbing fact is that we've known how to deliver safe water and basic sanitation to people for more than 100 years. So, why are people still dying today because of it? Can you imagine if we had a cure for HIV/AIDS and millions of people continue to perish because of the inability to deliver treatment? It would be outrageous. Yet, more than 3.4 million people die each year from water, sanitation and hygiene-related causes. Most of these illnesses and deaths can be prevented. For example, diarrhea remains the second-leading cause of death among children younger than 5 globally. Nearly one in five child deaths -- about 1.5 million each year -- is because of diarrhea. It kills more young children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined. Knowledge of that alarming reality drove us to action. In 2009, we co-founded Water.org, an organization dedicated to ending this crisis in our lifetime. From the beginning, we focused on finding solutions that won't depend solely upon charity. We came up with WaterCredit, which applies the principles of microfinance to the water and sanitation sector. Through the program, individuals take affordable, small loans to finance the water and/or sanitation solution that works for them. According to our internal analysis, we've empowered more than 1 million people to gain access to safe water or sanitation. Our research also shows that investment in WaterCredit reaches five to 10 times as many people as a traditional grant over a 10-year period. At the current rate, we believe we could end the global water and sanitation crisis for nearly 100 million people by 2020. Safe water and toilets change everything. When you see the difference it makes in a community, it's the difference between night and day. We met lively, excited children, and women moving with ease and natural, joyful energy. We spent time with a group of children at a school where they demonstrated hand-washing techniques and talked about the important things in life -- their classrooms, their teachers and friends. We know about Muddumare, who was living with many family members in in a village outside of a rapidly growing city in India. ""We have 16 people in the house. Five years ago, we constructed our home by taking out a loan but we did not build a toilet. Nobody had a toilet in the village, and no one thought about having one in the house,"" said Muddumare. ""All of us used to go out in the open for defecation. But now as the population is increasing, there is no space for this."" Muddumare said his children are all becoming more educated and doing more ""modern"" work. He questioned how he and the family could go on defecating out in the open. Given the progress the world around him was making, it seemed ironic to him that his family did not have a toilet in the home. Muddumare made the decision to construct a toilet to make life better for his family. By taking out a WaterCredit loan of 7,000 rupees ($112 U.S. dollars) from Water.org's local microfinance partner, the Organization for the Development of People, he was able to build a toilet. He has 3 acres of land where he grows groundnuts, sorghum and finger millet. The yield from his crops helps him earn money, which he uses to repay the loan amount in easy monthly installments. Having a toilet means his family no longer was hindered by the time-consuming and physical constraints of open defecation. The change improved productivity and restored dignity. For many others, it saved health and transformed lives. We hope that in the coming year, more organizations, both in the private and public sector, will double down on water and sanitation-related investments. Together, we can accelerate the pace of progress against the enormous but solvable crisis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matt Damon and Gary White.","Matt Damon, Gary White: Millions die each year from lack of safe water and sanitation .
Damon, White: With WaterCredit program, we could help end the global water crisis .
They say clean water access improve productivity, restore dignity and transform lives .

"(CNN) -- What is life like for the men who build Dubai's skyscrapers? Human rights groups have repeatedly drawn attention to the low wages and living conditions of the emirate's corps of foreign workers (mostly from south and southeast Asia), but there have been few attempts to scratch the surface of their everyday life beyond the construction sites. A new documentary that opened in Dubai cinemas this week is hoping to change all that. ""Champ of the Camp"" chronicles an annual singing competition that takes place in Dubai's labor camps. Like many of the city's migrant workers, the subjects put up with long working days, relative isolation and inhospitable weather so they can send money back home; sometimes to children awaiting school fees or daughters awaiting dowries. ""Camp ka Champ"" (the Hindi name applied to the contest) offers them a rare bit of respite and the chance to earn cash prizes. ""The money I send back home to my family is how they make ends meet. It hasn't been easy; sometimes I feel I have no life,"" admits one contestant featured in the film. Western Union is the official sponsor of the competition. According to Rupa Vinod, the managing director at Right Track, the advertising agency that set up the contest, the UAE represents one of the largest markets for the money transfer firm. Many laborers use their services bi-monthly to send remittances. ""While there's not a commercial angle to the contest, it does help build loyalty with the brand,"" Vinod admits. ""People (in the camps) might trust the brand a little bit more now that it's closer to them."" Likened to ""American Idol"" with a Bollywood twist, Champ of the Camp has become increasingly popular over the years. When it launched in 2006, only 100 contenders auditioned. Last year, 3,000 applied. First-place winners take home AED10,000 ($2,722), other contestants can win items like TVs and home appliances . Though the subject of labor camps can be somewhat touchy in Dubai, with many expats living comparatively gilded lives at the expense of the city's migrant workers, there seems to be a lot of curiosity about how these men -- squirreled away into tower blocks on the fringes of the city -- live their daily lives. More than 1,200 viewers turned up at the film's premiere at the Dubai International Film Festival. ""The Dubai public has a curiosity about the men who built the city for them,"" explains Mahmoud Kaabour, the film's director. ""Many people live here for years and enjoy the champagne lifestyle without ever knowing how the other half have come to be here or what kind of lives they have,"" he adds. One of the more touching story lines in the film follows Adnan, a Pakistani worker who helped construct the Burj Khalifa. ""He could always see it in the remote distance, but he never walked along the fountains, or enjoyed its restaurants or went up to see its viewing deck,"" says Kaabour, who took him back to the site during filming. ""He stared at the tower and gave a really poignant reflection on what life in the Burj might be like compared to life in the camps. It was one of the critical scenes in the movie, and it really excited viewers."" At the end of the premiere, movie's characters took to the stage and performed a live concert, eliciting a standing ovation from the crowd. In a rare moment of engagement, many viewers hugged the participants and posed in photos with them. Despite the movie's popularity and critical acclaim, the journey from film festival to cinemas has been a financial struggle, and unless Kaabour gets more funding for his project, the likelihood it will last past this week is remote. ""The UAE is a tremendously expensive place to film,"" says Eva Sayre, the film's producer. ""We were able to get a couple of grants, but otherwise, the entire thing came out of our own pockets."" In hopes of raising enough money for marketing and distribution, Sayre and Kaabour have launched a crowd-funding campaign through aflamnah, a Middle East version of Kickstarter. ""We want the general public to hear the laborers tell their stories and to know who they are, but we also want to invite further pondering about the labor camp institutions,"" says Kaabour. ""We hope we cracked a dialogue that's going to go a bit further now that the film has hit cinemas.""","Documentary Champ of the Camp Chronicles a singing contest in Dubai's labor camps .

"(CNN) -- Award-winning writer/producer Don Payne, one of the creative minds who contributed to ""The Simpsons,"" died this week at his home in Los Angeles, CNN has confirmed.

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old Arkansas girl who was infected with a rare brain-eating parasite continues to improve, Arkansas Children's Hospital spokesman Tom Bonner said Sunday. Kali Hardig is eating, drinking, smiling and talking, Bonner said. She is even walking with assistance during therapy sessions. When Kali entered the hospital earlier this summer, she was in critical condition, unresponsive and unable to breathe without the assistance of a breathing tube. A new photo released Sunday shows the dramatic improvement she has made. In the photo, Kali is sitting up in her hospital bed, smiling. Kali's doctors have been in virtually uncharted territory as they treat her for the rare amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri. Of 128 known cases in the past half-century, just two patients have survived, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kali is one of two 12-year-olds who recently contracted the amoeba. Zachary Reyna of Florida died last month of the parasite, even after receiving the same experimental drug that was given to Kali. He contracted the amoeba after kneeboarding in a water-filled ditch by his house August 3, his family told CNN affiliate WBBH. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm, fresh water, most often in the southeastern United States. Between 2001 and 2010, there were 32 reported cases in the United States, the CDC says. Most of the cases occurred in the Southeast. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. You cannot be infected with the organism by drinking contaminated water, the CDC says. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali's case. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Kali's attending physicians, said they immediately started treating her with an antifungal medicine, antibiotics and a new experimental anti-amoeba drug doctors got directly from the CDC. They also reduced the girl's body temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Two weeks ago, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Pasala said that while other cases have not met with such favorable results, what may have made a real difference is that the girl's mother got her to the hospital so quickly. Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Kali's infection, according to a news release from the Arkansas Department of Health. Another case of the same parasite, also called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the news release said. What's in your pool water? The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the government agency's website states. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" CNN's Jacque Wilson, Jen Christiansen, John Bonifield, Caleb Hellerman, Jennifer Bixler and Leslie Holland contributed to this story.","Kali Hardig, 12, continues to make progress at Arkansas Children's Hospital .

"(CNN) -- She cuts an imposing figure on the tennis court, but Serena Williams has been stepping gingerly as she prepares to back up her stellar 2013 season. The world No. 1 has arrived in Brisbane to begin her preparations for next month's Australian Open, and she is wary of repeating the successive ankle injuries which have marred her last two campaigns Down Under. The first struck in the Queensland warm-up event two years ago, and then again last January in the opening match in Melbourne -- a factor which contributed to the American's shock fourth-round defeat by then teenager Sloane Stephens. ""I thought about it (at home in Florida during the off season) because I have steps in my room,"" Williams told reporters on Sunday. ""I thought, 'Gosh, I'm going to tip over these steps. I'm going to tape my ankles extra tight for the next four weeks.' ""If I can get a year without twisting my ankle I think I'll be good to go."" Williams overcame both injuries to end 2012 and 2013 as the dominant force in women's tennis, taking her grand slam haul to 17 titles -- five short of Steffi Graf's record. Williams' first opponent in Brisbane will be former world No. 9 Andrea Petkovic, who defeated American Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-4 7-5 in Sunday's opening round. Only four players beat Williams in 82 matches last season, and the German lost their only previous encounter. The Brisbane event will also feature world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka, who beat Williams in an exhibition in Thailand on Saturday, and Maria Sharapova -- making her WTA Tour comeback from a shoulder injury that has sidelined the Russian since August. Caroline Wozniack, another former world No. 1 who is now working with Sharapova's ex-coach Thomas Hogstedt, has been forced to pull out due to her own shoulder problem but expects to be fit for the following tournament in Sydney. ""Everyone, when they play me, they play pretty much amazing, really unbelievable,"" Williams said. ""I always have to be ready. I can't stop. I love competing. So for me, it's just about motivating myself and trying to reach new goals."" One of those was relaunching her clothes brand Aneres during her postseason break. ""I was interviewing so many people.

"Washington (CNN) -- Voting on strictly partisan lines, a House committee recommended Wednesday that Attorney General Eric Holder be cited for contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents relating to the botched Fast and Furious weapons sting operation. The vote ended an extraordinary daylong hearing that took place after President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege over some documents sought by the panel investigating Fast and Furious. The White House move means the Department of Justice can withhold some of the documents. The committee measure now goes to the full House for consideration, expected next week, of what would be an unprecedented action -- Congress holding a sitting attorney general in contempt. What happens if panel cites Holder for contempt? ""Unless the attorney general re-evaluates his choice and supplies the promised documents, the House will vote to hold him in contempt next week,"" said a statement by the chamber's Republican leaders. ""If, however, Attorney General Holder produces these documents prior to the scheduled vote, we will give the (committee) an opportunity to review in hopes of resolving this issue."" All 23 Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee supported the contempt measure, while the 17 Democrats opposed it, reflecting the deep political divide on the issue. Committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, refused to put off consideration of the measure, saying the White House assertion of executive privilege ""falls short"" of any reason to delay the hearing. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history . However, Issa said after the hearing that he believes a settlement to avoid an unprecedented contempt vote in the House is ""in the best interest of the Justice Department, Congress and those most directly affected by Operation Fast and Furious."" In a statement later Wednesday, Holder called Issa's decision to hold the vote ""an election-year tactic"" and ""an extraordinary, unprecedented and entirely unnecessary action, intended to provoke an avoidable conflict between Congress and the executive branch."" The committee's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, accused Issa of setting an ""impossible standard"" for Holder by initially demanding documents the attorney general is legally prohibited from providing. Now Issa has ""no interest in resolving"" the dispute with Holder, Cummings said. Wednesday's developments further heightened the drama of a high-profile showdown between Issa and Holder over the Fast and Furious program that dates back to subpoenas issued by the House committee last year. What do you think of the controversy? The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapon purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Issa's committee is specifically seeking documents that show why the Department of Justice decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that said top officials had only recently learned about Fast and Furious. The stalemate over the documents escalated dramatically Wednesday. CNN senior political analyst and former presidential adviser David Gergen said such dusts-ups are usually resolved by political negotiations.That's not been the case here. ""For a lot of Americans who don't understand the complexities and really don't care about the complexity of this, it is one more illustration ... that Washington is broken,"" Gergen said. But the impasse also shows something about Holder's resolve, he told ""John King USA."" ""He's stiffened his spine,"" Gergen said. ""He has been under pressure to resign from some quarters in the Republican Party. He ain't going anywhere."" Now the question is whether a settlement can be reached before the House vote. If the House finds Holder in contempt, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted for criminal contempt, according to Alan Morrison, associated dean at George Washington University Law School. ""It would look like terrible overreaching to go for criminal contempt,"" Morrison said, which carries a penalty of $1,000 and up to one year in prison. Instead, Morrison said, it is more likely the House would pursue civil prosecution in federal court. The House committee vote came more than six hours after notice that Obama had asserted executive privilege. In a letter to Obama seeking that action, Holder said the documents involved related to the Justice Department's ""response to congressional oversight and related media inquiries,"" and that release of internal executive branch documents would have ""significant, damaging consequences."" Holder contempt vote could come next week . Holder also said releasing the documents would ""inhibit the candor of executive branch deliberations in the future and significantly impair the ability of the executive branch to respond independently and effectively to congressional oversight."" Holder said he offered to turn over some of the documents sought by Issa when they met Tuesday in a final effort to resolve the dispute before Wednesday's hearing. Issa, however, said Holder put unreasonable conditions on his offer. In a letter to Issa after Tuesday's meeting, Deputy Attorney General James Cole reiterated Holder's position that the documents would show Holder had nothing to hide about his role in Fast and Furious. Cole noted that the lone point of dispute was whether the February 4, 2011, letter was part of a broader effort to obstruct a congressional investigation. ""The answer to that question is an emphatic 'no,' and we have offered the committee the opportunity to satisfy itself that that is so,"" Cole wrote. The department says it already has handed over more than 7,000 pages of records to House investigators and that the remaining material Issa wants could jeopardize criminal prosecutions. Issa and other Republicans on the panel mentioned Brian Terry's death by name in accusing Holder and the Justice Department of trying to stonewall the investigation of what happened. ""The Department of Justice has fought this investigation every step of the way,"" Issa said. ""At the heart of the congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious are disastrous consequences: a murdered Border Patrol Agent, his grieving family seeking answers, countless deaths in Mexico, and the souring effect on our relationship with Mexico,"" Issa said in a statement. ""Congress has not just a right but an obligation to do all that it can to uncover exactly what happened and ensure that it never occurs again. "" See letter to Issa from deputy attorney general (.PDF) Terry's family issued a statement Wednesday that called for all of the documents sought by the committee to be turned over. ""Our son lost his life protecting this nation, and it is very disappointing that we are now faced with an administration that seems more concerned with protecting themselves rather than revealing the truth behind Operation Fast and Furious,"" the statement said. The mother of another federal agent said Wednesday she wants to know the ""full truth"" about his death. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata, who was working for the United States in Mexico, was murdered in February 2011 when his vehicle was ambushed on a highway between Mexico City and Monterrey. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, last year said he wanted to know if a Texas-based ""gun walking"" program may have played a role in Zapata's murder. He said one of the weapons used in the slaying was allegedly purchased in Texas and trafficked to Mexico. ""Unfortunately, the situation regarding Fast and Furious as well as other gun-walking operations has been something that has damaged the lives of many,"" Zapata's mother, Mary, said in a statement. ""I would have hoped that transparency would have been a priority so that we, like so many others, could get some answers."" Holder floats 'Fast and Furious' deal with Congress . The Tuesday meeting between Issa and Holder amounted to little more than a reiteration of the positions the two staked out in an exchange of letters the previous week. ""Any claims that the Justice Department has been unresponsive to requests for information are untrue,"" Holder said, noting he shut Fast and Furious down. The subpoenas issued last year originally cited a broad array of documents, including wiretap requests and other materials involving confidential sources that Holder argued he was prevented by law from supplying. Issa narrowed the request in negotiations with Holder in recent weeks. Holder rejects resignation call at heated Senate hearing . Democrats argued the documents demanded by Issa related to internal discussions about responding to the Fast and Furious investigation, rather than the committee's intended purpose of finding out who authorized the failed program. The party-line division in the panel extended to the portrayal of the Tuesday meeting attended by Holder, Issa, Cummings and others. Issa and Republicans rejected the conditions of Holder's offer, while Cummings and Democrats said the panel should work with Holder to seek a resolution. Issa said he was surprised by Obama's action and questioned whether the White House's role in Fast and Furious ""has been greater than previously acknowledged."" On the border: Guns, drugs -- and a betrayal of trust . Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN he previously traced the program only up to the level of an assistant attorney general. ""Now it raises the question of what does the president know and when did he know it by the claim of executive privilege,"" said Grassley, who participated in Tuesday's meeting. But Carl Tobias, professor at the University of Richmond's School of Law, said it does not appear Obama was involved with the Fast and Furious program. ""He is trying to protect the prerogatives of the department and the people who work for him,"" Tobias said of the executive privilege. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that while Holder may be embarrassed, he won't ultimately be found in contempt. ""This is going to be just another political dispute,"" Toobin told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""If people remember at all, they'll remember 23 Republicans were for it, 17 Democrats were against it."" CNN's Terry Frieden, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett , Allison Brennan and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","House leaders say the full chamber could vote on contempt next week .

"(CNN) -- The Democratic Party's vote Thursday for the ""nuclear option"" was a move to deprive the minority party in the Senate of a procedure it has abused to block President Barack Obama's judicial nominees and other appointees. Before, a single Republican could unilaterally and without any reason block a nominee from receiving a simple up-and-down vote on the Senate floor. The ""nuclear option,"" an overblown term for changing Senate rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60, will put an end to using that procedure -- the filibuster -- to block appointees. Republicans have been gumming up the works of our government, both because they ideologically favor the dysfunction of government and because they want to fundamentally undermine the President at every step. And so during Obama's five years in office, Republicans in the Senate have confirmed just one nominee to the Court of Appeals in Washington, often regarded as the nation's second highest court after the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Republicans have blocked three appointees to the court and held up countless other nominations to other important posts. There had been a concern that if Democrats went nuclear, nothing would stop Republicans from employing equally restrictive procedures should Democrats be the minority party in the Senate again. And yet, to anyone watching Washington today, is there any question that Republicans have abandoned any sense of bipartisan decorum and are solely functioning as anti-government, anti-Obama bullies? If Republicans repeatedly resort to such childish thuggery when they're the minority party, it's hard to imagine them behaving much better if they're put in charge. If Democrats didn't flip the nuclear switch now to allow appointments to go through, Republicans will surely flip it later. At least if Democrats do it first, they get to finally vote on some critical nominees and move the governance and sanctity of our nation forward. In a statement, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had said that attacking Obamacare is a priority over voting to fill key vacancies in the nation's courts. Sadly, Republicans in Congress are making a mockery of their constitutional obligations while turning the hallowed halls of our government into nothing more than a playground for their ideological circus. Sometimes that circus is so absurd it hurts. For instance, Republicans have repeatedly tried to blame the financial crisis on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rather than -- for instance -- the deliberate scamming of big banks that are now paying massive settlements for their wrongdoing. And yet that topsy-turvy reasoning aside, Republicans are blocking the nomination of Rep. Mel Watt to lead the Federal Housing Finance Authority, deliberately maintaining a vacancy in the position charged with regulating and monitoring Fannie and Freddie. The Constitution lays out the Senate's responsibility in this regard as clearly secondary to, not equal with, the president's authority: . ""[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law."" Advice and consent. Not block and redirect and hold up and try to impose the will of the Senate's minority party on the nominations and actions of the president. And so Democrats have finally had enough with a Republican Party that seems determined to pitch a temper tantrum about everything Obama does, no matter that he won two elections and his policies are widely popular with voters. After all, even though the President's approval ratings took a hit, his numbers at 39% are still ""sky high"" compared with those of Congress, which has a 9% approval rating according to a recent Gallup poll. That's the lowest approval rating since Gallup has collected such data. Moreover, while such low numbers overall likely reflect voter frustration with the partisan squabble of unproductive government, polls show that voters consistently blame Republicans far more than Democrats for this dynamic, whether for causing the government shutdown or deliberately sabotaging economic progress to hurt the President's image. ""Nuclear option"" is a loaded term. Proponents of the measure call it the ""constitutional option"" in so far as it is constitutional and it would finally hold Senate Republicans' feet to the fire to perform their constitutional duty. That indeed seems a more accurate description and one that reminds us all that it was Republicans' own reckless and destructive behavior that brought us to this point in the first place. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.","With ""nuclear option,"" judicial nominees can be confirmed with a simple majority vote .
Sally Kohn: This will keep GOP from using a procedure to block President's appointments .
Kohn: GOP made government virtually dysfunctional, blocked Obama at every turn .
This will hold Republicans' feet to the fire to do their constitutional duty, she says ."
"(CNN) -- As a country music recording artist, as an entertainer and especially as a husband and father, life can get hectic. I realized early on the importance of having a routine to manage such a busy schedule. But my body kept giving me ""reminders"" earlier in my career that something was just not right. In the mid-'90s, I started to experience tingling and numbness on my right side along with facial spasms. I hoped they would pass, but symptoms continued to appear all too frequently. After a battery of tests, I was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the most common form of multiple sclerosis. My diagnosis came when I was 26. It surprised me to learn that of 400,000 Americans with MS, many are diagnosed between ages 20 and 50, like I was. I kept wondering, ""Why me? Why now?"" My career was progressing, and there were many positive things going on in my life: I had just recorded my fourth album and was celebrating the birth of my first child. So this country boy decided he was not going down without a fight. With support from my family and friends, I realized that I needed to stop dwelling on being diagnosed with a chronic disease, and instead focus on finding a groove. To do that, I had to develop a routine to manage my condition, which helped me look forward for the first time since being diagnosed. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can be tricky to manage because it affects everyone differently. In fact, it took almost a year of working with my neurologist to find the routine that worked best for me. Living with multiple sclerosis means struggles and triumphs . I've learned to eat a healthy diet and keep up a moderate exercise routine, take my medication and rely on love and support from my family to get through the tough times. Now that I've found a routine that works, I stick with it and encourage others with this illness to do the same. I'm proud to help lead the ""Stick With It"" campaign to educate patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis about the importance of sticking with a routine for the long haul. Experts agree that patients do better when sticking with a routine that works for them. There's a lot of information out there that can sometimes be confusing, but I encourage folks to talk to their doctor to find what can work best for them. ""Stick With It"" includes national public service announcements to start airing this month, along with a Facebook page that is coming soon. Both will provide tips on how MS patients can work with their doctor. ""Stick With It"" is in partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals and Band Against MS, the charity I founded a decade ago to help provide educational information and fund programs for those with MS. I didn't have the information available when I was diagnosed, and I want to make sure others with MS don't feel as lost in this disease as I once was. Helping others with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis has been close to my heart for some time. It's all the motivation I need to ""Stick With It!"" In addition to being a country music artist, Walker is also an ambassador for the National MS Society and a paid spokesman for Teva Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer of one of nine medications approved for treating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.","Clay Walker was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis at 26 .

"(CNN) -- Starbucks, McDonald's, Zara -- many of the international chains have tried to colonize Paris but the city seems to have put up more resistance than, say, London or New York. Parisians still love their little neighborhood vendors selling one thing and selling it very well -- shops of a kind apparently threatened with extinction in other big cosmopolitan cities. Not that these often quirky Paris establishments are all old, family-run and hidden down a side street.

After the success of his first store in Nice, optician and eyewear-collector Charles Mosa opened this second shop in Paris in 2011. It's no ordinary opticians, however -- Mosa hunts down dead stock from defunct factories, creating a collection of never-worn-before frames dating from 1900 to 1980.

"(CNN) -- Facebook users, mark my words: You'll revolt when the site rolls out its new features in the coming weeks. Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the website's biggest redesign so far, and only a fraction of the website's 800 million users seem to have the slightest clue. I'm not talking about the new real-time ""Ticker"" at the top right of your Facebook profile. I'm not even talking about the ""Top Stories"" that now appear at the top of your Facebook news feed -- those are tiny, insignificant changes compared to what's just around the corner. But boy, did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements. Among my Facebook friends, more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit. Of course, they did no such thing. How will they react when Facebook throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely new? If you use Facebook, chances are you're unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month (full disclosure: Mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with Facebook on a social news app). Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebook's 90-minute announcement of the new profile pages last week. And an even smaller percentage of Facebook users have discovered, like I did, that you can enable the new ""Facebook Timeline"" profile page right now so you're prepared for the launch. So what's the big change? Facebook will be switching profile pages, perhaps optionally at first, to a new format called ""Facebook Timeline."" I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format. I'm someone who thrives on trying new things, but this change was radical even for me. Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back, so I stuck with it for a few days. I'm so glad I did: Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made. Here's what'll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched: Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two, with boxes of text, photos, videos and even maps of your favorite locations. Rather than just displaying your most recent activities, your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life, all the way back to your birth. Facebook will become a record of your existence: All your memories, your victories and your defeats, your loves, your losses and everything in between. You'll be shocked, as I was, when this change is made. Suddenly your life is laid out before you, the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by Facebook's algorithms. You'll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now, and where all your most recent updates went. You'll add a big, new ""Cover photo"" to your page and waste a few hours preening your Timeline, choosing to feature your happiest memories, hide the inconsequential ones, and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments. And you'll realize, as I did, that Facebook knows you better than you know yourself. Through this process, you'll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence. While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning, or what time you left for work, or where you had lunch, Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events, discards the irrelevant ones, finds the most emotive, the most visual, the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus. Much like our memories, Facebook Timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years. It's a marvel of computer programming: An algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory; perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional response. So yes, you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks. Then, like me, you'll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you didn't even recognize it at first: A meaningful social network. And like any other groundbreaking technology -- the PC, the smartphone, the iPad -- you'll wonder why life wasn't always this way, and how you got by without it.","Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look .

"(CNN) -- Tom Hanks' upcoming movie ""Cloud Atlas"" might be a little confusing for those who haven't read the book on which it's based. In the movie, actors play multiple races with varying accents and even different genders -- and they do it across eras past, present, and future. Despite this, Hanks -- who called the screenplay a ""page turner like 'Thornbirds' "" -- thinks it will become self-explanatory as the film progresses, especially for careful observers. ""Even before the opening credits say 'Cloud Atlas,' "" Hanks said, ""Jim Broadbent as (the character) Timothy Cavendish explains the movie in one line. If you're hip to figure that out, you'll see it."" For those who miss that explanation, Hanks had one of his own ready: ""I found it actually gave a language to the connections we all have with each other,"" he said. ""What 'Cloud Atlas' is all about -- individual people have to make this decision between cruelty and kindness, someone has to go against a mindless version of the status quo, and it's this idea that great acts of kindness last forever and reverberate through eternity. It's another definition of human history."" But, said Hanks, some stories are more important than others to the larger narrative. Take presidential politics for example: Hanks takes the recent round of presidential debates with a grain of salt. ""You know what? The debates are just TV shows,"" he said. ""Now, they carry a lot of weight because of all the stuff that goes on, but they're just TV shows. I don't think there's any new policy that comes out of them."" Hanks said it's ""interesting to watch the ballyhoo"" following a debate, especially regarding a candidate's choice of words, such as Mitt Romney's ""women in binders"" comment. ""You know what? There are a lot of people who have binders full of women,"" Hanks joked. ""Actually, I have a loose leaf notebook that has them in it."" But despite the discussion following a televised debate, Hanks doesn't think the actual debate is much of a factor in deciding the election. He cites the John Kerry-George W. Bush debates in 2004, in which Kerry would jump in the polls following a showdown with Bush, and yet Kerry ultimately lost the race. So even if one candidate seems to dominate, and the other crumbles, it won't matter, Hanks said, ""unless someone says something so incredibly dumb that you can't trust them after a while. But those guys aren't going to do that. They're both good at what they're doing. They've both got it. But I don't think anybody says anything that magically alters our concept of anything."" But, as Hanks well knows, anyone can say something ""incredibly dumb"" once in a while. Hanks, for example, did so on ""Good Morning America"" Friday. Speaking in the voice of one of his ""Cloud Atlas"" characters, he accidentally swore on live television. But will it make anyone trust him less? Probably not, but it might encourage networks to use a seven-second delay while he's promoting the film -- an idea he suggested seconds after using the F-word. ""Man, oh man,"" Hanks apologized on ""GMA."" ""I'm sorry, I slipped. ... I have never done that before. I would apologize to the kids in America that are watching right now. And let me say the next time I'm on the show, there will be a seven-second delay."" Tom Hanks to make Broadway debut .","Hanks is appearing in the new film ""Cloud Atlas""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Armed tribesmen kidnapped a German national in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on Saturday night, officials said Sunday. The German was studying Arabic at a language center in the old city of Sanaa. ""He was on his way home in the Safia districts of the capital when he was snatched from the street and most likely taken to the central province of Mareb,"" an Interior Ministry official told CNN. ""Efforts are ongoing to ensure the safe release of the German national,"" said Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi. Kidnapping has long been a problem in Yemen, with tribes often using foreign nationals as bargaining chips in their dealings with the central government. But the past 24 months have proven even more dangerous for foreigners. Strict checkpoints have been in place in Sanaa since Thursday night. The official blamed tribal militants for being behind the kidnapping but would not rule out the possibility of al Qaeda involvement. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network. Over the last six months, nine foreigners have been kidnapped in Yemen, mainly by militants who have turned to kidnapping for huge financial gains. On Friday, rebels battling for control of northern Yemen clashed against tribesmen, leaving dozens dead in fighting just miles from the country's capital. At least 42 people were killed and more than a dozen injured in clashes between Houthi Shiite militants and fighters from the Sunni Hashid tribe in Amran province, which is seen as a linchpin to controlling the region, according to two security officials and a local tribal leader. The reports of fighting come as cease-fire negotiations are under way to put an end to the fighting that has plagued Yemen for months, spurred in part by a power vacuum left by the departure of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report .","German language student abducted on Saturday night in Sanaa's old city .

"(CNN) -- In the aftermath of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, embattled Penn State University is hosting a sexual abuse conference and says boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and Elizabeth Smart will give speeches. The conference will be held on October 29-30 and comes after the well-publicized scandal that culminated with the conviction of Sandusky, a former assistant Penn State football coach on multiple charges of sexual abuse of young boys. ""Over the last nine months, Penn State has made a commitment to becoming a leader in the research, prevention and treatment of child sexual abuse, and we have taken a number of steps to ensure that our communities are safer,"" Penn State President Rodney Erickson said in a message promoting the conference. Leonard, a boxing icon, is known for his lightning fast hands, legendary fights and recently for his role in several reality television shows. But last year in his autobiography, Leonard delivered the surprising admission that early in his career he was sexually abused by an unnamed Olympic boxing coach. Penn State accreditation in jeopardy over sex abuse scandal . Smart made headlines in 2002 when she was kidnapped from her Utah home at age 14 and held captive for nine months. Her kidnapping stunned the nation, and the media covered the months-long search to find her. Her abductor, Brian David Mitchell, sexually abused her during her time in captivity and is serving life in prison for the kidnapping and assault. Recently Smart has married and become an advocate for change related to child abduction. Penn State has had its share of bad headlines since Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 male victims. In July former FBI Director Louis Freeh released a report on Penn State's handling of the sex-abuse allegations against Sandusky, stating that the school's leadership showed ""total and consistent disregard"" for youths sexually abused by Sandusky. Also last month, the NCAA fined Penn State $60 million, banned the football program from bowl games for four years, stripped scholarships and took away the team's wins from 1998 to 2011.

"(CNN) -- K.S. ""Bud"" Adams Jr., the founder and owner of the Tennessee Titans/Houston Oilers football franchise and a co-founder of the American Football League, died Monday morning at his home in Houston, the team said. He was 90. Adams owned the team for more than 53 years, starting in Houston, where his Oilers began play in 1960 as a charter member of the NFL's new competitor, the AFL. Adams, an oil company founder, teamed with other businessmen, including eventual Dallas Texans and Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, to form the eight-team AFL in 1959. The Oilers won two AFL championships before the league merged with the NFL in 1970. The Oilers franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, eventually settling in Nashville as the Tennessee Titans. His franchise reached the Super Bowl once during his stewardship: in January 2000, when the Titans lost 23-16 to the St. Louis Rams. People we lost in 2013 . Adams' death came three days after ""Bum"" Phillips, the man Adams employed as Oilers coach and general manager from 1975 to 1980, died at age 90.

"(CNN) -- An Alabama man convicted of raping his former neighbor and friend was sentenced November 13 to 20 years in a state penitentiary on the lead charge, and 10 years each on the lesser offenses. Except that he wasn't. The victim, Courtney Andrews, told CNN she was outraged by the sentencing. ""I don't know how any of this is possible."" Austin Clem, 25, was convicted of one count of forcible rape and two counts of second-degree rape for attacks that Andrews said started when she was 13. ""Honestly, I didn't understand when I first heard the sentence,"" said Andrews, now 20. ""I was expecting him to spend a long time in prison."" She said she hadn't talked about the abuse because of threats. ""I had to grow up at a very, very young age, and I know what it's like to have your life threatened and that no one will understand me."" Even though the sentencing order says on its face that Clem will serve his time in a state penitentiary, that same order adds that he will serve none of his time in a state penitentiary. People are outraged. Moreover, they are confused. Was this a legal sentence? If so, was it a moral sentence? 'Suspended' sentences: When 'incarceration' means anything but . People have every reason to be confused. Sentencing statutes are routinely complex, and Alabama's is no exception. Most state sentencing schemes follow a common theme, arriving at an individual's punishment based on the 1) gravity of the offense; and 2) the defendant's prior record; which can then be aggravated or mitigated by any other factors the court wants to consider. Lately, in light of the Marissa Alexander case, mandatory minimum sentences have been harshly criticized. ""Mando-mins"" as they are sometimes called, force a judge to sentence a minimum number of years, preventing a judge from considering the individual defendant's unique circumstances, and showing mercy where appropriate. The Austin Clem case highlights the issue at the other end of the spectrum: whether judges can have too much discretion in sentencing convicted felons. In the Clem case, the judge's discretion came from his authority to impose a ""split sentence."" Let's look at the lead charge and the sentence, taken verbatim from the order of sentence: ""Count I- Twenty (20) years in the State Penitentiary, split sentence, to serve two (2) years in [a community-based program], balance suspended and placed on three (3) years supervised probation."" Yes, you read that right. It essentially says: Twenty years in prison -- except that it will be zero years, and none of it in prison. The judge likely relied upon Section 15-18-8 of the Alabama Code, which explicitly gives judges discretion to suspend a significant portion of a defendant's sentence. A suspended sentence is incarceration in name only: The defendant will serve that time out of custody. Clem received 20 years. In this jurisdiction, for sentences between 15 and 20 years, it appears that a mandatory minimum applies: The judge must order at least three and up to five years, and then may suspend the rest. Here's where it gets strange: The Alabama Supreme Court has held that even the incarceration portion of a split sentence (the three-year minimum) may be suspended. So 20 years can mean zero years. Why give so much discretion to judges? In Alabama, the rules of procedure direct judges to consider alternatives to long prison terms. Why? The rules cite skyrocketing costs associated with actual confinement and call attention to prison overcrowding. That prison overcrowding leads to uncertainty: In other words, the judges don't know that the prison can even accommodate their sentence, so they might as well mete out a sentence that can actually be carried out. An illegal sentence vs. an immoral sentence . For many, it doesn't matter that this might have been a legal sentence. The outrage is directed not at the legality, but the morality of the punishment. Did the judge have a moral obligation to incarcerate Clem? What would you have done? Would you have given credence to the defense's argument that the sex was consensual? Is it more important to you as a judge that Clem get the counseling that sex offenders desperately need? Or is it more important that he be isolated from society? The idea of punishment for criminals is justified by a few different goals. Incarceration serves to quarantine criminals and protect the rest of us in society from them. Another goal of punishment is rehabilitation. Like it or not, most sex offenders will eventually serve their sentences and be back on the street. Given the risk of repeat offenses, rehabilitation of these felons could be the most critical factor in protecting society. But punishment also recognizes simple retribution as a goal. Retribution is the idea that a punishment should, in theory, be equivalent to the crime. While retribution can also achieve vengeance, it serves a more practical purpose. A society that fails to punish offenders risks citizens taking matters into their own hands -- which threatens the stability of the society itself. So, if you are a retribution-type judge, you'd probably sentence Clem to long-term incarceration -- even though the legislature has effectively told you that, because of overcrowding, he might not serve that whole sentence. If you are a rehabilitation-type judge, or you worry about Clem's dependents, you might do as this judge did, and focus on the rehabilitation, with the idea that more progress can be made on the outside than on the inside. As long as the sentence is legal, as a judge, the choice is yours: Do you focus on retribution? Or rehabilitation? One thing is for certain, you may not agree with the judge's sentence in the Austin Clem case. Indeed, the prosecution in this case is not going gently into the good night. The prosecution has now asked an appeals court to fix what it calls an illegal sentence, claiming the judge had no authority to impose the two-year minimum, and should have at least imposed the three year minimum. That appears to be a correct reading of the law. Of course, if the judge can suspend the entire sentence anyway, including the mandatory minimum, is it a distinction without a difference? The prosecution also claims that felons convicted of first-degree rape are excluded by law from community-based programs, because rape is so fundamentally a crime of violence. If the judge misread the law here, the prosecution may succeed. If so, the court will have to resentence Clem -- but if the judge can still suspend the entire sentence, could Clem get an even better deal? If you can't accept it, then your beef is not only with the judge. Your beef is with the Alabama legislature and the Alabama courts that enacted not only the rules, but warned the justice system that it simply could not accommodate prison terms. Your beef is with the same prisons that don't have enough beds, leading to the crisis. Finally, your beef is with the Alabama Supreme Court, which sanctioned this practice. Because even if this sentence is ultimately legal, you may still conclude that it is an immoral one. Unfortunately, there's no appeals court for that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Danny Cevallos.","An Alabama man was sentenced to no prison time for rape conviction .

"International air passengers face tightened security on U.S.-bound flights following the alleged attempt by Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab to bomb a Christmas Day flight heading for Detroit.  U.S. travel and security authorities, international airlines and airports and aviation organizations have all moved quickly to implement a range of measures that will impact travelers' normal routine.  Which flights are affected by the new measures? At present only flights to the United States are affected. What are the measures? The Transportation Security Administration, which oversees the security for U.S. travel, says it has issued a directive for additional security measures to be implemented for flights as they leave their last stop before the United States. The authority has not made public the directive. But it said in a statement that passengers can expect to see extra security ""at international airports such as increased gate screening including pat-downs and bag searches. During flight, passengers will be asked to follow flight crew instructions, such as stowing personal items, turning off electronic equipment and remaining seated during certain portions of the flight."" Individual airlines and airports will each interpret the TSA directive in their own way. But anecdotal advice suggests that passengers are not allowed to leave their seats for the bathroom or to access luggage during the final hour of any flight, nor keep blankets or pillows on their laps. Passenger Niki Yazzie, who was on a flight Saturday from Brussels, Belgium, to Dulles Airport in Virginia told CNN that passengers not allowed to leave their seats for the last hour of the flight. There have also been reported bans on the use of laptops and MP3 players. What will be the knock-on impact on air travel? The measures, which only apply to U.S.-bound flights, are not at present as severe as those introduced after 9/11 or the revelation of the liquid bomb plot in August 2006. CNN aviation analyst Richard Quest cautions: ""If the measures are just for U.S.-bound flights then they're workable. If they are for all passenger flights then things will grind to a halt. It will not be as bad as the ban on liquids but it will be close."" Can passengers expect more extensive precautions? Quest says that the Detroit incident has exposed a hole in airport security. ""This is their worst nightmare,"" he said, ""someone following procedure and still getting through. They are trying to avoid the ultimate -- the ban on hand luggage and the physical search. But they have now been forced into the latter."" He adds that airlines would eventually ease the severity of some of the measures. ""There's no way a major carrier will tell its business class passengers that they can't have a pillow and blanket."" American carriers tend to be the first to introduce security measures and the last to abandon them -- to the benefit of rival airlines. What are airlines telling passengers? All are following a similar line -- check before you fly, turn up early, expect tougher security and skimp on the hand luggage. British Airways has advised that ""only one item of hand luggage is allowed for all passengers traveling to the U.S. from Heathrow, Gatwick or London City. This applies to passengers whose journey originates in London, as well as those who are transferring flights."" It adds that holiday presents in hand luggage will need to be unwrapped -- but only for U.S.-bound flights. American Airlines meanwhile advises that ""all passengers should plan to arrive at the airport at least three hours in advance of their flight's departure to allow extra time for check-in and the boarding process."" Cathay Pacific states that additional security measures will include: ""Pat down check by security personnel and physical inspection of their cabin baggage and personal property prior to boarding; and, restricting the use of cabin phones at any time during the flight. ""Passengers will be required to cooperate with cabin crew on any other inflight security measures as instructed."" What does this mean for passengers? After previous scares extra security measures have been introduced, only to eventually be scaled back slightly. Now, life for travelers is likely to become more complicated again. ""After this latest incident there will now be the normal fuss and furor for an airline,"" said Quest. Female passengers, for example, might have to put handbags and purses in hand luggage rather than being allowed to carry them in addition. Will travelers from certain countries be affected? A leaked copy of the TSA's Standard Operating Procedures, published online in early December, stated that travelers from certain nations -- Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Somalia, Iraq, Yemen or Algeria -- should be referred for screening. The inclusion of Yemen is notable as the country where Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab says the explosive device was acquired, according to a U.S. federal security bulletin. Quest says that while positive vetting -- where certain groups of travelers are targeted -- would not be enforceable, it may take place covertly. How long will these measures continue? ""Patdown is here to stay on U.S.-bound flights,"" says Quest, adding that it would even apply to all family members heading for a break at Disneyworld in Orlando.  ""This incident has exposed what the airline authorities hoped would not be shown up.""","U.S. authority in charge of travel security issues new directive on measures after alleged terror bid .

"Santa Ana, California (CNN) -- A surveillance video played a key role as closing arguments got underway Tuesday in the trial of two former Fullerton, California, police officers accused in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man. Kelly Thomas was severely beaten by deputies the night of July 5, 2011. He later died in a hospital. The surveillance camera footage shows Thomas being beaten, clubbed, and stunned with a Taser by police. The case drew national headlines. During closing arguments, District Attorney Tony Rackaukas told jurors that the confrontation was started by former police officer Manuel Ramos. On the video Ramos can be heard telling Thomas, ""These fists, they are going to f*** you up."" Rackauckas told the jury that Kelly Thomas was simply trying to protect himself from an unprovoked beating. Rackauckas told the jury, ""Kelly Thomas pleaded -- pleaded -- that he could not breathe. Apologized. But the use of force continued."" But an attorney for one of the police officers painted a very different picture of that night. John Barnett told jurors the case was ""not about a about a homeless, helpless, harmless Kelly Thomas."" Barnett painted a picture of Thomas as a mentally ill methamphetamine addict with a violent past. Barnett argued that Thomas was uncooperative with officers who were responding to a complaint that a homeless man was attempting to break into parked cars. The prosecution and the defense even disagree about the cause of Kelly Thomas's death. The coroner ruled that Thomas died from respiratory failure as a result of the beating. Defense experts have testified that Thomas's death was due to heart abnormalities caused by long-term drug use. Barnett told jurors, ""There is a controversy among the leading minds in the field."" Former officer Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. He faces a possible sentence of 15 years to life in prison if convicted. He is the first police officer charged with murder in an on-duty incident in Orange County history. A second former officer, Jay Cincinelli, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force in the case. Both were fired from the Fullerton police department following the beating incident.","Kelly Thomas, 37, died after being beaten by Fullerton Police Department officers .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Elie Wiesel, the Nazi concentration camp survivor who went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize, showed little inclination this week to make peace with accused swindler Bernie Madoff, whom he called ""one of the greatest scoundrels, thieves, liars, criminals."" Elie Wiesel called on the federal government to bail out charities just as it has bailed out carmakers and banks. ""Could I forgive him? No,"" the 80-year-old told a panel assembled Thursday by Conde Nast's Portfolio Magazine at New York's 21 Club to discuss Madoff, whose alleged victims included Wiesel and his foundation, The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. ""To forgive, first of all, would mean that he would come on his knees and ask for forgiveness,"" the Auschwitz survivor said. ""He wouldn't do that."" Madoff, 70, is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that may have cost investors up to $50 billion. He faces one charge of securities fraud in connection with an international scheme that has cost some investors their life savings and could land him in prison for up to 20 years. Wiesel said a wealthy friend who has known Madoff for 50 years introduced them. The two men met twice over dinner, and Wiesel checked with financial experts whom he trusted before investing all of his and his wife's personal money. Then, once Madoff had gained his trust, Wiesel invested all $15.2 million that his foundation had amassed, he said. ""We thought he was God, we trusted everything in his hands,"" the Boston University humanities professor said. Wiesel put his friend's loss at $50 million. Wiesel rejected the suggestion that ""affinity fraud,"" the tendency for people to trust others of similar background, played any role in leaving him vulnerable to Madoff. Both men are Jewish. ""It's not the Jewishness in him, it's the inhumanity in this man who simply believed he can go around depriving people of their livelihoods. What he has done to certain people, it breaks my heart,"" he said. ""At the end, he went down to swindle thousands and thousands of people, and hurt thousands and thousands of people.

Wiesel offered a punishment he would like to see meted out to the financier, who is under house arrest but has not been indicted. ""I would like him to be in a solitary cell with a screen, and on that screen, for at least five years of his life, every day and every night there should be pictures of his victims, one after the other after the other, always saying, 'Look, look what you have done to this poor lady, look what you have done to this child, look what you have done.' ""But nothing else -- he should not be able to avoid those faces, for years to come. This is only a minimum punishment."" Madoff's attorney, Ira Sorkin, said he understands Wiesel's point of view, but said Madoff must be presumed innocent.

"(CNN) -- With their budgets teetering on bankruptcy, states are digging deep to find creative ways to ease their financial woes. If marijuana were legalized, it could become California's No. 1 cash crop. Although fiscal year 2009 was grim for states, observers predict that 2010 will be even worse. ""The numbers that states are looking at in terms of their shortfalls is truly staggering. And all of this is happening in an environment where raising taxes is still pretty toxic, and it's pretty explosive,"" said Sujit CanagaRetna, a senior fiscal analyst for the Council of State Governments. Instead of raising taxes, states are putting taxes and fees on specific items and services as they try to decrease their budget gaps. ""You see this blizzard of fees popping up all over the country and in very unusual places,"" CanagaRetna said. One of the more controversial ideas is to legalize the sale of marijuana, as proposed in a bill introduced in California's state legislature by Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano this year. The bill proposed taxing pot by $50 per ounce. If legalized, marijuana could become California's No. 1 cash crop, bringing in an estimated $1 billion a year in state taxes. The bill was shelved this session, but a revised version will probably be reintroduced.  See budget woes, state-by-state » . Last week, Oakland became the first U.S. city to tax proceeds on medical marijuana. Other California cities have discussed a similar tax. This year, lawmakers in Georgia turned not to pot but to poles as a possible source of additional revenue. Republican state Sen. Jack Murphy's proposed ""pole tax"" would have charged patrons of strip clubs a $5 entrance fee. The bill was not approved. Nineteen states have explored gambling-related proposals as ways balance their 2010 budgets, according to the National Council of State Legislatures. In Alabama, lawmakers considered bringing more bingo games to the state and legalizing slot machines, but the measure was not approved. Delaware's Democratic Gov. Jack Markell signed legislation creating a sports lottery that legalizes single-game betting. Four professional sports leagues and the NCAA have filed a lawsuit over plans for the lottery, fearing that it threatens the integrity of the games. ""Basically, what we are dealing with is a larger issue here, which states have been grappling now for a few years, that is the shift in our economy away from manufacturing economy to a service-based economy,"" CanagaRetna said. He noted that when sales tax doesn't apply, states aren't able to capture the economic activity. Here are a few of the more interesting ways states are trying to conserve -- and create -- some extra funds: . Can you be more creative than your state?

"(CNN) -- NASA's Cassini spacecraft has provided your multicolored space distraction of the day: images of a swirling, six-sided weather feature on the surface of Saturn. Scientists say the ""Hexagon,"" the formation's working title at NASA, is unlike anything they've seen elsewhere. They say the feature is ""turbulent and unstable,"" packing 200-mph winds. That's nearly 50 mph stronger than the wind speed required for a Category 5 hurricane. ""A hurricane on Earth typically lasts a week, but this has been here for decades -- and who knows -- maybe centuries,"" said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini team member at the California Institute of Technology. The Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, since 2004. NASA hopes it will collect more pictures and other data of Saturn and its rings and moons through 2017. Cassini had photographed the hexagon before. But the short video clip released this week is the first high-resolution image of the massive jet stream, and the first with color filters. Cassini captured images of the hexagon over a 10-hour time period on December 10, 2012. The images, which scientists are still analyzing, are rendered in ""false color,"" a method that makes it easier to tell the difference between different parts of the storm. To human eyes, the hexagon and the planet's north pole would appear in tones of gold and blue. Cassini arrived at Saturn in 2004. But NASA has begun getting better images of the planet from Cassini since sunlight began bathing Saturn's northern hemisphere with the arrival of the planet's spring season in 2009.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Extreme heat in major U.S. cities this week signals more than the arrival of the dog days of summer.  City dwellers have long endured hot summer afternoons, but the frequency of extremely hot days -- when admissions to hospital emergency rooms for heat-related illnesses spike -- has increased substantially over the past several decades. An analysis of weather records at Georgia Tech reveals that the average number of heat-wave days in large U.S. cities each year had increased from nine in the mid-1950s to 19 by the mid-2000s. The news is even worse for  the country's most sprawling cities, such as Atlanta, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Raleigh, North Carolina: The number of heat-wave days in these cities has nearly tripled during the same time. There are two reasons for the increase in urban areas.  First, temperatures in cities are rising because of  the global greenhouse effect, which is intensifying as the vehicles we drive and the energy we consume emit more and more greenhouse gases. Second, and more important, cities are warming because of the loss of trees and other natural land cover to make way for buildings, streets, and parking lots, which are composed of materials that absorb far more thermal radiation than the natural landscape. Because of these two effects -- one global, the other local -- most large American cities are warming at more than twice the rate of their outlying rural areas and the planet as a whole, and this accelerated pace is at the root of the increasing frequency of heat waves. Much more than a source of discomfort, the growing frequency of heat waves in cities poses a significant public health threat. This was made clear by an intense and prolonged heat wave in Europe during the summer of 2003, when it's estimated more than 70,000 residents of France, Italy, Great Britain and other nations died from exposure to extreme heat. The majority of people who died lived in cities. With a death toll exceeding that of any other weather-related natural disaster in the developed world -- including hurricanes, tornadoes and floods --  the European heat wave attests to the growing risk of climate-related health threats, even in the most affluent and medically advanced societies. Yet the global response to this climate event -- one that reveals more about the profoundly changing environment in which we live than any other yet endured -- has largely been one of indifference. Less than a decade after the deadly heat wave, many outside of Europe do not even recall hearing of it. And fewer appreciate its central lesson: The extremity of the heat was greatly amplified and so made more dangerous by the cities themselves. So, as cities prepare over the coming days for the potential health impacts of a heat wave, it is imperative that urban governments look ahead and take aggressive action over the coming years to address the root causes of rising temperatures in cities. The good news is that cities don't have to wait for the U.S. Congress or the global community to adopt highly effective programs.  Programs already under way in New York, Los Angeles and other cities to plant millions of trees can measurably cool the air and dampen the extremity of heat waves over time. The preservation and restoration of greenspaces within and around urban areas are a critical first line of defense against climate change. Coupled with enhancing greenspace is the need to make built surfaces more highly reflective, to offset the absorption of solar energy. The use of lightly hued or whitewashed roofing and paving materials, as found in Mediterranean cities, is a proven tool for moderating summer temperatures. Finally, a long-term transition from sprawl and highways toward more compact urban development, featuring walkable neighborhoods and transit systems, can reduce the emission of waste heat from vehicles and buildings.   This summer shows climate change is neither a theoretical problem nor one to be addressed by future generations: It is on display this week in major U.S. cities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Stone.","Brian Stone: Number of heat-wave days in U.S. cities has doubled since 1950s .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Police in Afghanistan say they have rescued a 15-year-old girl who was locked up in the basement of her in-laws' house, starved and had her nails pulled out. Authorities in the northern Baghlan province said they were aware of reports that the girl was tortured after she refused to be forced into prostitution. But, they said, they were waiting for her to fully recover to talk to her and learn more. The girl, Sahar Gul, was married off to a 30-year-old man about seven months ago. After her parents reported not seeing her for months, police launched their investigation, said Baghlan police official Jawid Basharat. ""After police rescued her from a dark room of her in-laws' house, we saw her nails had been pulled out by her husband. And she said with broken voice that her husband used to cut her flesh using pliers,"" Basharat said. The girl was also denied food, he said. Rahima Zarifi, director of the Women's Affairs Department in Baghlan, said Sahar was immediately hospitalized. ""She was in a very bad condition when I met her,"" Zarifi said. ""The perpetrators had pulled out her hair by force. She was suffering a kind of skin disease and she didn't even have proper clothes on."" Police have arrested Sahar's in-laws, but her husband managed to flee. The case, Zarifi said, highlights how women continue to suffer in parts of Afghanistan despite overall progress since the fall of the Taliban. In the second quarter of this year, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) registered 1,026 cases of violence against women. Last year, 2,700 cases were recorded. Earlier this month, gunmen attacked and sprayed an Afghan family with acid in their home after the father rejected a man's bid to marry his teenage daughter. In another case, a 21-year-old, identified only as Gulnaz for her own protection, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she reported that her cousin's husband had raped her. Her plight attracted international attention when it came out that she had agreed to marry her attacker to gain her freedom and legitimize a daughter conceived in the attack. She was eventually freed, following the president's intervention.","Police say they are waiting for the girl to recover to talk to her .

"(CNN) -- Hollywood executives love a movie franchise: a series of films with an in-built audience who return time and again to enjoy their favorite characters, stories and themes. Such box-office gold is usually based on pre-existing properties, for example comics (""Iron Man"" et al), novels (""The Hunger Games"") -- even theme-park rides (""Pirates of The Caribbean""). But the strong interest that followed the death of actor Paul Walker last weekend has been boosted by his crucial role in an unlikely franchise whose appeal has built steadily during the past decade, especially outside the United States. The six ""Fast & Furious"" films have spawned a globe-trotting, block-busting series, generating $2.4 billion in ticket sales alone since the turn of the century. Back then few predicted that a mid-budget actioner with little-known actors set in the hi-octane world of LA street-racing would still be going strong 12 years later. How did it happen? Released in June 2001, ""The Fast And The Furious"" was a testosterone-fuelled boys-with-toys movie set around a cat-and-mouse game between an undercover cop (Walker) and his prey (Vin Diesel). ""I remember being in Honolulu when Mark Shmuger (former co-chairman of Universal Pictures) called to say they'd just had the most amazing test screening of a film we'd never heard of, called 'The Fast And The Furious,' recalls Andrew Cripps, former president and COO of UIP, the distribution joint-venture between Universal and Paramount which released the first three films internationally. ""It seemed pretty domestic at the time,"" continues Cripps, now president EMEA for IMAX. ""It was about L.A. street-racing, it had a relatively unknown cast, but there was a chemistry there between the lead characters and it really worked with young audiences around the world. I was pleasantly surprised by the international box office of the first film."" ""The Fast And The Furious"" raced to an impressive $145 million in the U.S. during the lucrative and crowded summer season. An international release was delayed till fall to market the film as a fresh success that had swept the U.S. while also ensuring it avoided competition from bigger rivals. International grosses were low compared to domestic -- but they were strong for a $38 million movie skewed to an American audience. But the chemistry between Walker and Diesel that engaged audiences was missing from the next two sequels. For the second installment, 2003's ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" Diesel was absent (focusing on two potential franchises that positioned him as the clear star) although Walker remained front and center. While U.S. box office was down on its predecessor, international grosses jumped 75%: a domestic franchise clearly had global appeal. As before, the UK, France, Germany and Australia proved powerful markets, while Mexico saw sales more than double, mirroring the series popularity with Hispanic audiences in the U.S. Universal sat up and took note, setting the third film -- which starred neither Walker nor Diesel -- in Tokyo. At the time it made sense: Japan has its own street-racing scene and in 2006 was the biggest international market. It was also a territory the franchise had yet to crack. ""The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift"" worked for the Japanese market, boosting box office by 28% from the previous film. But while Japan grew, other major markets shrank and North American box office halved. Without Walker or Diesel the franchise had lost its spark and seemingly run its course. By 2009, with the careers of the original cast floundering, Diesel -- now a producer -- helped orchestrate the return of all four key players from the original cast for ""Fast & Furious."" International success had to be the focus if the franchise was to be revived: domestic success was no longer a guarantor of franchise longevity. Nervous executives were still unsure the package would work and skipped a release into the overheated summer market, targeting instead an Easter rollout and building on the success of the first feature (the film's tagline was ""New Model. Original Parts.""). It worked and audiences returned, with fresh growth in all the franchise's previous key markets and new support in Russia, a traditional haven for action movies. ""The relationship between Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's characters was at the heart of the franchise,"" explains box office analyst Charles Gant of The Guardian. ""So as soon as it brought those two guys back together they were on a money train."" That chemistry and rivalry between Walker and Diesel needed to be maintained. How? By turning the movies from street-racing series into a globe-trotting action franchise rooted in frenetic auto action. Thus 2011's ""Fast Five"" became a heist caper set in Brazil with Walker and Diesel working together instead of in opposition: global appeal broadened still further by bringing back multi-national characters from across the franchise. But with Walker and Diesel both on the wrong side of the law the series now needed a new opponent. Enter former wrestler and human mountain Dwayne Johnson aka ""The Rock."" ""We initially designed the role for Tommy Lee Jones,"" Diesel explained in an April 2011 interview. ""One of my fans on Facebook said I would love to see you and The Rock in anything together. It really was the best choice in the world."" ""Fast Five"" became a major international player and from its late April release it landed a knockout blow on superhero slugfest ""Thor"" across several territories. It was also the first of the franchise to venture into the high-ticket giant-screens owned by IMAX, its bangs and ballistics sitting well with the format's male-heavy audience. By the time the UK-set ""Fast & Furious 6"" opened in May 2013, expectations were heady: the first film had been a domestic-weighted surprise; the second a solid sequel; the third a flop; the fourth an all-or-nothing reboot; the fifth a take-a-chance change of direction. The sixth was primed to be a guaranteed blockbuster. It didn't disappoint. Grossing $550 million at the international box office alone, ""Fast & Furious 6"" has become the third highest grossing film of the year worldwide behind ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Despicable Me 2."" Seventy percent of its $788m gross has come from overseas: as with its predecessor, China was the top grossing market ($66m). Such heady figures were vital to sustain a movie series whose production costs had ballooned from $38m in 2001 to $160m in 2013. But Walker's death has now left the future of the franchise in question: Universal announced this week that production has shut down on the seventh instalment ""so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise,"" which was due to release on July 11 2014. Many of the cast are already signed up for an eighth episode. ""The latest was the biggest yet and the series looked set to grow and grow,"" says Gant. ""The franchise is giddy and fun and I think it will be a real challenge for them to continue in the wake of Paul Walker's death and the manner in which it occurred."" Nick Hunt contributed to this report.","""Fast and The Furious"" movie franchise has taken more than $2 billion worldwide through ticket sales .

"(CNN) -- Since the death penalty was reinstated in Colorado more than 35 years ago, the state has executed just one person. Now comes the case of James Holmes, who faces 166 counts of murder and attempted murder for a shooting at an Aurora movie theater that left 12 people dead and 58 wounded. If there ever was a poster boy for capital punishment, legal analysts say, the 25-year-old Holmes would fit the bill. On Monday, Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said he will seek the death penalty in the case despite a defense request to take capital punishment off the table if Holmes pleaded guilty. Deciding whether to pursue the death penalty was a delicate balancing act for the state, said CNN legal contributor Paul Callan. Any time someone is sentenced to death, the sentence isn't carried out right away. Usually the appeals process takes 10 years to wind its way through the courts, he said. In addition, more and more states are abolishing the death penalty. Currently, 33 states have the legal option of imposing the death penalty, while 17 plus the District of Columbia do not. ""The prosecutor is walking a tight rope,"" Callan told CNN last week. Some people would be furious if Holmes received life in prison after such a brutal crime, Callan said. But even if Holmes is sentenced to death, there are no guarantees. ""He is looking at ... the realistic view of the world,"" Callan said, ""which is, even if I get the death penalty, it will probably never be imposed."" Complicated decision for prosecution . The death penalty was reinstated in Colorado in 1976. In that time, the state carried out one execution -- in 1997. Right now, three people sit on Colorado's death row. Prosecutors had a lot to consider in determining whether Holmes, if convicted, should join them. ""The voters enacted the death penalty in Colorado. This case is the poster boy for that,"" Callan said. Holmes' attorneys have said they intend to pursue an insanity defense. And that, said David Beller, a defense attorney not associated with the case, can make the prosecution's decision to seek the death penalty more complicated. ""The Supreme Court, and really society, has been very clear: We don't kill, we don't execute people who are mentally ill. We just don't do it,"" he said. In deciding to seek the death penalty, prosecutors also had to weigh the impact on the families of the victims since the case could go on for a year, with a string of appeals likely. Prosecutors blast defense . Monday's hearing came less than a week after Holmes' defense team filed documents saying Holmes had offered to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in jail. Colorado theater shooting suspect offers to plead guilty . Prosecutors took the defense to task for publicly offering it, saying they weren't given enough information to even consider such a deal. ""Not only improper, but grossly improper,"" prosecutors said in a Thursday court filing. ""For the intended purpose of generating predictable publicity"" Attorneys on both sides are under a gag order, leaving case watchers to divine tactics from court documents. ""Prior to arraignment, Mr. Holmes made an offer to the prosecution to resolve this case by pleading guilty and spending the rest of his life in prison, without any opportunity for parole,"" the documents filed by the defense team read. Last month, a judge entered a standard plea of not guilty for Holmes, who is accused in the July 20 shooting. In the documents filed Wednesday, his attorneys said they are still exploring a mental health defense, ""and counsel will vigorously present and argue any and all appropriate defenses at a trial or sentencing proceeding, as necessary."" Holmes' lawyers blast Colorado's insanity defense laws . The case against Holmes . Federal agents have said the former University of Colorado doctoral student planned the attack for months. He began buying guns last May, allegedly building an arsenal of two Glock handguns, an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition. Authorities say Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives, then traveled to the movie theater armed with the weapons, tear gas and body armor planning to kill audience members during a screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats. ""This is not a 'whodunit.' Everybody knows that James Holmes committed these horrible murders. The question is what punishment he will get,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""If they (defense attorneys) can get life in prison, they will consider this a victory."" Holmes' trial date has been set for February 3. 'Truth serum' won't reveal mind of James Holmes .

"(CNN) -- A 2-year-old boy missing in Rhode Island has been found wandering the streets of Providence, according to Johnston Police Deputy Chief Daniel Parrillo. Authorities had issued an Amber Alert for Isaih Perez on Sunday morning. The toddler was taken to a hospital to be checked out, but he appeared to be in good health, Parrillo said. Asked whether he had any idea how Isaih got where he was, Parrillo said he did not. ""A patrol man found him while on patrol just walking on the sidewalk. We don't know he was dropped off, if he was left off there, we don't have any particulars at this time,"" he said. Earlier, Parrillo said that two men had been taken into police custody in connection with the kidnapping of the 2-year-old boy and a double homicide. The toddler was not with either man when police apprehended them. Authorities had said they believe Malcolm Crowell, 22, fled the scene of the homicide in Johnston, taking Isaih with him. Crowell was found by police in Fall River, Massachusetts, following a tip related to an Amber Alert for the boy. Authorities identified Daniel Rodriguez as a second suspect during their investigation, and he was taken into custody by police in Providence early Sunday evening, Parrillo said. Charges are expected to be filed Monday. The relationship between the suspects and the child is unknown, Parrillo said. The victims of the double homicide have not been identified.

"(CNN) -- A former Massachusetts crime lab chemist accused of mishandling evidence affecting hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of criminal cases was sentenced Friday to three to five years in prison after pleading guilty to 27 counts. Annie Dookhan, 36, was arrested last year, accused of cutting corners by visually identifying alleged drug samples instead of performing chemical tests, and then altering the samples to cover up the practice. More than 300 drug convictions involving Dookhan's tests -- conducted from 2003 to 2012 -- have been put on hold since last year in Suffolk County alone, Suffolk County District Attorney spokesman Jake Wark said. Dookhan also was accused of falsely claiming, while testifying as an expert witness at a criminal trial, that she had a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. A defendant's conviction was overturned because of this, and authorities allege he killed someone in May, after his release. ""Annie Dookhan's egregious misconduct sent ripple effects throughout our entire criminal justice system,"" Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement. ""Her deliberate decision to tamper with drug evidence and fabricate test results harmed the integrity of the system and put the public's safety at risk."" Dookhan pleaded guilty Friday to tampering with evidence, perjury, obstruction of justice and falsely claiming to holding a master's degree. She said little during Friday's hearing in Boston, other than repeatedly saying, ""Yes, your honor,"" to questions such as whether she understood the consequences of her guilty pleas. The judge also ordered that she serve two years of probation after serving the prison time. Governor: 40,000 defendants could be affected . In August, Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said the cases of more than 40,000 defendants could be affected by Dookhan's tampering. Reviews of all the cases she handled are under way. Dookhan worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from 2003 until March 2012, when she resigned, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. The attorney general's office began a criminal investigation in July 2012, after Massachusetts State Police were tipped off by Dookhan's co-workers, who alleged her work at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory in Jamaica Plain might be unreliable. The investigation revealed that Dookhan allegedly had tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab, allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely ""dry labbing"" samples. ""Dry labbing"" is a term used for visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test. Authorities arrested Dookhan at her home in Franklin in September 2012. Second Massachusetts state chemist accused of tampering . Authorities: Released man accused in killing . Dookhan's false testimony about her credentials in a Plymouth County drug trial led to the release of a man who went on to be accused of murder, Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy Cruz said. Donta Hood was convicted of a cocaine charge in 2009, in a trial in which Dookhan -- as an expert witness -- falsely testified that she had a master's degree, authorities said. Hood was released in November 2012. Cruz said he wasn't able to retry Evans on the drug charge because the evidence in the case was destroyed. Storage space had been at a premium, he said, and no one thought it would be needed again. After his release, Hood was arrested twice -- first, on a gun possession charge. While out on bail for the gun charge, he allegedly shot and killed Charles Evans in Brockton, Massachusetts, in May, authorities said. ""There's no bigger pain than somebody being released that goes out and kills somebody,"" Cruz told CNN. Evans' family declined to comment. Chemist in Massachusetts drug sample case lied about degree . Dookhan also declined CNN's request for comment about her case. At a court proceeding earlier this year, Dookhan's lawyer, Nicholas Gordon, said that she took shortcuts in the lab to get more cases done to help her career, never considering the negative consequences it could have for criminal cases. ""The furthest thing from her mind is that this is going to ultimately cost millions of dollars, (And that) it's going to throw the entire Massachusetts criminal justice system into a tailspin,"" Gordon said in court. An investigation revealed that not only did Dookhan not have a master's degree, but she never took master's-level classes, prosecutors said. Some of the obstruction charges stem from instances in which authorities relied on tampered evidence in criminal proceedings, prosecutors said. CNN's Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.","Annie Dookhan pleads guilty to tampering with evidence, perjury, obstruction of justice .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- The upcoming Oscars are no stranger to causes or controversy. And this year, there is a strong dose of both surrounding the film ""Argo"" -- and its star and director, Ben Affleck. This controversy bubbled up when the buzz started that Affleck could get an Academy Award nomination for best director when the announcements are made Thursday. Read more: Academy Awards 2013: And the nominees are... ""Argo"" tells how an ingenious and daring CIA agent helped orchestrate the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1980. In November 1979, about 300 Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy and 66 Americans were taken hostage. But six U.S. diplomats escaped and were hidden at the Canadian Embassy by the Canadian ambassador and his wife. The CIA agent -- Antonio ""Tony"" Mendez, played by Affleck -- successfully led the mission to evacuate the Americans, which involved Mendez and his associates posing as a Canadian film crew that was eager to make a movie in Iran. Read more: 'Lincoln' leads field in British film awards nominations . The real Tony Mendez was awarded the Intelligence Star for Valor, and other honors, for leading the rescue. He later wrote a memoir, detailing the events in Tehran. ""Argo"" is loosely based on Mendez's book. Better make that, very loosely based. As movie critics and others have pointed out since the movie opened a few months ago, the filmmakers took lots of dramatic license with the story. Mendez's role is played up, while that of the Canadians who helped hide and protect the Americans is played down. Some scenes depicted in the film never happened. Some characters are composites of several real people. Read more: Why 'Django Unchained' stirs race debate . In other words, it's what you would expect from a Hollywood feature film based on a historical event. It's not a documentary. It's meant to be taken with a grain of salt, and to be entertaining. Still, there are some Latinos -- in and out of Hollywood -- who think that, in this case, the filmmakers, and especially Affleck, pushed the concept of creativity too far. They say Affleck missed an opportunity to put more Latinos on screen. Moreover, they say, Affleck improperly claimed, for himself, the choice role of Mendez when he should have cast a Latino actor instead. They insist that the director didn't just cheat a Latino out of an acting job but the Latino community out of a feel-good story about one of their own who won acclaim for a heroic deed. The critics are right, and their cause is just. Affleck should have tried to cast a Latino to play Mendez. That's common sense, and it would have made ""Argo"" a better movie. Affleck also didn't do himself any favors by trying to dismiss the criticism with a glib remark that essentially said that it really doesn't matter that the actor playing Mendez isn't Latino since Mendez himself isn't, shall we say, overtly Latino. Read more: The biggest, buzziest movies of 2013 . At a recent forum intended to publicize the film, Affleck responded to a question from the audience about the controversy by noting that ""Tony does not have, I don't know what you would say, a Latin/Spanish accent"" and that ""You wouldn't necessarily select him out of a line of 10 people and go 'This guy's Latino.' "" Ouch. At least Affleck didn't slip and say ""line up."" ""So I didn't feel as though I was violating something,"" he said, ""where, here's this guy who's clearly ethnic in some way and it's sort of being whitewashed by Ben Affleck the actor."" Johnny Depp set a better example. Several months ago, Depp turned down the role of Mexican revolutionary Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa in another film. He said that the role should go to a Latino. I praised Depp at the time for showing that, besides being a great actor, he is also a person of character. Read more: A (Richard) Gere shift for Oscars? The exclusion of Latinos from Hollywood is an old story. This is still a black and white world, where Latinos rarely get cast in the leading role. We're the gardeners and housekeepers, the gang leader and drug dealers, the nannies and farm workers. That's it. There has been some progress, of course. But not enough -- not when you have a Latina in the Supreme Court, three Latinos in the U.S. Senate, and Latinos heading Fortune 500 companies. I could blame the environment of Southern California, in which most Hollywood writers, producers and directors live and spend most of their time. When they get up in the morning and drive to work, most Latinos they encounter are subservient. We clean their homes, cook their breakfast, trim their hedges, park their cars and otherwise help them get through the day. Still, you can push this argument too far, and wind up going down a dangerous path -- one that ultimately sets back the greater cause of trying to get television networks and film studios to create a broader range of meatier roles for Latino actors and actresses. After all, it's a short walk from saying that a director should have cast a Latino to play a Latino to arguing that only Latinos can play Latinos. And, if that's the argument, then on what moral high ground do Latinos stand to also push -- as we should -- for Latino actors and actresses to be considered for generic and mainstream roles that could have gone to white actors? We can't have it both ways. Even if Latinos succeed in making their point about this one director and this one movie, it could backfire. We could win this battle, and still lose the war. But before Latinos can be fully integrated into America and not considered outsiders, we have to take every opportunity to push for inclusion and fairness. And acknowledging that Latinos have the skills to play themselves is a good start. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Protesters in Ukraine remained defiant and continued their mass demonstration against President Viktor Yanukovych over the country's U-turn away from the European Union Monday, the same day masked men raided the headquarters of the opposition party Monday, according to opposition party leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk. ""Members of the special ops destroyed the entire server room,"" he said. ""Equipment was destroyed, dragged out, across the entire premise of the Batkivshchyna Political Party headquarters."" Police denied any involvement in the raid. The raid happened after Yanukovych 's announcement on his website that he would back a call for talks involving the opposition to work out a compromise. With pressure growing, thousands remained on the streets of Kiev, some facing off with lines of Interior Ministry troops Monday evening near the presidential administration building. Minor scuffles broke out, but demonstrators were holding their ground as security forces began removing barricades. Opposition leader and former heavyweight champion Vitaly Klitschko approached riot police and urged them to stay calm and ""not break the law"" should they be ordered to remove protesters. ""None of us has either guns nor other objects; this is a peaceful protest,"" he said. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden entered the fray Monday with a phone call to Yanukovych in which he ""expressed his deep concern about the situation in Ukraine and the growing potential for violence,"" according to a statement. Biden said he urged Yanukovych to hold talks with the opposition. Burning tires to stay warm . Faced with freezing temperatures as the bitter cold sets in, the protesters burned tires and sipped hot soup and tea to stay warm. Some played soccer or strummed guitars as they camp out in tents. The crowds often swell in the evenings as people leave work and join the rallies. As more police gathered on the streets, the demonstrators received a message of support from actor George Clooney. ""We here in the United States have great affinity for those seeking democracy,"" Clooney said in a video posted online. ""We learned through trial and error that true democracy cannot exist without a free and fair and honest election."" The actor, who has lent his voice to campaigns for various issues in the past, added: ""Let me just say this to all of you in the square in Kiev or all around Ukraine: When you look to the West, know that we are looking back at you with great admiration."" Populist movement . The protests began when Kiev refused a deal with the European Union, opting instead for closer ties with neighbor Russia. It has grown into a populist movement, the biggest the Eastern European country has seen since the so-called Orange Revolution toppled the government nine years ago. ""The government and opposition should hold talks to solve this. It has gone too far, it might result in conflict,"" Vysotsky said. ""We do not want a conflict."" European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton would travel to Kiev on Tuesday to try to ""bring some solutions to the very tense situation that Ukraine is living today."" Speaking at a conference in Milan, Italy, Barroso said he had spoken with Yanukovych by phone Sunday. ""I asked him to show restraint in the face of these recent developments, to not use force against the people that are demonstrating peacefully, to respect fully the freedoms that are so important for all of us in Europe,"" he said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Yanukovych on Sunday and told the Ukrainian President that he had ""grave concern"" about the situation, urging authorities not to resort to violence. Yanukovych told the U.N. chief that ""consultations would be initiated to defuse the situation,"" the United Nations said. East vs. West . The protesters say an EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. They accuse Yanukovych , who met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union. The tensions tugging at the country are felt across the nation -- Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west of the country and a more Russia-oriented east. One of the main reasons for Yanukovych 's decision to backpedal on the EU talks is Russia's threat of trade sanctions and gas bill hikes. Yanukovych was also under pressure by the EU to free Tymoshenko, his jailed chief political opponent. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office in 2004, when he was Prime Minister, also swept Tymoshenko to power. Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. The United States and Europe see the punishment as politically motivated. Many of the protesters have carried her picture in Independence Square during the rallies. ""This is the end of Soviet occupation,"" the party's Twitter account said. ""End of (the) regime of shame and humiliation.""

"(CNN) -- There are many strange jobs in Hollywood. Seat filler at awards show. Producer on ""COPS"" who blurs all of the naked bodies. Co-star on ""Anger Management."" Here's another: Person in charge of the subtitles for TLC's reality sensation ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"" (Wednesdays, 9 p.m.). Imagine trying to decipher everything that comes out of the mouths of seven-year-old beauty pageant contestant Alana Thompson and the rest of her fast-drawling, ""Guess Whose Breath""-playing family from McIntyre, Georgia. We asked Sara Reddy — the fearless Honey Boo Boo exec producer who counts this task as one of her responsibilities — to take us into her strange world of TV transcription. Why does the executive producer supervise the subtitles? Does she have a special skill set? Not exactly. Reddy was raised in Southern California, not the South. But she did develop a special ear for the family's peculiar enunciations while working on ""Toddlers & Tiaras,"" the show on which Alana was discovered. ""Most people think of Southern accents as having this drawl that's really slow and deliberate, but with this family it's the opposite,"" says Reddy. ""They talk incredibly fast and they just skip over consonants and entire syllables. I don't know if it's the region they are from or just the family."" And for some reason, she's the one on staff who can best decode their language. ""I don't know why I have this gift, but I understand them perfectly, and I don't think they need to be subtitled. It astonishes me when people are like, 'What is she saying?' I'm like, 'You can't hear that? It's perfectly clear to me!'"" How do the show's producers decide what to subtitle (which seems to be pretty much everything)? ""We have so many subtitles, it's like we're making a foreign film in English,"" she declares with some amount of pride. Occasionally during the notes process, a network executive will ask for an onscreen translation of a hard-to-decipher line. But here's the true test: ""If the [family is] delivering information you need to follow the story line, we subtitle it,"" she explains. ""Sometimes we subtitle things that we don't understand and put in the noises. They're not even words. We take it seriously and make sure we're phonetically accurate."" Reality TV's most appalling shows (so far) What goes into the subtitling process? The subtitles require 15 to 20 staff hours of labor per episode, estimates Reddy. They are typed in and checked for accuracy; as many as ten co-workers might weigh in on a difficult line. Lip-reading is also key. ""Sometimes, it will come down to looking at the upper teeth meeting the lower lip and you know it's an f or a b, and that could be a starting point."" (Another trick is to isolate a family member's microphone on high-quality speakers during the audio mix session.) The show's online editor keeps a collection of Post-it notes with spellings of the family's made-up words, such as ""smexy"" and ""s'mage."" Reddy recalls a particularly healthy discussion over how to spell Sugar Bear's nickname Shugie. ""Normally you wouldn't have to think of that,"" she says. ""But when we went to subtitle it, it became this big debate. Because s-u-g-e-y looks like ""soogie."" It became this thing: 'How do we spell it? Two g's? One g? Do we spell it phonetically? Do we spell it with an S and an H?"" Isn't it condescending to subtitle people speaking English? Or Pumpkin saying ""marannaise"" instead of ""mayonnaise""? Reddy insists that's not the intention. ""They make up so many interesting words and mispronounce things in pretty genius ways, and I don't want to correct them. Especially if it's a delightful mistake,"" she says. ""Also, it tests your eye if what you're reading doesn't match what you're hearing. If we put 'mayonnaise' as it's spelled, your brain has a little stutter. We try to put little quirks in the subtitles because that's part of what makes them so charming. The way they handle the English language is so fascinating. If (the family members) were sensitive about it, that would be different. But part of what makes this show magical to me is that this family embraces their flaws. Find anyone on the planet who knows how to pronounce everything. To me, it's relatable."" In addition, she says that viewers may be leaning on the subtitles more than they think. ""When people say it's condescending, it's because they're reading the subtitles so they understand everything. If we showed it without subtitles they'd be complaining they couldn't understand enough. So it's taken for granted. We give them the answers."" Which family member is the toughest to translate? Reddy doesn't even pause to think before answering. It's Mama Bear. ""I'm fluent in June-ese,"" she says. ""That's the hardest dialect. She talks so fast. It's just this rapid fire of syllables. She does these amazing combinations of words like 'beautimous.' 'Vajiggle jaggle' is this kind of onomatopoetic word. It's brilliant. In early edits of the show, 'vajiggle' was spelled 'vagiggle' which looked like 'va-giggle.' We had to change it to a j. I was an English major and I sometimes don't know if it's an advantage or a disadvantage."" The 15 worst TV spin-offs . Who's the runner-up? Sugar Bear claims that honor. ""He has more of a slow drawl -- like most people think of the Southern drawl -- but he mumbles so much that you don't hear a lot of consonants,"" she notes. ""It's an entirely different challenge."" And the easiest? It's that voluble little star, Alana, a.k.a. Honey Boo Boo ""She doesn't talk as fast as the older girls and her mom, and she also has this very deliberate delivery that she was just born with, and she sells every line that she says,"" says Reddy. ""But she's young still and she'll probably be talking really fast by the time she's a teenager and will be just as difficult as the rest of them."" How often is Reddy stumped while trying to figure out what June & Co. are saying? Only on the rarest of occasions. She recalls a line in a season 1 episode that tormented her: ""Pumpkin was saying, 'Why do we have all this toilet paper?' And June turned to Pumpkin and said, 'To wipe your ...' Something. I could not understand for the life of me. It sounded like 'tootay' and I wrote down so many words. I wrote 'tube tape,' 'toot take.' I listened to it a thousand times and I finally just put in the subtitle 'tootay.' I was making up a word as a placeholder. And I actually sent the clip to June and said, 'What are you saying here?' And she wrote back, 'Yeah, I think I was saying 'tootay.' And I was like, 'What is that?', and she said 'I don't know, I just made it up as a word for her butt.' I had spent hours listening and trying to figure out what combination of words would have those syllables that matched this context, and sure enough it was just some word she'd made up on the spot. I think that was a pretty big moment of realizing, 'Oh, she makes up words. There are going to be times when there isn't an answer.'"" Did the producers ever tell the family to speak more clearly? A few feeble and futile attempts were made in the beginning. ""And then we realized what makes them so great and so great for TV is just letting them be themselves,"" says Reddy. ""If they were to become self-conscious about trying to speak differently than they just naturally speak, it would absolutely ruin the magic of the show. It's the same thing with trying to get them to speak one at a time. It would be a losing battle. It's so much better to just embrace them for exactly who they are and let them be themselves and subtitle it, so the rest of the world can enjoy them and understand them."" Any subtitle spoilers for this season? ""We do have a scene coming up in one of our later episodes that could quite possibly break the world record for the most subtitles ever appearing in a short amount of time,"" teases Reddy. ""It'll break the record for the world's fastest subtitles. There might not be a record that's ever been established but we'll break it anyway."" Has Reddy ever considered subtitling the family's pet animals? ""We toyed with the idea of giving the chicken, Nugget, some thoughts when he clucks,"" says Reddy. ""We were thinking about subtitling what he thought of the family. But we decided we were taking too many liberties with Nugget's inner world.... We thought about [subtitling] Kaitlyn, the baby, and what her thoughts could be. But we want this to be a real world. What makes the show awesome is that it's so real. It still is my dream to subtitle Nugget someday."" And what would Nugget say? ""'Save me.'"" See the original story at EW.com .

"(CNN) -- The seven-hour flight from the Netherlands to Michigan had been uneventful. Passengers bided time watching movies or trying to catch shut eye. But as Northwest Flight 253 made its final approach to Detroit on Christmas, the actions of one man put at risk the lives of nearly 300 passengers on the jetliner -- and the quick thinking of another helped prevent disaster. Jasper Schuringa, a Dutch filmmaker, appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" for a second time Tuesday night, recounting how he and others subdued an al Qaeda-linked suspect from detonating explosives that the man had attached to his underwear. That suspect, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, is now charged with attempting to destroy an aircraft in a plot that the militant group, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has claimed responsibility for. A senior administration official said late Tuesday that new information suggests the 23-year-old Nigerian man's plot may indeed have had ties to the group. ""First, I thought it just might be a crazy guy to actually carry a firecracker onto the airplane,"" Schuringa said Tuesday night. ""It came as quite a shock when I heard he had ties to al Qaeda."" From Detroit, Schuringa had a connecting flight before his final destination: a vacation with friends in Miami, Florida. As the plane neared Detroit, Schuringa said, he heard what sounded like a firecracker going off. ""First, it was just 'bang,'"" he said. ""And you're trying to look around, like where's this bang coming from."" Immediately afterward, someone screamed ""Fire!"" Schuringa said he noticed a man on the left side of the aisle, sitting still while on fire. ""A normal person would stand up, and he wasn't standing up,"" he said. ""So then I knew, this guy is trying to do something."" Schuringa said he jumped over the passenger next to him, reached across the aisle and lunged for the suspect, now identified as AbdulMutallab. View timeline of bombing suspect . ""He was getting on fire. And he was still holding the device, the bomb,"" Schuringa said. ""And he was still holding it in his hands. And I had to, like, rip the bomb out of his hands."" Schuringa said the man just stared at him, but did not let go of whatever he was holding onto. In an earlier appearance on ""Larry King Live,"" Schuringa described how he yanked the object from the man, stamped out the fire with his hands and tossed it. With the help of crew members and other passengers, the man was then taken to the front of the plane, handcuffed and stripped to make sure he wasn't carrying anything else. Through it all, the man appeared dazed. ""He was staring into nothing,"" Schuringa said. Investigators now say AbdulMutallab was allegedly carrying PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate -- enough of it to blow a hole in the aircraft. But the device he used failed to detonate fully, instead setting off the fire, authorities said. Part of the explosive device was sewn into the suspect's underwear. FBI agents recovered what appear to be the remnants of a syringe near the seat. Because the syringe was destroyed, investigators are having trouble determining the accelerant the suspect tried to use to light the explosive. ""When I was interrogated by the FBI, I was trying to think what I was actually holding, because it was very thick,"" Schuringa said. ""It's just like everything just happened in the blink of an eye. But it's quite scary to hold a bomb in your hands. Not something you do every day."" Among the passengers on the Friday flight were Wisconsin native Richelle Keepman and her family. They were returning from Ethiopia with two children they had adopted. On ""Larry King Live"" on Tuesday, she called Schuringa a hero. ""We're just so thankful that you did what you did and the other passengers who helped, because your bravery saved us,"" she said. Schuringa said his action was just a knee-jerk reaction. ""There's so much going on in your mind, you're not afraid,"" he said. ""You just don't think and just jump."" Keepman said the security at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport was nothing like what she is used to in the United States. ""We walked through and did not have to take our shoes off,"" she said. ""Also, my mother had a water bottle in her bag that she'd completely forgotten about. And it went right through and we didn't realize it until we were on the plane."" Keepman said she hasn't had time to relive the experience as she introduces the adopted children to life in America. ""With the children being home and they're seeing snow for the first time and just so many new things, our focus right now is just on the fact that we're here and we're able to live these moments with them,"" she said. However, she remembers one odd detail. Amid the commotion, a man about 10 seats in front of Keepman was capturing it all with a camcorder. ""It was definitely a little out of the ordinary,"" she said. ""I mean, I don't know why he was standing up and we were supposed to be seated and he was filming it."" A person familiar with the investigation told CNN that investigators have pored through tapes that several people shot during the incident. But none has provided anything useful to the investigation, because each was captured after the fire began or has an obstructed view. Schuringa said he too tries not to think too much about the day. ""Like Richelle, I think we're all happy we're still alive and living for another day,"" he said. ""Of course, for everybody it's quite a big shock that a person like that can try to take out our lives. And that's just unimaginable.""","Jasper Schuringa subdued man accused of trying to blow up plane .

"(CNN) -- The search for a U.S. man who allegedly abducted his two young sons last week focused Monday on Cuba, with a Florida sheriff's department saying it had received information that the man, his wife and sons had arrived in the island nation, possibly by sailboat. A State Department official in Washington told CNN that the U.S. Interest Section in Havana ""is aware of this case and is in contact with local authorities to get more information."" The official would not comment further, citing ""privacy considerations."" Authorities believe the father, Joshua Michael Hakken of Louisiana, abducted his sons Chase, 2, and Cole, 4, early Wednesday after breaking into the Florida home of the children's grandmother and tying her up. In Havana, Lynn Roche, an official with the U.S. Interest Section, said section officials couldn't discuss any case of an American who hasn't signed a privacy act waiver. And an official with Cuba's foreign ministry said Monday evening that his agency was unaware of the case and had not received any requests for help from U.S. officials. The boys had been removed from the care of Hakken and his wife, Sharyn Patricia Hakken, last year, and on Tuesday, the couple's parental rights were terminated in Louisiana, investigators say. The abduction report triggered an Amber Alert for the children, but there were no reported sightings. Joshua Hakken, described as an anti-government protester, was believed to be armed, according to the Hillsborough County sheriff's office in Tampa, the site of last week's alleged abduction. Investigators believed his wife was with him. On Monday, the sheriff's department released a statement saying it had ""received information that the Hakken family had arrived in Cuba."" The brief statement did not offer any specifics about the information but added, ""We are currently working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation who is in contact with the U.S. State Department to verify this information."" That followed a statement Friday from the same department saying it had obtained information that Joshua Hakken recently bought a 25-foot sailboat. There is no extradition treaty between Cuba and the United States, although there have been recent cases in which Americans sought for crimes in the United States and discovered in Havana have been sent back by the Cubans. The FBI currently estimates there are around 70 fugitives from U.S. justice in Cuba, which is one of the reasons Cuba remains on the U.S. list of countries that support state terrorism. Most of the American fugitives in Cuba have been there for decades and have ties to revolutionary movements or radical groups. On Thursday, the police department in Slidell, Louisiana, issued its own statement offering background on the Hakkens and why the boys were taken from the parents last year. In June of 2012, Slidell police responded to a disturbance report at a hotel where Joshua and Sharyn Hakken were staying with their sons, the police statement said. ""When police arrived, both Mr. and Mrs. Hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers. They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon,'"" the Slidell police statement said, adding, ""Let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time."" Because of the parents' behavior and ""the fact that narcotics and weapons were located inside of the hotel room,"" the children were taken by child welfare officers, and Joshua Hakken was arrested on drug charges, the statement said. ""Approximately two weeks later, Slidell Police were notified that Mr. Hakken had shown up to the foster family home ... with a firearm demanding the return of his children,"" the Slidell police statement continued. ""The foster parents called 911, and Mr. Hakken fled without his children. We have heard nothing until (Wednesday)."" At some point over the past few months, the children were sent to Tampa to live with their grandmother, Patricia Hauser, the mother of Sharyn Hakken. ""Somehow they found out where the kids were,"" said Detective Larry McKinnon of the Hillsborough County sheriff's office. Sheriff's investigators say Joshua Hakken entered Hauser's home at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday. She told police that he tied her up and fled with the children in her silver 2009 Toyota Camry. That vehicle was found later that day just a couple of blocks away from the home. Those investigators told CNN they believe Joshua Hakken joined up with his wife, who was waiting in their pickup truck, and the family drove to a parking garage. A short time later, investigators said, Hakken is believed to have taken a sailboat out of a private slip in nearby Madeira Beach. Surveillance images showed the boat sailing into the Gulf of Mexico about three and a half hours after the boys disappeared from their grandmother's home, investigators said, adding that the photos showed adults and children aboard. CNN's Patrick Oppmann in Havana, Rich Phillips and Kim Segal in Miami, Elise Labott and Emily Schultze in Washington, and Dave Alsup and Joe Sutton in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Authorities believe Joshua Hakken abducted his two small sons last week .

"Leh, India (CNN) -- It's always tricky being a tourist alongside foreigners in your homeland. That may be especially true in India, a country so vastly different in every respect from the United States. But when the call came from my husband's niece and nephew, Larkin and Nelson, to accompany them and their father, Raymond Broussard, on a trip to the Himalayan region of Ladakh, I couldn't say no. Part of it was purely selfish. I'd never been to Ladakh, a region off India's northern Jammu and Kashmir state that borders Tibet. It's fairly accessible these days by plane -- at least in the summer -- but during my childhood in India, Ladakh was not a destination. Back then, most Indians visited picturesque Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. That was long before a violent insurgency, aimed at wresting part of Kashmir from Indian control, ravaged the area. I'd heard from friends who'd been to Ladakh in recent years about how glorious a place it was, surrounded by towering, snow-capped peaks and Buddhist monasteries. I'd yearned to go for a very long time, so the invitation was instantly appealing. But there was a deeper reason. Raymond is a pediatric dentist in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He told me that when he was young, his father, also a dentist, had taken him on a goodwill mission to Haiti. It was a trip that became indelibly etched in his mind. What American kid wouldn't learn from helping others so much less fortunate? Raymond told me he wanted his own children to experience something similar. He'd been thinking about it for a long time and then suddenly, just like that, Larkin was entering her senior year in high school. This was Raymond's last window of opportunity. He signed on with a group called Global Dental Relief, a Colorado-based charitable organization that provides dental care for poor kids in India, Nepal, Vietnam, Cambodia, Kenya and Guatemala. He was going as one of six volunteer dentists. But the group needed nondental volunteers as well. Larkin and Nelson were going -- it was their first trip to India -- and they inspired me to sign up as a nondental assistant. If they could do it, why not me? I wasn't so sure about how much help I'd be. I couldn't tell you what ""scaler"" or ""explorer"" tools looked like, but it wouldn't hurt, I thought, to learn new skills. I rescheduled my previously planned trip to India. I almost always visit home in the winter when the humidity and sizzling temperatures subside in Delhi and in my hometown, Kolkata. But there is no easy way to reach Leh, the Ladakhi capital, in the winter. The city is snowbound. So on a late August evening, I boarded a flight in Atlanta bound for Delhi. After a day getting over jet lag and visiting family, I joined the Global Dental Relief group and was immediately relieved to know that few of the nondental volunteers had any experience with cavities or extractions. But we all had two things in common: We wanted to do something good, and we wanted to see one of the most breathtaking places in the world. Less than an hour after the Indigo jet left smoggy Delhi behind, passengers strained to see out the windows. The view was nothing short of magnificent. The rising sun kissed the tall, stark peaks of the Himalayas. Some of them looked like they were on fire, the orange hues so startlingly bright. After we settled into the Snow View Guest House, we ventured out into town -- even though it had been strongly suggested that we take it easy in our rooms. Leh is about 12,000 feet above sea level and many a visitor has fallen prey to altitude sickness. We filled up on Tibetan momos (dumplings filled with lamb, chicken or vegetables) and got up early the next morning to begin setting up the dental clinic. David Sonam, the owner of the guesthouse, helps set up the clinic every year. He's a businessman and a former dean at a school who wants to do something for the kids in Ladakh, many of whom hail from impoverished homes and lack the services they need. ""Dental care,"" Sonam told me, ""is not so good here."" The kids don't get check-ups. Many don't even have toothbrushes or paste at home. The only care, Sonam said, is for emergencies -- bad infections and painful teeth extractions. Downstairs from our makeshift clinic is a permanent center that Sonam set up for kids with special needs. There's a room painted with stars where children with autism can relax. There's also a physiotherapy center for children who've had corrective surgery so they can walk again. A wheelchair can be a curse in a place like Leh. It's hilly and hardly anywhere is handicapped accessible. Sonam said the biggest problem here is lack of water and hygiene. Most children grow up with a mouthful of rotting teeth, which can lead to other problems later in life. And that's what we begin to see the next day when the long lines begin to form at our humble dental clinic. One day, we encountered about 250 students from Siddhartha School who traveled for hours from mountain villages. ""They are kids who only go to see a dentist when they are in a lot of pain,"" said their teacher Tanzin Dolma, 38. That includes Tesering Chonzom, 14. She's already had to have two fillings; now she's in for a third. She cowered from Raymond's anesthesia needle. Her friend Stanzin Anmol tried to calm her down. I wiped the tears flowing down her cheeks. But within an hour, she was out the door, her cavity filled. Over six days, the Global Dental Relief volunteers saw 715 patients -- fillings, extractions, cleanings, sealants. In all, the group estimated the value of the service at about $170,000. But we felt like a million. The clinic, I think, was especially meaningful for the Indians among the volunteers -- there were three Indian dentists and one other Indian dental assistant. I'd covered international aid organizations in my homeland -- in conflict and the aftermath of natural disaster -- but I'd never been a participant in anything like this. My crash course in dentistry probably won't take me very far though the next time I am sitting in a chair (take note, Dr. Elise Ashpole), I will know what you mean when you say: ""18 occlusal."" I will also know when you pick up the dread extraction tool. Eventually, the names of the children I met will fade in my mind. What I will remember are the expressions of awe and astonishment on the faces of Larkin and Nelson, who, as teenagers, discovered a slice of a strange new land. They, like their father, Raymond, who never forgot his trip to Haiti, will hopefully look back on India in 2013 as a necessary stepping stone in the path of life. What I will also remember are certain moments -- Angmo Rigzin's hand clutching mine so tightly that I thought the bones in my fingers might break. She was 11, suffered from anxiety and deathly afraid of Raymond's needle. When her ordeal was over and she finally was able to smile again, I handed her a toothbrush to take home. She ran out, down the stairs and out into the afternoon light. Two minutes later, she returned with an older student who spoke a smattering of English. ""Thank you,"" the older girl told me. ""She would not have been able to bear this without you."" I watched Angmo return to her schoolmates playing on a swing set in the shadows of a 17th century Tibetan-style palace. Every visitor to Leh makes the trek up to that palace. From up there, tourists gasp at the scenery before them, the majesty of the Himalayas ahead and all of the city below. But most tourists will never see what I did in Leh. I saw a part of my homeland through a new lens. For that, I am grateful.

"(CNN) -- The 911 call is accusatory. The woman flatly tells the dispatcher she just witnessed several police officers in East Bakersfield, California, beat a man to death. The woman -- identified by the local newspaper as Salina Quair, 34 -- happened upon the scene as she left Kern Medical Center, where the father of four would later die. ""There's a man laying on the floor, and your police officers beat the sh-t out of him and killed him,"" said Quair, according to a tape of the 911 call obtained by CNN affiliate KERO-TV. ""I'm right here on the corner of Flower and Palm right now and you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight sheriffs. The guy was laying on the floor, and eight sheriffs ran up and started beating him up with sticks. The man is dead laying right here, right now,"" she continues. The sheriff's office has named the seven deputies involved in the incident, including a sergeant, while the California Highway Patrol has yet to name its two officers who responded to the scene. The area is largely residential, packed with one-story homes and small apartment complexes. In addition to the hospital, East Bakersfield High School and the county coroner's office are within two blocks of the intersection where David Sal Silva died. The Kern County Sheriff's Office has said it will not comment until the investigation is complete, but a news release says the incident began May 7 just before midnight. A deputy responded to a call that a man, later identified as Silva, 33, was lying on the ground, possibly intoxicated. Silva was ""uncooperative,"" according to the sheriff's office, even after a canine was deployed. ""The suspect continued to actively resist the deputy and the K-9. Additional deputies arrived on scene, along with two CHP officers who responded to assist. The suspect continued to resist and received baton strikes from the deputies attempting to take him into custody,"" according to the sheriff's news release. After Silva was restrained, police requested medical assistance for his injuries, the release said. He was having trouble breathing and was taken across the street to the hospital. ""While being treated at KMC, the suspect was pronounced dead at about 12:44 a.m.,"" the news release said. Several witnesses have painted a more brutal picture, saying that Silva was crying for help and officers continued to beat him until he fell silent. Others have said they captured the incident on their cell phones. Two of those witnesses hired attorneys after police confiscated their phones, KERO reported. In a news release Tuesday, the Kern County Sheriff's Office said that Youngblood has requested the FBI's help in analyzing ""two cell phones pursuant to a search warrant related to the ... death of David Silva."" It was not immediately clear which phones these are or what ""forensic analysis"" is being done, though the office did say that Bakersfield police saw one of the phones on video from the incident, but not the other one. Youngblood also asked the FBI to conduct a ""parallel"" investigation into the incident. ""I think it's the right thing for the public, and I think it's the right thing for this organization,"" the sheriff told reporters Tuesday. The only video released thus far is from a security camera, and the quality is poor. It appears to show two men scuffling for about two minutes before another man arrives. The two men appear to repeatedly hit the third man as he's on his knees and later lying on the ground. Police cars arrive and officers gather around the man on the ground, but their actions aren't clear. The video is grainy, and the blur of light and shadows makes it difficult to determine what is happening. Witnesses told CNN they were awakened by the incident. One witness, who asked not to be identified, described a chaotic scene. ""He was asking for help. He was screaming with pain. He only got to ask for help like three times,"" he said. ""Those hits were brutal."" Sheriff Donnie Youngblood promised a fair investigation into the incident. ""I'm waiting till this investigation is done so I can look at it objectively and decide whether we did something wrong, and If we did, I'll stand up and tell you that we did. If we didn't, I'll stand up and tell you that we didn't,"" he told KERO. In November, the family of Jose Lucero, 33, won a $4.5 million civil judgment against the Kern County Sheriff's Office, according to The Bakersfield Californian. After the mentally ill Lucero had made delusional 911 calls, four deputies beat, pepper-sprayed and Tasered him, killing him in front of his parents, according to the newspaper's report about the 2010 incident. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Stephanie Elam contributed to this report.","NEW: Having the FBI investigate is ""the right thing for the public,"" California sheriff says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- As winter recedes, winds whip through downtown Seoul and chill the crowds of commuters on their way home. The sun is dropping and the pale golden light streams between tall buildings. A girl smiles as she chats excitedly on her cell phone. Men in black suits cluster on a street corner debating their happy hour destination. Nowhere is there the slightest inkling that anyone in this second largest metropolitan area in the world -- is fearful or even anxious about the stream of threats emanating from North Korea. Just as sure as spring is coming, most seem to find it entirely normal that warnings of thermonuclear war, annihilation and utter devastation punctuate this, the season of joint U.S., South Korean military maneuvers. Opinion: Why North Korea regime is scary . ""We are post-war, we don't worry about that,"" a journalist specializing in local news told me. ""We take it for granted."" He was just one of about 30 reporters I met in a session discussing news in the South Korean capital this week. Seoul is a scant 30 miles from the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea -- one of the most militarized places on the planet. If a full-scale war were to break out, the South Korean capital would be Pyongyang's prime target. It might only be minutes before artillery or rockets would come raining down. North Korea has an array of artillery and other conventional arms that make its military a credible threat, especially to South Korean. Pyongyang is also believed to possess thousands of tons of chemical agents, although it has denied possessing such weapons. I wondered aloud if South Koreans really weren't afraid or simply felt there was nothing they could do about it anyway? ""We're insensitive,"" one offered in reply. It's not the futility of fear in their predicament; it's that they have lived their entire lives under a cloud of threats and warnings from the North. ""We know North Korea doesn't want war,"" said another. ""They want money and food,"" adding that Pyongyang has tried it all -- missiles, the nuclear threat, its million man army -- to try to blackmail the South. Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell visited this week and told hundreds of people gathered for the Asian Leadership Conference that North Korea knew well an attack on South Korea, much less the United States, would mean a ""regime ending"" retaliation. He encouraged his mostly South Korean audience to be optimistic because they were part of the world that has grown more democratic and wealthier, as opposed to the road chosen by the Kim family dynasty. Rather than being burdened by the dark clouds of threats, Powell urged them to pursue jobs and human dignity, to focus on the environment and poverty reduction. What's Kim Jong Un up to? South Koreans seem overwhelmingly willing to take that advice. In the week I've been here, I have only found one woman who remembers participating in civilian air raid drills. ""It was 30 years ago,"" she told me. Today, Seoul's 25 million people have absolutely no ambition to live in constant fear. But Seoul isn't all of South Korea. ""It's different for us than people on the islands,"" one told me, recalling the attack in 2010 that killed four South Koreans on Yeonpyeong island barely outside North Korea's territorial waters. In Seoul, the prospect of war is unthinkable. But in a select few flashpoint areas, the threat of armed provocation is very real, indeed. Korean nightmare: Experts ponder potential conflict . I paused on a street corner near CNN's Seoul offices and looked up at the jagged peaks rising behind the Blue House, which is the South Korea's presidential office. If missiles ever did come streaking toward the South Korean capital, they would likely arc above those mountains. The nearest shelter, I thought, would be the subway system. I considered how long it would take me to get there, even if I were lucky enough to see them still short of their targets. My calculations weren't at all comforting. Then, like about everyone around me, I decided to think about something else. iReport: What are your views on North Korea's threats?","No indication of fear or anxiety in Seoul toward North Korean threats .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Americans appear split over President Barack Obama's health care proposals, according to a new national poll. Sen. Harry Reid, center, talks about health care flanked by Sens. Christopher Dodd, left, and Charles Schumer. Fifty percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning say they support the president's plans, with 45 percent opposed. The results indicate a generational divide. ""Obama's plan is most popular among younger Americans and least popular among senior citizens,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""A majority of Americans over the age of 50 oppose Obama's plan; a majority of those under 50 support it."" Read full transcript of poll . The poll's release comes as lawmakers go back to their home districts and states for summer recess. The House of Representatives is already on break and the Senate heads home at the end of the week. Some lawmakers are holding town hall meetings or other public forums on health care reform over the next few weeks, where voters will get a chance to speak out about the various proposals for change. The poll indicates that seven in 10 Americans say they're very or somewhat likely to attend such events. ""Nearly half of those who oppose the Obama plan say they are more likely to attend town hall meetings to express their views on health care; only 37 percent of those who support Obama's plan are very likely to attend a public forum on that issue,"" Holland said. The poll indicates that only three in 10 of all Americans think the president's health care proposals will help their families. Another 44 percent feel they won't benefit but that other families will be helped by the president's plans, and one in five say no one will be helped. ""Less than a quarter of Americans with private health insurance think that Obama's proposals would help them personally. Most people on Medicare and Medicaid also don't think that the Obama plan will help them,"" Holland said. The survey suggests that around seven out of 10 Americans think that major structural changes are necessary to reduce health care costs or provide insurance coverage to all Americans. At the same time, more than eight out of 10 people are satisfied with their own health care and nearly three out of four are happy with their own insurance. In any health care system, tough decisions that affect individual patients -- such as which people get certain treatments and which treatments are too expensive or ineffective -- must be made. The poll suggests that Americans are split on whom they prefer to make such choices, with 40 percent saying it should be the insurance companies and an equal amount believing that the government should make the call. The battle over health care is registering with people across the country. According to the survey, more than half of all Americans have strong feelings regarding the health care debate, with about a third saying they strongly oppose Obama's plans and 23 percent strongly in favor. ""On issues like this, intensity of opinion matters as much as numbers. Opponents of the president's health care reform seem to feel more intensely about it than Obama's supporters,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Monday, with 1,136 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll: Americans divided on Obama health care plans .

"(CNN) -- A South Florida man killed his wife and son with a crossbow, drove 460 miles to try and kill his other son, and then slit his own throat. The violent, long-distance rampage took Pedro Maldonado Sr. from one end of the state to the other. While the Broward County Sheriff's Office continues to piece together a time line, detectives believe Maldonado shot and killed his 47-year-old wife, Monica Narvaez-Maldonado, and their 17-year-old son, Pedro Maldonado Jr., with a crossbow in their Weston townhouse sometime on Monday. Weston is located about 13 miles west of Fort Lauderdale. The sheriff's report says Maldonado, 53, then drove about 460 miles north to Tallahassee in an attempt to kill his older son, JosÃ© Maldonado, who attends Florida State University. ""His dad did try to shoot him with the same handheld crossbow and the arrow hit Jose's ear,"" Dani Moschella, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's department, told CNN affiliate WSVN. ""Then his father tried to choke him, and JosÃ© luckily was able to get away."" JosÃ© Maldonado never reported the attack to police, but it was his father's confession to a friend on Tuesday that set authorities on his trail. The Broward Sheriff's report says Pedro Maldonado called a friend in Miami and admitted to killing his wife and son. A short time later, authorities found their bodies in the South Florida townhouse. Did Montana newlywed blindfold husband before pushing him off cliff? Later in the day, authorities learned that Maldonado might be in the Lake City area, about 100 miles east of Tallahassee. The Columbia County Sheriff's Office found his SUV at a hotel. After trying to contact Maldonado for hours, they entered his room and found him dead early Wednesday. He slit his own throat, authorities said. Man kills wife, dogs in home . ""I knew them. They were good neighbors.

"(CNN) -- Not long ago, presidential candidate Herman Cain made headlines when he said blacks were brainwashed for not considering conservative ideas. On other occasions he declared that racism was no longer a problem and blamed the poor for being poor. A personal friend, I know Cain to be more thoughtful than those incendiary sound bites, but I also suspect he knew that uttering them would help him land right where he is: atop the Republican presidential field, a standing that could be threatened by recent reports of sexual harassment allegations. Unfortunately, such trash talk -- popular among many black conservatives -- continues to alienate black Republicans from the African-American community. During the early '90s, when I was a member of The Atlanta Journal editorial board, I had high hopes that the black conservative movement -- to which I was a recent convert -- could help transform black America. I penned a number of columns urging the black community to put its vote in play so that Democrats would have to do something new to keep it and Republicans would be enticed to go after it. For me, the '90s was an exciting time for black conservatives. Having burst on the scene in the early '80s during the Reagan administration, they were everywhere. On the far right were free-market conservatives like economists Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams, along with establishment types such as Ward Connerly and Clarence Thomas. On the moderate side were professors like Glenn C. Loury, Shelby Steele and Stephen Carter. On the progressive side were voices like community grass-roots intellectual Robert Woodson and television host Tony Brown. Beyond those names, there were a number of other right-leaning black voices, from college campuses to the pulpit. Black conservatism was the most visible it had ever been since Booker T. Washington peddled self-help capitalism at the turn of the last century. But what excited me most was progressive black conservatism. Rooted in black nationalism and the self-help belief system of Malcolm X, it insisted that the black community be at the forefront of solving black problems. Far from being separatist or pessimistic, it was highly hopeful about America, recognizing that there was much more opportunity than there were obstacles. It was policy- and solutions-oriented, focusing on things like rebuilding the black family, black entrepreneurship, starting and supporting black businesses in poor neighborhoods, enterprise zones, housing vouchers, micro-lending, repealing Davis Bacon (a prevailing wage law that unfairly prevented unskilled, often black, workers from gaining apprenticeships on federally funded construction jobs), and starting Christian schools. It wasn't wholesale against social programs; it just wanted to duplicate the successes of those programs -- not necessarily government-led -- that actually worked. It didn't deny the existence of racism, but neither did it obsess over it, counting as more important those things over which blacks had control: persistence, hard work, academic exertion, and personal responsibility. But progressive black conservatism would never gain traction. Its lone supporter among white Republicans -- HUD Secretary Jack Kemp under George H. W. Bush -- who pushed a strong urban agenda, was ignored as his party pursued an aggressive suburban strategy that further alienated blacks. The tone of black conservatism became even more accommodationist, with progressive voices being drowned out, and never evolved beyond parroting long-held white conservative and neoconservative dogma. Today's crop of black conservatives is no different. In an environment of runaway corporate greed, where the top 1% is getting richer at the expense of the middle class, where rising college costs are making many students question the worth of a college education, where unemployment is hovering at 16% in the black community, where home values are drying up, and the economy is nearly on life support, black Republicans -- whose spiel is as one-dimensional as it was 20 years ago -- come off as even more tone-deaf. Their idea of reaching blacks is gimmicky. Just recently, RagingElephants.com launched ads in Austin, Texas, declaring, ""G.O.P. is the New Black"" and ""Martin Luther King, Jr. was a Republican."" An article written by Indiana tea party organizer Emery McClendon for Project 21, a national leadership network of black Republicans, says the tea party could appeal to more blacks if, among other things, it would show Sarah Palin and Dick Armey mingling with African-Americans. How laughable. Far from being rejected by a black community that is brainwashed, black conservatives have themselves to blame. They've appeared to care more about their own advancement and acceptance in the GOP than about truly helping blacks. That's a shame, because we still need a diversity of political ideas. If black conservatives really want to make black conservatism a serious force in the black community, they have to drop their ""just get over it"" philosophy about racism and its lingering effects, stand up to the GOP when it does something wrong, and come up with a real urban agenda. Take racism. Though I agree with them that it's not the No.1 problem blacks face today, there's no denying the fact that structural racism remains interwoven into the nation's criminal justice, educational and corporate cultures. All one has to do is read Michelle Alexander's excellent book , ""The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,"" or an insightful article by Jennifer Hochschild and Vesla Weaver, ""The Skin Color Paradox and the American Racial Order,"" in the December 2007 edition of Social Forces, to see the impact of racism in the criminal justice system and how darker-skinned blacks are relegated to overall lower socioeconomic status, more entanglements with the criminal justice system, and a reduced chance of holding elective office than their lighter-skinned counterparts. A 2003 University of Chicago study found that African-Americans with black-sounding names were less likely to get called back for job interviews. Ignoring such evidence robs black conservatives of credibility and moral authority. Telling blacks, some of whom are poor, desperate and penniless, to just pull ""yourselves up by your bootstraps"" -- while not at least acknowledging that historically, the boots were rigged, and in some cases they remain so -- is inauthentic and hypocritical. If black conservatives want to claim King, they should at least learn from him. During the civil rights movement, King said he couldn't in good conscience tell blacks to lay down their arms in the fight for freedom without speaking out against the Vietnam War. ""As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems,"" he said. ""I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through non-violent action; for they ask and write me, 'So what about Vietnam?' They ask if our nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without first having spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government."" King understood this simple fact: There is no moral authority in attacking the shortcomings of blacks while glossing over the sins of the larger society. Certainly, black conservatives are right to differ with black liberals about how racism impacts black advancement today. I understand what some of them are trying to do: get blacks to stop obsessing over what they can't control -- white people's hearts -- and focus on the things they can. Still, the argument rings hollow. I used to tell my son, ""A racist cop may pull you over because you're black, that's his fault; but if he finds drugs in the car, that's your fault."" Unlike some conservatives, I don't wish to let either party off the hook. As long as black conservatives appear to be attack dogs for the white establishment, they will always be a weak and ineffectual voice in the black community. Their views may win them a few elections, sell some books, and earn them the applause of their white counterparts, but it will remain a marginal movement that has no impact in the black community. Indeed, scarcely any blacks were excited when Michael Steele was elected chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2009 or when Rep. Allen West of Florida and Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina became the first two black Republicans to go to Congress since J.C. Watts of Oklahoma retired in 2003. And while we applaud the chutzpah of Cain and his amazing ability to have outperformed so many career politicians, it's his politics most blacks can't embrace. Bristling under recent reports that he had been the target of complaints of sexual harassment, Cain says he's being unfairly attacked, and I believe he is. The man I know has been married for 43 years and his character is unassailable. He's right that presidential politics places a big target on your back.

"(CNN) -- Kids having sex on prime time broadcast TV? Must be sweeps month. It's so predictable, it's almost laughable. Almost. That is, it would be if it weren't for the fact that there are real-world consequences for these brazen, ratings-boosting publicity ploys. Fox's soapy, teen-targeted ""Glee"" tried to boost sagging ratings this week by showing not one, but two teen couples having sex for the first time -- one gay, the other straight. Show co-creator Ryan Murphy and the folks over at ""Glee"" are spinning this as a ""teachable moment"" for teens and their parents, an opportunity for dialogue about safe sex and responsible choices. The problem is Ryan Murphy wants to have his cake and eat it, too. Hollywood loves to defend teen sex story lines by insisting, ""Kids are having sex! We're reflecting the real world!"" But the truth is much more sobering and complicated. Yes, there are and always have been sexually active teens, but never before have depictions of premarital teen sex been so widespread in the media. Today, you are more likely to see sexualized teens than adults in sexual situations. By presenting teen sex as common, the media marginalizes teens who choose to remain abstinent while increasing the pressure teens are already feeling to become sexually active. Television is a ""sexual super peer,"" according to Jane Brown, a professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of North Carolina. The phrase ""peer pressure"" is used to describe the influence a peer group can exert on a teen's decisions. Television amplifies that peer pressure by making the entire realm of television, and all the characters in it, part of the teen's peer group. When television portrays attractive, popular teenage characters as sexually active, it sends a powerful message to young viewers that there is an expectation that they, too, should be sexually active and, in fact, there might be something wrong with them, if they aren't. Teens are also aware that television influences their behavior. According to one survey, a third of youths age 12 and older say the media encourages them to have sex by making it seem like ""everybody does it."" And why shouldn't they get that impression? Beyond making teen sex the norm, researchers have found heavy television viewing to be predictive of positive attitudes toward ""recreational"" or casual sex and negative attitudes toward remaining a virgin. Studies have also found the more a teenager identifies with the characters they see on prime time TV shows, the more likely they are to be sexually experienced and to expect higher levels of sexual activity among their peers. At least half a dozen studies in the past few years have documented a strong correlation between exposure to adult media content as children and the early onset of sexual activity among teens. One study even found that viewing of sexual media content was predictive of teen pregnancy. If that isn't enough, why exactly do parents and teens need to sit down and watch a TV show that glamorizes teen sex in order to have a conversation about it? Let's hope most parents pass on Hollywood's attempt to help them out with the visuals and simply have an honest conversation with their teenagers. If history is a predictor of future behavior, we can expect this trend to continue. A season or two into Murphy's show ""Nip/Tuck"" on the FX network, he was interviewed for a Bravo network documentary about breaking sexual taboos on television. Murphy stated, ""It's tough to get that sexual point of view across on television. Hopefully I have made it possible for somebody on broadcast television to do a rear-entry scene in three years. Maybe that will be my legacy."" This, ladies and gentlemen, is the self-styled sex-ed teacher to America's teens. The worst thing parents can do is step aside and let Hollywood do the teaching. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Henson.","This week's ""Glee"" showed two teen couples -- one straight, one gay -- having sex for first time .

"(CNN) -- It just had to be him. Mario Gotze scored the winning goal for Bayern Munich against his old team Borussia Dortmund in a 3-0 result that some will say already puts an end to the title race in Germany. Gotze netted in the 66th minute after coming on as a substitute 10 minutes earlier, his low, right-footed shot to the far post beating Roman Weidenfeller in Dortmund. Arjen Robben and Thomas Muller ended any hopes of a Dortmund comeback by getting the second and third goals in the 85th and 87th minutes, respectively. Gotze didn't dare celebrate in front of the fans clad in yellow and black who once adored him. When the German international's move to Dortmund's fierce rival was all but confirmed in April -- Gotze then joined his new teammates in the off-season -- the mood of Dortmund supporters significantly changed and the 21-year-old became highly unpopular. Having completed the treble last season -- Bayern downed Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final -- Pep Guardiola's men are seemingly on their way to another successful campaign. Guardiola's side increased its lead over Dortmund, thought to be Bayern's only serious challenger in the Bundesliga, to seven points. Dortmund lost its third straight game in all competitions and would do well to arrest the slump given three of its regular back four are out injured. This week for cover Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp was forced to turn to free agent Manuel Friedrich, and the 34-year-old German international started Saturday. Dortmund's best chance early fell to Robert Lewandowski but the Polish striker's left-footed shot ballooned over the bar. Lewandowski could incur the wrath of the Dortmund faithful, too, if he shifts to Bayern Munich -- as expected -- in the near future. Gotze replaced Mario Mandzukic amid boos and the displeasure of the locals intensified when the opening goal arrived. Dortmund was left wide open as it chased a leveler and Robben and Muller took advantage. No Messi, no problem . Guardiola's former club Barcelona, deprived of the services of injured forward Lionel Messi for the rest of 2013, had little difficulty in dispatching Granada 4-0 at the Camp Nou, using a more direct approach. Andres Iniesta and the returning Cesc Fabregas sent Barcelona on its way with first-half goals from the penalty spot, with Alexis Sanchez and Pedro adding strikes in the second 45 minutes after Granada midfielder Manuel Iturra hacked down the latter for a second yellow card. ""We controlled the pace of the game, knowing when we had to play more directly and when we had to slow the match down,"" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino was quoted as saying by the club website. ""This side know how to play in different ways when they need to. ""We have a commitment to play attractive football and I think the fans enjoyed themselves today."" Barcelona also played without keeper Victor Valdes, midfielder Xavi and fullbacks Dani Alves and Jordi Alba. Barcelona led La Liga by three points over Atletico Madrid and was six better than Real Madrid going into the weekend and nothing changed by the time Saturday ended. Both Madrid teams had an even easier time than Barcelona. Atletico Madrid routed Getafe 7-0 and Real Madrid won 5-0 at Almeria. The sizzling Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo -- who single-handedly accounted for Sweden in the World Cup playoffs -- opened the scoring in the third minute for Real Madrid but limped off in the 54th. ""He had a problem with his thigh but I don't think it will be anything as there was no pain,"" Real manager Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""He will be back soon."" Real Sociedad, in the Champions League this season, rallied from 3-1 down to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3. Carlos Vela, like Messi a diminutive left-footer, scored all four goals for Sociedad. Milan woe . In Italy, AC Milan's drought in the league continued as it could only draw 10-man Genoa 1-1 at home. Thomas Manfredini was given a straight red card shortly before halftime for hauling down Mario Balotelli in the box but the striker missed the resulting spot kick and Genoa hung on at the San Siro. Milan, without a Serie A victory since the middle of October, sits 18 points behind leader Roma. Napoli's title bid suffered a blow, defeated by Parma 1-0 at home. On Sunday, Juventus can leapfrog Roma atop the standings by defeating Livorno. Roma, slowed by successive draws following a record 10-0-0 start in Serie A, hosts Cagliari on Monday.","Mario Gotze scores the winning goal for Bayern Munich against old team Borussia Dortmund .

"(CNN) -- Think you have to pay a lot for a Valentine's gift this year? Spare a thought for romantics in Bangkok, Thailand, where florists charge $45 for just one rose. Bangkok, Hong Kong and Tokyo are some of the more expensive places in which to buy red roses for Valentine's Day, according to an informal price check by CNN on Thursday. A dozen premium Dutch roses cost a whopping $487 in the Thai capital Thursday. In Hong Kong, a dozen roses cost $205, and in Tokyo, they cost $120. The price was much cheaper in China -- just $15 for a 12-stem bouquet of homegrown roses -- but buying a dozen is not the norm. In fact, there is a romantic meaning behind a whole range of numbers, giving Valentines a range of ways to profess their love. One rose means ""You're the only one,"" and three says ""I love you."" Sending 108 roses is equivalent to a marriage proposal, and 365 means ""I think of you every day."" And for $1,516, Beijing shops were offering a total of 999 roses, which means ""We'll be together forever."" Prices were cheaper elsewhere across Asia. In Jakarta, Indonesia, and Seoul, South Korea, a dozen roses were going for $60 at florist shops Thursday. A similar bouquet in Delhi, India, cost only $9. By far the cheapest prices of the informal survey were in Nairobi, Kenya, where 22 roses -- nearly two dozen -- cost about $2.50. That's because Kenya is a major rose producer and horticultural exporter. In 2008, the value of Kenyan flower exports was nearly $500 million, according to the Kenya Flower Council. The country shipped more than 93,000 tons of flowers that year, and annual growth has averaged more than 10% for the past six years. Almost all of Kenya's flower exports -- 97% -- are to Europe, the council says. But if it was Kenyan roses they were selling Thursday at London's Liberty department store, the cheap prices weren't filtering down to consumers. Liberty was sold out of red roses Thursday and other colors were costing between $58 and $96 per dozen. The United States imports more than 80% of its Valentine's Day roses, primarily from Colombia and Ecuador, according to the Society of American Florists. The vast majority of the rest come from California. The reason so many come from abroad has to do with weather and timing, the society said. Growers need 50 to 70 days to produce enough roses for Valentine's Day after the demand for red roses at Christmas is filled. Winter's shorter daylight hours and higher energy costs hamper efforts to grow large rose crops. Plus, in order to grow a single long-stemmed rose -- a Valentine's Day favorite -- growers have to nip off several rosebuds along the stem, reducing the total number of roses they can grow, the society said. The average Valentine's Day price for a dozen florist-arranged, long-stemmed roses in the United States is just above $73, according to the Society of American Florists. At other times of the year, it's just more than $59.","Bangkok, Thailand, has some of the most expensive Valentine's roses .

"(CNN) -- A 21-year-old Indianapolis man has been charged with stealing samples of the brains of dead mental patients from a medical museum, authorities said Thursday. The specimens were allegedly later sold online. The man, identified as David Charles, allegedly stole more than 60 jars of brain and other human tissues in early October from a warehouse space at the Indiana Medical History Museum, the Marion County prosecutor's office said in court papers Thursday. Charles was arrested December 16 on felony theft and other charges. Charles is to appear an Indianapolis court later this month in connection with the alleged theft of dozens of jars of preserved human brain tissue valued at about $4,800. Court documents said some jars were sold on the auction site eBay by a middleman, despite a company policy against listing ""humans, the human body, or any human body parts or products."" Attempts to reach Charles on Thursday were unsuccessful. He declined to comment when seen outside his Indianapolis home by a reporter with CNN affiliate WXIN. The alleged scheme began to unravel when the executive director of the museum, Mary Ellen Hennessey Nottage, received a call last month from a man in California who said he had purchased ""six jars of brain matter"" for $600 on eBay, according to court documents. The man suspected the jars were stolen when he compared them to others on the museum website. Nottage notified the police. Nottage said the California man collected oddities. The specimens he bought were stolen from a warehouse space on the museum campus, where thousands of jars of brain and other human tissue from autopsies performed on patients at the now-defunct Central Indiana Hospital for the Insane in the 1890s were stored. ""Apparently that's a trend that's building -- the macabre, the oddities,"" Nottage said. ""The television reality show 'Oddities' illustrates that very well. I think it's indicative of people's collecting interests. It's definitely bizarre. It's infuriating that they do not have respect for the human remains."" In the universe of bizarre items that Internet users sell on eBay -- host to millions of auctions each day -- human organs are forbidden. To buy or sell them is a felony under federal law, and trading in illegal goods is a violation of eBay's rules. The list of prohibited items includes Native American grave-related items such as skulls and skeletons intended for medical research, Tibetan prayer skulls, organs, bones, blood, waste products, body fluids and sperm. Police determined that the buyer on eBay had received the brains from a middleman who allegedly got them from Charles. Charles was arrested during a sting after allegedly agreeing to sell jars of brains to an undercover officer at a Dairy Queen, police said. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, a professor of medical anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, and director of Organs Watch, a program that researches human organ trafficking around the world, said the sale of the organs of deceased people was uncommon compared to a thriving, worldwide trade in illegal organ sales of living people. That trend has been fueled by the Internet and a global shortage of organs for transplants. ""Wherever there's an Internet, people are trying to sell organs,"" Scheper-Hughes said. Charles also was charged with marijuana possession and possession of paraphernalia. Additional charges are possible, A.J. Deer, spokesman for the Marion County prosecutor's office, said without elaborating. The Indiana Medical History Museum is on the grounds of what used to be the Pathological Department of Central State Hospital, according to the museum's website. Central State Hospital was opened in 1848 as a ""hospital for the insane"" and closed in 1994, according to the Indiana Commission on Public Records website. ""We have thousands of pieces in the warehouse and we're still checking against our inventory,"" Hennessey Nottage said.","Indianapolis man charged with theft of human brain samples from medical museum .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a year after the presidential election, the excitement of Barack Obama's campaign has faded into the reality of an Obama White House. As observers try to determine what time it is in American politics, they arrive at opposite conclusions. To some, said Tulane University political scientist Thomas Langston, Obama is like Jimmy Carter, and the nation will soon hammer the nails into the coffin of a dying Democratic coalition just as voters, tired of the Carter ""malaise"" era, handed the White House to Republicans in 1980. To others, Obama has come to usher in a new understanding of the relationship between the government and the people. To them, Langston said, it's the dawning of a new age, as depicted in a famous 1984 Ronald Reagan campaign ad that declared, ""It's morning again in America."" Both Obama and Carter were elected into office at a time when voters were hungry for change. Carter represented the antithesis of President Nixon and a break from the disillusionment and mistrust of government caused by the Watergate scandal. Carter, like Obama, learned the ropes in a state Senate. Critics accused Carter of being inexperienced, having served one term as the governor of Georgia. But the Democratic candidate presented himself as a politician outside of politics and a reformer uninterested in partisan games. ""With Carter himself, there was a sense of a kind of national renewal in some ways that people have said has been true after the very difficult years of the Bush presidency,"" said Russell Riley, chair of the Miller Center's Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia. Shortly after taking office, Carter's approval rating peaked at 75 percent but dropped to the low 40s in a little more than a year. He entered office weighed down by a sagging economy, and eventually, the energy crisis, the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian hostage crisis took a toll on his administration. ""He ended his presidency, of course, holed up in the White House as a virtual captive himself of the Iranian hostage takers,"" Langston said. The parallels to Carter come primarily from Obama's Republican critics. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist speculated last month that a Carter-esque loss ""may happen again,"" and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has predicted that a Republican resurgence -- like the one he led in the mid '90s -- could be just around the corner. ""Carter is held up as the model of the ineffectual president -- a saint of a man but an ineffectual president. And so when people compare Obama to Carter, that is an attack,"" said David Gergen, a senior political analyst for CNN who also worked in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations. The comparison to Carter, Gergen said, is more of a danger sign for Obama than it is a reality because it shows how the storyline has changed. When Obama first came into office, observers likened him to some of the most successful presidents in U.S. history, such as Franklin Roosevelt, Gergen said. Now, Obama's also being compared to a president who didn't live up to expectations. The Carter comparison shows how much polarization has occurred in the country since the election, Gergen said. Under Carter, there was also a sense of polarization -- but it was in the president's party. The liberal wing of the Democrats felt abandoned to the point that Sen. Edward Kennedy, one of the top liberals in Congress, challenged Carter in his 1980 re-election bid. Kennedy came up short, but his bid severely weakened Carter and contributed to his eventual defeat in the 1980 election to Reagan, Riley said. While the similarities are not lost on Riley, what's more telling is the ""most important mistake that [Obama] didn't make."" When Carter took office, there were Democrats with executive branch experience available, but he didn't want to use them. ""Carter was criticized for bringing in the 'Georgia Mafia,' "" Riley said, referring to Carter's decision to give key positions to people from his home state. Obama, however, stacked his bench with pros from the Clinton administration. He brought in some advisers from Chicago, Illinois, some from Washington and others such as Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel with deep ties to both places. That move was critical, Riley said, ""because if you've got seasoned people in these positions, they're much more likely to make adjustments and to know Capitol Hill in a way that will allow them to weather the kinds of problems that were common to both Carter and Obama."" John Geer, a Vanderbilt University political scientist, said the comparisons to Carter are weak. ""Jimmy Carter is a very rare exception in American history. Most first-term presidents get a second term,"" he said, adding that it's especially rare since Carter's term came on the heels of previous Republican rule. President George H.W. Bush also served one term, but it came after eight years of Republican control of the White House. The more analogous comparison so far, Geer said, is to Reagan, who also entered the White House with a full plate of foreign policy problems -- mostly surrounding the Cold War -- and a major economic crisis at hand. Reagan was a gifted politician, Geer said. He was known as an inspiring communicator, and his appeal crossed party lines. Like Obama, polls showed that Reagan was more popular than his policies. More than 20 years after he left the White House, Republicans still look to him as the last great face of the party. ""Reagan continues to be the touchstone, the smiling Buddha figure. Everybody rubs his belly for good luck,"" Langston said. ""Like the smiling Buddha, he is whatever you want him to be."" In his book ""The Audacity of Hope,"" Obama wrote that although he and Reagan had differing political viewpoints, he understands the Republican president's appeal. ""Reagan spoke to America's longing for order, our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind, impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies, so long as we rediscover the traditional values of hard work, patriotism, personal responsibility, optimism, and faith,"" he wrote. Gergen, who was director of communications for Reagan, said the comparisons to Reagan are strained because of their opposite governing styles. Where as Obama tries to draw consensus, Reagan drew lines, he said. ""Reagan was a conviction politician, and Barack Obama is a consensus-seeking politician,"" Gergen said. ""Barack Obama was a magical figure in his campaign, ran an extremely good campaign, but also based it more on the sense of hope and change as ideas, the particular policy solutions, à la Reagan."" Martin Anderson, an economic policy adviser to Reagan, said Obama and Reagan faced similar problems in their first year but approached them with different solutions. Faced with an economic crisis, Reagan's strategy was to reduce taxes, let the American people figure out what to do and then find out what went wrong, Anderson said. After Reagan cut taxes in his first year, there were no immediate changes. ""It looked terrible, and it didn't look very good during the second year. And then it began to catch and it worked ... and it was really terrific on the third and the fourth and the fifth and so on,"" Anderson said. As for Obama's approach to country's economic woes -- it's too early to tell what will happen, he said. In his first few months in office, Reagan also went through a game-changing experience that had ramifications for both him and the country: He got shot. ""He came very close to dying. It was right down next to his heart. Just stunned everything, stunned everybody,"" Anderson recalled. But within weeks, Reagan was back at work -- with a positive attitude and good sense of humor. ""And the Democrats -- after he came to life again -- they took a deep sigh and said, 'OK, you can do whatever you want,' "" Anderson said. As tragic as the 1981 assassination attempt was, Reagan's quick recovery -- and the sympathy from Democrats -- provided momentum for the president's agenda. ""The first year is a very tough year for any president,"" Anderson said, noting that each year thereafter is ""dramatically different."" Asked what he thinks about comparisons to Carter and Reagan, Anderson replied, ""You know who he looks like? Obama."" Looking to administrations past, Obama can learn a valuable lesson, Gergen said. ""Don't spend time wallowing in arguments about who you might be -- spend time worrying about who you are and worrying about governing."" The similarities between Obama and his predecessors, while interesting to discuss, are not foreboding, Riley said. ""There is no exact historical parallel to what we are looking at right now. There are bits and pieces here and there,"" he said. It's impossible, however to take those similarities and ""piece out from them a guaranteed scenario that he is going to end up in the same place."" That idea, he said, is perhaps best summed up in a quote attributed to Mark Twain: ""History doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes.""","Presidents Obama, Carter both elected at a time when voters wanted change .

"(CNN) -- Debbie Benzine lost her first husband to heart disease when he was 44. His death left her to raise a young child alone. For 16 years, she stayed single because, ""going through it once was enough for me."" When she met Dale Benzine, he weighed around 300 pounds but was in pretty good physical shape. Yet over time, she watched as the former football player started taking pills for his high cholesterol and high blood pressure, more for anxiety and gout, and insulin shots for his Type 2 diabetes. ""His girth got bigger, as did his neck, which caused sleep apnea,"" she remembers. After the Atlanta couple got married, she found herself buying him bigger and bigger clothes. When her insurance company announced that bariatric surgery, or weight-loss surgery, would be covered under the couple's plan, she told her husband about it. ""I knew he had to do something, but I wasn't sure he was ready for something so drastic,"" she says. He was. The doctor had flat-out told Benzine: ""Lose weight or die."" He was tired of taking so many medications and not having enough energy to simply live life. ""One day ... you find out that you're 56 years old and if you want to see 66 you better do something about it,"" he says. There are several types of bariatric surgery. With gastric bypass, a new stomach about the size of a golf ball is created by cutting across the top of the stomach and connecting the smaller pouch with the intestines. Another type involves placing an adjustable band around the upper portion of the stomach. The device can be tightened or loosened at subsequent doctor's visits. It can help patients feel fuller faster and eat less. Unlike gastric bypass, adjustable gastric band procedures can be easily reversed. Benzine decided to do the gastric bypass surgery. Although doctors aren't sure why, studies have shown gastric bypass puts Type 2 diabetes into remission in most obese patients. Dale also didn't want to have the option of reversing the surgery. ""In the back of your mind you can always take the band off,"" he says of the lap-band procedure. ""I didn't want to be able to go back."" Getting approved for the surgery was more difficult than he expected. Many people who have bariatric surgery gain the weight back, so insurance companies are often wary of paying for the procedure. Benzine saw his primary care physician, a nutritionist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a gastroenterologist and a psychiatrist -- all of whom had to sign off. The psychiatrist told Benzine he rejected upward of half his patients because they weren't prepared to make the necessary life changes after the surgery. Benzine admitted that 10 years ago he wouldn't have been ready either. ""I'm from Wisconsin,"" he says. ""I enjoyed my beer, brats and cheese too much."" But kids and grandkids ""changes things."" He was ready. He eventually got the go-ahead. The day of his surgery, his wife recalls she was an emotional wreck. ""I tried to dissuade (him) from having it. What if they made a wrong cut? What if he didn't wake up? What if he had a heart attack on the table?"" The surgery was a success, but he was far from the ideal patient. Shortly after surgery he ate a popsicle too fast and starting throwing up. When he got home, he continued his trial-and-error period, getting sick as he learned his limits. ""Imagine after you eat your big Thanksgiving dinner -- times 10,"" he says of overeating with his smaller stomach. ""And you can't do anything about it. You're just so miserable and it's either got to come up or go out."" He started out on a liquid diet, then pureed his food. Slowly he introduced solids. ""We didn't go to happy hour or dinner with friends because he was uncomfortable,"" Debbie Benzine says. ""I started hiding out to eat because I felt guilty."" It was like being a baby and learning to eat all over again, Benzine says. He realized that meat -- steak, chicken, turkey -- was too tough for his stomach to handle. But popcorn went down easily. He developed 10 rules for himself, and other bariatric patients, and the weight began to fall off. In six months, he had lost more than 125 pounds. The hardest thing for him was filling time. He had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food. He now smokes a cigar instead of eating a bag of chips, or plans a big weekend getaway to celebrate a work success. He orders an appetizer instead of an entree when he goes out to play cards with friends during the week. His daily diet routinely consists of Greek yogurt, protein bars, soup, popcorn, cheese and crackers. He doesn't eat large meals, just smaller portions whenever he's hungry. In some ways, his wife has had to alter her lifestyle to fit his. It hasn't been easy, the couple says, but it has been worth it. ""I'm 57 going on 37,"" Benzine says with a laugh. ""No pun intended -- I'm like a kid in a candy store."" He plans to attend his 40th high school reunion in June with pride: ""I know I'll be one of the only people who can say they weigh less at that reunion than they did in high school."" More importantly, ""I will have my husband and best friend around for a long time,"" his wife says. Follow Dale's '10 Commandments' of bariatric surgery . 1) Set your goals early, both in pounds to lose and the date by which you want to achieve this loss. Keep a daily log or scorecard of your weight loss. 2) Trial and error of foods and liquids will be necessary, but painful. Blueberries were terrible for me, but butter-free popcorn worked. Go figure. Hint: Keep your anti-nausea pills close by -- you will definitely need them in the beginning. 3) Find a high-protein breakfast and lunch that you can live with each day. (Mine was Greek yogurt for breakfast and smoothies with strawberry, banana and chocolate protein.) Also, stay true to your vitamin regimen, especially vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium. 4) Concentrate on changing your daily eating habits from three large meals per day, plus snacks, to five to six small meals. 5) Stay hydrated! It's very important that you avoid getting dehydrated, so avoid intake of caffeine, carbonated sodas, beer and alcohol. 6) Move more while you are eating less. Start out walking 30 minutes, four to five days a week. Build up to walking farther and faster, and more often, while adding weight lifting two to three days per week. You will be amazed how fast the weight will start dropping once you get into this routine, plus your dog will love it even more than you! 7) Start rewarding your new body with activities instead of food. Reward yourself by going to see a favorite performer if you hit a weight loss goal. Join a card club, start reading again, or make a movie date with your significant other each week. Replacing your ""going out to eat"" time with activities will arguably be the best move you will make during this whole journey. 8) It's OK to leave food on your plate! Regardless of what your mother said growing up, children in Africa, India or China aren't going to be affected if you leave food on your plate when eating at home or away. People will ask why, but trust me, you won't be hurting their feelings if you just say you're full. 9) Order an appetizer as your main meal when eating out. You will be amazed how full you will be after eating the smaller servings and your pocketbook will also thank you. 10) And last, but definitely not least, welcome and embrace your support network, be it a wife, friend, business colleague, etc. You will have good days and a few bad ones and the unconditional love and support these people will show you will help you push through the bad and be there to help celebrate the good!

"(CNN) -- Soccer star Nicolas Anelka has sparked controversy after making a gesture one French government official called ""shocking"" and ""disgusting."" After he scored his first goal for West Bromwich Albion in Saturday's 3-3 draw at West Ham in the English Premier League, the former France international pointed his right arm straight down and touched that arm with his left hand. The gesture is known as a ""quenelle,"" but some have called it a Nazi salute in reverse. Anelka took to Twitter and claimed the ""gesture was just a special dedication to my comedian friend Dieudonne"" but the French government is seeking to ban Dieudonne for alleged anti-Semitic behavior. French Sports Minister Valerie Fourneyron added on Twitter that there was no place for Anelka's gesture. ""Anelka's gesture is a shocking provocation, disgusting,"" she said. ""There's no place for anti-Semitism on the football field."" West Brom's caretaker manager Keith Downing defended Anelka, who converted to Islam almost a decade ago, when he spoke to reporters following the match. ""It is dedicated to a French comedian he knows very, very well,"" Downing said. ""I think speculation can be stopped now. It is absolute rubbish really."" However, the European Jewish Congress called for English authorities to punish Anelka. ""This salute is merely a lesser known Nazi salute and we expect the same kind of punishment to be handed down by the authorities as if Anelka had made the infamous outstretched arm salute,"" its president Dr. Moshe Kantor said in a statement on Sunday. ""This salute was created by a well-known extreme anti-Semite who has displayed his hatred of Jews, mocked the Holocaust and Jewish suffering. ""It is sickening that such a well-known footballer would make such an abusive and hateful gesture in front of tens of thousands of spectators. There should be no room for such intolerance and racism in sports and we expect that the English Premier League officials as well as the police will give Anelka the appropriate punishment."" The EPL has yet to comment on the incident, but British media reported that the English Football Association would investigate it. This isn't the first time Anelka -- who has played for the likes of Juventus, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Arsenal in a 19-year career -- has been involved in controversy. He earned the nickname of ""Le Sulk"" due to his body language and was thrown out of the 2010 World Cup by France after he allegedly insulted then coach Raymond Domenech at halftime during a defeat against Mexico. Anelka was later banned for 18 matches by the French Football Federation, and in response he announced his international retirement. He had been part of France's European Championship-winning squad in 2000. At Real Madrid he allegedly once refused to train and was banned by the Spanish club for 45 days. Anelka is now playing for his sixth English club, having left Chelsea in January 2012 for a big-money move to Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua. He lasted just a year there before going to Italy for a five-month loan with Juventus, which won a second successive Serie A title. The 34-year-old had a difficult start to his time at West Brom, which was marred by the death of his agent in August. The West Ham game was his first appearance since late October, and he scored his first goals for the club in what was his eighth outing. West Brom, which sacked manager Steve Clarke this month after a poor run of results, is 15th in the 20-team EPL.","Nicolas Anelka under fire for making an alleged anti-Semitic gesture after scoring goal .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for more than three hours in Jerusalem on Friday as he pushed a new framework for a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. The meeting was private, but earlier in the day, three Republican senators who also met with Netanyahu shared some of Israel's concerns. Netanyahu named two major concerns, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told reporters. One is the threat of a nuclear Iran, and the other is the marginalization of Israel by Palestinians going outside of the peace talks and directly to the United Nations to seek statehood. Graham, who was accompanied by Sens. John McCain of Arizona and John Barrasso of Wyoming, said they shared the prime minister's concerns. The trio of Republicans said they support a lasting peace process, but not one that puts Israel at a disadvantage. Kerry arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday and immediately headed for Jerusalem, the start of his ninth trip to the region since taking over as America's top diplomat nearly a year ago. At the outset of the trip, he said that the time is close for tough decision-making. A senior State Department official said Kerry's talks with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas would be substantive. ""It is an effort to provide agreed guidelines for a permanent status agreement; that is to say, a full and final peace treaty between the parties,"" the official said. Kerry's proposal is based on five months of intensive consultations with Israelis and Palestinians since the resumption of the peace process last summer. As a result of those talks, he intends to test some of his ideas with the two leaders. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

"(CNN) -- The Dakar Rally claimed another victim Friday, as organizers announced the death of an experienced competitor in the motorbikes section. The body of 50-year-old Belgian Eric Palante was found at the 143km mark of the previous day's stage from Chilecito to San Miguel de Tucuman, the longest of the grueling race. A support truck had gone in search of the rider, who had been missing overnight after the 911km marathon leg. Two members of a local Argentine news team also died while following Thursday's fifth stage when their car plunged into a ravine. Organizers of the annual event said Palante's death would be examined by a judge in the Catamarca Province of Argentina, but reported on their official website that ""no alert"" had been received ahead of his fatal accident. They paid tribute to the Honda rider, who was bidding for victory in the amateur motorbikes section: ""He knew the race very well, and over the years his enthusiastic but serious approach had made him one of the pillars of the event. ""It is with great sadness that the organizers and the entire family of the Dakar offer their condolences to Eric's family and friends."" Palante is the 27th competitor to die in the rally since it was first staged in 1978, while more than 50 have died overall, including spectators, support crew and the media. The marathon motor rally, for cars, motorbikes and trucks, was originally staged between Paris and Dakar in Senegal. It was moved to South America, principally Argentina and Chile, in 2009 because of threats of terrorism.","Motorbike competitor on Dakar Rally found dead .

"(CNN) -- Without talisman Lionel Messi, Barcelona slipped to their second defeat in a week as a 1-0 reverse at Athletic Bilbao Sunday blew the Spanish title race wide open. Already qualified for the Champions League knockout stages, their 2-1 midweek loss to Ajax Amsterdam could be forgiven, but Iker Muniain's 70th minute winner for Athletic has far greater significance. It was Barca's first league reverse of the season and left them level on points with Atletico Madrid with arch-rivals Real Madrid snapping at their heels a further three points adrift. Athletic, who are unbeaten at their new San Mames stadium, have moved up into the fourth Champions League spot with the victory. Muniain might have put them ahead in the first half but he wasted a great chance from close range, while Barcelona offered little in reply. Brazil's Neymar was kept quiet but just after half time he burst through only to be pulled back by home midfielder Ander Iturraspe, who was lucky to escape with a yellow card. But the men from the Basque country remained a constant threat and Markel Susaeta crossed for Muniain to slide home his decisive goal. A second should have followed but Gaizka Toquero headed a cross straight at Barcelona goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto, who made a reaction save. Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino flung on Sergi Roberto and Pedro as late substitutes, but to no avail. Messi was confined to the sidelines for the second time this season last month with a hamstring injury which is set to keep him out of action until January, missing at least two more La Liga games. Meanwhile in Italy, champions Juventus went three points clear of early pace setters Roma with a 1-0 win over Udinese Sunday. It took an injury-time header from Spain striker Fernando Llorente to grab the three vital points as he headed Stephan Lichsteiner's shot past Zeljko Brkic. Juve had plenty of chances to wrap up their 12th win of the season and sixth in a row, but were frustrated by dogged defense and poor finishing until the last gasp strike. Earlier, Roma were held to their fourth draw in a row, 1-1 away at Atalanta. Napoli, who are in third, nine points adrift, travel to Lazio Monday. Fourth placed Inter Milan failed to make up ground as they were held 1-1 at home to Sampdoria. Renan scored a late leveler for Sampdoria after Fredy Guarin had given Inter an 18th minute lead at the San Siro.","Barcelona lose first La Liga game of the season .

Officers went into the teenager's classroom around 1:15 p.m. Friday and arrested him on charges that included unauthorized possession of a firearm, careless storage of ammunition and carrying a concealed weapons. He is set to appear in court at Toronto's Old City Hall on Saturday morning, police said.

"(CNN) -- The men accused in the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old Indian woman were formally charged with murder, rape and kidnapping in a New Delhi court Thursday, a senior police official said. The attack on the woman, who died from her severe injuries last week, has appalled and enraged many Indians, prompting widespread debate over the way the country handles sexual assaults and the treatment of women in Indian society. Numerous protests have taken place, new laws have been proposed and senior lawyers in the court district where the accused men have been charged say they will not represent them. Police submitted charges against five suspects before a new fast-track court in Saket, a southern district of New Delhi, said Suman Nalwa, deputy police commissioner of a special unit for women and children. He said authorities were waiting for the outcome of a bone marrow test before deciding whether a sixth suspect in the attack, believed to be a minor, will be charged as a juvenile or an adult. 'She could have been me': Action urged after Delhi gang rape case . The results of the test, intended to determine the suspect's exact age, should come soon, Nalwa said. The trial will begin this week once all the evidence is gathered, he said. As well as counts of murder, kidnapping and rape, the men face charges including voluntarily causing harm during a robbery, armed robbery with murder, and destruction of evidence. If convicted, several of the offenses are punishable by death or life imprisonment. The victim, whose name has not been released, died Saturday in a Singapore hospital, where she received treatment after being airlifted from New Delhi. The men are accused of assaulting the woman and her male companion on a bus in the Indian capital on December 16, robbing them of their belongings before dumping them at the side of a road, police said. The male companion was eventually discharged from a local hospital. iReport: 'I'm ashamed as a man' Protests, which have been taking place every day since the woman's death, continued Thursday in New Delhi. Authorities plan to seek the death penalty for the accused, CNN affiliate IBN reported, with many calls for the men to be hanged, including from the victim's family. If the sixth accused is confirmed to be a minor, he could be sent to a children's home for a maximum of three years, according to IBN. The 11 lawyers who make up the executive board of the Saket Bar Association on Wednesday vowed not to represent any of the accused assailants because of the nature of the crime. In addition, the bar association has appealed to its 7,000 members also to refrain from representing the accused, said the association's president, Rajpal Kasana. ""We are not taking this case on the grounds of humanity,"" he said. The boycott by the bar association does not mean the accused will not have lawyers. Attorneys from other districts or ones appointed by the court will likely fill that role. Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013 . The call for local lawyers to avoid defending the accused is unprecedented, but justified because ""everyone is emotionally attached to this case,"" Kasana said. Lawmakers are weighing a proposal to toughen the country's anti-rape law. Some have suggested a new law should be named after the woman, while others have said it's illegal to reveal her identity. The victim's father told IBN that he supported naming a new law after his daughter. ""All I ask is that the law is the toughest it can be,"" he said. ""The death penalty is compulsory for a crime so grave the assailants must be hanged. The courts must give these men the death penalty."" Misogyny in India: We are all guilty . CNN iReporter Meera Vijayann, a consultant for a non-governmental organization from Bangalore, India, said sexual harassment is a daily problem for women -- but it was the horrific nature of the New Delhi attack and the brazenness of the alleged perpetrators that frightened so many people. Despite calls for harsher punishments for those who carry out such crimes, Vijayann feels only a change in attitudes and culture will truly bring about change. ""There is a sexist mindset, politicians have made silly remarks about women and how they should wear modest clothes, not go to parties ... if they make the laws how will it benefit us?"" she asked. ""People have to change the way they think."" India's Supreme Court will hear a petition Thursday asking it to suspend all lawmakers who face charges for crimes against women. The petition was filed in the aftermath of the brutal gang rape, which sent thousands of outraged protesters to the streets for days. ""This unfortunate episode has galvanized the nation,"" said Jagdeep S. Chhokar, an official with the Association for Democratic Reforms, which tracks political candidates' criminal records. Chhokar said six Indian state lawmakers are facing rape charges in unrelated cases, and two people in the federal parliament are also facing charges of crimes against women that fall short of rape. The group says that in the past five years, political parties across India have nominated 260 candidates facing charges of crimes against women such as assault and outraging the modesty of a woman. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong, Aliza Kassim from Atlanta, and Sarah Brown contributed to this report from London.","Police file charges against the accused men in a New Delhi court .

"(CNN) -- The funeral for a mentally ill North Carolina teenager killed by police will take place Saturday, said his family, who refrained from adding to the simmering debate about whether the shooting was justified and instead tried ""to celebrate his life."" Friends and family of Keith Vidal were invited to attend visitation services Friday at Brunswick Funeral Home, a short distance away from where the 18-year-old was killed. Vidal's funeral will start at 1 p.m. Saturday at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Southport, North Carolina, his family said Friday in a statement. ""We ask for and appreciate your support for the Vidal-Wilsey family, as they lay their child to rest,"" the family said. ""Your continued prayers and support are greatly needed and appreciated."" Their grieving began Sunday, following a 911 call asking for police to help in dealing with a schizophrenic armed with a screwdriver and asking to fight his mother. ""He's not doing very good,"" said the man on the 911 call. ""We've got to get him someplace."" In teen's shooting, who do you believe? Three law enforcement officers from three different agencies ended up at Vidal's Boiling Spring Lakes home. Family members said the first two were able to calm the situation, but things quickly devolved after the third -- Detective Bryon Vassey from neighboring Southport -- came on the scene. Soon thereafter, Vidal was killed. His outraged family has called his shooting unconscionable, holding the Southport detective directly responsible. Vassey, through his lawyer W. James Payne, claims he acted as he did fearing there was an imminent and deadly threat to another officer, who they say was in danger of being stabbed by Vidal with the screwdriver. CNN first learned of the shooting through an iReport sent by a family friend. Vidal's family, including his stepfather Mark Wilsey, spoke emotionally in the days after the shooting, blasting the Southport detective. But they have been relatively quiet since, even after Payne and the North Carolina Police Benevolent Association offered details that they say explain why the detective did what he did. And in its statement Friday, the family said it will maintain its silence -- declining ""to revisit the specific details"" and deciding ""to allow time for the investigative process to occur as it should."" In addition to the state Bureau of the Investigation, the district attorney's office for Brunswick County is probing the incident and could decide to press charges. ""We believe that justice for Keith will not be served by trying this case in the news,"" the family said. ""At this time, we have full faith in the judicial system and the ... district attorney's office to investigate and evaluate this case and reveal the true facts surrounding the tragic death."" The Vidal-Wilsey family added that, for now, they will try to focus on the ""wonderful memories"" they have. ""Keith was very much beloved by his family, friends and classmates,"" according to the statement. ""(The family), and the community at large, need time now to grieve in peace and remember the Keith they knew and loved.""","Visitation for Keith Vidal is Friday; his funeral will be on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Apple, as the reports go, is working on a ""smart watch,"" although the secretive company won't say anything about it, of course. So, after months of speculation, what does its chief rival in the mobile world do? Announce that it definitely is working on a smart watch. Lee Young Hee, executive vice president of Samsung's mobile business, said as much during an interview in South Korea, where the company is based. And he said it's not a knee-jerk reaction to Apple's rumored plans. ""We've been preparing the watch product for so long,"" Lee told Bloomberg. ""We are working very hard to get ready for it. We are preparing products for the future, and the watch is definitely one of them."" He did not give any details on when the watch may be released, what features it will have or how much it will cost. With its Galaxy S line of smartphones, Samsung has become the first competitor to provide a real challenge to the dominant iPhone. While Apple's iconic phone remains the single-most popular mobile device -- the release of the iPhone 5 led to a record sales quarter and was the most popular of the 75 million devices running Apple's iOS system that were sold in those three months -- Samsung moved into a solid second place with its Galaxy S III. The S III outsold the iPhone 4S during the third quarter of last year before the iPhone 5's release, and the company announced last week that the Galaxy S4 is on its way. Now the companies seem poised to go head-to-head again in what appears to be an emerging market -- wearable tech. Nike's fitness-oriented FuelBand has led the charge. But few new products have captured the imagination of the tech-minded such as Google Glass, an eyewear-like headset that offers augmented-reality images as well as basic smartphone-like features. The device is due later this year and has started popping up on the faces of field testers. Then there is Pebble, the smartwatch that raked in about $8 million on Kickstarter and has begun shipping to backers. But will there be a market for these devices outside of early-adopter technophiles and loyalists who will scoop up any new product their favorite company creates? Early signs say the public might need a little more information first. According to an unscientific survey of users by mobile deals site BuyVia, 26% of respondents said they were interested in buying a rumored iWatch, 38% said they were not interested and more than a third, 36%, said they weren't sure. (The survey was conducted before Samsung confirmed it's in the game as well.) The top five features respondents said they'd like to see in a watch were e-mail and texting, phone calls, GPS, Wi-Fi and weather updates. ""While consumers are seemingly divided about their desire to own the rumored Apple iWatch, it's fascinating that the most desired features for the watch mirror popular iPhone capabilities,"" said BuyVia CEO Norman Fong. ""It's as though consumers are only interested in a watch that offers everything the smartphone does, only in a more convenient 'package.' What they seem to crave is a way to more easily access iPhone features everywhere they go.""","Samsung says it plans to make a ""smart watch""

"(CNN) -- Matthew Mullins used to regularly show up late to yoga class on purpose. ""That way I could be in the very back of the class where no one would watch me,"" Mullins said. ""At 206 pounds, being only 5-10, I felt like I really looked stupid."" Last year, when the California photographer and part-time college student went in for his regular checkup, he got troubling news. The doctor told him he was in the beginning stage of hypertension and wanted to put Mullins on blood pressure medication. Mullins was only 32 years old. ""I didn't want to end up sick,"" he said. ""My mom died at the age of 42 after struggling with obesity and high blood pressure. I knew she wouldn't want me to go down this path."" As a gay man, Mullins said being overweight also made it hard to meet people. Studies show gay men struggle more with body image than straight men and are more likely to end up with eating disorders to meet an ideal standard that is hard for many to achieve. ""If you are overweight in our community, you become invisible, and I just hate that about us,"" Mullins said. ""Out at a bar or party guys would talk to me sometimes, but when I lost the weight the conversation took on a really different tone. ... It's not right to exclude people because they are overweight, but that's the reality."" His doctor did put him on a high blood pressure drug, but Mullins said he didn't like the way it made him feel. Instead, he decided to make a radical change to the way he lived. He started by downloading an app called Loseit!, an interactive calorie counter program. ""It's awesome -- you can scan any bar code you have on food in the house, and it helps you keep track of what you are eating,"" Mullins said. Tracking calories and fat became a game. He tried to see how much sugar he could eliminate from his diet. Advice from a professor to diversify the food he ate made him put more color on his plate. ""My family was very Irish, and we were more into potatoes and bread and meat,"" Mullins said. ""Now I try to avoid all that white."" He eliminated fast food. He cooked more at home. Desserts were gone; green vegetables were in. Breakfast was yogurt or rice pudding, because he found the carbohydrates helped with energy. Lunch was soup that was heavy on vegetables or a sandwich with lean meat. Dinner was a chicken breast and rice that he cooked himself. Keeping a strict diet helped him quickly see a difference. He lost about two pounds a week. When he was down 20 pounds, he decided it was time to start running. He started small and gradually built up his run over time, going from one mile to seven. ""It really was not fun at first,"" Mullins said. ""It was hilarious how hard it was running just a mile. I felt like it was 10. But gradually it got easier."" He also joined an exercise boot camp offered on campus. He kept up with yoga and then added regular exercise to his everyday activities. He couldn't afford to join a gym, but that was OK -- ""If I'm watching TV, I push the table aside and pull out my exercise ball or lift weights,"" Mullins said. He knows many people complain that they don't have time to exercise. He does get busy working and going to school, but he said that is no excuse. ""I can do 3Â½ miles in 25 minutes now running,"" Mullins said. ""Anyone could find 25 minutes in their day to exercise."" He also enlisted his friends to hold him accountable. Together they downloaded a Nike app that lets you monitor how much friends work out. That kind of friendly competition keeps him motivated, he said. Plus, friends will call him with words of encouragement if he ever slacks off. He and his friends got so into exercise they created a group called Hashtag Run. Together they have tackled local 5K's to raise money for a variety of charities, including autism. One day they hope to do a long AIDS fundraising bike ride that stretches over hundreds of miles. A photographer, Mullins also started taking photos of himself so he could watch his progress. ""Those photos certainly keep me honest and motivated,"" he said. Now at 165 pounds and still losing, Mullins walks around shirtless so much he says his friends teasingly ask when he'll put his shirt back on. And yes, he gets hit on when he goes out. ""I've got so much more confidence and energy, and the best part is I'm so much more comfortable with myself,"" Mullins said. ""I'm 33 years old and now I feel like I could live for at least 30 more. I didn't really feel like that before."" ""What I've learned from all of this is you've got to figure out what will make you go out and do it,"" Mullins said. ""Trust me, I didn't want to run when it was freezing in December. But having friends invested in your success and, maybe even more important, doing it for yourself ... it all really does help.""","Matthew Mullins had an ""aha"" moment when doctors put him on blood pressure medication .

"(CNN) -- When the draw for the third round of the FA Cup was made, one match particularly enticed -- Arsenal versus Tottenham. With Arsenal leading the Premier League and Tottenham rejuvenated under new manager Tim Sherwood, the encounter between the north London rivals indeed promised much. But in the end it was mostly one-way traffic and the Gunners prevailed 2-0 at home to advance in football's oldest knockout competition. The FA Cup is famous for its giant killings although on Saturday only one Premier League team lost to lower-division opposition, Aston Villa. And even then, Villa's 2-1 defeat to Sheffield United wasn't that big of a surprise since Villa boss Paul Lambert said this week the FA Cup was a distraction. Manchester City will still be favored to beat Blackburn in a replay following their 1-1 draw but the quadruple chasers are facing a stack of fixtures in January. Arsenal, which trails only Manchester United in FA Cup successes, took an early lead when in-form Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla sent a left-footed shot into the top corner in the 31st minute. Arsenal maintained the pressure in the second half and doubled the advantage when Tottenham fullback Danny Rose was dispossessed by Tomas Rosicky near the halfway line. Rosicky coolly beat Hugo Lloris in the 62nd minute to preserve manager Arsene Wenger's streak of never losing in the third round. ""We won such an important game -- it means a lot to us and the fans, obviously,"" Rosicky told ITV. The lone bad news for Arsenal was a leg injury to Theo Walcott, another player in form. Walcott left the pitch in controversial fashion, telling Tottenham fans -- with his hands -- what the score was. Wenger said he was told it was the England international's reaction to being hit with coins. ""What he did was not offensive,"" Wenger told reporters. ""I don't think the FA will take any action. I have seen the pictures and he is not being aggressive. He is smiling."" Tottenham was unable to build on its 2-1 win at Manchester United in the league on Wednesday and was eliminated from a Cup competition for the second time in about two weeks. With Sherwood at the helm, then as a caretaker, Spurs lost to West Ham at White Hart Lane in the League Cup quarterfinals. Villa ousted . Despite saying that most Premier League managers would prefer to avoid the FA Cup, Lambert fielded star striker Christian Benteke against third-tier struggler Sheffield United. But it was Ryan Flynn who got a late winner at Villa Park -- and now Lambert can focus fully on keeping his team in the top division. ""There was never any way I was decrying the competition at all,"" a defiant Lambert told Villa's website. ""You want to try and do a good run. If you look at the League Cup last time, we picked strong teams throughout the competition. I never take them lightly."" Manchester City, embarrassed by Wigan in last year's final, took a 1-0 lead at second-tier Blackburn though conceded the equalizer in the 55th minute. ""I think it's very important to still be in the cup -- we played against a strong home team,"" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told the club website. City, which finished with 10 men after the 85th-minute dismissal of Dedryck Boyata, could play seven more games in January, a test even for its deep squad. Wigan, now in the Championship, will replay against the MK Dons after a 3-3 draw. In the all Premier League ties, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer began his reign as Cardiff boss with a 2-1 upset win at Newcastle; Norwich and Fulham drew 1-1; and Crystal Palace won 2-0 at West Bromwich Albion. Macclesfield, the lowest-ranked team in the third round, earned a replay by drawing Sheffield Wednesday 1-1. Among Sunday's matches, Derby hosts Chelsea and Manchester United entertains Swansea.","Arsenal defeats Tottenham 2-0 to advance to the fourth round of the FA Cup .

Sandy should make landfall late Monday or Tuesday, striking somewhere between Virginia and New York. Tuesday into Wednesday . Sandy is forecast to move slowly. In spots, its center could linger for as long as 48 hours, unleashing heavy rain from the Great Lakes down to the Mid-Atlantic, through the Northeast.

To be fair, Christie faced a dilemma: Either admit to creating a climate of bullying, intimidation and political payback that led to the George Washington Bridge scandal, or claim that his staff and appointees disrupted traffic on the world's busiest bridge as political punishment without his knowledge. In the business we call it a choice between being a crook or a schnook. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Gov. Schnook. A schnook, for those who don't speak Yiddish, is a dupe. A fool. A patsy. A schnook is a victim, and Chris Christie is not convincing playing the victim. He wants us to believe that Gov. Straight-Talk, Mister No-B.S., credulously believed a pack of lies from his close aides. He wants us to believe that, as a former federal prosecutor, he thought his one-hour ""investigation"" of this operation, which yielded no confessions, was all that he could have done to unearth the truth. The governor clearly hopes that his press conference, his apology and his firing of one whole person will put this issue to rest. It won't. There's a great old saying that battle-scarred scandal managers love: ""The dogs bark but the carnival moves on."" It's the crisis manager's equivalent of ""Take two aspirin and call me in the morning,"" meant to reassure the scandal-plagued public figure that the media and the public have short attention spans, and that the next twerking episode will distract folks. But not with the Chris Christie bridge-closing scandal: This one's gonna stick. How do I know? Three reasons: . 1.  It feeds a pre-existing narrative. This is the most important factor in determining whether a miscue becomes a scandal and whether a scandal becomes a permanent taint. Any issue that advances a narrative that people already have is given greater credence and is more memorable. Every public figure has a master narrative. In fact they have two: one positive, one negative. In the case of Christie, his larger-than-life persona has been drawn both with bold strokes and in vivid color. The positive narrative is compelling -- and true: the straight-talking, forceful, blunt leader; the no-nonsense take-charge guy who blasted as ""stupid and selfish"" his own constituents who did not evacuate a beach community before a hurricane. Christie's negative narrative is just as powerful, and just as true: bully. He burst on the national scene in YouTube clips of town hall meetings where he berated critics. As The New York Times reported, as governor, Christie has a remarkable pattern of bullying: stripping former Gov. Richard Codey of his security detail after Codey called Christie ""combative and difficult;"" cutting funding to a Rutgers University program run by a professor who sided with Democrats on a redistricting panel, and more. If, as it appears, Christie's appointees and staff forced New Jerseyans to suffer through a four-hour traffic jam because their mayor -- a Democrat -- had the temerity to back the Democratic candidate opposing Christie's re-election, it doesn't just feed the image of a bully; it cements it. 2. There are ongoing legal and political processes. The Democratic majority leader of the State Senate, Loretta Weinberg, described herself as shocked by the scandal. More important -- and more ominous, for Christie -- she declared, ""I am waiting -- and hopefully with the support of Assemblyman (and Deputy Speaker John) Wisniewski -- that the subpoena power will continue."" Continuing subpoenas mean continuing revelations. ""Sooner rather than later,"" Weinberg said, ""we're going to hear the whole story of who knew what when."" There are almost certainly going to be lawsuits from aggrieved commuters, which will put folks under oath. And, most ominously, the U.S. attorney has said he is looking into the matter. If this becomes a federal case, the stakes rise immeasurably. 3. It happened at the media epicenter. It's not fair, but it's true: The news media is based largely on the East Coast and principally in New York. If the governor of South Dakota closed the Chief Standing Bear Bridge, which connects South Dakota to Nebraska, most of the national media would not know or care. But this is the George Washington Bridge. Journalists can cover this story, literally, on their commute. Christie's proximity to the media center has helped fuel his celebrity; now it may fuel his downfall. The truth is there is not much Christie can do about these three dynamics. He tried apologizing, but kept returning to the plea that he is truly the victim here: that he's just a poor schnook who was lied to. It seems to me that is small comfort to the thousands of people who endured four-hour traffic jams, or schoolchildren trapped on endless bus rides, or the family of the elderly woman who died after emergency services were slow in getting to her. He tried blaming others, as if acting in a Sopranoesque fashion is totally antithetical to his political style. Soon he will return to attacking the press and Democrats. None of it will work. If you believe Bullygate is going away anytime soon, there's a bridge in Fort Lee I'd like to sell you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala: Chris Christie faces difficult choice between being seen as a crook or a schnook .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of secret files from the Argentinean dictatorship have been uncovered, including ""blacklists"" that singled out more than 300 artists, actors and writers. Among those the military junta deemed ""dangerous"": novelist Julio Cortazar, singer Mercedes Sosa and actress Norma Aleandro. These three, for example, spent the dictatorship years abroad: Sosa and Aleandro in exile and Cortazar in France. These cultural figures were categorized as ""F1"" to ""F4,"" corresponding to their perceived risk to the state, Defense Minister Agustin Rossi said Monday when he unveiled the findings. Those labeled F1 were considered low-risk, and F4s were those seen as most dangerous to the dictatorship. The works of these artists were banned or censored during the dictatorship, from 1976 to 1983. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the so-called Dirty War. The documents -- 1,500 in total -- are all from the secret files of the military junta, Rossi said. The files were found in the basement of the building that houses the air force headquarters, Rossi said, according to the state-run Telam news agency. The files have ""historical and judicial"" value, Rossi told a radio station Tuesday. ""Thirty years since the return to democracy, there may still exist documentation that can be useful"" to reconstruct details from the dictatorship, he said. Hebe de Bonafini of the human rights group Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo gave credit to the military for finding the documents and making their existence known. ""There will be things that we know and things that we won't, but the important things is that there are 1,500 unexpected files that come at an unexpected moment,"" she told Telam.","1,500 files from the Argentine dictatorship were uncovered .

"(CNN) -- Authorities intercepted two speedboats -- sinking one -- and recovered thousands of pounds of cocaine worth more than $500 million. ""These two disruptions are an example of the international cooperative law enforcement effort to disrupt transnational criminal activity and deny their profiting from such activity,"" Doug Garner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's director of national air security operations in Jacksonville, Florida, said in a news release. The Memorial Day weekend drug bust, which was announced Wednesday, resulted from two separate interdiction efforts, the first unfolding Friday north of the Galapagos Islands, west of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean. A Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine crew spotted a 30-foot speedboat. After realizing that they'd been spotted, three people on the boat started chucking packages of cocaine into the water. They also ""began washing the boat to eliminate traces of cocaine,"" the release said. In small-town USA, business as usual for cartels . A law enforcement helicopter, responding to a call from the Customs and Border Protection crew, tracked down the boat and fired shots to disable it. Three suspects were arrested as the boat sunk into the ocean, according to the release. ""This joint effort denied criminal organizations more than $82 million dollars from cocaine proceeds,"" it said. The next evening, a Customs and Border Protection crew in the Western Caribbean saw a three-engine speedboat moving rapidly near the Panamanian-Colombian border. The boat's driver tried to evade police by moving closer to the Panamanian coastline and maneuvering ""in and out of shoals and other obstructions,"" according to the agency. Colombia arrests fake nuns with cocaine under their habits . The crew told Panamanian police to intercept the boat, which was carrying bundles of cocaine weighing more than 6,000 pounds.

"(CNN) -- The snow-covered mountains tower above the sub-tropical beach, a stunning vista by any standards -- but what sets Sochi apart from other seaside resorts is its sheer scale of concrete and steel. It's a grand project that Vladimir Putin hopes will transform an ailing region of Russia and make a bold statement of intent, using sport as the fulcrum -- much in the way that China did with its Olympics in 2008 and Qatar hopes to do with soccer's World Cup in 2020. At a reported $50 billion and rising, Russia's first Winter Olympics will be the most expensive in history -- topping the eye-watering $40 billion Beijing Summer Games. ""I've heard it's the world's largest construction site right now, and I can see that,"" says U.S. Olympic Committee official Patrick Sandusky. One of the six new stadiums will be used solely for the opening and closing ceremonies. ""This is quite a national project, not a regional one,"" says Sandusky, who was part of a U.S. delegation to Sochi last November. ""You can sense that this is very much on the happening agenda for President Putin and the federal government beyond just the organizing committee and the regional area of Sochi. This is a big project for Russia."" Spiraling costs . With a year to go before the 2014 Winter Games, much of the Black Sea city is still a mass of scaffolding. ""The noise of construction is everywhere,"" reports CNN's Phil Black from Sochi, which he describes as ""a rundown Soviet-era resort town crippled by terrible traffic."" Costs have spiraled since Russia was awarded the Games in 2007, and the stakes are high as the Kremlin makes an ambitious flexing of financial muscle that will also include hosting soccer's World Cup in 2018. On Thursday, Putin visited Sochi to see how construction was progressing and unhappy with ballooning costs and that the ski jump facility is two years behind schedule and is still unfinished, reportedly promptly sacked vice-president of Russia's Olympic Committee Akhmed Bilalov. ""Part of the investment that Russia has made is not only what the world will see in Russia, but also they're building a winter paradise that they hope to showcase through the Olympic broadcast and attract tourism in the future,"" says 2010 Vancouver champion Bill Demong, who competed at a Nordic combined skiing test event in Sochi last weekend. ""They have not only connected to Sochi to the mountains by rail, but also Sochi to the rest of Western Europe."" Vladimir Putin's spokesman admitted the enormity of the task ahead. ""It's a huge challenge, especially for President Putin because he uses this Olympics as a good opportunity for boosting the economy and developing this region of Sochi,"" Dmitry Peskov told CNN. It is opening up a resort city where temperatures reach 40C in summer, and will be as warm as 10-15C by the sea when the Olympics take place from February 7-23 next year -- with organizers already stockpiling snow due to sporadic falls, Black says. Much of the expense is due to the lack of existing infrastructure at the resort, which is an hour and a half's flight south-west of Moscow near the border with Georgia and the disputed territory of Abkhazia. Unlike the last Winter Games in Vancouver, which was integrated within the city, Sochi has had to start from scratch -- new roads, rail, hotels, as well as an improved power grid. ""I was impressed with the scale of the project and what they are doing there,"" says Sandusky. ""Uniquely it's a summer resort town in Russia traditionally, not a winter destination, although they have had skiing there a while. The juxtaposition of the Black Sea with the mountains behind is quite stunning in its beauty."" The Olympic events will be split between the mountain resort of Krasnaya Polyana and a purpose-built Olympic Park in the city, connected by a 45-minute high-speed train line. Criticisms . As with any major project, there have been problems. Human Rights Watch put out a report the day before the ""year to go"" milestone claiming that workers have been exploited by the construction companies. CNN contacted organizers for comment but has not received a response. Last year's high-profile alpine skiing test event -- the Winter Olympics' glamor sport -- was marred by criticisms of the course. ""They're pretty inexperienced there, they never held the World Cup so it was really rough and really hard,"" three-time Olympic silver medalist Ivica Kostelic told CNN's Alpine Edge show. ""We had huge jumps and after three days of training, I went for a slalom combined run and I'm skiing down and I feel like something popped in my knee like 'crack' and I didn't feel any pain so I just carried on skiing, but later I found out that my meniscus was broken."" Despite such concerns, most skiers have come out in favor of the venue, designed by former skiing great Bernhard Russi. ""The hill itself is amazing but the way they set the course last year was not ideal,"" says U.S. Olympic hopeful Travis Ganong. ""I think they learned a lot from that World Cup and I think they'll open up the course a little bit and make it more like a downhill. It was very turny and a lot of guys didn't like that. ""They didn't ask for feedback but they heard a lot of it from racers and the coaches, and I think they're listening, so hopefully we'll have a more open, faster downhill set for the Olympics."" Ganong says North American skiers might find Sochi more familiar than their European counterparts. ""In the Alps they don't get the same kind of snow. Sochi has the mountains like you get in the Alps but the snow that you get in the U.S. and Canada -- it's pretty amazing,"" he says. ""The downhill course is very challenging and it demands the best skier in the world to perform on that day to win. I don't think you'll see some unknown people doing well, at least in the downhill. It'll take solid skiing from a very good skier to win."" Sports mad president . Winning medals is also among the top goals for Russia's sports-mad president, who attended a figure skating test event in Sochi in December. ""It was exciting,"" says American skater Charlie White, who won the Sochi Grand Prix Final with his dance partner Meryl Davis. ""We had heard reports all week that he was there, not there, so in our five-minute warm-up we heard loud applause and we were able to glance up at the videotron at the top and saw that the video was on him. ""It's a big deal to be able to perform for such an important figure. It's great that he cares to come and watch. I can't imagine how nervous I'd be in front of President Obama."" White and Davis won silver at Vancouver, and the 2011 world champions are coached by Russian Marina Zueva. ""A lot of successful coaches here in the States have come out of Russia and what they have been able to create in the past six or seven years has been really impressive,"" added White. ""For us it's exciting because at the Olympics there's going to be even more buzz. They have had teams who have been able to set a new standard for ice dance, they've had multiple teams like that."" Collaboration . While Russia has a rich pedigree in skating, it is still catching up when it comes to alpine skiing. So much so the Russians have are working with the U.S. -- despite the countries' long years of Cold War opposition. ""We actually have a partnership with the Russian team where we train with them a little bit and share training space and hill space,"" says Ganong. ""Their team is definitely building and gaining momentum. I'm not sure where they'll stack up for the Olympics but they're definitely getting stronger."" The Sochi complex is geared towards spectators, according to Demong, whose Nordic combined event will start and finish at the same stadium -- which will be adapted between the staging of the jumping and cross-country skiing disciplines. ""The cross-country course is fairly short, 2.5 km, and will loop through the jump stadium twice -- about half the course is visible from the stands,"" says Demong, adding that a lack of snow was promptly dealt with by event organizers, who had it trucked in. ""It's a very modern setup, it's a very competition-oriented venue. It's going to be great for an Olympic venue and for international event-hosting for years to come."" While Americans flocked across the border to Canada four years ago, numbers traveling to Russia will no doubt be lower -- but the intrigue is building, Demong says. ""I think this will be a new defining moment for, say, the American public who don't travel here often or never have -- it will be a window into Russia that will define Americans' perspectives for years to come,"" he says. ""I think that perspective has been acknowledged by the organizing committee, and they're taking it very seriously, not only in the choice of venues but also in what they're tackling right now -- it's probably one of the most massive construction projects in history.""","Russia will host the Winter Olympics for the first time next February .

"(CNN) -- Police are still searching for a Norman Rockwell painting that disappeared from a Queens storage warehouse in September. The oil on canvas painting, ""Sport,"" shows a man in a rowboat wearing a yellow raincoat, holding a fishing pole. The image was published on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1939. The painting disappeared from a WelPak Art Moving and Storage unit at 58-60 Grand Avenue in Maspeth. Police said the painting was being stored awaiting shipment to its owner. Neither NYPD nor Sotheby's would identify the owner of the painting. The painting sold for $1,085,000 at a Sotheby's auction of American Art in New York on May 22. It was sold from a private collection in Birmingham, Alabama, and before that was owned by the Hildebrandt family of Westchester County. Signed by Rockwell on the lower right, the painting is approximately 22 by 28 inches and framed in gold wood.

"(CNN) -- Florida authorities on Saturday evening arrested two convicted murderers who had been on the lam after being released from prison with forged documents, a state agency said. Charles Walker and Joseph Jenkins were taken into custody ""without incident"" at 6:40 p.m. at Panama City's Coconut Grove Motor Inn, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said. Members of that agency and the U.S. Marshals Service found and detained the two men, the agency said. Walker and Jenkins are expected to appear in court Sunday morning at the Bay County Courthouse in Panama City. The state Department of Corrections -- which mistakenly released the men though it has insisted through no fault of its own -- said little about the arrests. ""We are, of course, happy they have been taken into custody,"" agency spokeswoman Jessica Carey said. Authorities have been searching for Walker and Jenkins, both 34, after investigators discovered forged motions to reduce their respective sentences and forged court orders granting the requests. Earlier Saturday, family members of both men appealed for them to turn themselves in to authorities. ""We just want you to surrender yourself to someone you trust who will bring you back in safely,"" Walker's mother, Lillie Danzy, said at a news conference outside the Orange County Sheriff's Department in Orlando. Jenkins' uncle, Henry Pearson, also urged the men to give their families some peace. Both families denied any knowledge in the escape plan, telling investigators and reporters they first learned of the releases in telephone calls from the Franklin Correctional Institution with news they could pick up their family member. Danzy appears to have questioned the call, telephoning the prison twice to make sure it was legitimate. ""The family believed their prayers had been answered,"" a spokeswoman for Danzy said. The two men, according to family members, disappeared shortly after their return. In September 1998, Jenkins killed Roscoe Pugh Jr. during a home-invasion robbery attempt. Six months later, Cedric Slater was gunned down on an Orlando street corner -- shot dead, a jury determined, by Walker. Both killers were convicted and sentenced to life behind bars without the possibility of parole within two years of their crime. While it's not known whether they knew each other, they were at the same prison in North Carrabelle in Florida's Panhandle. Jenkins left there on September 27, and Walker left on October 8, according to authorities. They had motions indicating the sentences had been reduced as well as court orders granting the request. Investigators later discovered these documents were forged. The legal-looking documents contained bogus reproductions of several key players' signatures, including those of the Orlando-area State Attorney Jeffrey Ashton or the assistant state attorney and Judge Belvin Perry. They bore the seal of the Orange County clerk of court's office. Perry told CNN his signature is easy to find online on documents related to the high-profile trial of Casey Anthony. Anthony was acquitted in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. ""People, particularly people with criminal minds, come up with ingenious ways to beat the system,"" Perry said. ""They have nothing but time on their hands to think of things."" Prosecutors first learned about what happened after a member of Walker's family contacted them, Ashton said. An October 8 letter from the Department of Corrections to Slater's mother, Evangelina Kearse, notified her a ""court order and amended sentence caused (Walker's) sentence to expire."" ""Please be aware that recent actions causing the release of this offender are beyond our control. Nevertheless, we apologize for the delay in this message,"" it said. Both Walker and Jenkins appeared to play by the rules after their release. They both went to the Orange County jail to register as felons -- Jenkins on September 30, Walker on October 11 -- as required by law. While their releases may have initially seemed legitimate, the two convicts later were classified as escapees. CNN's Nick Valencia, John Zarrella, Kim Segal and David Simpson contributed to this report.","NEW: Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker are set to appear in court Sunday .

"(CNN) -- It happens every so often: A military sexual assault scandal hits the headlines. Most recently, an Air Force general decided to pardon an officer convicted of rape. Then came revelations that not one but two of the service members that the military assigned to prevent sex abuse are under investigation for perpetrating it. And in light of a new Pentagon report estimating the number of military sexual assaults at 26,000 a year -- about half of them against men -- this time around, even many in the military community agree there is a problem that won't go away and can't be ignored. Congress is reacting, as it often does to headlines, by proposing reforms. But the current crop of ideas misses the mark. Sergeant trained to protect victims faces sexual assault allegations . The bills primarily propose changes to a commander's authority to start or control cases in the military criminal justice system. But courts martial, with their due process and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, will always be too rare to make a difference. What changed the face of civilian employment was a civil legal approach -- sexual harassment law -- that made it cost money when employees are assaulted. This approach shouldn't be sidelined in addressing the military sexual assault problem. The civil legal system reaches people who probably won't see a criminal prosecution. It reaches people such as Joseph Oncale, who was sexually assaulted by several co-workers on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. It reaches people such as Mechelle Vinson, who was 19 when she started work at a bank and the manager demanded that she sleep with him. The civil legal solution gives voice to workers who are not that different from the military members who face a command gone wrong: People working long hours, with few options, sometimes living at work, sometimes immigrants with nowhere else to go. The civil system balances workers' needs against legitimate business concerns -- to give managers authority -- by making the employer pay if managers abuse that authority. The employer has an economic incentive to make sure that doesn't happen. After officer charged in sex assault, military faces questions . This law changed what people thought was right. A friend told me that in the 1960s, a teacher told her she needed to sleep with him to pass. She said: ""We just called that life."" Now, in the civilian world, it's called sexual harassment, and it's illegal. The military hasn't had the benefit of that change. Civilian judges (not Congress, and not the military) made up special military immunities, loosely called the Feres doctrine, to block it. It's time to overrule them. The civil legal approach can nip problems in the bud. It can stop a predator who is testing the waters or change a command environment that has lost sight of the need to treat all of its personnel professionally. If service members had the same rights as other employees to bring civil lawsuits, victims would have direct power to challenge abuses of authority. They would not have to wait for government officials to take up their case, and they might not have to wait until something as horrific as a criminal rape happened to them. Military rape victims: Stop blaming us . But doesn't sexual harassment mean policing petty slights and awkward jokes? That's a myth. Even in the civilian workplace, to win you have to show behavior that is severe or pervasive to the objective observer -- something so serious or so frequent that it significantly alters working conditions. The military is not the civilian workplace, and its unique needs have to be considered carefully in any reform, whether criminal or civil. Civil actions are, after all, potentially less disruptive than outside prosecutors and anonymous tips. What happens next should come from a partnership between the uniformed services and civilian experts. But it should look more broadly at solutions that go beyond the latest scandal. Of course, some people think it would be unfair to make the military change. Boys will be boys, the thinking goes. When I joined the military, many of my contemporaries cringed, fearing the worst, but they were wrong: The men I served with met the highest standards of professionalism. To expect anything less is to undersell our men, and women, in uniform. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maia Goodell.","Recently, two military sexual assault scandals hit the headlines .

"(CNN) -- Walking into a Pyongyang hospital room to greet her imprisoned son, Myunghee Bae was overcome with emotion. Talking exclusively to CNN, Bae said it was a ""very happy moment. At the same time, I could not believe he was a prisoner in North Korea; a new realization."" Bae was granted a five-day visa to North Korea and three short visits with her son, Kenneth; a total of six hours, in which she says there was not one moment's silence. ""He said he's being treated very fairly,"" she said. ""He was taken to a special labor camp, so he was the only prisoner, and a whole lot of people have to stay with him, guards and doctors."" Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me . Kenneth Bae, an American citizen, was arrested in November of last year and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor. The North Korean regime says he was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. His mother says he has a profound love for the country and its people, and any offense he caused was not intentional. ""Always, he wanted to help the people over there, help the country,"" she said. ""He always thought that way, but apparently he misunderstood their system, so a lot of things he realized -- he did some harm to their country."" Bae added that her son's Christian faith was so strong, he wanted to convey his feelings. North Korea is officially an atheist state and has punished missionaries in the past. Although Bae was unable to meet with North Korean officials to plead her son's case, she wants to make her message to them clear: ""Please give him mercy and give him amnesty to send him home. We apologize as a family on his behalf, but his health cannot sustain any longer if he is sent back to the labor camp again."" Kenneth Bae, American imprisoned in North Korea, moved to hospital . Bae was forced to work in the camp for three months until his health deteriorated. His mother says his illnesses include diabetes, an enlarged heart, gallstones, back and neck pains, and high cholesterol. Bae says he looked better when she met him than he appeared in the footage of his hospitalization in August. But that brings its own concerns. ""My worst fear is to send him back to the labor camp because his health seems a little bit improved, that's my worst fear. Because I don't think his body can endure eight hours labor a day, six days a week."" Previous Americans detained in North Korea have been released when high-profile visitors have traveled to the country to plead their case. Most notably, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter went on two separate occasions in 2010. Bae believes her son's case has not encouraged such attention, as relations between Washington and Pyongyang hit a new low this year. Myunghee Bae says it has been an agonizing 11 months, not only for her, but also for Kenneth Bae's wife and three children. ""They all had a very hard time, and I think we all as a family felt helpless. We could not do anything for him, only sending letters ... we don't have any power to bring him home."" The most heart-breaking part of the trip for Bae was leaving Pyongyang and walking out of the hospital without her son. ""It was very hard; I cannot express my pain and my heartache to leave him behind as a prisoner in North Korea. How long will it take to see him again?""","Myunghee Bae says seeing son at a Pyongyang hospital was a ""very happy moment""

"London (CNN) -- Villages cut off by floodwater, rail links severed and huge waves pounding coastlines. Powerful gales and torrential downpours battered southern Britain over the weekend in a fresh surge of extreme weather that has caused chaos across the country. And there is no letup yet. Britons face more misery, as forecasters are warning there will be little respite from hurricane-force winds and lashing rain that have seen hundreds of people forced from their homes. Britain has been hit by bad weather since early December, and swaths of southwestern England have been flooded in continuously stormy weather. ""We have another Atlantic storm bringing gales and heavy downpours to many parts of the UK this weekend,"" Paul Gundersen, Met Office chief meteorologist, said in a written statement. ""Monday is expected to bring a brief respite from the stormy conditions before more strong winds and rain set in from the west on Tuesday. This will bring the continuing risk of flooding and damaging winds bringing down trees to cause disruption to travel and power networks."" Wettest January in 248 years . England suffered the wettest January since 1766, and there are hundreds of flood alerts in force for low-lying areas in southern and central England and Wales. Gusts of up to 80 miles per hour, heavy rain and massive waves make up the latest extreme weather coming from the Atlantic Ocean and driven, meteorologists say, by a long and powerful polar vortex. Hundreds of people have already been forced out of their homes. And with the ground heavily saturated, any more rain will increase the flood risk across the country. In Chertsey, Surrey, where the River Thames burst its banks, a 7-year-old boy died and 17 people were hospitalized after falling ill, police said Saturday. Police said the cause of illness was unknown but ""cannot rule out that there may be a link to flooding in the local area."" Efforts were under way to build flood defenses in the area, where nearby homes were damaged and riverside benches and trees were submerged in the water. Soldiers and sandbags . Prime Minister David Cameron is promising government help for regions that have literally been under water for weeks now. He visited flood-hit Somerset on Friday and will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee, known as Cobra, on Sunday to discuss the crisis. ""All Govt depts doing all they can to help those affected,"" Cameron tweeted last week following a similar meeting. Storm waves have been beating rocks and spraying mist onto coastlines in seaside towns, where many shops have been closed. Military personnel have been sent out to some areas to deploy sandbags and improve flood defenses. On top of flooding, the weather has caused some areas to be cut off from power as well as rail links. In one area, Dawlish, high tides and stormy seas destroyed a sea wall, causing a significant stretch of railway to collapse into the sea. Nearby homes and a road were also damaged.","NEW: PM Cameron to hold emergency meeting on flood crisis Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The search is over for a California family who disappeared under mystifying circumstances three years ago. Authorities confirmed the identity of two of four sets of remains found Monday in the California desert near Victorville as those of Joseph McStay and his wife Summer, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said Friday. They were identified through dental records, he said. Two other remains found nearby are believed to be those of their sons Joseph and Gianni, McMahon said. He said positive identification will be done through DNA testing. The four were killed, McMahon said. No suspects have been identified and the sheriff did not elaborate on how they died. Some family members became emotional during Friday afternoon's news conference. ""It gives us courage to know they are together, and they're in a better place,"" said Joseph's younger brother Mike McStay, choking back tears. ""It's been a tough road."" A motorcyclist reported finding possible skeletal remains Monday in an area not far from Interstate 15 near Victorville, according to the Sheriff's Department. Police found two shallow grave sites, with two sets of remains in each grave, McMahon said. February 4, 2010 was the last day anyone saw the family or heard from them. When police entered their Southern California house more than 10 days later, they found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room. Their two dogs were also in the home. But not a single trace of the McStays. The McStays lived in Fallbrook, about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and some 50 miles north of San Diego. The family's locked and abandoned Isuzu Trooper was located February 8, 2010, in San Ysidro, California, just two blocks from the border. Surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the McStays walking into Mexico. But from there the trail goes cold. The sheriff said his office said it will look at this crime from the beginning, and will work with the FBI to find the suspects. Although investigators said someone had been researching travel to Mexico on the family's home computer, the McStays' sudden disappearance and the fact that their credit cards and bank accounts went unused raised suspicions. When they disappeared three years ago, Joseph was 40, his wife, Summer, was 43, and their children were 4 and 3 years old. ""I've been in this business for over 35 years, but I've never seen anything like this,"" Lt. Dennis Brugos of the San Diego Sheriff's Department told CNN shortly after the disappearance.

"(CNN) -- After years of defiantly denying that it was aware of any links between football and brain injuries, the NFL reached a surprising settlement with 4,500 former players who sued the organization over concussion-related issues to the tune of $765 million. If this settlement is approved as is, the NFL will have ""no admissions of liability or weakness claims."" I recall that former Chicago Bears defensive back (and my former colleague at Voice America Sports) David Duerson's last text message to his family, asking to have his brain examined right before killing himself with a shotgun to the chest. I also remember Philadelphia Eagles safety Andre Waters asking me, ""How do I feel?"" in a conversation we had, when I mentioned I based my playing style on his. Years later, Waters committed suicide with a gunshot to the head. They didn't get any help. The good news is that this settlement will put most of the $675 million in the hands of my NFL brethren and their families who need it the most. This would include $4 million for those diagnosed after their deaths with a brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, $5 million for men diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and $3 million for players diagnosed with dementia. The NFL will also pay up to $75 million to fund baseline medical exams for the players and will spend $10 million on new research into concussion care. Half of the $765 million will be paid in the first three years. The second half will be paid out over 17 years. This is in part what players wanted -- to financially provide for the worst-off diagnosed players named in the lawsuit as well as providing for all current retired players, regardless of whether they joined the lawsuit or not. I always believed that the lawsuit would eventually end in a settlement. But in light of last year's revenue for the NFL -- $9.5 billion -- I'm concerned about the other terms of the settlement. The core of the concussion lawsuit contends that the ""the NFL was aware of the evidence and risks associated with traumatic brain injuries for many decades, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from players."" I believe the NFL more than likely would not have settled with the admission of any liability. By not going to trial, the league does not have to face the discovery and deposition process and therefore leaves many questions unanswered. If this had gone to trial, the NFL would have opened itself up to an extended run of bad PR, potentially billions of dollars in damages, and would have been forced to hand over sensitive internal archives. The NFL could have been required to produce documents, such as e-mails. E-mails are currently at the center of another lawsuit in which a group of former college players led by Adrian Arrington is seeking class action status, challenging the NCAA's handling of head injuries. The NCAA has until September 13 to respond to the motion to certify the case. However, this lawsuit may also be headed toward a settlement. Just ten days before the NFL settlement was announced, the NCAA agreed to mediation. All this leaves the important questions unanswered: How dangerous is football? How serious are the head injuries? Since the initial filing of the concussion lawsuits, the NFL has funded over $100 million on numerous outreach and safety programs. Yet it's ironic that the final settlement only sets $10 million aside for ""concussion research."" We will never learn what exactly the NFL had learned about football-related brain injuries and when they knew it. This information could be extremely valuable in future decisions and research on how to treat or prevent concussions. Moreover, this is information parents of our future football players can use to make informed health decisions. In 1994, then-NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue initiated the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) committee, which was led by Dr. Elliot Pellman. He was also the team doctor for the New York Jets at the time. Pellman once cleared wide receiver Wayne Chrebet to play after he was knocked unconscious. In 2003, Pellman was the lead author for nine of 16 studies that minimized the significance of concussions. In 2009, the NFL disbanded the MTBI committee after a series of congressional hearings. While Pellman and the NFL may never have to turn over what they knew, the proposed settlement is still pending with an opt-out option for the players, some of whom will appeal and object to the settlement. If this happens, the judge will have to seriously consider that four former players have recently sued the NFL and its helmet maker, Riddell. Riddell, which is a defendant in the NFL concussion lawsuit, is not part of the proposed settlement, so that part of the litigation continues. It is unclear how the NFL settlement will affect future lawsuits due to the current collective bargaining agreement (CBA). In 2011, the NFL added safety rules (like no helmet-to-helmet contact) to the CBA, which make it extremely difficult for players to file lawsuits in the future for injuries they haven't sustained yet because players are now made aware of the risks. Before approving this settlement, the judge will need to take a serious look at the objections made by many players to the agreement, particularly because they will never know what the NFL knew about concussions. I've already heard from many players who plan to opt out of the current settlement. On October 8, the PBS ""Frontline"" documentary, ""League of Denial: The NFL's Concussion Crisis,"" will air and hopefully shed some light on what the NFL still hasn't revealed. Hopefully, we will figure out if the settlement is enough. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LaMar C. Campbell.","The NFL and former players reached a $765 million settlement over concussion issues .

"(CNN) -- In death as during his life, former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon elicits emotional reactions, both laudatory and critical. His death on Saturday at age 85, after eight years in a coma, resurfaced old wounds, but also praise for his strength in leadership. In those last years of his life, Sharon was in a state of minimal consciousness with minimal non-verbal communication, a hospital spokesman said. Sharon, giant of modern Israel, dead at 85 . The former leader had many ups and downs during his hospitalization, and on Saturday, ""he departed peacefully with his loving family at his side,"" the spokesman said. His coffin will be moved Sunday to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, where citizens can come to pay their respects through 6 p.m., the office of current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced. A state memorial ceremony -- to be attended by, among others, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and former British leader Tony Blair -- will be held at the Knesset starting at 9:30 a.m. Monday. This will be followed by a funeral procession that includes a stop in Latrun for a special meeting of Israel Defense Forces staff and ends with a military funeral at Sharon's ranch, Shikmim. In remarks on Saturday, Netanyahu remembered his predecessor as a warrior and a political leader. ""The State of Israel bows its head on the passing of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,"" Netanyahu said in a statement. ""Ariel Sharon played a central role in the struggle for the security of the State of Israel over all its years."" The same decisions that made him a controversial figure during his lengthy tenure as a military man and politician were back on display in the initial reactions to his death. These moments include his role as defense minister during the 1982 war in Lebanon. During that conflict, he was held indirectly responsible by an Israeli inquiry in 1983 for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. He was forced to resign. He also raised ire in the Arab world by encouraging Israelis to build settlements on occupied Palestinian land, but later did an about-face and pushed for the historic withdrawal from settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, which were turned over to Palestinian rule for the first time in nearly four decades. READ MORE: Sharon's life on the front lines . President Shimon Peres made an address eulogizing his ""dear friend Arik Sharon,"" calling him by his well-known nickname. ""He was an outstanding man and an exceptional commander who moved his people and loved them. And the people loved him,"" Peres said. But Hamas, the Palestinian movement that runs Gaza, paints Sharon with a darker legacy. ""We deal with the death of Sharon as an end for the crimes he committed against the Palestinian people,"" said Israr Almodallal, spokesman for Hamas in Gaza. ""The biggest crime was the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, and we deal with Sharon as a criminal person. ""We will not forgive Sharon any way or another,"" he said. At the Baddawi refugee camp in northern Lebanon, Sharon's death was marked with long bursts of shooting into the air, the Lebanese state-run NNA news agency said. READ MORE: Five things to know about Sharon . President Barack Obama offered condolences to Sharon and the Israeli people, but his statement did not single out any milestones in the late prime minister's life for praise besides noting that Sharon dedicated his life to Israel. ""We continue to strive for lasting peace and security for the people of Israel, including through our commitment to the goal of two states living side-by-side in peace and security,"" Obama said. Secretary of State John Kerry offered a nuanced statement: ""During his years in politics, it is no secret that there were times the United States had differences with him. But whether you agreed or disagreed with his positions -- and Arik was always crystal clear about where he stood -- you admired the man who was determined to ensure the security and survival of the Jewish State."" To make Israel stronger, Sharon recognized that peace is necessary, Kerry said. Vice President Joe Biden will lead the U.S. delegation to Sharon's memorial service, though details of the funeral have not been announced. Israel's current defense minister, Moshe Ya'alon, in turn, praised Sharon's military career. ""Ariel Sharon was first and foremost an extraordinary military commander that turned the (Israel Defense Forces) into an army that confronts the enemy and quickly prevails,"" Ya'alon said in a statement. ""He displayed his military leadership in the battlefield, both in battles against regular armies and in the fight against terrorism."" Sharon was involved in every Israeli war going back to 1948, and he was remembered as a fierce fighter. He believed strongly that in order for Israel to survive, a strong army was needed. He had a reputation as a hawk, but he moved in a more moderate direction as prime minister. The office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, released a statement focusing on Sharon's shift toward negotiations with the Palestinians. Sharon ""will be remembered for his political courage and determination to carry through with the painful and historic decision to withdraw Israeli settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip. His successor faces the difficult challenge of realizing the aspirations of peace between the Israeli and Palestinian people,"" the statement said. French President Francois Hollande offered his condolences, also emphasizing his actions at the end of his career. ""After a long military and political career, he made the choice to turn towards dialogue with the Palestinians,"" Hollande said in a statement. The reaction from Russian President Vladimir Putin was less specific and, overall, laudatory for Sharon's contributions to Israel and toward fostering Israeli-Russian relations. ""The President of Russia highly praised Ariel Sharon's personal qualities, his activity to uphold the interests of Israel, noting the respect he enjoyed among his compatriots and internationally,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. Critics continued to evoke the 1982 war in Lebanon. ""It's a shame that Sharon has gone to his grave without facing justice for his role in Sabra and Shatilla and other abuses,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""His passing is another grim reminder that years of virtual impunity for rights abuses have done nothing to bring Israeli-Palestinian peace any closer."" Khaled Abu Al Noor, head of the Democratic Front, a Palestinian faction, described Sharon as ""a murderer."" ""He is responsible for the massacre of many Palestinian children, women and elderly. We call on the international community to try him under international law even after his death."" Sharon's son, Gilad, thanked the people who cared for his father in the hospital and those who prayed for him. ""He was the one who decided when he would go,"" Gilad said.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Wal-Mart is investigating its operations in Mexico to determine whether there were violations of the U.S. law that prohibits giving bribes to international officials, the company said in a statement. The retail giant's announcement comes after a New York Times report detailing what the newspaper said was widespread bribery used by Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary to speed up store construction. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. executives in Bentonville, Arkansas, recommended shutting down an internal review of the alleged bribery even after the lead investigator recommended expanding the investigation, according to the newspaper, which cites former Wal-Mart employees, participants in the company's investigation and copies of internal review documents. A paper trail found suspect payments in Mexico totaled more than $24 million, the newspaper said, citing an internal Wal-Mart review. CNN has not independently confirmed the details in the New York Times report. ""Many of the alleged activities in The New York Times article are more than six years old,"" Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said in a statement Saturday. ""If these allegations are true, it is not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for. We are deeply concerned by these allegations and are working aggressively to determine what happened."" In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late last year, Wal-Mart disclosed a probe into whether its workers violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits giving bribes to international officials. The retailer said the possible bribes pertained to such matters as obtaining permits and licenses, as well as to inspections. At the time, Tovar said the investigation was ""focused on discrete incidents in specific cases."" ""We take compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) very seriously and are committed to having a strong and effective global anti-corruption program in every country in which we operate,"" Tovar said Saturday. ""We will not tolerate noncompliance with FCPA anywhere or at any level of the company."" Tovar said the company began an extensive review related to compliance with the law last year, and has met with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to disclose the investigation. Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission could not be immediately reached for comment. The New York Times report cites a former executive, Sergio Cicero Zapata, who resigned from Wal-Mart de Mexico in 2004. Cicero told the newspaper he had helped organize payoffs to local officials -- including dispatching intermediaries to deliver envelopes full of cash. The aim of the bribes, he said, was to guarantee zoning approvals, reductions in environmental impact fees and support from neighborhood leaders, according to the newspaper. After resigning, Cicero alerted a senior Wal-Mart lawyer about the deals in 2005, prompting an internal investigation, the New York Times said. Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica, the company's subsidiary in Mexico, said in a statement that it is ""fully committed to complying with the laws of the countries where it operates, including any state or municipal regulations pertaining to the application for licenses and permits."" ""The allegations in the recent New York Times article, if true, do not accurately reflect Wal-Mart de Mexico y Centroamerica's culture,"" the statement continued. Mexico was the first country in Wal-Mart's international division. Wal-Mart has 2,099 retail units in the country, including 213 supercenters, according to a company fact sheet. CNNMoney's Julia Talanova contributed to this report.","The retail giant says bribery allegations are ""not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for""
