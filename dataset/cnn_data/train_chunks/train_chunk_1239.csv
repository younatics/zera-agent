"It might look like an alien from outer space, but this bizarre creature is a four-eyed fish that lives deep beneath the ocean on our planet. The fish's extra pair of eyes give it 360° vision, even though the animal lives deep below the ocean's surface in almost pitch-black waters. The scientist who made the discovery believes the glasshead barreleye fish has evolved with extra eyes so it can detect prey, predators and potential mates. The glasshead barreleye fish (rhynchohyalus natalensis) has four eyes with 360° vision. It is thought that the peculiar creature has evolved with extra eyes (one is circled) so that it can detect prey, predators and mates from every angle . Rhynchohyalus natalensis was first discovered in 1924. It lives at depths of between 800 and 1,000metres. The species has been spotted in the eastern Atlantic Ocean near Cape Town, South Africa, the western Atlantic in tropical waters and the western Pacific between Australia and New Zealand. The barreleyes are an unusual family of deep sea fish, most of which have upwardly-directed eyes. The 'main' eyes detect the silhouettes of prey swimming above, while 'extra' side eyes give it a view of what's going on below it and by its sides. Also known as Rhynchohyalus natalensis, it lives at depths of between 2,600ft (800 metres) and 3,300ft (1,000 metres). It has two primary cylindrical eyes pointing upwards so it can see prey or predators silhouetted against the gloomy light above. It also has a second set of silvery eyes on the side of its head which have a mirror-like second lens and retina. These contribute to the fish's strange appearance. The German scientists who explored how the fish is likely to see claim it has a previously unknown type of eye. The fish has two primary cylindrical eyes pointing upwards so it can see prey or predators silhouetted against the gloomy light above. It also has a second set of oval-shaped silvery eyes on the side of its head (pictured) which have a mirror-like second lens and retina . The glasshead barreleye fish has two primary cylindrical eyes pointing upwards so it can see prey or predators. It also has a second set of silvery eyes on the side of its head with a mirror-like second lens. The silvery 'extra' eyes detect bioluminescent flashes created by deep-sea creatures to give the glasshead barreleye fish views to its sides and below. The light coming from below is focused onto a second 'retina' by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals, giving the fish a much bigger field of vision. Reflector eyes are usually only found in invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. Its silvery 'extra' eyes detect . bioluminescent flashes created by deep-sea creatures to give the . glasshead barreleye fish views to its sides and below, according to a . study in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society. The . light coming from below is focused onto a second 'retina' by a curved . mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of . guanine crystals, giving the fish a much bigger field of vision. It was caught in the Tasman Sea during an international research project and measures 18cm in length. The results of the study into the fish's vision were unexpected as reflector eyes are usually only found in invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. However, one other vertebrate, the deep-sea brownsnout spookfish or (Dolichopteryx longipes) also uses a combination of reflective and refractive lenses in its eyes. Professor Hans-Joachim Wagner, of the University of Tubingen's Institute of Anatomy in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany, made the discovery. He said: ‘Obviously, a broad field of vision is an advantage even at great depths.’ The fish studied was caught in the Tasman Sea (illustrated) during an international research project and measures 18cm in length . The deep ocean fish's silvery eyes (marked with arrows) detect bioluminescent flashes of light created by deep-sea creatures to give the glasshead barreleye fish views to its sides and below . Most fish have eyes on the sides of their heads because their eyes are bifocal so that light entering from some directions has a short journey to the retina than light from other directions. The whole eye tends to protrude from the fish's head, which combined with the animal's movement, means fish have good all-round vision. A deep sea fish called Opisthoproctus soleatus has telescopic eyes that are placed on its head so that it looks straight up towards the sky. Mud skippers have eyes on 'turrets' so they can see all around and when they are on mud they can withdraw their eyes into turrets to clean and lubricate them. Another four-eyed fish called Anableps tetrophthalmus has eyes on top of its body. Each eye is divided into two parts. The upper part is designed for seeing in air, while the lower part has evolved for underwater vision, allowing the animal to swim effectively at the water's surface. Flatfish such as soles, turbots and plaice (pictured, above) have both eyes on the same side of their heads so they can 'lie' on one side but face upwards - an adaptation to living on the seabed. Mud skippers (pictured) have eyes on 'turrets' so they can see all around. When they are on mud they can withdraw their eyes into the turrets to clean and lubricate them .","The glasshead barreleye fish (Rhynchohyalus natalensis) lives at depths of between 800metres to 1,000metres in the Tasman Sea, near New Zealand .

Number 5: Later this year the Supreme Court will finally rule on `tomato' vs. `tomahto' A crackdown on unhealthy food is not limited to the White House agenda, however, as New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced last week that he planed to implement a band on sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces (about half a litre) in most restaurants, theaters, delis and sports stadiums throughout the city. According to the New York City Health Department, 34 per cent of adult New Yorkers are overweight and 22 per cent are obese. Obesity also kills thousands of New . Yorkers every year and costs $4billion in health care. Across the U.S. $168 billion is spent on obesity a year. The ban, also aimed at fighting . obesity, would affect drinks equivalent to what McDonald's Corp calls . small and has incensed food and beverage makers, many of which have . agreed to voluntary nutritional measures.

Disney is also launching its own 'Mickey Check' label for food it deems to be nutritious to help promote certain healthier foods in grocery stores and other retailers. A 2006 Institute of Medicine report said junk food marketing contributed to childhood obesity. That same year Disney, which owns the ABC-TV network and a host of cable channels, introduced voluntary guidelines that prohibited licensing of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters for foods that do not meet minimum nutritional requirements. That helped sell more than 2 billon servings of Disney-licensed fruits and vegetables since then, Iger said at the event, which featured a Mickey Mouse character making yogurt parfaits surrounded by buckets of lemons, oranges and apples. Its theme parks also started offering carrots and milk -- rather than fries and soda -- as the default choice for kids meals and saw that 60 percent of parents chose the healthier option, he added. Disney's new effort will not allow advertising during children's programming on its networks, including ABC and Disney XD and its child-focused websites, for foods that fail to meet minimum nutrition requirements. The company could not say how many products would be affected by the new rules, but experts said not all unhealthy foods will disappear.

"Following reports there are now more than a billion websites, researchers have created a map that reveals just how far and wide these sites penetrate the globe. The map was created by researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute using 2011 data on web users and total population datasets from the World Bank. It reveals that China is now home to the world’s largest internet population at over half a billion, followed by the US, India, and Japan. Hover your mouse over the interactive module to explore the map . The map was created by researchers at the Oxford Internet Institute using 2011 data on web users from the World Bank.

Each hexagon accounts for approximately one third of a million internet users, and countries with fewer than that number were removed from the map. The shading of each country reflects its internet penetration rate, and darker shades indicate higher levels of internet usage in that population. This means that some countries may appear larger because they have a higher proportion of people using the web, but when looked at the population as a whole, the penetration may be low. The top category of internet penetration is where more than 80 per cent of residents are online. The bottom category features countries with a penetration of less than 20 per cent. This included a number of African countries including Chad and Niger.

This means that some countries may appear larger because they have a higher proportion of people using the web, but when compared to the population as a whole, the penetration may be low. The World Bank has tracked the number of web users and connections per country since the 1996, as part of its Worldwide Governance Indicators project. Its data reveals that 42 per cent of the world’s internet users live in Asia - and China, India, and Japan alone host more internet users than Europe and North America combined. The top category of internet penetration is where more than 80 per cent of residents are online, and few of the world’s largest countries fall into this category. This suggests that in all of the world’s largest internet nations, there is still substantial room for growth, claim the researchers. All but four of the countries with an internet penetration rate of more 80 per cent are in Europe, including Denmark, the UK, and Germany. The exceptions are Canada, New Zealand, Qatar, and South Korea. Most Latin American countries now have a penetration rate of more than 40 per cent, and the region as a whole now hosts almost as many internet users as the US, continued the researchers. In the last three years, almost all North African countries have doubled their population of web users, with Algeria being the exception. However, more than half of Sub-Saharan African countries have a penetration of less than 10 per cent.

"The Thai surrogate mother of baby Gammy has claimed that Wendy Farnell, Gammy's Australian and apparent biological mother did not actually supply the egg which Pattaramon Chanbua carried. Ms Chanbua, 21, told Fairfax Media the egg was donated by another Thai woman via a surrogacy agency, but the sperm did come from David Farnell. The couple currently have custody of Gammy's sister Pipah who lives with them in West Australia. 'They are not really related with the baby … I am not really sure they will give real love to Gammy’s sister', Ms Chanbua said. Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, says Chinese-born Australian Wendy Farnell - said to be Gammy's biological mother - did not supply her own eggs . The 21-year-old is reportedly angry over the interview the Farnell's will give to Channel Nine's 60 Minutes on Sunday night. Ms Chanbua maintains the couple abandoned Gammy because he had Downs Sydnrome and other health problems. This comes as Thailand proposed changes to its surrogacy laws and clinics over the international scandal between Ms Chanbu and the Farnells. Australia has pressed the Thai government to allow a transition period before it bans commercial surrogacy in a bid to allow Australians to receive children being carried by Thai surrogate mothers. The request made by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop comes a day after a Thai surrogacy agency was shut down by authorities. Ms Bishop made the call to acting Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow at the ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting in Myanmar capital Naypitdaw, on Saturday. The surrogate mother said the sperm did come from Mr Farnell (right) but she doesn't think they will love Gammy's twin Pipah (middle) Ms Bishop raised the issue of ongoing cases of surrogate mothers for Australian women and requested Thai authorities allow for a 'transition period' for the births 'for humanitarian reasons' before enforcing proposed laws. The Australian families have already paid thousands of dollars to agents and the surrogate mothers for the procedure. Mr Sihasak told reporters Ms Bishop said the Australian government had no policy to support commercial surrogacy and Thailand had full authority to deal with issue. Ms Bishop's request comes as Thailand prepares to fast track legislation through the National Legislative Assembly. As many as 50 Australian couples may have lost the opportunity to be parents after the Bangkok IVF clinic was shut down with Thai authorities suspecting links to an international baby trafficking organisation. Following the closure of the All IVF Center on Friday, there are grave concerns that Thai surrogate mothers could abort their babies now they have no support from the clinic as the baby Gammy scandal has seen 40 clinics raided in a serious crackdown across Thailand. Foreign minister Julie Bishop (left) has called on Thailand to allow a transition period before banning commercial surrogacy a day after All IVF Clinic in Bangkok was shut down.  Dr Pisit Tantiwattanakul (right) was the centre's director . An estimated 70 per cent of Australian couples seeking surrogacy attended the All IVF clinic . It is estimated that about 50 Australian couples, who have arrangements with the clinic, have no way of contacting their surrogates and the whereabouts of the embryos previously stored at clinic was also unknown, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Thai authorities have cracked down on the growing surrogacy business after the plight of Gammy, a six-month old baby with Down syndrome, whose Australian biological parents allegedly left him behind in Thailand but took his twin sister to Bunbury in Western Australia. Surrogacy Australia founder Sam Everingham has called on the Thai authorities to ensure all of the clinic’s surrogates are safe and the biological parents will be reunited with their babies when born. Health Service Support chief Boonruang Trairuangworawat said the clinic was shut down because services could cause harm or even deaths: ‘it’s registered as a medical facility but not as one offering fertility treatments’. Pisit Tantiwattanakul, the clinic’s executive director, infertility specialist and chief embryologist, was described on the clinic’s website before it was shut down on Sunday, as ‘charming and kind,’ who received ‘high marks for his patient demeanour and his direct approach to client care’ and performed more than 700 IVF procedures a year.

"Surrogacy Australia says it knows of up to 200 would-be Australian parents caught in Thailand's planned crackdown on commercial surrogacy, but the number may be higher. Spokeswoman Rachel Kunde said the organisation could only estimate the total amount because some were outside its network, including the West Australian couple at the centre of an international surrogacy drama. Ms Kunde said the couple, who are accused of leaving their baby daughter's twin brother Gammy, who has Down syndrome, in Thailand with the surrogate mother, did not use Surrogacy Australia's services. ""They didn't go through our organisation so that is an example of the people that aren't getting advice from us and going overseas,"" she said. Ms Kunde said they were working closely with the Australian embassy in Thailand to make sure surrogates were receiving obstetric care and knew they had not been abandoned by those who had commissioned them. Foreign minister Julie Bishop (left) has called on Thailand to allow a transition period before banning commercial surrogacy a day after All IVF Clinic in Bangkok was shut down.  Dr Pisit Tantiwattanakul (right) was the centre's director . She said they were also trying to find out what happened to the frozen embryos of about 50 Australian couples at a Bangkok IVF clinic that closed in the wake of the Gammy surrogacy controversy. There is growing concern among Australians using surrogates overseas about uncertain changes to commercial surrogacy laws, Ms Kunde said. Thailand is preparing to fast-track legislation to outlaw commercial surrogacy, banning agencies acting as brokers, or accepting financial or other benefits. Advertising for women to act as surrogates for commercial purposes would also be illegal. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Saturday called on the Thai government to allow a transitional period before the ban, to enable Australians to receive children still being carried by surrogates. The biological parents of baby Gammy will give their side of their story to Nine Network's 60 Minutes program on Sunday night. Meanwhile, the mother of Gammy's biological father, who is a convicted sex offender, has told The Sunday Times he is reformed and deserves to be a father again. The 81-year-old said her son and his wife should be allowed to keep Gammy's sister because they loved her to bits and were very excited to be parents.

"UKIP Leader Nigel Farage has issued a public plea appeal to disaffected Tories to join his party . David Cameron expects the UK Independence Party to win next year’s European Parliament elections despite his pledge to hold an in/out referendum on Europe. A senior Conservative source said it was now taken as a ‘reasonable assumption’ in Downing Street that UKIP would top the poll next May – sparking a fresh round of Tory bloodletting on Europe just 12 months before the General Election. ‘This will keep coming back,’ the source said. ‘UKIP are going to do very well next year and we are going to have to go through all this again.’ The admission blows apart the Prime Minister’s strategy of ‘shooting the UKIP fox’ by pledging to hold a referendum on Europe. UKIP leader Nigel Farage today issue a direct appeal to disaffected Tory members to join his party. He sought to exploit unrest within the Conservative ranks with a full-page advertisement in The Daily Telegraph to accuse the Conservative leadership of having betrayed the trust of its natural supporters. It comes after it emerged a senior Tory ally of Mr Cameron had can party activists 'mad, swivel-eyed loons'. Mr Farage said it was the 'ultimate insult', adding: 'Only an administration run by a bunch of college kids, none of whom have ever had a proper job in their lives, could so arrogantly write off their own supporters. 'Conservatives are used to a party that is patriotic, supports business and believes in aspiration. Today they are led by people obsessed with farms and introducing gay marriage and happy to open the door to 29 million Romanians and Bulgarians from January 1 next year. 'If you are a Conservative who supports the UKIP position that we should be an independent, self-governing nation, then your party now treats you with contempt.' It is expected to trigger a fresh round of defections from the Tory party to UKIP among local councillors as well as rank and file activists. Six members of the Conservative group on Merton council in south London have announced they are switching. Mr Farage, pictured with police officers during a recent trip to Scotland when protestors gathered around the politician, wants to woo Tories . Richard Hilton, one of the group, said he was joining UKIP because the 'loons' comment was the 'final insult' from the 'liberal elite that runs the Tory party nowadays'. Mr Cameron was also strongly criticised by Lord Howe, the former Conservative Chancellor who helped bring down Margaret Thatcher. He said Mr Cameron was ‘losing control’ of the party after pandering to Eurosceptics by offering an in/out referendum. Lord Howe, who also served as Foreign Secretary, accused Mr Cameron of ‘running scared’ of his own MPs and UKIP. ‘Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes the current terms of UK membership of the EU, the Prime Minister has opened up a Pandora’s Box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the process,’ he said. ‘The ratchet effect of Euroscepticism has now gone so far that the Conservative leadership is in effect running scared of its backbenchers, let alone UKIP, having allowed deep anti-Europeanism to infect the very soul of the party.’ In a further development, a poll revealed that 46 per cent of people would vote to leave the EU if there were a referendum now, with a further 24 per cent undecided. Lord Howe said the PM has opened a political Pandora's box since questioning UK's membership in the EU . Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed that Cabinet ministers have been banned from saying how they would vote now, after Education Secretary Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond were accused of undermining the Prime Minister last week by saying they would vote to get out. Mr Hague is said to have been ‘furious’ at their interventions and has ordered other ministers to keep quiet on the issue. In an interview yesterday he  said: ‘The rest of the Cabinet will not be answering hypothetical questions.’ Mr Hague urged the Conservative Party to show ‘unity’ on the issue  of Europe in the run-up to the  next election. A source close to Nick Clegg said yesterday that Tory rows about Europe were obscuring the Government’s success on thorny issues such as crime. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) and Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) were accused of undermining underminign the PM last week by saying they would vote to get out of the EU . The source said: ‘The Conservative Party has spent the past week banging on and on about Europe when, as a Coalition Government, we could and should  have been promoting our own Queen’s Speech. ‘Crime is always among the  public’s top concerns. The Lib Dems will not let internal Tory Party angst over Europe drown out our good record in government. ‘Someone should promote our programme in government – and  it looks like it’s been left to the  Lib Dems.’ Mr Clegg will tell an audience today that the Coalition has presided over a fall in crime to the lowest levels since records began, producing a ‘more liberal, more  tolerant and less violent society’. In a speech to a charity on the ‘Rehabilitation Revolution’ he will say that the Liberal Democrats have argued for years about the need to tackle reoffending, which costs the economy £10billion a year. He will say: ‘This continuing fall in crime is one of the biggest untold success stories of this Coalition. ‘Lots of people predicted that in tough economic conditions, crime would go up, as it has done in the past. But it hasn’t and we should be proud of that fact. ‘It has been achieved without excessive bureaucracy or increasing intrusion.’","Senior Tory source said consensus in Downing Street is that UKIP will win next May's election .

"She doesn’t like getting those floppy ears wet. And there’s no way she’ll be trying the doggie paddle. But it seems you can lead a rabbit to water and, with the help of a bright orange buoyancy aid, make her swim. Heidi, a giant continental rabbit, has taken to her new exercise regime like a duck to water. Her owner, Amanda Williams, hopes the twice-weekly swimming sessions will help cure her four-year-old pet’s arthritis. Heidi, a giant continental rabbit, has taken to her new exercise regime to help ease her arthritis like a duck to water . Miss Williams, 44, pays £30 a session for Heidi to swim in the 4ft-deep hydrotherapy pool. Staff strap the rabbit into an adjustable buoyancy vest designed for small dogs and pin back her ears with a hair band. She is then placed in the heated water  where she paddles up and down for about seven minutes at a time before being dried off with a towel. Heidi, who measures 3ft 2in from nose to tail and weighs a hefty 15lb, lives with two other rabbits in a £3,000 converted garage complete with sofas, air conditioning and carpet. Heidi, who measures 3ft 2in from nose to tail and weighs a hefty 15lb, lives with two other rabbits in a £3,000 converted garage complete with sofas, air conditioning and carpet . She has been diagnosed with arthritis in her hips and knees and spondylosis in her neck. ‘Over Christmas Heidi just stopped moving so I took her to the vet,’ said Miss Williams, an air traffic controller from Christchurch, Dorset. ‘He said we should try hydrotherapy, even though he had never seen it used with rabbits before. It is more usually used for horses and dogs. None of us thought she would tolerate one minute in the water but in her first session she took to it very quickly. She leapt off the platform into the pool. ‘As soon as she hit the water she just instinctively started paddling. It was obvious at first she had a problem with the water going into her ears so we tied them back with a scrunchie. ‘Her whole gait and posture is much better and she is moving around much more freely. She is now a much happier rabbit.’ Linda Prove, who owns the hydrotherapy pool in Milford on Sea, Hampshire, has never treated a rabbit before. But she is thrilled with the results. ‘Heidi is much more confident now and buzzing around the house and garden,’ she said. ‘It has worked wonders for her confidence.’ In total each session the hydrotherapy team spend with Heidi lasts 45 minutes, of which the rabbit will be in the pool for about seven minutes. Continental giant rabbits live on average for about six and cost roughly 150 pounds each. Miss Williams, who has two other continental giant rabbits called Herman and Greta, said the size of the animals means they cost her around £250 a month in food and bedding.","Heidi, a giant continental rabbit, has twice-weekly sessions to help arthritis .

"Perilous: David Cameron leaving Conservative Central Headquarters in Millbank today . David Cameron issued a love letter to Tory activists last night as UKIP closed to within two points in the opinion polls. The peace offering followed revelations that a senior ally of the Prime Minister had branded the party faithful ‘swivel-eyed loons’. MPs warn that his leadership is in peril amid discontent on Europe and gay marriage. The scale of the crisis was shown last night by a new poll that puts the Tories down five points on just 24 per cent, 11 behind Labour. UKIP – up six points in a month – was on 22 per cent, double the level of Lib Dem support.In his email to party members, Mr Cameron said: ‘We have been together through good times and bad. This is more than a working relationship; it is a deep and lasting friendship.’ Referring to reports that Tory co-chairman Lord Feldman – a tennis partner of Mr Cameron – had insulted them, he added: ‘ I am proud to lead this party. I am proud of what you do. And I would never have around me those who sneered or thought otherwise. ‘We are a team, from the parish council to the local association to Parliament, and I never forget it.’ The dire poll ratings will fuel the discontent of Tory MPs who warned yesterday the number prepared to force a leadership election has risen in recent days. If 46 write letters to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, there would be a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron. A senior MP said: ‘Three or four weeks ago it felt like we had turned a corner. Now it feels like the wheels are coming off pretty fast.’ A plotter said: ‘By my reckoning between . 18 and 23 letters could go in overnight. Cameron is by no means out of . the woods and won’t be for the next two years.’ Insult: Lord Andrew Feldman, chairman of the Conservative Party and personal friend of David Cameron, has denied calling Tory activists  'swivel-eyed loons' MPs warn that a by-election loss to UKIP would lead to ‘meltdown’ in the party. The Conservative Party board discussed the Lord Feldman issue for 35 minutes yesterday and rejected calls from Tory MP and board member Brian Binley to hold a full investigation. Lord Feldman repeated his denial that he . said the words attributed to him. That section of the meeting was . chaired by co-chairman Grant Shapps with Lord Feldman still in the room. Capitalising: UKIP leader Nigel Farage can celebrate that his party is twice as popular as the Lib Dems . Both faced criticism over the ‘disconnect’ between the leadership and the grassroots, over the way the affair was handled and over No 10’s decision to attack the media for its reporting. Mr Shapps admitted Tory high command must do more to connect with party members, stressing party chiefs would ‘redouble its efforts’. After the meeting, Mr Binley said: ‘It was agreed that there was a need to narrow the gap between the party and the country and the leadership.’ But he also suggested that Mr Cameron still ought to do more to get to the bottom of the ‘Swivelgate’ incident. ‘If it were my company, I would want to find out exactly what had happened because I would want to put it right and make sure it didn’t happen for the next time,’ he said. Miles Windsor, chairman of Conservative Grassroots, said: ‘I find it absolutely astonishing that this insult to the Conservative Party isn’t being investigated. ‘If an investigation conclusively revealed the attributed comments were not made by a senior party member it would set minds at rest. ‘To dismiss any investigation smacks of arrogance and cover-up. This seems to confirm the leadership’s contempt for its grassroots.’ Those present at the meeting said the party board – a group of MPs, peers, donors and local party bosses – backed Lord Feldman because he works assiduously for the party. But some privately expressed concerns the co-chairman was simply expressing the views of Mr Cameron. One of them said: ‘The Swivelgate story plays into the wider sense in the party and the country that there is an aching void between most of the British people and a small group of gilded elite who don’t understand them.’","David Cameron e-mailed party members to re-affirm 'we are a team'

"They are the rubble-strewn relics of a forgotten age of bustling prosperity: a mosque, a minaret, a hospital and a marketplace. Now in ruins, they have been destroyed by a war that is not only killing generations of Syrians but also history itself. And as these before and after pictures show, a heritage built over more than 5,000 years is being slowly buried under rubble. The ancient Umayyad Mosque of Aleppo was once an imposing testament to ancient Syrian architecture, and said to be home to the remains of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist. Imposing: The ancient Umayyad Mosque of Aleppo was once an imposing testament to ancient Syrian architecture, and said to be home to the remains of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist .

But now its famous courtyard is filled with bricks and rubbish while its walls are blackened and pock-marked by almost three years of fighting. Then there is the famous minaret of the Omari Mosque in Deraa under which anti-government protests have been held almost every day since the conflict began. The historic mosque is said to date back to the 7th century. Aleppo's Souq Bab Antakya was once a maze of winding passageways and cobbled streets selling a cornucopia of food, clothes and trinkets. But it now lies silent, but for the sound of bombs and gunfire, as forces loyal to president Bashar al-Assad attempt to flush rebel fighters from its streets.

Nearby, al-Kindi hospital is just a shell of the modern building it was. There are no patients, no doctors, no ambulances, no life at all at this once modern medical hub. In May 2012, Durham University PhD student Emma Cunliffe, a member of the Global Heritage Network, prepared a report on the damage done to Syria's heritage sites, detailing the many civilisations that helped build contemporary Syria. 'Numerous bronze-age civilisations left their successive marks, including the Babylonians, the Assyrians and the Hittites,' she said. 'They, in turn, were replaced by the Greeks, the Sasanians, the Persians, the Romans and the Arabs, many of whom chose Syrian cities as their capitals. 'The European Crusaders came and left some of the most impressive castles known and the Ottoman Empire also made its mark. All these cultures co-existed and conflicted, forming something new and special and found nowhere else in the world.' Landmark: Then there is the famous minaret of the Omari Mosque in Deraa under which anti-government protests have been held almost every day since the conflict began . Collapsed: The historic mosque is said to date back to the 7th century but has since been destroyed, now surrounded by burnt-out tanks, tires and blockades . Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Syrian peace talks in Geneva are deadlocked over the divisive issue of transferring power to a transitional government, sources told the BBC. The Syrian government team reportedly presented a 'declaration of principles' that did not mention transfer of power, before it was rejected by the opposition. It reportedly insisted that Syrians choose a political system without 'imposed formulas' from outside, while also insisting on discussing 'terrorism' rather than transfer of power. Opposition delegate, Monzer Akbik, said: 'The people not acceptable are the people who committed crimes against humanity and war crimes including Assad and his associates who have blood on their hands.' Also today, the United States said it has restarted deliveries of nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition, officials said Monday, more than a month after al-Qaida-linked militants seized warehouses and prompted a sudden cutoff of Western supplies to the rebels. The communications equipment and other items are being funneled for now only to non-armed opposition groups, said the U.S. officials. However, Syria's opposition says there has been no progress on aid convoys reaching the besieged city of Homs and the release of prisoners from government jails. Opposition spokesman Monzer Akbik said talks on a political transition in Syria will go ahead regardless. 'We will start talking about a new Syria,' he said in Geneva as the government and opposition delegation sat down again with a UN mediator for talks.

Shell: There are no patients, no doctors, no life at all but for gun-toting fighters and rubble . No life: People walk through the Al-Madina Souq market in Aleppo, left. Now it is empty, right . A tentative agreement was reached on Sunday to let women and children leave a blockaded part of Homs. But Mr Akbik described the deal as a 'moral outrage' and said people trapped in the city should receive aid inside their city and then have the freedom to leave or stay. The UN mediator earlier said the two sides have reached a deal to allow women and children to leave a city under government siege for more than a year. Lakhdar Brahimi acknowledged that the step was a small one - he had hoped for an agreement to let humanitarian aid into Homs. But the agreement was the first tangible outcome from peace talks that have been marred from the outset by low expectations and acrimony. Mr Brahimi defended the pace of the talks, which have yet to touch upon the issue of president Bashar Assad's future. 'You may gain one hour and lose one week,' he said.","Images show once bustling centres of commerce and culture now lying silent .

"As the government's austerity programme rolls on, and the UK tightens its belt, Britain is a nation in need of something to smile about. And it seems a Shetland pony moon-walking to the strains of an '80s pop tune could be just the thing. An advert for mobile internet firm 3, which sees a pony tapping its hooves to Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac, has been lauded as 'the best thing ever' by fans on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Silly: The Shetland pony is seen moon-walking to the sounds of Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac in the advert . The quirky clip has racked up more than two million YouTube hits in less than a week. 'Seeing the dancing pony advert brightens up my day,' said Twitter user @_5ophie, while @Lozzaap tweeted that it would 'always be my favourite advert'. Another fan, @Anthonyshaw_, posted: 'Love that dancing pony in the new 3 advert', adding 'It'll probably be in a lasagne by next week though' - referencing the recent horse meat scandal. Today, Mari Williamson, the owner of Socks told of her pride. Mrs Williamson, 42, who runs the Benston stud farm on Shetland, said she was amazed at the five-year-old's new found fame. He was even given the VIP treatment during the shoot by having his own hairdresser who attached 40 clips to his locks for each day of filming. 'Brightens my day': One Twitter user described the 3 advert as 'the best thing I've ever seen' Baffled: A grey horse peers over a wall at the dancing pony in the quirky ad . In the zone: The dancing Shetland pony moon-walks to the edge of a cliff in the advert, which ends with the caption: 'Silly stuff. It matters' Mrs Williamson was approached last year to supply the ponies for the advert, which was filmed on the cliffs of Eshaness on the islands. She said: 'The reaction has been . incredible, we have had phone calls and emails from all over the world. I . thought they did a terrific job with the advert and it was surreal . watching it for the first time. 'Socks is a plucky pony who just . loves attention and I think that's why he was picked out to be the star. He spent a week filming the advert and he took it all in his stride. 'It's gone viral now with millions of . people watching him but he is blissfully unaware and is keeping his . hoofs firmly on the ground.' Socks was prepared for his starring . role for two weeks by local animal trainer Elaine Tait, who told how she . taught him to 'moonwalk' by giving him carrots as gifts. She said: 'Since I only had two weeks in order to get Socks ready to moonwalk, I had to work quickly to gain his trust. Quirky: The advert has received over two million hits on YouTube . Standing out in a crowd: The other Shetlands carry on grazing as the dancing pony moon-walks past . 'I had to encourage him to go up on . his rear legs as well - usually this is something that a trainer tries . to get his horse or pony not to do, but because of the choreography of . the ad, it was something we had to do. 'In order to get him to paw the . ground, which is probably one of the most important parts of the . moonwalk process, I placed a facecloth to the ground that he would paw. 'Eventually, he would know to paw the ground without the facecloth being there.' The moonwalking Shetland horse advert . was filmed by award-winning filmmaker Dougal Wilson, famed for his . tear-jerking festive films for John Lewis. Local hairstylist Bjoern Larson fitted Socks with extensions and used luxury products on him for the shoot. One of Mrs Williamson's other ponies, Hugh, also starred on the advert, which launched during Coronation Street last week. However, she insisted that despite his fame she will not be cashing in by selling Socks. She added: 'He has never been for sale and I won't be selling him no matter what the price. 'He's a very special little pony.' Mash-up versions of the popular . advert have also been cropping up on YouTube, including one in which the .

"It is a view which is bound to make any sports fan set the countdown clock for 2016. These are the first images showing what we can expect from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in just under three years’ time. Built on a waterfront peninsula in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of the city, it stretches out over 300 acres and will help Rio host 15 Olympic sports and 11 Paralympic competitions at 34 venues across the city. Scroll down for video . Let the games begin: As well as the sports parks and venues, the Rio de Janeiro Olympic park will also feature a 12,000 capacity waterfront lawn where sports fans can watch the games on big screens . Bright lights, big city: The triangular peninsula will be lit up in the colour of the Olympic flag at night, according to this prediction by designers . Resourceful design: The peninsula upon hosted the 2007 Pan-American Games at three venues which will now be incorporated into the new Olympic Park . The 2016 Olympic Park has been designed by the same architects who created the now iconic London 2012 Park, located in Stratford, East London. London-based International Architects Studio Aecom won the bid in 2011, basing their design on classic Brazilian architecture and nature, with the aim to create a legacy for the city. The . 15 venues will be interconnected by flowing pathways, intended to . remind the great Amazon River, and for those who fail to get their hands . on the much-coveted tickets, a waterfront open green space is to be . built to host 12,000 people who will be able to follow the actions on . big screens. A specific . broadcast centre will play host to 20,000 journalists from around the . world, and the Olympic villages will be located nearby. Architects . say the construction of the Rio Olympic Park is set to be much more . straight forward than the 2012 Games, as several venues are already . operating. Paved with good intentions: What the park will look like in 2016, during the Olympic Games . Olympic legacy: Once the Games are over the Olympic site, pictured as planned in 2018, will begin a conversion from mammoth sports Mecca to a resourceful addition to the city . Complete conversion: The image shows the site plan for 2013, with many of the venues converted into housing and schools, much needed in Rio . Unlike the London Games, the main Olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous Brazil football stadium, the Maracana, which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the Joco Havelange Stadium - home to the club side Botafogo. The Olympic Park itself is centered around three original sports venues which were built for the 2007 Pan-American Games. The . vision for the future is not just to create a global stage for the . Olympic and Paralympic Games of 2016, but also, in the longer term, to . create a new legacy district with new homes, jobs and places for leisure . activities,’ Aecom said. 'Every . Olympics needs to reflect the character and ambitions of the host city . and this is where the differences between the two parks are most . pronounced. ‘While London . was about demonstrating how a short global event can lead to the long . term regeneration of one of the most neglected and deprived areas of the . city, Rio is about celebrating Brazil's emergence as a world power as . well as making sure there is a strong legacy plan in place.' Good track record: The London architecture firm which was chosen to design the Rio site, was also responsible for creating the 2012 Olympic park in Stratford . Lighting up the world: Rio's Olympic Park will be located next to the water's edge in the Barra area of the the city, built on the former Brazilian grand prix track .","Olympic Park for Rio Games is being built on a peninsula in the city's  Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood .

"It claims to be a survival show in which 13 ‘ordinary’ men are marooned on a desert island to fend for themselves for a month. Yesterday however TV adventurer Bear Grylls and Channel 4 found themselves embroiled in a fakery row over The Island after it emerged that several of the contestants are professionals used to thriving in extreme conditions – and some of the scenes have been staged. In last week’s opening episode, the dehydrated camp-mates were seen running out of time to find a source of fresh drinking water. Scroll down for video . Bear Grylls' new Channel 4 show, The Island, has been accused of fakery after producers tampered with the environment . Kiff McManus (circled left), Rupert Smith (circled, third from left), Dan Etheridge (circled, second from right) and Matt Bennett (circled, far right) have worked as crew in other extreme programmes before . When they eventually located one, . viewers were not told that the murky supply was in fact a rubber-lined . pool put there by the production crew. It has also transpired that two caimans – a species of crocodile – were let loose for the group to catch. This was not disclosed in the broadcast. Introducing . the first episode of the five-part series, Grylls said he wanted to . ‘find out what happens if you strip a man of all the luxuries and . conveniences of modern living and then force him to fight for his . existence’. He claimed that . the contestants were ‘ordinary men about to be abandoned on a Pacific . island with just the clothes they stand up in and a few tools’. Nine . were introduced in the first episode: call centre worker Ryan McHugh, . 21; ex-police officer Tony Fletcher, 70; leakage engineer Craig Brown, . 26; hairdresser Dean Smith, 24; neurologist Sam Nightingale, 33; sheep . farmer Joe Birch, 23; IT trainer Mike Fletcher, 37; actor Sackie . Osakonor, 28; and business coach Christopher Barrow, 60. Channel 4 have said they released two caymen onto the island to sustain the men and replenish the natural habitat . The series showed the men capturing and killing the caymen for food as part of their desert island experience . A spokesman for the channel insisted the men still had to catch the animals for food, as seen in the show . However four other men were not. They all have experience of surviving extreme conditions and some have previously worked with Grylls. Rupert . Smith worked with him on Channel 4’s Escape To The Legion and cameraman . Dan Etheridge worked with Grylls on Man vs Wild. Sound recordist Kiff . McManus has ten years’ experience working in hostile conditions, while . Matt Bennett was part of the team behind Sky’s Ross Kemp On Gangs. Channel . 4 said in a statement:  ‘It clearly states in the programme voiceover . that trained crew are part of the experiment, living under exactly the . same conditions as the other men. Crew members including Matt Bennett (above left), Rupert Smith (above right), Kiff McManus (below left) and Matt Bennett (below right) have worked on similar shows in the past . ‘Like all of the men on the Island, their professions are captioned on screen and their backgrounds are discussed.’ Of . the claims of fakery, it said the caimans were let loose on the . uninhabited island to ensure there was enough ‘native wildlife’ to keep . the 13 men fed. It . added: ‘We had to ensure the island’s only water supply, a muddy pool, . would last through filming in the dry season and that there were enough . native animals and native vegetation that could sustain the men for 28 . days – as long as they had the ingenuity to find it, catch it and kill . it.’ A water source on the island was also lined and 'topped up' by crew to ensure they had enough water . Producers of The Island with Bear Grylls - in which 13 men are marooned on the desert island - have been accused of fakery over the issues . It is not the first time Grylls, 39, has been accused of fakery. In . 2008, he apologised to viewers after it was revealed that during Born . Survivor, also broadcast on Channel 4, he had stayed in a hotel and not . camped as the show claimed. Viewers tweeted their anger at the new revelations. One said: ‘People are actually shocked that The Island with Bear Grylls is fake?’ Bear Grylls is not the only star to have his TV showed hit by accusations of fakery. In 2011, the BBC was criticised for including footage of baby polar bears in its Frozen Planet series, which it later emerged was filmed in a zoo. A voice over by Sir David Attenborough spoke of the cubs being born 'beneath the snow', but the corporation said the script was 'carefully worded' and did not mislead the audience. The BBC's Frozen Planet was criticised when it emerged footage of two tiny polar bear cubs was actually filmed in a Dutch zoo . The BBC's Top Gear also came under fire last year after it was claimed actors were brought in to replace members of the public during one of the show's stunts. Viewers watched as a makeshift hovercraft put together by Jeremy Clarkson  and his fellow presenters splashed diners sitting alongside the River Avon, but is was later alleged the people were played by actors. The BBC refused to comment on the claims but a senior source said at the time: ‘Top Gear is an entertainment programme and I don’t think viewers would have been taken in.’ In January this year, Channel 5 came in for criticism after a crew member was apparently filmed inside the house, holding up cue cards to the housemates, who are not supposed to have contact with the outside world. Makers of Top Gear were hit by claims that actors were brought in to play members of public during one of the show's stunts last year . A Big Brother spokesman claimed: 'Sometimes members of the task team enter the Big Brother house but they do not communicate with housemates.' And, earlier this year, TV hit Gogglebox was embroiled in a similar row after one of its stars claimed the programme is scripted. Makers of the Channel 4 show, which films families watching TV, were accused of telling participants how to react and feeding them funny comments. A source said to have starred in the show also claimed they were made to change clothes to make it look like the programme was filmed on different days. A Channel 4 spokesman insisted the cast are filmed two or three times a week and said there was 'no truth' in claims the show is scripted. Gogglebox was accused of being scripted but star Leon Bernicoff, pictured with wife June, wrote online: 'Nobody tells ME what to say unless it's June. We watch things as they go out or later.'","The Island with Bear Grylls billed as '13 ordinary men on uninhabited island'

"Children educated at private schools earn almost £200,000 more by their early forties than pupils who go through the state system, a new study has revealed. Researchers said they had identified the scale of the private school salary ‘premium’ for the first time. Even after taking into account the ability and family background of pupils, private school pupils earn ‘substantially more’ – nearly £58,000 by their early forties. The study by the Social Market Foundation think-tank found that private schools tend to be more effective at improving pupils’ results and sending them to university. Children educated at private schools earn almost £200,000 more by their early forties than pupils who go through the state system, a new study has revealed . The findings prompted calls for leading fee-paying schools to be opened up to all pupils – regardless of their family wealth - using public money. Emran Mian, SMF director, said: ‘Take two people of the same ability at age 11 and with the same parental background, track them forward, and the pupil who attends independent school is likely to earn substantially more – a total of £58,000 more on average just between the ages of 26 and 42. ‘Our research suggests that a significant driver appears to be that independent schools typically progress the education of pupils more during their school years than state schools. ‘On this basis, limiting the opportunity to attend independent schools to those who are able to afford the high fees seems inequitable.’ The research tracked thousands of Britons born in 1970 and analysed their earnings between the ages of 26 and 42 – the age group it is currently possible to study. It found that pupils who attended fee-paying secondary schools earned an extra £193,700 between those ages compared with their state-educated peers. After taking into account test scores at age 10 and a child’s family background, the premium dropped to £57,653. But the report said: ‘Even once family background and early age test scores are taken into account, those who go to independent schools are more likely to achieve higher salaries in later life, indicating a strong “school effect”.’ The research suggests that private school pupils go on to earn £3,600-a-year more than pupils of the same ability and family background who go through the state system. Over the course of an entire working life, the premium could exceed £150,000. Fees for secondary day schools are typically £12,500-a-year. Researchers said they had identified the scale of the private school salary 'premium' for the first time. Even after taking into account the ability and family background of pupils, private school pupils earn 'substantially more' - nearly £58,000 by their early forties . The report suggested the difference between private and state school earnings diminishes further among pupils who go on to gain university degrees. But it added: ‘Having been to an independent school does increase later-life earnings above and beyond the fact that it increases the likelihood of achieving a degree.’ It said: ‘Independent school pupils with a degree earned on average about 20 per cent more than their degree-holding state school educated counterparts by age 42.’ The report said that teachers in private schools tended to be better qualified and class sizes were smaller. They were also better resourced and enjoyed greater freedom from the state. An analysis of exam results suggested that pupils at independent schools progressed more quickly than similar pupils at state schools. ‘An independent school premium does exist,’ said the report. ‘Some of this is due to the quality of the student intake, but our analysis has shown that a meaningful proportion is likely due to the learning environment provided by the schools.’ The report went on to back a scheme proposed by the Sutton Trust, a social mobility charity, which would involve opening up dozens of top independent schools to pupils of all backgrounds. Participating private schools would receive the same funding per pupil as local state schools but would also be able to charge fees on a means-tested basis, with the poorest families paying nothing. Extending the scheme to 100 leading schools would cost £215million, the report concluded. But the plan has found little favour with the Tory and Labour front benches. Education Secretary Michael Gove has said his focus is on improving state schools. Sir Peter Lampl, chair of the Sutton Trust, said private schools should be ‘ladders of opportunity’ rather than ‘bastions of privilege’. In a foreword to the report, Sir Peter said the ‘stark truth’ was that a day pupil at a private school is 55 times more likely to win a place at Oxford or Cambridge and 22 times more likely to go to a top-ranked university than a state educated child. ‘This is a shocking waste of potential,’ he said. ‘This report clearly sets out the advantages that can be gained from a good private education. We need to open those opportunities to more young people, transforming the independent sector to ensure that successful day schools recruit once again on merit rather than money. ‘Forty years ago, most of the best independent day schools in this country were open to children of all backgrounds. Today, unless your parents can find £12,500 a year after tax, access is by and large denied.’ Backing the report, Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The evidence is overwhelming that independent schools confer a massive advantage on their pupils. ‘Rather than knocking independent schools down, we should be opening them up on a meritocratic basis. If we’re serious about establishing ladders of opportunity for the bright kid from the council estate or rural backwater, this is the way to do it.’","Social Market Foundation think-tank found .

"Food Standards Agency investigation found  phenylbutazone - or bute - in this Asda product . The veterinary painkilling drug phenylbutazone - or bute - has been found in Asda Smart Price Corned Beef, the Food Standards Agency has said. Asda had already withdrawn tens of thousands of its own brand corned beef last month after it was found to contain up to 50 per cent horsemeat. The supermarket giant removed the £1.54 products from stores across Britain on March 8 - and tests this week showed quantities of horse DNA above trace levels. Leicestershire County Council found the ingredients of one batch of the 340g tins were half horse, but Leeds-based Asda has insisted it only found levels of up to five per cent. Asda, which last month said it had carried out more than 700 tests on products during the horsemeat scandal, has had eight products that have been positive for at least traces of horse. A spokesman for Asda said the chain has 'taken a belt and braces approach' to testing for horse DNA and quickly removed any products from its shelves 'whenever we've had any concerns'. Andrew Rhodes, director of operations . at the Food Standards Agency, acknowledged it takes time to test for . bute once horsemeat is found in a product. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today . programme, he said: 'What we have found in this positive test result is a . very low level of (bute)... which is only really just above the limit . of detection. 'It's very unlikely to (do harm). As . the chief medical officer has said... it's extremely rare people have an . adverse reaction to phenylbutazone. 'This is considerably lower than a . therapeutic dose and you would have to consume enormous quantities of . meat, way more than anyone could physically consume, to get near a . therapeutic dose.' Mr Rhodes said it was important to understand how the product came to be contaminated and how it came to have bute in it. 'If someone has done something which . is illegal, and not taken due measures to prevent that happening, then . they can face sanctions,' he said. 'But we need to determine exactly . what has happened in this case before we can determine whether that will . happen or not - which is true of any of the cases we have seen.' Supermarket: The Walmart-owned chain with 500-plus stores, whose Smart Price Corned Beef is manufactured by French supplier Toupnot, has also scraped its Chosen By You Corned Beef line (file picture) The Walmart-owned chain with 500-plus . stores, whose Smart Price Corned Beef is manufactured by French . supplier Toupnot, has also scraped its Chosen By You Corned Beef line. Europe's horsemeat scandal erupted in . January, when testing in Ireland revealed that some beef products also . contained equine DNA, and the problems then spread across the continent. The scandal ensnared numerous . well-known brands, prompting product withdrawals, consumer concerns and . government investigations into the region's complex food-processing . chains. City of London Police fraud experts . will lead the probe into the horsemeat scandal, co-ordinating the . response to what ministers have claimed is an international criminal . conspiracy. In the Commons last month, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson described the . adulteration of food products with horsemeat as a 'criminal conspiracy . which covers 23 countries'. Ade McKeon, Asda's director responsible for the quality of all the store's branded products, said: 'I know our customers will be just as concerned about this news as we are. Even at such a low level, it is totally unacceptable. 'I can reassure our customers that we are working closely with the FSA and our suppliers to deliver a wide ranging and rigorous programme of testing, to be sure that the products we sell are exactly what it says on the label.' Andrew Rhodes, director of operations . at the Food Standards Agency . An Asda spokesman said: 'We have taken an extremely cautious approach since the very beginning . and have carried out more than 700 tests, moving swiftly to remove any . products from our shelves whenever we’ve had the smallest concerns. 'Our . commitment to you is to continue to test our products regularly and . update you with the very latest news as soon as we can. 'In March 2013 we withdrew tinned Smart Price Corned Beef (340g) after receiving a positive test for horse DNA above the one per cent trace level set by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). 'Today, 9th April 9, tests on further batches have shown a positive . result for very low levels of horse medication called phenylbutazone, . also known as bute, at four parts per billion. 'The FSA has reassured us that the . quantities we’ve found pose a low risk to human health. They say: ""Bute . is not allowed to enter the food chain; however, even if people have . eaten products which contain contaminated horse meat, the risk to health . is very low."" 'Although there is a very low health risk, we are recalling this . product. This simply means that we ask anyone who has tinned Smart Price . Corned Beef (340g) in their cupboards at home to bring it back into . store for a full refund. 'The tinned Chosen By You Corned Beef (340g) product, also withdrawn . in March, has not tested positive for phenylbutazone. However as a . precaution it is also being recalled as it is made in the same factory. 'We want you to have complete confidence in the food you buy at Asda . and we are happy to refund any product you’re not 100 per cent happy with.' A spokesman for the FSA said: 'The Food Standards Agency has been informed by Asda that very low levels of the veterinary medicine phenylbutazone, known as bute, have been found in 340g tins of its Smart Price Corned Beef.

The classes are run by Michele Leonard, one of Australia’s foremost choral conductors. Ms Leonard tours various rural communities, holding workshops and scouting for a yearly musical performance which features 130 kids from surrounding rural communities. 'The workshops are open to anyone, but Michele is looking out for the kids that have a spark. Mack was lucky to have been interested in performance since he was a kid, which gave him an edge over the kids who had less experience.' The classes allow Mack and like minded children to  work on their dreams together, under the guidance of Leonard and her lifetime of experience. 'It's had an incredible effect on his life. Mack has the confidence to believe in his ability. It has allowed him to be who he's supposed to be, and for that we're forever grateful.' Ms Holz said that Mack mostly keeps his performances separated from school. 'As a child, it's difficult to be different. In our communities, most of the kids just play rugby. Mack is strong enough to be proud of what he does, but he mostly keeps from dancing at school.' Speaking on the show Outback Choir, Mack explained ‘I chose not to be too into dance at school because then you might lose some friends or something-they might ditch you,' he said. 'Not many people go for dancing or singing.’ Mack explains that a Billy Elliot musical he went to in Sydney changed his life. Since then, he earned his current epithet.

"President Obama blasted the IRS on Tuesday, after a damning Inspector General report on the agency's practice of singling out conservative groups seeking tax exempt status. 'The . report’s findings are intolerable and inexcusable,' Mr Obama said on Tuesday in a statement, as the FBI opens an investigation into the IRS practices. The White House reaction came after the release of an audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, that found the tax agency did indeed single out groups based on policy positions. But critics fault the report for failing to identify who at the IRS was responsible for instituting the discriminatory policy and some have suggested the audit is nothing more than the Obama administration's 'whitewashing' of the scandalous episode. Scroll down for video . Zero tolerance: President Obama, Monday at a White House press conference, condemned the IRS for its alleged discrimination saying the agency's employees have failed the American public . 'The IRS . must apply the law in a fair and impartial way, and its employees must . act with utmost integrity,' Mr Obama assured the public in his statement. 'This report shows that some of its employees . failed that test,' the statement continued. The president said he has charged Treasury Secretary Jack Lew 'to hold those responsible for these failures accountable, and to make . sure that each of the Inspector General’s recommendations are . implemented quickly, so that such conduct never happens again.' Attorney General Eric Holder announced on Tuesday, four hours before the release of the report, that he has called for a criminal investigation into the Internal Revenue Service's practices. The DOJ probe will focus on whether the IRS conducted any illegal activity throughout the course of the targeting scandal. He called the IRS' actions 'outrageous and unacceptable.' 'The FBI is coordinating with the Justice Department to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters,' the attorney general told the press. Holder's remarks came a day after it was revealed that Acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller repeatedly failed to tell Congress that Tea Party groups were being inappropriately targeted, even after he had been briefed on the matter. The IRS said on Monday that Miller was first informed on May, 3, 2012, that applications for tax-exempt status by Tea Party groups were inappropriately singled out for extra, sometimes burdensome scrutiny. Likely story: Acting Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Steven T. Miller, right, admitted the agency made missteps but insisted they were not politically motivated . The report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, that was delivered to Congress, accused the agency of 'insufficient oversight' in its practice of paying close attention to social welfare organizations applying for tax-exempt status as 501(c)(4)s, for those groups that had conservative key words in their title. 501(c)(4)s are a type of nonprofit in . the American tax code, described as 'social welfare' groups, that tend . to be civic organizations and political action committees. 'The inappropriate and changing . criteria may have led to inconsistent treatment of organizations . applying for tax-exempt status...[ineffective management] allowed inappropriate criteria to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months,' the report said. The organizations were targeted for review 'based . upon their names or policy positions' and not due to 'indications of . potential political campaign interventions,' the report continued. The practice is believed to have occurred from 2010 to 2012. The report proposed that the IRS provide . better documentation for the reasoning behind selecting certain groups . for extra review and that it resolve cases which had been in limbo for . as long as 3 years, in some cases. Probe: Attorney General Eric Holder has demanded a full investigation into the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax exempt status . Critics have faulted the report for . failing to identify which agency employees were responsible for the . flagrant discrimination, with the audit stating simply, 'we could not . specifically determine who had been involved in creating the criteria.' Utah Republican Sen. Orin Hatch, the . ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, said on Tuesday, 'it . wasn’t just some lowly staffer ... very senior management at the IRS . here in Washington knew what was going on for over a year and didn’t say . a word.' 'There’s a reason . Congress is a coequal branch of government - something I wonder if the . Administration fully appreciates - and we are going to fully examine . what they are doing to ensure the people of our nation have confidence . that we are looking out for the public interest.' Sen. Hatch has called on Miller to resign. Senator . Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said earlier on Tuesday . that Republicans would exhaust every effort to find who was responsible . for the matter. 'We do . know this: we can’t count on the administration to be forthcoming about . the details of this scandal, because so far they’ve been anything but,' he told reporters. Michigan . Rep. Dave Camp, the Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Ways . and Means said, 'I am astounded and appalled that the IRS targeted . organizations based on their political beliefs...The IRS’s repeated . failure to be truthful is completely unethical and an embarrassment to . this government.' The . Democratic ranking member, Rep. Sander Levin, agreed, 'Chairman Camp and . I have agreed it is essential that there be a thorough and bipartisan . investigation and effective remedial action.' Groups with the words 'patriot,' 'tea . party' and '9/12' were said to have been flagged and 'inappropriate . criteria' was used by the agency in reviewing their applications. '9/12' refers to a movement launched by ultra-conservative media pundit Glenn . Beck, who started the effort on his former FOX News talk show. The . 9/12 Project was launched in 2009 to encourage Americans to return to . the patriotism the country felt on September 12, 2001 - the day after . the terrorist attacks when citizens put aside partisan disagreements in . the name of solidarity. The Internal Revenue Service insisted . on Tuesday that the tax agency's scrutiny of groups with conservative . buzzwords like 'patriot' and 'tea party' was not politically motivated . though the attempted appeasement has failed to satisfy concerned . Republicans. Joseph . Grant, acting commissioner for the agency's tax exempt division, . defended employees who targeted the groups applying for tax exempt . status, insisting it was out of a 'desire for efficiency and not out of . any political or partisan viewpoint.' Grant's . defense came as part of a damning Inspector General audit that alleged . the agency did indeed single out groups based on policy positions. Hot seat: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney fielded questions on Tuesday about Obama's knowledge of the IRS scandal, insisting the White House was not privy to the agency's practices . Acting Internal Revenue Service . Commissioner Steven T. Miller admitted on Tuesday, 'mistakes were . made...we should have done a better job of handling the influx of . applications by advocacy organizations,' in an editorial piece published . in USA Today. Mr . Miller similarly defended his agency though, echoing the IRS talking . point that the scrutiny was not rooted in political ideology. 'They . were in no way due to any political or partisan motivation. We are - . and will continue to be - dedicated to reviewing all applications for . tax-exempt status in an impartial manner,' he wrote. Despite . assurances from the agency that the attention was a mere oversight and . did not have political roots, Obama is feeling intense pressure from . both sides of the aisle over the embarrassment. The Senate Finance Committee . announced this week that it will join the House Committee on Ways and Means in investigating the matter. The House committee is preparing for its initial hearing and in a letter dated on May 14, the Republican committee chair and the Democratic ranking member requested an extensive list of documents from the IRS to be submitted by May 21. 'Despite repeated calls for cooperation, the agency failed to be completely truthful in its responses to the Committee during its nearly two-year long investigation of this matter,' the Congressmen stated. Probe: The House Committee on Ways and Means has requested an extensive list of documents from the IRS in advance of the Congressional hearing . The IRS apologized on Friday for what it . acknowledged was 'inappropriate' targeting of conservative political . groups during the 2012 election to see whether they were violating their . tax-exempt status. In some cases, the IRS acknowledged, agents . inappropriately asked for lists of donors. During the White House press briefing . on Tuesday, Obama's Press Secretary Jay Carney fielded a barrage of . questions about the scandal. President Obama 'has no tolerance for targeting of specific groups, conservative groups, . if the reporting is true on this, and he would expect action to be . taken,' Mr Carney insisted. The White House spokesman asserted that the White House had not been aware of the tax agency's methods. On Monday, President Barack Obama said he first learned about the issue from news reports on Friday. Referring to the alleged practice as 'outrageous,' Mr Obama said during a press conference at the White House, 'there is no place for it, and they have to be held fully accountable.' 'The IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity and people have to have confidence that they are applying the laws in a non-partisan way,' he said.","IRS targeted conservative groups seeking tax exempt status from 2010-2012 .

The IRS said on Monday that Miller was first informed on May, 3, 2012, that applications for tax-exempt status by Tea Party groups were inappropriately singled out for extra, sometimes burdensome scrutiny. At least twice after the briefing, Miller wrote letters to members of Congress to explain the process of reviewing applications for tax-exempt status without revealing that the Tea Party had been targeted. On July 25, 2012, Miller testified . before the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee but again was not . forthcoming on the issue - despite being asked about it. At the hearing, Rep Kenny Marchant, a . Republican from Texas, told Miller that some politically active . tax-exempt groups in his district had complained about being harassed. Marchant did not explicitly ask if Tea Party groups were being targeted. But he did ask how applications were handled. Miller . responded, 'We did group those organizations together to ensure . consistency, to ensure quality. We continue to work those cases,' according to a transcript on the committee's website. Tea party protesters: Dozens of individual organizations have complained that the IRS treated them differently from liberal or politically neutral groups . He added, 'It is my hope that some of the noise that we heard earlier this year has abated as we continue to work through these cases.' Earlier, Republican Rep Charles . Boustany of Louisiana had raised concerns with the IRS about complaints . that Tea Party groups were being harassed. Boustany specifically . mentioned Tea Party groups in his inquiry. But . in a June 15, 2012, letter to Boustany, Miller gave a generic response. He said that when the IRS saw an increase in applications from groups . that were involved in political activity, the agency 'took steps to . coordinate the handling of the case to ensure consistency.' Informed: Acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller was told by staff in May 2012, that some groups' applications for tax-exempt status were improperly selected for extra scrutiny . He added that agents worked with tax law experts ""to develop approaches and materials that could be helpful to the agents working the cases.' Miller did not mention that in 2011, those materials included a list of words to watch for, such as 'Tea Party' and 'patriot.' He also didn't disclose that in January 2012, the criteria for additional screening was updated to include references to the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. 'They repeatedly failed to disclose and be truthful about what they were doing,' said Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Camp's committee is holding a hearing on the issue Friday and Miller is scheduled to testify. 'We are going to need to find out how much he knew,' Camp said of Miller. The Senate Finance Committee announced Monday that it will join a growing list of congressional committees investigating the matter. The IRS apologized Friday for what it . acknowledged was 'inappropriate' targeting of conservative political . groups during the 2012 election to see whether they were violating their . tax-exempt status. In some cases, the IRS acknowledged, agents . inappropriately asked for lists of donors. The agency blamed low-level employees in a Cincinnati office, saying no high-level officials were aware. When members of Congress repeatedly . raised concerns with the IRS about complaints that Tea Party groups were . being harassed last year, a deputy IRS commissioner took the lead in . assuring lawmakers that the additional scrutiny was a legitimate part of . the screening process. That deputy commissioner was Miller, who is now the acting head of the agency. Clampdown: Obama was faced with questions about the performance of his administration's IRS on Monday. He said allowing the targeting groups for their political views was 'outrageous' Camp and other members of the Ways and Means Committee sent at least four inquiries to the IRS, starting in June 2011. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, sent three inquiries. And Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House oversight committee, sent at least one. None of the responses they received from the IRS acknowledged that conservative groups had ever been targeted, including a response to Hatch dated Sept. 11, 2012 - four months after Miller had been briefed. In several letters to members of . Congress, Miller went into painstaking detail about how applications for . tax-exempt status were screened. But he never mentioned that . conservative groups were being targeted, even though people working . under him knew as early as June 2011 that Tea Party groups were being . targeted, according to an upcoming report by the agency's inspector . general. 'It is almost . inconceivable to imagine that top officials at the IRS knew conservative . groups were being targeted but chose to willfully mislead the . committee's investigation into this practice,' Camp said. 'This revelation goes against the . very principles of free speech and liberty upon which this country was . founded, and the blatant disregard for which the agency has treated . Congress and the American taxpayer raises serious concerns about . leadership at the IRS.' The IRS issued a statement Monday . saying that Miller had been briefed on May 3, 2012 'that some specific . applications were improperly identified by name and sent to the [exempt . organizations] centralized processing unit for further review.' Under scrutiny: Hundreds of small protests, like this one involving The Tea Party Immigration Coalition, have cropped up in 2013 in opposition to the president's immigration reform package . That was the unit in Cincinnati that handled the Tea Party applications. Miller became acting commissioner in . November, after Commissioner Douglas Shulman completed his five-year . term. Shulman had been appointed by President George W. Bush. On . June 29, 2011, Lois G. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees . tax-exempt organizations, learned at a meeting that groups were being . targeted, according to a draft of the report by the Treasury inspector . general for tax administration. At the meeting, Lerner was told that . groups with 'Tea Party,' 'Patriot' or '9/12 Project' in their names were . being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny, the report . says. Lerner instructed agents to change the criteria for flagging groups 'immediately.' However, when Lerner responded to . inquiries from the House oversight committee, she didn't mention the . fact that Tea Party groups had ever been targeted. Influence: Tea party groups were instrumental in the tide-turning elections of 2010, when their fervor swept new conservatives to governors' mansions, statehouses and Congress . Her responses included 45-page letters in May 2012 to Republicans Darrell Issa, of California, who chairs the committee, and Rep Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who chairs a subcommittee. Lerner also met twice with staff from the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee to discuss the issue, in March and in May 2012, according to a timeline constructed by committee staff. She didn't mention at either meeting that conservative groups had been targeted, according to the timeline. 'Knowing what we know now, the IRS was at best being far from forth coming, or at worst, being deliberately dishonest with Congress,' Hatch said Monday. On Monday, President Barack Obama said he first learned about the issue from news reports on Friday. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House counsel's office was alerted the week of April 22 that the inspector general was finishing a report concerning the IRS office in Cincinnati. But, he said, the counsel's office did not get the report and the president did not learn the focus until Friday. 'If, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that's outrageous and there's no place for it,' Obama said Monday at a press conference. ""And they have to be held fully accountable, because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity, and people have to have confidence that they're applying it in a non-partisan way, applying the laws in a non-partisan way.","IRS targeted conservative groups for closer scrutiny .

"The Internal Revenue Service wrote to the Richmond Tea Party last year demanding to know the names of all its financial donors and volunteers, as part of a 55-question inquisition into its application for tax-exempt status, MailOnline has learned. The agency wanted to know 'the names of the donors, contributors, and grantors' for every year 'from inception to the present.' It also demanded 'the amounts of each of the donations, contributions, and grants and the dates you received them.' 'How did you use these donations, contributions, and grants?' the IRS asked. 'Provide the details.' Scroll down for video . The Richmond Tea Party received a lengthy list of questions from the IRS, including demands for lists of its donors and volunteers . And in addition to the names of board members, officers and employees, the nation's taxing authorities insisted on knowing the names of everyone who helped the Richmond Tea Party without compensation. 'Please identify your volunteers,' the January 9, 2012 letter from the IRS read. The agency also required the Virginia conservative group to provide copies of sections of its website that only its members can access. The IRS came under fire on Friday when its Office of Inspector General released a draft of an investigative timeline showing that the agency had played political favorites with nonprofit groups seeking tax-exempt status. In 2010, according to that investigation, the Cincinnati-based IRS office responsible for vetting tax-exempt applications began targeting groups with 'Tea Party or similar' words in their names – including words like 'patriots' and '9/12' – for tighter scrutiny. The Richmond Tea Party received this demand along with dozens of others from the IRS, asking for a list of its donors and the amounts they had contributed. The group refused, citing their donors' right to privacy . The IRS ultimately identified approximately 300 such organizations, many of which were independently organized in 2009 and 2010 under the larger 'tea party' banner. Those groups had a decisive impact in the 2010 midterm congressional elections, and became a thorn in the side of the Democratic party, costing it race after race, especially in the House of Representatives, which shifted to Republican control. In the nearly three years since the IRS began looking more closely at conservative nonprofit groups than others, 125 of the 300 target organizations have been approved for tax-exempt status. Another 25 withdrew their applications. The remainder are still waiting. The Office of Inspector General's timeline shows that in Washington, senior officials with the IRS were made aware of the practice by at least August 4, 2011. On that date, the chief counsel of the IRS met with the agency's Rulings and Agreements unit 'so that everyone would have the latest information on the issue.' But during a press gaggle about Air Force One on Monday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney insisted the White House was unaware of the investigation or its political implications until last month. Obama faced questions about the performance of his administration's IRS on Monday. The White House has said it learned of the IRS IG's report on Friday, when a copy of an investigative timeline was leaked to reporters . The Richmond Tea Party has organized conservatives in Virginia's capital region for more than three years, but refused to share its donor and volunteer lists with the IRS as a condition of winning tax-exempt status . 'My understanding,' Carney told reporters while en route to New York City for the president's appearance at political fundraising events, 'is that the White House Counsel’s Office was alerted in the week of April 22nd of this year, only about the fact that the IG was finishing a review about matters involving the office in Cincinnati.  But that’s all they were informed as a normal sort of heads-up.' 'And we have never – we don’t have access to, nor should we, the IG’s report or any draft versions of it.' Asked whether heads would roll at the IRS if the IG's report concludes that there was substantial wrongdoing, Carney was cautious. 'I think you’re getting ahead of it,' he told a reporter, according to a transcript released by the White House. 'I think you heard from the President on this today and how he feels about it.  But the ""if"" is very important, so we’re not going to start predicting outcomes if we don’t know what the conclusions of the IG report are.' The Washington Post reported on Friday that the IRS has apologized for its practices, which sought to scrutinize conservative nonprofit groups 'that criticized the government and sought to educate Americans about the U.S. Constitution.' In early 2012 a group of tea party organizations refused the IRS's requests for what they considered overreaching information about their operations, instead asking the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee to investigate. That committee wrote in June 2012 to the IRS inspector general, asking for 'periodic updates' on its investigation. Sen. Marco Rubio demanded the firing of the acting IRS commissioner on Monday in response to findings of the IRS's Office of Inspector General . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa has vowed that the IRS controversy won't go away without a complete investigation . California Republican Rep. Darrel Issa, who chairs the committee, has promised it will 'aggressively follow up' on the IG's findings. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said in a statement Friday that the IRS 'cannot target or intimidate any individual or organization based on their political beliefs.' 'The House will investigate this matter,' Cantor promised. Add appearing on the Fox News Channel on Sunday, Michigan Republican Rep. Mike Rogers said the IRS had 'agents who were engaged in intimidation of political groups.' 'I don't care if you're a conservative, a liberal, a Democrat or a Republican,' he said. 'This should send a chill up your spine. It needs to have a full investigation.' President Obama echoed that sentiment during a press conference on Monday, sayign any IRS personnel who played political favorites 'have to be held fully accountable. ... And you should feel that way regardless of party. I don't care whether you're a Democrat, independent or a Republican.' 'At some point, there are going to be Republican administrations. At some point, there are going to be Democratic ones. Either way,' the president said, 'you don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased and anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate.' Tea party favorite Sarah Palin wrote on Facebook that the 'IRS revelation is another step in the unraveling of the Obama administration's self-proclaimed ¿hope and change.""' Tea party groups were instrumental in the tide-turning elections of 2010, when their fervor swept new conservatives to governors' mansions, statehouses and Congress . Richmond Tea Party Executive Director Larry Nordvig did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in 2012 his organization lashed out at the IRS for making 'unreasonable documentation requests.' 'This illustrates everything the American people find unacceptable from their government,' the group said in a press release. 'A simple request for tax-exempt status should not take years to complete, involve hundreds of pages of documentation, require hundreds of volunteer hours, and request private information we should never have to disclose.' 'This grants the Federal Government the dangerous power to selectively stymie those voices with which they disagree, bogging them down in endless paperwork and compliance costs so that they are unable to spend time serving the principles they founded their organization to advance.' The Virginia organization said it applied for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status on December 28, 2009 and waited nearly 10 months for a response, which consisted of 17 questions and a two-week deadline. That demand was made on the opening day of the Virginia Tea Party Convention, which the Richmond Tea Party organized in large part. 'We fully complied,' the group wrote, 'providing over 500 pages of documentation. We received no response for over a year. Eventually the IRS sent a letter dated January 9, 2012, thanking us for our ""complete and thorough responses"" from the first request,' but then asking 55 more questions in 12 parts – 'including the totally inappropriate request for a full list of our donors and volunteers. We were given the same two-week timeframe for completion.' IRS official Lois Lerner (L) leads the team tasked with evaluating tax-exempt organizations. She has not responded to requests for comment. Nonprofit attorney Alan Dye (R) said his tea party clients are 'pissed off' Alan P. Dye, a nonprofit attorney with the Washington, D.C. firm of Webster, Chamberlain & Bean, told MailOnline that he represents six tea party groups that have been waiting for periods of up to 30 months for the IRS to issue rulings. 'They're very pissed off,' he said, 'and they have every right to be pissed off.' He advises his clients to refuse to answer invasive questions about their donors and volunteers, he said, since information they provide would be made available to the public. 'Everything these groups tell the IRS is open to public . inspection once their exempt status is granted,' Dye explained. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio demanded the ouster of acting IRS commissioner Steven T. Miller on Monday. President Obama called the IRS's alleged conduct 'outrageous,' and . said the bureaucrats responsible would be 'held accountable.'","Lengthy questionnaire arrived more than two years after the Richmond Tea Party applied for tax-exempt status .

"On the front line at 13: Stories about Private Sidney Lewis appeared in newspapers at the time but were not corroborated until now . A 13-year-old boy who ran away to join up fought on the front line in the First World War until his mother sent his birth certificate to the War Office and pleaded that he should be sent home. Sidney Lewis, who has been recognised as Britain's youngest soldier to serve in the Great War, enlisted with the East Surrey Regiment in August 1915, five months after his 12th birthday, and was fighting on the Somme by the age of 13. But within weeks he was ordered home to his mother, Fanny Lewis, in Tooting, south London, after she told officials he was too young to fight and should be sent back. Stories about the child fighting on the frontline were printed in papers at the time, but they were never corroborated until now. This weekend the Imperial War Museum in London declared Private Lewis the youngest authenticated fighting soldier after examining papers provided by his only son, Colin. The bundle included Sidney's birth certificate and letters from the War Office to his mother promising he would be sent home immediately. One telegram sent to Sidney's mother Fanny from the officer in charge of records at the Machine Gun Corps on 24 August 1916 read: 'Madam, your application on behalf of your son, and birth certificate, have been forwarded here by the War Office. 'I have to inform you that action has been taken and the lad will be discharged with all possible speed.' And a letter sent to Mrs Lewis the day before from the War Office's director of recruiting said: 'With reference to your letter relative to your son, Private SG Lewis, Machine Gun Corps, I am directed to inform you that telegraphic instructions have been issued that he is to be at once with drawn from the firing line and sent home for discharge. 'On arrival in this country he will be discharged from the Army forthwith.' It is believed Sidney, who is said to have had the physique of an older man, tricked enlisting officers into letting him sign up.  He underwent six months of training before being sent to France to fight. He was awarded the Victory Medal and . the British War Medal for his service in the Great War, in which he was . deployed to France with the 106th Machine Gun Company and saw active . service including six weeks fighting in the Battle of Somme. Sidney's son Colin Lewis told the Sunday Times that Sidney's mother 'ruled the roost at home'. He said: 'He told me he fought in the Battle of the Somme but I thought he was telling fibs because he was so  young.' The War Office wrote to Mrs Lewis to say her son would be 'at once withdrawn from the firing line' Colin Lewis, 80, with a picture of his father in uniform and, right, with his parents Sidney and Ivy in 1946 . Anthony Richards, of the Imperial War Museum (IWM), said: 'This is certainly the youngest First World War soldier that we hold documents for in IWM’s archives. 'His story is quite phenomenal; not . only did he enlist at the age of 12 and fight on the Somme at the age of . 13, but he returned to service at the end of the First World War and . worked in bomb disposal during the Second World War. 'He was obviously a very tenacious man and undeterred by his early experiences.' Sidney, one of eight children whose father was a hospital nurse, was among thousands of boys . thought to have tricked enlisting officers into letting them sign up, . but the youngest known to have done so. Sidney Lewis' birth certificate shows he was born in March 1903 and thus was only 12 when he enlisted . Author Richard van Emden, who wrote Boy Soliders Of The Great War, said Sidney signed up in the summer holidays of 1915, at a time when many boys signed up, unaware of how bloody it the war would be.  Few, however, saw active combat. Sidney fought in the Battle of . Delville Wood, scene of some of the most ferocious fighting in the . Battle of the Somme, which left around 500,000 men wounded or killed. It was after six weeks at the frontline that he was plucked from the . trenches and sent home to his mother. His brother-in-law Sidney Bardell, 94, said: 'I'm told he more or less ran away from home to enlist.' But he could not explain why it took Sidney's mother a year to contact the War Office. 'The lad will be discharged with all possible speed': A telegram sent to Mrs Lewis by the Machine Gun Corps . Irrepressible: Sidney Lewis, seen here on holiday with his wife Ivy in c.1946 went on to join the police force . Despite being sent home, the irrepressible Sidney went on to re-enlist in 1918 and served in Austria with the army of occupation after the Armistice.  He later joined the police force and worked in bomb disposal during the Second World War. His son said his father was 'a forthright fellow' who continued to ignore authority throughout his life until he died at the age of 63 in 1969. Pte Lewis' story will be one of thousands told in a new IWM website, Lives Of The First World War, which will tell the story of those who served at home and abroad. The website will go live in February.","Sidney Lewis was 12 when he enlisted with East Surrey Regiment in 1915 .

"Competitors on May The Best House Win – the popular Channel 4 programme in which four houseproud people judge one another’s homes – generally abide by an unwritten rule. It states that when the show is over, all agree it was a fair contest and the winners deserve the £1,000 prize. But nothing would persuade Robert and Lisa Foden, from near Warrington in Cheshire, to agree. Lisa, 34, who appeared on the show on May 20 last year, says they lost only because ‘the two people who won gave everyone else rubbish marks’. This may sound like sour grapes, but given the effort and ingenuity that went into the couple’s extraordinary Bond-themed home, filled with high-tech luxuries 007 would be proud of, their angst is understandable. Robert and Lisa Foden filled their Cheshire home with high-tech luxuries that James Bond would be proud of . Robert, 54, a builder and developer, bought the building that stood on the site – an unprepossessing office block – shortly before the couple got together in 2009. He didn’t give much thought to it before they set off on a two-year, round-the-world trip, so it was in Majorca that he finally sketched plans for a wildly futuristic home. ‘I had seen some wonderful modern houses when I lived in Jersey a few years back,’ he says, leading the way up the drive as the electric gates shut behind us. ‘I’d also seen showpiece new homes like Thunderbirds and Bowie in Sandbanks, Dorset, where all the football stars live, so I had a general idea of what I wanted.’ Irish slate and European oak in the exterior walls give a hint of opulence, but it is when you cross the threshold that you see what this house is all about. Couple (pictured, Lisa) spent less than £1million building the house and are confident a buyer will snap up the property for its asking price of £1.45million . A spiral staircase twirls upwards, and mirrors in the style of the James Bond logo, etched with Welcome To Moonacre (a play on Bond film Moonraker), create an 007 vibe. We turn into the kitchen, with its white central island and enormous units Robert bought for £35,000 at a Grand Designs show. Then he leads us into the drawing room. The high-tech house is called Moonacre, a play on the Bond film Moonraker which starred Roger Moore as 007 . ‘Seeing the old offices was surreal,’ he says. ‘Pens were left on the tables, coffee cups were half drunk, jackets had been left on the chairs; there were even personal files left behind. It was like taking over the Marie Celeste.’ Upstairs, the master bedroom has everything but a Bond girl in situ, while the children’s rooms – for Daisy-May, one, and Frankie, two – lead on to a terrace enclosed by unbreakable glass. But the room where you can most easily see Bond relaxing with a shaken-not-stirred cocktail is the nightclub. With a karaoke machine, kitchen, disco lights and wood-burning fireplace, this room attracted the most attention on May The Best House Win. Mention of it brings a Bond-villain smile to Robert’s lips. ‘It was funny,’ he says. ‘Lisa must have spent two grand on entertaining the crew and competitors. She hired a white grand piano, brought in cocktail waiters and caterers, the lot. The prize was half that, and then she came third behind a terrace house and a man whose house was a kind of Santa’s grotto.’ Nevertheless, creating this 7,000 sq ft home has been a shrewd investment. Robert picked up the site ‘for a song’ and spent less than £1,000,000 on the build. One offer of the full asking price of £1,450,000 has fallen through, but he is sure it won’t take long to find a buyer for his Bond fantasy-house with its gardens and acre of paddocks. ‘Since the recession, the Government has encouraged people to build on brownfield sites,’ he says. ‘There are still lots of unused office blocks. Just go for it.’ Moonacre is for sale at £1,450,000 with jackson-stops.co.uk, 01625 540340.","Robert and Lisa Foden filled their Cheshire home with high-tech luxuries .

"Kerry, a green-eyed, crimson-lipped beauty with suspiciously smooth skin and a full bust, looks like a woman with something to hide. And she is: Kerry is actually a 52-year-old heterosexual man wearing a latex mask and full bodysuit to emulate a woman. Kerry is part of a subculture known as 'female masking' that until very recently has remained relatively unheard of, even among dedicated cross-dressers. Male enthusiasts don elaborate latex or silicone masks and bodysuits complete with breasts to become glamorous female alter-egos. Scroll down for video . Behind the mask: A masker for decades, Kerry's unmasked life is that of a married man . Married man Kerry, from Seattle, has been . fascinated by masks ever since he saw an episode of Mission: Impossible . in 1970 depicting actresses wearing masks to impersonate other . characters. At 15, he tells The Atlantic, he began wearing female masks, at first from local costume shops, and later self-made latex creations. 'It'd be one thing to disguise myself as a guy, but I'd still be a guy,' he told the Atlantic of his initial desire to wear a mask. 'But if I could disguise myself as a woman that would be a total transformation.' With the advent of the internet, Kerry found a community of like-minded female maskers and realized he wasn't alone. Finding other female maskers not only provided Kerry with a community, it launched a whole new career. Lady in red: Kerry says that many men enjoy female masking but that it's a taboo even among the cross-dressing community . Plastic fantastic: The 'Jessica' full head and torso silicone mask with foam breast inserts costs $600 . He began selling his realistic masks to other men, and became so successful that he was able to leave his day job as a printer and create his own business in mask-making. For about $500, a mask and body suit including foam-stuffed breasts can be purchased from Kerry's website. His wife of 12 years, he says, thinks his obsession is 'weird.' 'She doesn't have anything to do with it. Once in a while she might help me with something but it's not really her thing,' he told the Atlantic. And while his masking has a sexual element to it, he says that his wife is not into it, and he is OK with that. 'It's one of those things where we all sort of have fantasies, scenarios we'd like to do but I think the reality would be really, really disappointing. So probably better not to try that,' he said. Write caption here . 'In a way I don't want to fetishize my wife. You know, I have sex with my wife because I love her. And I don't want to turn her into a sex object, if that makes any sense at all. Because the mask is a fetish object, that's the only thing it really exists for.' Female masking, while taboo even among the cross-dressing community, has managed to reach the edges of popular culture. Photographer Steven Meisel even shot model Carolyn Murphy in a mask of Italian Vogue in 2012 after stumbling across the fetish online. A British documentary called Secrets of the Living Dolls that screened earlier this year featured female maskers from all walks of life. Unlike transgender people, ‘maskers’, or ‘rubber dollers’ as they’re also known, do not feel born in the wrong body. For them, dressing up as a member of the opposite sex is a simply a way to have fun. A new Channel 4 documentary, Secrets of the Living Dolls, will reveal the lives of 'maskers' - men dressed in an elaborate body suit designed to make them look like the glamorous women they are not . ‘They’re not freaky people, they’re not weird, they’re just like you and me,’ explains Barbie Ramos, the owner of Femskin, a company that makes the $850 (approximately £518) custom-made silicone outfits worn by maskers. ‘They’re just like what they call “vanilla people” - that’s you and me - except for at night or on special occasions, they like to put on a mask. Why not?’ Her son Adam, who also works at Femskin, adds: ‘I don't think it would be fair to call them gay or even attracted to other men.’ ‘It's about fun. A lot of men have fun by pretending to be women. Not all of them even want to be hot. Some want to be nasty hags.’ Unlike transgender people, 'maskers' do not feel born in the wrong body - it's just their way of having fun . One masker who has no interest in being a nasty hag is Robert, who following a painful divorce, has spent the last 12 years dressing up as Sherry, a 40-ish buxom blonde. Robert . is one of a growing number of men for whom time off means time spent . dressed in an elaborate body suit, complete with breasts and a vagina, . designed to make them look like the glamorous women they are not. But while many of the maskers who appear in Channel 4 documentary say it’s all about having fun; for 70-year-old Robert, matters don’t appear quite so simple. 'That's why I do this,’ he breathes as he pouts at his reflection in the bathroom mirror, ‘because I think I look amazing. ‘I just can't believe that's a 70-year-old man in the mirror and that's why I do this,’ he continues. ‘If I saw a 70-year-old man in the mirror I would quit this tomorrow. ‘ . Asked what he sees when he looks at his dolled up reflection, he replies: 'An exciting looking female,’ adding: ‘If I saw a woman like this and she asked me to go hang out, I'd say yeah. ‘ . For him, the appeal of Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that for him, dating real women has been something of a disappointment. ‘You see, after all, I'm 70 years old and I've tried dating, and when I'm dating, the women I meet are generally 55 to well up into their 60s,’ he explains. ‘Some of them are in really good shape for their age but they don't look anything like this and it's very difficult to date when you have this to come home to.’ But not every masker has a troubled love life. For Joel, a British bartender who lives with his girlfriend, Mel, dressing up is all about escapism. Robert, finds that the appeal of dressing as Sherry seems to lie partly in the fact that for him, dating real women has been something of a disappointment . Joel, a British bartender who lives with his girlfriend and goes by the female name of 'Jessie' dresses up for escapism . ‘I get enjoyment out of it, I get a sense of escapism out of it,’ he reveals. ‘I'm just out to have fun. It's like the extension of another persona within me that just wants to go out and have fun. ‘The conundrum is people ask: “What do you do when you get dressed up?” And the answer is: not much. ‘Sometimes I just take photos to put up on masking websites, other times it just happens to be who I want to be that day.’ Secrets of the Living Dolls will air tonight at 10pm on Channel 4 . But Joel’s masking career hasn’t always gone smoothly. While girlfriend Mel is happy to accept his alter-ego Jessie, he spent 15 years hiding her from his parents – and from his neighbors. ‘I wouldn't walk 20 steps down the road dressed as a doll because I know general society in the area we live in would be very, very against it,’ he explains. ‘Who knows what could happen?’ One masker who is far less reticent about his hobby is Jon, a Minneapolis father-of-six who works as a forklift driver in a warehouse. According to Jon, not only does masking make him feel good, it also helps him to bond with his daughters. ‘I try to find ways to fit in and be involved with the daughters, and that sometimes means make-up and fingernails and things like that as well,’ he explains. ‘You don't have to have your guard up and necessarily be afraid of other people if you want to dress in a way that makes you feel really good. ‘One guy in particular that I trust at work - he knows that I put on the boobies!’ But not everyone is quite so understanding. Jon’s wife Sunny is his second, met and wed after his first marriage broke up because of his penchant for rubber dolling. ‘This does affect my relationships because I make my priorities and sometimes other people are not happy about my choices,’ he admits. So is it all worth it? Jon’s friend ‘Vanessa’, a 56-year-old who is also father of six, thinks it is. ‘When I'm in my male mode, I go out in public and I just blend in,’ he confesses. ‘When I walk down the street, people don't pay any attention to me. ‘But when I dress up, put this mask on and the wig, it's like being a beautiful woman walking down the street. ‘You become one of the beautiful people and you draw a lot of attention, and attention is not something I've had a lot of.’","A subculture known as 'female masking' is thriving online .

"Dutch authorities are recalling some 50,000 tons of meat sold as beef across Europe that may contain horse meat. Today Britain’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) confirmed that the meat did come to factories supplying supermarkets in the UK, and said it was trying to establish how much. The vast recall came as officials named Dutch firm Wiljo Import en Export B.V. and Vleesgroothandel Willy Selten B.V. as those who supplied the meat. The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority said 370 different companies around Europe and 132 more in the Netherlands were affected by the recall because they bought meat from two Dutch trading companies. Beef... or is it?  Today's news about the dubious meat coming out of Holland is the latest of several food scandals . The food authority said in a statement that because the exact source of the meat cannot be traced 'its safety cannot be guaranteed', and said the Dutch authorities had 'no concrete indications that there is a risk to public health'. Miss Filon said the recall covers meat dating back from the very beginning of 2011 up to February 15 this year, when the companies at the heart of the recall were placed under heightened scrutiny and faced criminal investigations. She conceded that - because the recall dates back more than two years - some of the meat 'may already have been consumed'. The British FSA said: ‘We have been informed by . the Dutch authorities that a small number of UK businesses may . potentially have received products from the company implicated in their . investigation. 'The FSA is following up with these businesses as a matter . of urgency to determine if they have received products from the Dutch . company.’ The suspect shipments began in January 2011, according to the European . Commission. A spokesman said: ‘At this stage, the origin of the meat is . unknown but the Netherlands authorities acknowledged that horse meat had . been mixed with beef.’ Other countries known to have bought the affected meat include France, Germany and Spain. Miss Filon said authorities were bound by law to recall the meat if it is unclear where exactly it came from. She said: 'If meat has an unclear source then the law - the general food law - says it is no longer fit for human or animal food.' Dutch authorities began a large-scale investigation into the country's meat industry in February after the horse meat scandal broke across Europe. This afternoon's shock news is just the latest scandal in a long list concerning the dubious origins of some foodstuffs. Supermarket giant Asda recalled all corned beef from its budget range last month after trace of a horse drug were found . Yesterday, the Food Standards Agency said that the veterinary painkilling drug phenylbutazone - or bute - had been found in Asda Smart Price Corned Beef. Asda had already withdrawn tens of thousands of its own brand corned beef last month after it was found to contain up to 50 per cent horsemeat. The supermarket giant removed the £1.54 products from stores across Britain on March 8 - and tests this week showed quantities of horse DNA above trace levels. Leicestershire County Council found the ingredients of one batch of the 340g tins were half horse, but Leeds-based Asda has insisted it only found levels of up to five per cent. Asda, which last month said it had carried out more than 700 tests on products during the horsemeat scandal, has had eight products that have been positive for at least traces of horse. A spokesman for Asda said the chain has 'taken a belt and braces approach' to testing for horse DNA and quickly removed any products from its shelves 'whenever we've had any concerns'. Andrew Rhodes, director of operations . at the Food Standards Agency, acknowledged it takes time to test for . bute once horsemeat is found in a product. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today . programme, he said: 'What we have found in this positive test result is a . very low level of (bute)... which is only really just above the limit . of detection. 'It's very unlikely to (do harm). As . the chief medical officer has said... it's extremely rare people have an . adverse reaction to phenylbutazone. 'This is considerably lower than a . therapeutic dose and you would have to consume enormous quantities of . meat, way more than anyone could physically consume, to get near a . therapeutic dose.' Mr Rhodes said it was important to understand how the product came to be contaminated and how it came to have bute in it. 'If someone has done something which . is illegal, and not taken due measures to prevent that happening, then . they can face sanctions,' he said. 'But we need to determine exactly . what has happened in this case before we can determine whether that will . happen or not - which is true of any of the cases we have seen.' Supermarket: The Walmart-owned chain with 500-plus stores, whose Smart Price Corned Beef is manufactured by French supplier Toupnot, has also scraped its Chosen By You Corned Beef line (file picture) The Walmart-owned chain with 500-plus . stores, whose Smart Price Corned Beef is manufactured by French . supplier Toupnot, has also scraped its Chosen By You Corned Beef line. Europe's horsemeat scandal erupted in . January, when testing in Ireland revealed that some beef products also . contained equine DNA, and the problems then spread across the continent. The scandal ensnared numerous . well-known brands, prompting product withdrawals, consumer concerns and . government investigations into the region's complex food-processing . chains. City of London Police fraud experts . will lead the probe into the horsemeat scandal, co-ordinating the . response to what ministers have claimed is an international criminal . conspiracy. In the Commons last month, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson described the . adulteration of food products with horsemeat as a 'criminal conspiracy . which covers 23 countries'. Ade McKeon, Asda's director responsible for the quality of all the store's branded products, said: 'I know our customers will be just as concerned about this news as we are. Even at such a low level, it is totally unacceptable. 'I can reassure our customers that we are working closely with the FSA and our suppliers to deliver a wide ranging and rigorous programme of testing, to be sure that the products we sell are exactly what it says on the label.' Andrew Rhodes, director of operations . at the Food Standards Agency . An Asda spokesman said: 'We have taken an extremely cautious approach since the very beginning . and have carried out more than 700 tests, moving swiftly to remove any . products from our shelves whenever we’ve had the smallest concerns. 'Our . commitment to you is to continue to test our products regularly and . update you with the very latest news as soon as we can. 'In March 2013 we withdrew tinned Smart Price Corned Beef (340g) after receiving a positive test for horse DNA above the one per cent trace level set by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). 'Today, 9th April 9, tests on further batches have shown a positive . result for very low levels of horse medication called phenylbutazone, . also known as bute, at four parts per billion. 'The FSA has reassured us that the . quantities we’ve found pose a low risk to human health. They say: ""Bute . is not allowed to enter the food chain; however, even if people have . eaten products which contain contaminated horse meat, the risk to health . is very low."" 'Although there is a very low health risk, we are recalling this . product. This simply means that we ask anyone who has tinned Smart Price . Corned Beef (340g) in their cupboards at home to bring it back into . store for a full refund. 'The tinned Chosen By You Corned Beef (340g) product, also withdrawn . in March, has not tested positive for phenylbutazone. However as a . precaution it is also being recalled as it is made in the same factory. 'We want you to have complete confidence in the food you buy at Asda . and we are happy to refund any product you’re not 100 per cent happy with.' A spokesman for the FSA said: 'The Food Standards Agency has been informed by Asda that very low levels of the veterinary medicine phenylbutazone, known as bute, have been found in 340g tins of its Smart Price Corned Beef.

"The Islamist militia which today took a second major city in Iraq and is turning its eyes south towards the capital Baghdad is so ruthless and extreme that even al-Qaeda has cut ties and distances itself from them. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Isis), used to be part of the international terror network, but was cast out in February this year in light of its violent behaviour towards rival jihadist groups. It is famed - and feared - for spreading hardline Islamic law to the areas it subdues. Transgressors are sentenced to death and swiftly executed in public, their bodies left to decay in the streets. Marauding: Isis militants are seen above, allegedly outside the city of Tikrit, which fell today to their forces . Extreme: The fighters were once part of al-Qaeda, which has cut ties with the group. They have now taken control of Saddam Hussein's home town . Tensions: The Isis fighters are from the Sunni branch of Islam - as was Saddam Hussein - in contrast to the current Shia government . This treatment has even been doled out against other jihadist leaders, who have been assassinated in a brutal struggle over strategy in the Middle East. Young jihadists are increasingly drawn to Isis over less extreme groups - particularly in the light of their rapid military progress through Iraq. In the past two days the group has overrun the northern city of Mosul, and today also took Tikrit, the hometown of executed Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein. In February, the leader of al-Qaeda issued a statement dissociating itself from Isis, which it accused of 'forbidden bloodshed' directed at fellow fighters. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's chief, cut ties after Isis attempted to bolster its strength by merging with other rebels in Syria. Punishment: Two men in Raqqa, Syria, were crucified this April for allegedly killing an Isis fighter . Brutal: The images, which could not be independently verified, appear to demonstrate Isis's uncompromising brand of hardline Islamist justice . He said: 'We weren't informed about its creation, nor counselled. Nor are we satisfied with it: rather we ordered it to stop... Nor is al–Qaeda responsible for its actions and behaviour.' The organisation is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a U.S. bounty of $10million on his head, second only to al-Zawahiri. The ISIS leader, who was born in 1971 in Baghdad, is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician. Violent and mysterious: This undated photograph is one of only a few in existence showing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of Isis . Baghdadi, who has a degree in Islamic studies, apparently joined the insurgency that erupted in Iraq soon after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. He was taken as a prisoner of the Americans in Camp Bucca between 2005 and 2007 - it was here that one of the only two photos know to be in existence was taken of him. He is known as 'The Ghost' to members of the pro-Assad Lebanese Shi-ite militia Hizballah. The secretive Baghdadi talks with a scarf covering his face even when dealing with close allies, according to militants who worked with him in Iraq. He addresses his ISIS followers through audio recordings posted to the internet, rather than in public places. Military sources have reported his death on numerous occasions in the past years, but the fighter always seems to reappear. This has led to speculation that al-Baghdadi is in fact a name used jointly by several commanders. Some estimates claim Isis group has in excess of 10,000 fighting men in its ranks. Many of its fighters are thought to be radicalised Western Muslims who have poured in from Europe and North American to join the fighting in Syria and elsewhere. The group, which controls large areas of land in Syria, is thought to be pouring resources and money from those areas into its burgeoning Iraqi campaign, which has seen it tear through the northern regions on the country. Its military progress, largely unhindered by Iraq's own security forces, have given it control over several highly valuable oil fields, which leaders will hope to exploit to strengthen their hand. Carnage: Isis fighters devastated Mosul, to the north of the country, on Monday. Pictured is a member of the Iraqi security forced gunned down by the militants . Strewn: Uniforms though to belong to Iraqi soldiers were seen scattered on the road in Mosul - Iraq's second city - in this smartphone image from the conflict . The situation has alarmed officials in Turkey, who called an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors after 80 of its citizens were taken hostage by Isis. 'Turkey briefed the other allies on the situation in (the Iraqi city of) Mosul and the hostage-taking of Turkish citizens, including the consul general,' a NATO official said. He said the meeting was held for informational purposes and not under Article 4 of NATO's founding treaty, which permits a member of the 28-nation alliance to ask for consultations with other allies when it feels its security is threatened. Turks seized included 48 from the . consulate in Mosul - including the consul-general and three children. Separately, 28 truck drivers who were delivering diesel to a power plant . were captured on Monday. Territory: The above map shows the areas of Iraq and Syria currently controlled by Isis forces . Meanwhile, Baghdad residents were stockpiling food, fuel and weaponry in anticipation of an attack on the capital in the coming days. Prime Minister Maliki has previously encouraged ordinary Iraqis to take up arms against the advancing soldiers of Isis, especially in light of claims that members of the police and military are intentionally defecting. Senior sources in the Iraqi government have said that they have a plan to take back Mosul, but were unclear on the details. Isis is pushing to expand its territory, which currently straddles the border between Syria and Iraq, and includes land extremely close to the Turkish border. The group's centre of power is Raqqa, a city in northern Syria, which is being run under the regime's oppressive and violent code. Raqqa was heavily contested throughout the Syrian conflict, and was held by several rebel groups until Isis threw out all other contenders in 2013. Recently Isis leaders imposed punitive rules on the city's Christian population, demanding that they pay a levy of gold for 'protection' else face being killed on the streets for their faith. Horrifying images have also emerged from the cities of crucifixions being used to punish men who attacked Isis fighters. Seven men were sentenced to death after a grenade was thrown at a soldier near a roundabout in Raqqa. The men, who were riding motorbikes, were then hunted down by Isis forces, according to a statement from the group. Two of the men were sentenced to die by crucifixion. One of the two was wrapped in a banner, which said: 'This man fought against Muslims and threw  a grenade in this place.'","Fighters from Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) took two Iraqi cities .

"The Terracotta Warriors are described as one of the 8th wonders of the world, but the life-size figures created over 2,200 years ago, were inspired by artwork by the ancient Greeks, one expert claims. Lukas Nickel believes it is ‘likely’ the 8,000 giant sculptures, which were buried in pits close to the mausoleum of Qin Shi Huangdi, were the result of contact between Greece and China. He cites newly translated ancient records that tell of giant statues appearing in the West, which inspired Qin Shi Huangdi, as evidence that the warriors of the First Emperor were based on 12 earlier life-size statues. Lukas Nickel believes it is 'likely' the 8,000 giant sculptures of Terracotta Warriors (pictured), which were buried in pits close to the mausoleum of Qin Shi Huangdi, were the result of contact between Greece and China . The Terracotta Army is a form of funerary art buried with the First Emperor in 210 to 209 BC and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife. Arguably the most famous archaeological site in the world, it was discovered by chance by villagers in 1974, and excavation has been on-going at the site since that date. An extraordinary feat of mass-production, each figure was given an individual personality although they were not intended to be portraits. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals. Current estimates are that there were over 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried. Since 1998, figures of terracotta acrobats, bureaucrats, musicians and bronze birds have been discovered on site. They were designed to entertain the Emperor in his afterlife they are of crucial importance to our understanding of his attempts to control the world even in death. ‘It is perfectly possible and actually likely that the sculptures of the First Emperor are the result of early contact between Greece and China,’ Dr Nickel, a reader at the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies, told LiveScience. Before the time of the First Emperor, there were no life-size figurines created in China and he thinks the idea came from Alexander the Great’s campaigns. The records, which Dr Nickel translated, reveal the statues were around 38ft tall (11.5m) and impressed the Emperor who built duplicates of them in bronze. The bronzes no longer exist as they were destroyed after the death of the First Emperor. However, a number of writers of the time documented the statues' existence, Dr Nickel wrote in the journal Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies. 'It is perfectly possible and actually likely that the sculptures of the First Emperor are the result of early contact between Greece and China,' Dr Nickel said. A carved marble relief of wrestlers is pictured . Before the time of the First Emperor, there were no life sized figurines created in China . Records suggest there were links between China and Greece and that sculptors were influenced by Greek culture. Dr Nickel believes statues of semi naked acrobats and dancers, which were found in another pit close to the mausoleum, are so realistic as sculptors learned from Greek masters, who collectively took centuries to perfect such realism in their sculptures and etchings. He wrote: 'The [Chinese] sculptors attempted to render a bone structure, muscles and sinews to depict a person in movement. ‘This comes close to an understanding of the human body that was employed at the time only in Hellenistic (Greek influenced) Europe and Asia.’ However, while Dr Nickel believes he might have solved the inspiration behind the Terracotta Warriors, it remains a mystery why rulers of the Han Dynasty stopped making large sculptures and instead swapped to miniatures. He suggests that the craftsmen who mastered how to build the huge figurines might have died without passing their skills on to the next generation, or that it was thought to be unlucky to replicate foreign models.","A School of Oriental and African Studies expert believes it is ‘likely’ the 8,000 giant sculptures were the result of contact between Greece and China .

"A total of . 13 aircraft suddenly vanished off radars for about 25 minutes on two . occasions while flying over Austria, it has been revealed. In . what is being billed as 'unprecedented' circumstances, the incidents on June 5 and yesterday saw the flight data disappear from air controller screens. Austria's . flight safety organisation admitted that the height, location and other . information for a total of 13 aircraft mysteriously vanished from radars. 'Unprecedented': The planes disappeared from radars over Austria. Pictured, air traffic controllers in Zurich . Investigation: Data for the planes disappeared as they were flying over Austria and other European countries . Air traffic control monitors airspace using two radar systems: primary and secondary - which is the main system used worldwide for controlling aircraft. The primary radar detects and measures the approximate position of aircraft using radio signals. The secondary radar, which relies on targets being equipped with a transponder, also requests additional information from the aircraft - such as its identity and altitude. All commercial aircraft are equipped with transponders, which automatically transmit a unique four-digit code when they receive a radio signal sent by radar. The code gives the plane's identity and radar stations go on to establish speed and direction. This flight data is then relayed to air traffic controllers. However, once an aircraft is more than 240km (150 miles) out to sea, radar coverage fades and high-frequency radio is used by air crew to keep in touch with those on the ground. GPS is only used by pilots to show their own position on a map, and these signals are not relayed to air traffic control. The 'Black Box' contains a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder. They emit ultrasonic waves, but have limited range, and don't use GPS. It is believed that some of the planes were long-haul flights carrying passengers on board. Markus Pohanka, a spokesman for Austro Control, said relevant EU agencies have been asked to investigate the 'unprecedented' situation. He . added that other unnamed neighbouring countries had similar incidents . and the EU's Eurocontrol, and European Aviation Safety Agency has been . asked for a probe. Pohanka . did not identify the other nations that the European flights were flying . over when they disappeared from secondary surveillance radars. However, a report in the Kurier . newspaper . said as well as in Vienna in Austria, flight controllers in Munich and Karlsruhe in Germany, and in . Prague, the Czech Republic, and Bratislava in Slovakia also reported related problems. The report said German air traffic control had confirmed the black outs, adding that the reason there were no collisions was due to the air traffic controllers. It could have had dramatic consequences, as 4,000 planes take to the sky in Austria every day - with 50 in the air at any one time, according to the report. Air traffic was conducted 'blind' - by voice only - during the temporary outage, it claimed. The . revelations echo the circumstances surrounding missing Malaysia . Airlines flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing which disappeared on . March 8. The . Boeing 777 - with 239 passengers and crew on board - vanished from . civilian radar screens about an hour into the night flight. The search for the flight - which involves countries including the UK, the US, Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand - has so far recovered nothing. In relation to the 13 missing flights about Europe, Kurier . cited unnamed experts as saying interference between the aircrafts' transponders and ground control was apparently to blame. Map of locations over Europe which have reportedly experienced flight data black outs . Pohanka . declined to confirm that or to say which airlines and planes were . involved. But he suggested that at least some may have been . long-distance passenger aircraft, based on their high altitudes. There was no danger at any time, he said. Pohanka . said extra air controllers immediately were called to their posts and . emergency measures, including establishing voice contact with the pilots . and widening flight corridors, were put into effect. The EU’s Eurocontrol and European Aviation Safety Agency will investigate the incidents. Missing: The news echoes the surroundings of the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared in March. Pictured, Malaysia Airlines aircraft parked on the tarmac at Kuala Lumpur International Airport . Pohanka said that safety in the Austrian air space was guaranteed at all times. He told MailOnline Travel: 'There is no situation in aviation where there is not another procedure that takes place. 'We noticed that some of the responder data sent from the plane to the ground disappeared for a short period of time from the radar screens. 'That is the reason why the contingency procedures were put into place. 'Voice communication guaranteed that we knew everything about the planes in Austrian air space and allowed air traffic controllers to do their jobs. 'Distance between aircraft was increased.' When asked what had caused the black out, Pohanka said no error was indicated on the operating system, but they would have to wait to hear the results of the investigation.","The incidents on June 5 and 12 saw flight data disappear .

From stunning stretches of Africa to a hefty chunk of Antarctica, FEMAIL rounds up the stunning spots with a very royal namesake. QUEEN ELIZABETH NATIONAL PARK - UGANDA . One of the loveliest of Uganda's national parks, Queen Elizabeth opened in 1954 and covers 764 square miles. Along with the 'big five' (lions, leopards, elephants, buffalo and giraffe), the park has an abundance of warthogs and Uganda Kob antelopes, as well as hippos and crocodiles who live in the Kazinga Channel that cuts through the park. In total, 95 species of mammal and more than 500 types of bird live in the park, including a rare group of tree-climbing lions who live near Ishasha in the southern reaches. QUEEN ELIZABETH RANGES - CANADA . Part of the Canadian Rockies, the Queen Elizabeth Ranges occupy the southeastern side of Jasper National Park in Alberta. The stretch, which got its royal moniker to mark the coronation in 1953, includes some impressively large peaks, the biggest of which is Mount Unwin. QUEEN ELIZABETH LAND . The UK's Antarctic territory, Queen Elizabeth Land is nearly twice the size of Britain and covers an impressive 169,000sqm. Bordered by the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, much of Queen Elizabeth Land is icy tundra, with Emperor Penguins and Weddell Seals among the local residents. Australia's Antarctic territory is also named after the Queen but was given its name prior to the Coronation and is known as Princess Elizabeth Land. PORT ELIZABETH - ST VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES . The capital of Bequia, the second-largest island in the Grenadines island chain, Port Elizabeth was given its name in 1952 when the Queen ascended to the throne. Perched on the edge of the beautiful Admiralty Bay, the harbour is home to the St Vincent Docks - the main source of commerce on the island - as well as a small market. QUEEN ELIZABETH ISLANDS - CANADA . The most northerly cluster of islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Queen Elizabeth Islands were renamed in 1953 to mark the Queen's coronation. Covering 161,000sqm, the islands are home to 14 per cent of the world's total number of ice caps and glaciers, and have a population of 400 people. Despite the tiny population, many of the islands are among the world's largest, among them Ellesmere Island which at 75,767sqm is the world's 10th largest island - one behind the UK which is ninth.","The Queen has officially opened Heathrow's new Terminal 2 .

"Hedge-fund owner Alan Howard has made what is thought to be the biggest single donation to help children in state education . One of Britain’s richest men has given £5million for state school pupils to be taught by teachers from private schools. Hedge-fund owner Alan Howard has made what is thought to be the biggest single donation to help children in state education. The money will be used to offer subjects including classics or Russian more often found in private schools. It will also allow lessons from some of the country's best-known institutions to beam lessons into classrooms in state schools. Mr Howard, estimated to be worth £1.6billion, has given the money to the United Learning Partnership Fund. Private schools involved in the scheme include St Paul's School, attended by Chancellor George Osborne and Marlborough College, the old school of the Duchess of Cambridge. Others signed up include RGS Guildford, James Allen's Girls School, Manchester Grammar School and Bolton School. They will work mostly-urban academy schools which are already sponsored by United Learning. Mr Howard, a co-founder of the Brevan Howard hedge fund, said: ‘Students deserve the best, especially when it comes to education. ‘I am very pleased to support a visionary team of educators who have developed an innovative approach to encouraging students to aim high while providing them the tools to achieve their goals. ‘The team is committed to do what it takes to make this project a great success and I am honoured to be backing their efforts.’ The fund will focus on distance learning, allowing specialist teachers from private schools to pass on their expertise using technology.

Marlborough College (left) and St Paul's School are among the private schools which have signed up to take part in the project . The Duchess of Cambridge is a former pupil at Marlborough College, while Chancellor George Osborne went to St Paul's . There will also be opportunities for pupils from state and private schools to attend cultural and sporting events together. Clusters of schools will also be offered help to improve access to top universities, including residential events for the most able students to prepare their university application. Jon Coles, the charity’s chief executive said: ‘We are indebted to the generosity of Alan Howard for his remarkable gift to us which will benefit teachers and students from across our schools and academies and far beyond. ‘This is an opportunity to do something unique in UK schools and provide training for staff across the board and give young people the advantages of exceptional enrichment experiences.’ Fiona Boulton, headmistress of Guildford High School said: ‘This funding demonstrates a multi-million commitment to assisting staff and children at all types of school from benefitting from shared training, development and pupil experience. We are delighted to be part of this. ‘The benefits of such a partnership work both ways. Being part of a group of both independent schools and academies, we already learn and share so much with our colleagues. To have a greater opportunity to do so, and with other schools, is wonderful.’","Alan Howard makes biggest single donation to help state schoolchildren .

"Going to work on a high protein breakfast of eggs and steak could help you stay slim . A high protein breakfast of eggs and steak could help you stay slim and stop dieters snacking at night, scientists say. Experts at the University of Missouri have found that a breakfast rich in protein significantly . improves appetite control and reduces unhealthy snacking on high-fat or . high-sugar foods in the evening. But according to research some 60 per cent of American young people consistently skip 'the most important meal of the day.' Now, Heather Leidy, an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology says a proper breakfast could hold the key to solving the American obesity crises, which currently sees more than 25 million overweight or obese young adults in the U.S. Leidy is the first to examine the impact of breakfast consumption on daily appetite and evening snacking in young people who habitually skip breakfast. In her study, 20 overweight or obese adolescent females ages 18-20 either skipped breakfast, consumed a high-protein breakfast consisting of eggs and lean beef, or ate a normal-protein breakfast of ready-to-eat cereal. Every breakfast consisted of 350 calories and was matched for dietary fat, fiber, sugar and energy density. The high-protein breakfast contained 35 grams of protein. Participants completed questionnaires and provided blood samples throughout the day. Prior to dinner, a brain scan using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed to track brain signals that control food motivation and reward-driven eating behavior. Experts at the University of Missouri have found that a breakfast rich in protein - such as lean beef - significantly improves appetite control and reduces unhealthy snacking in the evening . Surprisingly, the tests found that food such as Mexican burritos (left) could be more likely to help you stay slim than breakfast cereals such as muesli (right) The consumption of the high-protein . breakfast led to increased fullness or 'satiety' along with reductions . in brain activity that is responsible for controlling food cravings. The . high-protein breakfast also reduced evening snacking on high-fat and . high-sugar foods compared to when breakfast was skipped or when a normal . protein, ready-to-eat cereal breakfast was consumed, Leidy said. 'Eating a protein-rich breakfast impacts the drive to eat later in the day, when people are more likely to consume high-fat or high-sugar snacks' Leidy said. Protein-rich foods tend to make people feel fuller than foods rich in carbohydrates or fat, causing a knock-on effect on appetite. Experts say this minimising effect on hunger, helps to reduce overall energy intake. Diets rich in protein at the expense of carbohydrates have been associated with slightly greater losses of weight in the short term compared with the recommended high-carbohydrate, low-fat eating plans. 'These data suggest that eating a protein-rich breakfast is one potential strategy to prevent overeating and improve diet quality by replacing unhealthy snacks with high quality breakfast foods.' People who normally skip breakfast might be skeptical about consuming food in the morning, but Leidy says it only takes about three days for the body to adjust to eating early in the day. Study participants ate egg and beef-based foods such as burritos or egg-based waffles with applesauce and a beef sausage patty as part of a high-protein breakfast; Leidy also suggests eating plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese or ground pork loin as alternatives to reach the 35 grams of protein. Future research will examine whether regularly consuming high-protein breakfasts improves body weight management in young people. The article, 'Beneficial effects of a higher-protein breakfast on the appetitive, hormonal, and neural signals controlling energy intake regulation in overweight/obese, 'breakfast skipping,' late-adolescent girls,' was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology is a joint effort by MU's College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources; College of Human Environmental Sciences; and School of Medicine. Funding for the research was provided by the Beef Check-off and the Egg Nutrition Center/American Egg Board.","60 per cent of American young people skip 'most important meal of day'

"Nokia has unveiled a new smartphone with a 41-megapixel camera in its latest bid to catch up with rivals Apple and Samsung after years of poor sales. The Lumia 1020 runs the Windows Phone 8 operating system and has a second-generation version of the high-quality camera the Finnish phone maker first added to its PureView 808 phone last year. It is the best smartphone camera on the market with five times more megapixels than the iPhone 5 and 2.5 times more than Samsung's 16MP camera on its S4 Zoom. Scroll down for demo . Nokia has unveiled the Lumia 1020 smartphone, pictured, in a bid to rival Apple and Samsung. It runs Windows Phone 8 and has an enhanced version of the 41MP camera first added to Nokia's PureView 808 last year - almost five times the megapixels of the iPhone 5 . Operating system: Windows Phone 8 . Display: 4.5"" AMOLED WXGA (1280x768), PureMotion HD+, high brightness mode, sunlight readability . Battery: 2000 mAh battery . Processor: 1.5 GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 . Main camera: PureView 41 MP with optical image stabilisation . Resolution: 7712 x 5360 includes Nokia Pro Camera, Xenon flash for still images, LED flash for video . Front-facing camera: 1.2 MP wide angle . Memory: 2GB RAM, 32 GB internal memory; . Cloud storage: 7 GB free SkyDrive storage . The Lumia 1020's camera also comes with up to 6x digital zoom that can capture 'more details than other smartphone cameras.' This means pictures can be zoomed into and reframed without any of the image quality being lost. Speaking at the launch event in New York, Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop said the handset - which is available in yellow, black and white - can capture pictures and video of 'amazing quality and amazing clarity'. 'Today I'd like to introduce to you all the next chapter in smartphone photography,' Elop said. 'The Nokia Lumia 1020 will change how you shoot and how you create forever.' The Lumia 1020 uses the PureView technology previously seen on the Nokia 808, 920 and 928. It has optical image stabilisation and the company claims the device 'is able to produce some of the sharpest images possible by any digital camera.' This technology is combined with the Nokia Pro Camera application designed to make it easier for anyone to take professional quality images. The app's interface makes changes to photos in real-time as the shot is taken so photographers can see what the final image will look like. Using a new feature called dual capture, when the Nokia Lumia 1020 takes a high-resolution 38MP image it also takes a smaller 5MP version to make it easier to share online. The Nokia Lumia 1020's 41MP sensor uses ZEISS optics with six lenses that make it possible to take better photos in low-light conditions. The Lumia 1020's camera also comes with up to 6x digital zoom that can capture more details than other smartphone cameras and some digital cameras. This means pictures can be zoomed into and reframed without any of the image quality being lost . This also reduces the amount of blur in video and its Nokia Rich Recording feature 'handles sound pressure levels six times louder than conventional smartphone microphones.' Nokia's latest high-end smartphone was revealed as the Finnish firm battles to arrest a steady decline in demand for its devices and reclaim ground lost to rivals Apple and Samsung. A UK release date for the Lumia 1020 was not confirmed but the phone will be available in the US from July 26, priced at 299.99 dollars (£198) and it is expected in Europe 'this quarter'. A UK release date for the Lumia 1020 has not been confirmed but the phone will be available in the U.S. from 26 July at $299.99 (£198) and is expected in Europe 'this quarter' Tech bloggers responded enthusiastically about the camera and handset, but analysts questioned whether it was enough to help Nokia survive. Nokia is pinning its hopes for a comeback in smartphones on Microsoft's Windows Phone - an operating system struggling to compete with Google's popular Android system. Despite having the high-quality 41MP camera, the PureView 808 failed to live up to expectations and many analysts claimed this was because it was running Nokia's antiquated Symbian system. While regular mobile phones still account for the bulk of Nokia's shipments, smartphones are viewed as crucial for its long-term survival because of their higher margins and increasing demand for web access from mobile phones. Jo Harlow, Nokia's executive vice president in charge of smart devices, said the growing popularity of photo and video sharing meant more consumers will want better cameras. 'Taking pictures is in the top three things people do with a smartphone. It's a relevant feature to be focused on,' she told Reuters. 'To stand out you have to differentiate.' The new Lumia's 41-megapixel count far exceeds those of the iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom, at 8 and 16MP respectively. This is also higher than some compact cameras, although higher megapixels do not necessarily mean better photos as factors such as lens quality also affect the end result. Using a new feature called dual capture, when the Nokia Lumia 1020 takes a high-resolution image or video it also makes a smaller copy to make it easier to share online. The Nokia Lumia 1020's 41MP sensor uses ZEISS optics with six lenses that make it possible to take better shots in low-light conditions . An example of the high-resolution images taken using the 41MP camera on the Nokia 1020 . 'The imaging capabilities here are extraordinary,' said Current Analysis analyst Avi Greengart. But he added: 'It's still a Windows Phone. If somebody is looking for applications they're still going to look at iPhone.' Earlier Lumia models won positive reviews from critics and technology blogs but have failed to halt a shift to Android phones. Android and Apple's iOS together account for over 90 per cent of smartphone sales, according to research firm IDC. One major handicap has been a lack of apps. Windows Phone has only 160,000 apps, while rivals offer about five times as many because developers prefer to make them for the higher-volume operating systems. Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com said: 'The Lumia 1020 truly takes mobile photography to the next level. 'Whether the mother of all cameras will entice phone fans away from Apple and Android devices is questionable, though. 'The popularity of ‘kitchen sink’ devices that deliver a rounded experience in terms of hardware, apps and . services, casts doubt on the 1020’s wider appeal. 'There’s also a bigger issue at hand . here. Looking past the allure of megapixels, Nokia still seems to lack . focus when it comes to an important area – namely the lack of consumer . interest in the Windows Phone platform. 'Nokia is struggling to find its true . identity in a challenging market. At first glance the Lumia 1020 seems a master-of-one it remains . to be seen whether gadget fans will opt for a Windows-powered handset . over increasingly impressive - and diverse - competition.' 'Despite the quality of the device, I . have some serious doubts about whether it will change Nokia's fortunes, . and it risks becoming a niche product,' added IDC analyst Francisco . Jeronimo. He and other . analysts have also said Nokia needs to step up advertising and promotion . of its phones. Many have said telecom carrier partners, particularly in . the United States, have failed to promote Nokia to their customers. 'This . is the first real glimmer of hope for Nokia's resurgence and the . viability of the Windows ecosystem in smartphones - provided Nokia, . Microsoft, and their operator partners can convince consumers that this . experience is indeed a leap forward,' said Forrester Research analyst . Charles Golvin. 'That will be the real hard work.' A UK photojournalist recently embarked on a photography project aimed at showing off the quality of cameras across the Nokia range - especially in low-light conditions. Nick Ray took photographs of various people at night from across the country 'to shed light on their amazing stories that would otherwise go untold or unseen.' All the pictures were taken using Nokia's Lumia 925 phone and included pictures of homeless drug addicts Liverpool, pictures taken backstage at London burlesque club The Box showing performers getting ready, images of Britain’s largest skatepark as sports enthusiasts hurl themselves through the air and a young mother training for a kickboxing championship in Leeds.

According to the rules, the robots could be defensive but could not be designed to destroy the opposing teams’ machines. The winners were a team dubbed ‘40 Piece Chicken McNuggets’ who created two identical rovers that drove instead of flew. In the final round, it came down to the McNuggets and a team called the Cunning Stunts, which used their budget to make three roving robots as well as one flying design. ‘This is where rubber meets the road,’ said Carl Ruoff, instructor of ME72: Engineering Design Laboratory told Pasadena Star-News.

"Scientists have found a new virus thought to be the biggest ever seen on Earth. The virus, dubbed Pandoravirus, is one micrometre big - up to ten times the size of other viruses - and only six per cent of its genes resemble anything seen on Earth before. This has led French researchers to believe the virus may have come from an ancient time or even another planet, such as Mars. Scientists have found a new virus, Pandoravirus (pictured), which is the biggest ever seen on Earth. It is found underwater and is not thought to pose a serious risk to humans . Pandoravirus lives underwater and was found off the coast of Chile and in a pond in Australia. It is thought to have emerged from a new ancestral cellular type that no longer exists. It is about one micrometre meaning it is big enough to be seen under a normal microscope. The virus lacks the regular shape normally associated with viruses. Its genetic code is twice the size of the Megavirus, the biggest virus previously found. Only six per cent of its genes resemble genes seen before on Earth. The giant virus is only found underwater and is not thought to pose a serious risk to humans. However, . the researchers, who published their findings in the journal Science, . believe that the virus opens up a range of questions about the history . of life on Earth. Dr Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University in France, who found the virus, told NPR: ‘We believe that these new Pandoraviruses have emerged from a new ancestral cellular type that no longer exists.’ Many traditional viruses range in size from around 10 nanometres (nm) to around 500nm. The Pandoravirus is around one micrometre big and there are 1,000nm in a micrometre. This means the Pandoravirus is big enough to be seen under the most basic microscopes. Dr Claverie explained that because the virus is very big and lacks the regular shape normally associated with viruses, he initially thought it was a small bacterium. His team went on a hunt for giant viruses after a survey identified signs of them in seawater. The scientists who found the Pandoravirus believe that it could have originated on Mars. Only six per cent of its genes resemble genes seen before in other organisms on Earth . They took sediment samples from the coast off Chile and from a pond in Australia. They took the samples to their . laboratory and put them in a solution packed with antibiotics in an . attempt to kill any bacteria present. The Megavirus, pictured, was previously thought to have been the biggest virus on Earth at 440nm - half the size of the new Pandoravirus . These bacteria-free samples were then exposed to amoebas knowing that if they died, there must be something else in the samples killing them. This proved to be successful and large amounts of Pandoravirus were spawned. When the team studied them they found that their genetic code was twice the size of the Megavirus, which was previously the biggest virus ever found at around 440nm. However, they were in for more of a shock as only six per cent of its genes resembled genes seen before in other organisms on Earth. Dr Claverie told NPR: ‘We believe that those new Pandoraviruses have emerged from a new ancestral cellular type that no longer exists.’ He went on to explain that it is possible that they have come from another planet, such as Mars. The researchers do not yet know why this cellular form became a virus but they speculate that it could have evolved as a survival strategy. Alternatively, its unusual genome could have developed as a result of it picking up genetic material from its hosts. The researchers say that they now expect to find more giant viruses.","The Pandoravirus is one micrometre big - ten times the size of other viruses .

"Attorney General Eric Holder called on states to temporarily pause death penalty executions on Tuesday, until the Supreme Court decides a case about the controversial drug cocktails used for lethal injects in some states. The Supreme Court plans on hearing a case brought up by death row inmates in Oklahoma, who believe the midazolam-based drug cocktail used by the state is a breach of their constitutional protection from 'cruel and unusual punishment'. The death penalty has long been controversial but became an even bigger issue last year with the botched execution of Oklahoma prisoner Clayton Lockett who writhed in pain and clenched his teeth during the 45 minutes it took for him to die from an injection last year. Holder, who will be retiring once his replacement is confirmed, has long opposed the death penalty since it presents the 'inevitable' risk of killing an innocent person. Scroll down for video . Pause: Attorney General Eric Holder wants death penalty executions put on hold until the Supreme Court decides a case on the lethal drugs used in the executions. Pictured above speaking at the National Press Club on Tuesday . 'Our system of justice is the best in the world. It is comprised of men and women who do the best they can, get it right more often than not, substantially more right than wrong,' Holder said at a Tuesday luncheon at the National Press Club. 'There's always the possibility that mistakes will be made ... It's for that reason that I am opposed to the death penalty.' Pending: On Tuesday, the Florida Supreme Court voted to stay the execution of death row inmate Jerry Correll, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision about Oklahoma's drug cocktail . 'I think fundamental questions about the death penalty need to be asked. And among them, the Supreme Court's determination as to whether or not lethal injection is consistent with our Constitution is one that ought to occur,' Holder continued. 'From my perspective, I think a moratorium until the Supreme Court made that determination would be appropriate.' Since Oklahoma uses the same drug combination as other states who enforce the death penalty, the Supreme Court's decision could influence death row practices across the nation. Indeed, Holder's comments came the same day that the Florida State Supreme Court voted to stay the execution of  prisoner Jerry Correll because the state's lethal drug combination is similar to Oklahoma. 'If use of midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug lethal injection protocol is determined to be cruel and unusual — and therefore unconstitutional — then Florida's precedent approving the use of midazolam and the current Florida three-drug protocol will be subject to serious doubt as to its continuing viability,' the court wrote in their decision. 'Without a stay of execution in this case, Florida risks the unconstitutional execution of Correll, for which there is no remedy.' Correll, 59, went to the home of his former mother-in-law, Mary Lou Hines, in June 1985. He was convicted of killing Hines, his ex-wife Susan Correll, her sister Marybeth Jones and the former couple's 5-year-old daughter. Room of death: The execution chamber at the Florida State Penitentiary . The three women were each stabbed at least 14 times, and the girl was stabbed at least 10. Prosecutors said bloody fingerprints and palm prints, along with other physical evidence, linked Correll to the crime scene. The Florida Supreme Court has previously reviewed the use of midazolam and found it to be effective at rendering the condemned unconscious before the second and third drugs are used to paralyze inmates and then stop their hearts. Opponents of the procedure say that midazolam doesn't prevent inmates from suffering during an execution. Unsafe? Oklahoma death row prisoner Clayton Lockett was killed in a botched execution in April this year . Midazolam has been used in problematic executions in Arizona, Ohio and Oklahoma. Florida has used the drug in 11 executions with no apparent problems. Florida Justices Ricky Polston and Charles Candady said in the dissenting opinion that Florida's circumstances are different than Oklahoma's and that the Florida Supreme Court reviewed an exhaustive amount of material to determine that midazolam is constitutional. 'Whatever the majority's speculation about how the Supreme Court may alter the law in the future, this Court should follow our precedent as it exists today,' they said in the dissent. Oklahoma and Florida, uses midazolam as one of three drugs in lethal injection executions. The second drug serves to paralyze the inmate and the third one is used to stop his heart. In 2008, the justices upheld the use of a different three-drug combination in a case from Kentucky and set a high bar for challenges to lethal injections. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote then that the court probably would not stop executions unless 'the condemned prisoner establishes that the state's lethal injection protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain.' What has changed since 2008 is that states have been forced to change the drugs they use in executions after drug manufacturers took steps to ensure their products are not used in executions. The inmates are trying to stop their executions, arguing that the state would essentially be experimenting on them by injecting them with unproven and untested drugs. 'The drug protocol in Oklahoma is not capable of producing a humane execution, even if it is administered properly,' Baich said. Last April, Oklahoma used midazolam for the first time in a grisly procedure. Inmate Clayton Lockett clenched his teeth, moaned and writhed on the gurney before a doctor noticed a problem with the intravenous line and the execution was called off. Lockett died 43 minutes after the procedure began. Oklahoma revamped its procedures in response to the Lockett execution, including a fivefold increase in the amount of midazolam used. In last week's execution, Warner showed no signs of physical distress.",The Supreme Court will decide this year whether the three-drug combination used in Oklahoma executions is constitutional .
"The Qatari ruling family is due to make hundreds of millions of pounds from skyscrapers built on Olympic land  bought ‘for a song’ from the Government, it emerged last night. A Middle-East firm that is  co-owned by the powerful al-Thani royal family paid a knockdown £557million for 1,400 flats in the Athletes Village in 2011. At the time Britain was still in an  economic crisis and property prices were low. Good buy: Qatari Diar and Delancey, co-owned by the powerful al-Thani royal family, paid a knockdown £557million for the 1,400 flats, some pictured, in the Athletes Village in 2011 . High Value: One of the six plots by the Athletes Village in east London that will be developed. Experts think the company could make a £1billion profit by developing the area . The flats were built to house 23,000 . athletes and officials during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic . Games – including Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and South African runner . Oscar Pistorius – but were sold to Qatari Diar and Delancey before the . Games even started. Experts claim that QDD could now net a £1billion . profit from the purchase as the capital’s property market continues to . boom. This is because the . deal also included six little-publicised plots next to the village, for . which there is already outline planning permission for 2,000 residential . flats. This includes . permission for a 50-storey block – which would be the tallest building . on the Olympic Park after the ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture and which . could prove a goldmine for its overseas buyers. There is also outline planning permission for two 32-storey blocks, a hotel and a shopping and leisure development. The . estimated profits raise questions over whether the public was . short-changed when the deal – which will be finalised this month – was . agreed more than two years ago. The flats, another selection of which are pictured, were built to house 23,000 athletes and officials during the London 2012 Games - and were sold to the company before the Olympics had even started . Another story covered by the Mail on March 15 about Tony Blair and Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani . Last . night Justin Bowden, of the union GMB, said: ‘The Qataris bought it for . a knockdown price and now they look set to make a wad of cash. ‘What . has not been properly analysed yet is whether foreign investors are . paying proper taxes and if they are here for the long-term or to make a . quick buck.’ Bert . Schouwenburg, international officer for the GMB, which has previously . called the Qatari ruling family ‘secretive, playboy investors’, said: . ‘We got a shocking deal when the Olympic Village was sold. ‘Taxpayers’ money was used to build it and then it was sold for a song. The . Government didn’t know what to do with it and they ran out of money to . keep it.’ He also raised concerns over the ‘diabolical’ treatment of migrant labourers by Qatari-owned building firms overseas. Legacy: Sprinter Usain Bolt stayed in the Athletes Village while at the London 2012 Games . He . added: ‘The area around Newham is also among the poorest in London, . with long waiting lists for council houses, but it seems likely they . will be sold as luxury flats to speculative overseas investors, many of . which could then sit empty.’ QDD . – a joint venture between the oil-rich state’s investment arm and . British firm Delancey – is one of many businesses owned by the Qataris . which are snapping up some of Britain’s most prestigious properties. HarrodsThe . Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, told the Financial . Times in 2010: ‘We are investing  everywhere. Even your Harrods, we took . it.’ They bought it for £1.5billion. The ShardThe tallest skyscraper in Europe is owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). Sainsbury’sThe royal family of the Gulf kingdom  has a 26 per cent stake. One Hyde ParkThe . world’s most expensive apartment block is owned by Project Grande . (Guernsey), a joint venture between the former Qatari prime minister, . Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, and Christian Candy’s CPC . Group. London Stock ExchangeQatar bought a 20 per cent stake of  LSE in 2007, and took a 9.98 per cent stake in Nordic exchange OMX at the same time. Camden MarketIn . 2008, the QIA became an unlikely major stakeholder in London’s Camden . Market after buying a 20 per cent stake in property group Chelsfield. They claimed that the investment in the alternative market offered a . good opportunity to buy up further assets. Royal AscotIn . January, the Queen gave permission for the ruling al-Thani family of . Qatar to become her first commercial partner at Royal Ascot through the . holding company for the Qataris called Qipco. Its name will be allowed . to appear in places such as the top of stalls and at the back of the . parade ring. They are currently said to be involved in a bitter battle to gain ownership of Claridge’s hotel in London. Experts estimated that a two single-bedroom apartment on the Olympic Village site would sell for £350,000. Michael . Sacks of Sequre property investment said the value of the existing . flats, plus the profit made on new-build apartments would add up to ‘a . fantastic deal for the buyer’. He . added: ‘If they were to stagger the sales over the next five to ten . years, then you’re easily looking at over the  £1billion mark profit.’ The Olympic Development Authority said the developers would not have to sell or rent the flats as affordable housing. QDD . is already making money from the existing flats inside the former . Athletes’ Village, where tenants pay up to £515-a-week. It has been coy . over the future of the six development plots. However, a source told the Mail they already had plans ‘for two skyscrapers within two years’. So far the Government has lost £500million on the sale of the former Olympic Village, now re-named East Village. The . ODA spent £1.3billion building the flats and converting them into . saleable properties. It was initially supposed to be wholly funded by . the private sector, but the economic crisis in 2009 made it difficult to . attract investors. The same . year, public-private venture Triathlon Homes bought the leasehold for . the first 1,379 homes for £268million. QDD snapped up the remaining . 1,439 for  £557million in 2011. A . spokesman for the ODA insisted: ‘The ODA firmly believes, as it did in . 2011, that the sale of the former Olympic Village provides a good deal . for the taxpayer.’ A . spokesman for QDD said: ‘The plans are at a preliminary stage. However, . we can confirm that the buildings are likely to be less than the maximum . of 50 storeys permitted by the outline permission.’","1,400 flats in Athletes Village bought by Middle-East firm for £557million .

"A giant arena is being built in view of Nelson Mandela’s home to stage the biggest funeral in South Africa’s history for their beloved former leader. The huge dome can be seen being built behind the former South African president's home in Qunu, South Africa in time for the funeral on Sunday. Singing South Africans gathered in the rain today to honor the peace campaigner at a massive memorial service that drew some 100 heads of state and other luminaries, united in tribute to a global symbol of reconciliation.

Thousands sang God Bless Africa - Nkosi Sikelel'i Afrika - as they joined leaders at the FNB stadium in Soweto amid driving rain. ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa welcomed leaders from countries around the world. 'We wish to applaud the people of South Africa for the dignified manner in which they have honoured and remembered the memory of Nelson Mandela since he passed away. We applaud you and thank you for it,' he said at the start of the service. Mr Mandela, who died last Thursday aged 95, made his last public appearance at the stadium at the closing ceremony of the 2010 football World Cup. Today world leaders gathered to pay tribute to the inspirational figure who strove for world peace. Barack Obama compared Mr Mandela's actions to those of Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln and US civil rights leader Martin Luther King . Nelson Mandela's face is seen on a huge screen next to mourners at yesterday's stadium service . Barack Obama led tributes to Mandela urging the world to use the celebration of his life as a period of 'self-reflection.'

South Africans were praised for the 'dignified' way in which they commemorated the death of Nelson Mandela . Mr Mandela, who died last Thursday aged 95, was described as one of the most iconic world leaders in history . Mr Obama further singled out world . leaders who have publicly welcomed gains made by Mr Mandela but resist . reforms to tackle inequality and injustice. 'Around the world today we still see children suffering from hunger and disease and we still still see run down schools and we see young people without prospects for the future,' he said. 'Around the world today men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs and are still persecuted for what they look like and how they worship and who they are, that is happening today. 'There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba's (Mandela's) legacy of racial reconciliation but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. Thousands of ordinary South Africans sang God Bless Africa - Nkosi Sikelel'i Afrika - as they joined leaders at the FNB stadium in Soweto . The memorial celebrated his gift for uniting enemies across political and racial divides . 'There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba's struggle for freedom but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. 'There are too many of us on the sidelines comfortable in complacency or cynicism.' Mr Obama warned against viewing Mr Mandela as 'detached' from normal life. 'It was precisely because he could admit . to imperfection, because he was so full of good humour, even mischief . despite the heavy burdens that he carried, that we loved him so,' he . said. Former Presidents of USA, Bill Clinton and George W Bush are seen during the memorial for the peace campaigner . President Barack Obama shakes hands with Cuban President Raul Castro during the official memorial service . 'He was not a bust made of marble, he was a man of flesh and blood, a son and a husband, a father and a friend, that is why we have learned so much from him and that is why we can learn from him still. 'Nothing he achieved was inevitable, in the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness and persistence and faith.' Mr Obama's speech came after he shook hands with Cuban president Raul Castro among other world leaders gathered at the service. The US president was cheered by the assembled crowds. Boos were heard for the current South African president Jacob Zuma. Those attending included Prime Minister David Cameron and his three surviving predecessors, Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.","A giant arena is being built in view of Nelson Mandela's home to stage the biggest funeral in South Africa's history for him .

"The Australian suicide bomber who killed five people in a terrorist attack in Iraq last week is believed to be 18-year-old Adam Dahman. But the Melbourne teen's family denies he was behind the Baghdad blast, claiming he is alive in Syria. Online Adam was known as Abu Bakr al Australi. A social media post by the extremist Sunni Muslim group last week claimed he was responsible for the attack. Scroll down for video . The Melbourne teen behind the suicide bombing in Baghdad last week is reportedly Adam Dahman . His father Sam Dahman reportedly told the Herald Sun that he had spoken to his son just last week. 'Where is the proof?' he asked, as he demanded to see his son's body. MailOnline has attempted to contact the Dahman family for comment. On Monday the federal government confirmed that an 18-year-old Melbourne boy was responsble for the suicide bombing. Attorney-general George Brandis' office verified that the boy was living in Melbourne until last year, when he left at the age of 17. His father Sam Dahman reportedly told the Herald Sun that he had spoken to his son just last week . He is believed to be the first Australian responsible for a suicide attack in Iraq . He is believed to be the first Australian responsible for a suicide attack in Iraq. Intelligence sources confirm the culprit was from Melbourne, but fled the country through either Perth or Sydney at some point in 2013. It is believed that the teenager detonated a belt bomb in a market place in Baghdad, near the Shiite mosque of Abdullah bin Rawah in the main wholesale market of Shorja. The attack killed five and injured as many as 90 people.

"An unemployed father of 26 children, who has already raked in benefits worth more than £500,000, says he deserves more money to support his huge family. Unmarried Peter Rolfe, 64, from the Isle of Wight has fathered 14 boys and 12 girls with 15 different women. He appeared on today's This Morning to defend his lifestyle, ahead of a Channel 5 documentary airing this evening sharing his story. His side of the story: Peter Rolfe said on This Morning he only takes benefits for the sake of his children . Presenter Holly Willoughby revealed that Peter is getting £32,678 a year in benefits in the form of  child tax credits, family allowance, disability benefits, housing benefits and a state pension. Peter pointed out that the pension is his right given he worked in his youth as a doorman (a role he admitted was largely responsible for him sleeping with so many women and fathering so many children). He apologised if his large family puts a 'strain' on the benefits system but added that he only claims for his children's sake, not for his own. Disabilities: The father of 26 said he would get a job if he could . 'I claim exactly what I can get from the state for my children, not for my self,' he said. He added that he would work if he could. 'I worked until taking the children on and then I became a single father, if someone wants to give me a job I'll do it, even now with my disabilities but noone wants to give a disabled person a job,' he said. While some of Mr Rolfe's children have grown up and left home (his eldest daughter is in her forties), he still regularly has 18 family members staying in his three-bed council house. Six of his children aged three to 19 still live with him permanently. Hard life: Peter Rolfe says he needs a bigger council house and more benefits to support his family . Big brood: The father of 26 with some of his children (he has 14 boys and 12 girls altogether) And the family keeps on expanding - one of his teenage daughters has just had twins. As a result, Mr Rolfe says there simply isn't room for them all, they have to top and tail to share beds while he sleeps on the sofa. 'I would like a house with four bedrooms . big enough to accommodate the children,' he explained on the Channel 5 documentary. He said he has been waiting nine years for a bigger house. 'I'll be dead before they even . think about giving me a house,' he moans. Tight squeeze: Peter's council house on the Isle Of Wight isn't big enough for his family (they do not own the attached garage) Mr Rolfe's feckless behaviour has already invited the ire of taxpayers but he declares himself furious with local council leader, who recently awarded himself a 37 per cent pay rise. 'Why is he entitled to that when I'm . not entitled to a bigger bedroom?' he complains. 'He didn't do anything to deserve what . he's getting. All he's doing is getting money for nothing, what makes . him think he's worth that money?' In addition to demanding more money and a larger home, Mr Rolfe complains that he and his family have been struggling since the benefit cap came in. Furiously, he tells of how his children had to go without computer games because they were only getting £500 a week in benefits. Challenge: Peter said people who criticise him should imagine what it's like being a father of 26 . 'When the cap came in, we lost at least . £200 a week,' he fumes. 'It meant some of my children couldn't have a new pair of . shoes, couldn't have a new pair of school trousers, couldn't have stuff . other children get such as Playstations and Xboxes... None of my children have had . them and that's because we can't afford them. 'Before the cap we were able to live comfortably, it's a major drop that affected us right away. They didn't . drop the price of food, that's going up so you have a lot of worry and . you have to juggle everything you can.' Yet when their benefits were capped, Mr Rolfe and other members of his family decided not to make up the shortfall by getting a job. At the time . the documentary was filmed, his teenage daughter, Rosanne, was the only . one employed - but she quit her waitressing job after five shifts saying it . was too difficult. 'Everyone has judged for for it but I . hated it, I honestly did,' she explains. 'All the people there would talk down to me, I . would prefer to work a simple 9-5, no split shifts.' Upwardly mobile on benefits: Peter has successfully applied for disability allowance which means his family gets £800 a week (and he gets a mobility scooter) Mr Rolfe, who walks using a stick, has now managed to boost his weekly welfare payout to £800 a week again - after successfully claiming disability allowance. But for anyone who thinks he's got it easy, he points out it's hard work being a father to dozens of children. 'I would challenge anybody to come and do what I do for the children. People all criticise me, but come and do what I do,' he said. But following his appearance on This Morning, Peter again received a barrage of criticism from viewers who contacted the show via Twitter. Kim Foster angrily rote: 'Shocking! He gets more than I do, and I'm a full time nurse! Saved wages for a house deposit and it's handed to him!' while Sarah Hawkins said: 'There's just no excuse. The Government needs to be more stricted with benefits. I'm a single parent and work my butt off.'

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry invoked comedian Joan Rivers' death on Sunday while defending a law he signed that would close the majority of abortion facilities in the nation's second-most populous state. The Republican governor and likely 2016 presidential candidate suggested during a forum that Rivers' death could have been avoided if New York had a law like the one passed in Texas requiring clinics to abide by the same standards of care as hospitals. 'It was interesting that Joan Rivers and the procedure that she had done, where she died, that was a clinic,' Perry told attendees of the Texas Tribune's annual festival in Austin. 'It's a curious thought, that if they had that type of regulations in place whether or not that individual would be still alive,' he said, per a video provided by the Texas Tribune. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Texas Governor Rick Perry invoked comedian Joan Rivers' death while defending a law he signed that would close the majority of abortion facilities in Texas. The Republican  suggested during a forum on Sunday that Rivers' death could have been avoided if New York had a law requiring clinics to abide by the same standard of care as hospitals . Rivers was undergoing a routine procedure at an outpatient surgery center when the 81-year-old entertainer went into cardiac arrest and died earlier this month. Health officials in New York are still investigating. The provision of the Texas law that Perry referenced as preventative of fatalities like Rivers' was actually blocked by a federal judge in August and the state of Texas is currently engaged in a court battle to restore it. Had that requirement taken effect, only seven abortion facilities would remain in Texas — down from more than 40 in 2012. Jan Soifer, an Austin attorney representing abortion providers in the lawsuit, said in an email to the Associated Press on Sunday she didn't know the circumstances of Rivers' death, or if Perry knew whether that clinic would have met Texas' proposed ambulatory surgical center requirements. 'I do know that the evidence we produced at trial proved that abortions are among the safest procedures and neither ASCs nor admitting privileges make them any safer,' Soifer said. Heather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas,  also bristled at Perry's claim, telling the Associated Press in an email that complications can arise from any medical procedure, not just abortions. 'There's risk inherent in just about anything. You could have a heart attack and die while having your wisdom teeth removed. Should we outlaw wisdom teeth removal?' she said. The event on Sunday brought out a rare side of Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history, who reflected on 14 years of state policy after spending the past year whipping up conservative crowds around the U.S. for another potential White House run. Rather than a fiery speech blasting President Barack Obama, an easygoing Perry mused on his record on schools and jobs. The state's abortion clinic law came up in response to a question from an audience member. Perry, right, drew the comparison between Rivers' death and the Texas law during a talk with Texas Tribune CEO and editor in chief Evan Smith, right, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Sunday . Texas is now asking a federal appeals court in New Orleans to let the state fully enforce its sweeping anti-abortion law, known as HB2. That same appeals court previously upheld a section of the law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel of Austin ruled last month that making Texas abortion clinics spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult. Opponents of the law repeatedly extolled the safety of abortion clinics during a four-day trial in Austin, arguing that that only one of more than 500 deaths from pregnancy-related causes from 2008-2012 in Texas was attributed to abortion. The legal battle will likely continue beyond Perry's third - and final - full term in office, which will come to a close in January of next year. Perry reiterated during Sunday's event that he wouldn't announce a decision on whether he'll run for president again until after leaving office. However, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate has said several times in the past that he's preparing for a run. It's likely he'll be one of as many as a dozen Republicans competing for his party's nomination in 2016.","The GOP governor  suggested that Rivers' death could have been avoided if New York had a law like the one passed in Texas .

"In recent years a warming climate has encouraged wine producers to set up business in England, with . vineyards now covering 3,500 acres of countryside. But after a run of bountiful years, many have been left counting the cost of 2012's dreadful weather after the wet summer washed out this years harvest . Now a number of the nation's wineries have been left with not enough grapes to produce decent quality wine. The news comes after it was revealed that many  British fruit and vegetable crops have been similarly ruined. Bob Lindos, founder of the Camel Valley Vineyard, says that this year has been terrible for UK vineyards . Nyetimber Vineyard have had to scrap their 2012 harvest because of the awful weather . The peak year from English wine, 2010, saw four million bottles of wine produced. But this year's relentless rain and cold conditions has destroyed many of the precious grape plants. Britain's biggest wine producer, Nyetimber, has scrapped its entire harvest due to this year's bad weather. The West Sussex estate produced 400,000 bottles of wine in its peak year of 2009 from its 430-acres across West Sussex and Hampshire. But employers told staff on Tuesday that it would skip this year's harvest as the 'quantity and quality of grapes do not meet the required standard'. The cold, wet summer has already affected vegetable and fruit harvests in Britain and across the world, pushing up food prices. British wine has earned a popular following, and during the Diamond Jubilee the Royal family sipped sparkling wine produced in the UK . But the harvest cancellation, the first time in the firm's history that will leave grapes to wither on the vine, is the first sign of how devastating it could be for English wine. Other vineyards expect production to be down by between one-third and two-thirds. Cherie Spriggs, head winemaker at Nyetimber, said the 'really difficult and emotional' decision to skip the harvest was due to quality. 'I don't know what it would taste like, but I know it would not be good,' she said. The 60 full-time staff at Nyetimber were among those putting a brave face on it, according to Ms Spriggs. British wine has started to win over sceptics and even flattened French competition in international wine awards. Here are five of the biggest producers: . Denbies in Dorking, Surrey, is one of the UK's biggest physical vineyard with 265 acres under vines; . Camel Valley in Cornwall is one of Britain's best known vineyards and their 2008 Pinot Noir Rose Brut scooped the gold award at the International Wine Challenge; . Nyetimber in West Sussex has over 400 acres to produce wines that were drunk on the Spirit of Chartwell during the Diamond Jubilee River Thames flotilla parade; . The 23-acres Chapel Down winery in Tenterden, Kent, won a slew of awards at this years' International Wine Challenge, international Wine and Spirit Competition, and Decanter World Wine Awards; . The winemaker at the Furleigh Estate in Dorset, which has 85 acres, has been named Winemaker of the Year at the English and Welsh Wine of the Year 2012 competition. Despite struggling with emotion herself as she delivered the news, she said staff's commitment to quality wines meant they responded in 'classic English stiff upper lip' fashion. Nyetimber's sparkling wines are popular with the royal family. The 2007 Classic Cuvee was the only sparkling wine serve on the Spirit of Chartwell during the Diamond Jubilee River Thames pageant. The same wine also made an appearance at the Diamond Jubilee lunch at Westminster Hall where it was served on arrival to 700 guests, including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Bob Lindos, founder of Camel Valley, Cornwall, said the run of bad weather was likely to push his harvest down by a third from an average year. 'It's a bad year,' he said. 'People are trying to put a brave face on it, but it means there will be a shortage of English wine. It's a bit of a blow for many people.' However, he also pointed to the flipside of scarcity. 'It will help with price, no doubt about it. If there was bucket loads of it, it would be cheaper.' He also told  Harpers Wine and Spirit Traders Review that frosty May conditions had led to berries withering. Simon Bladon, owner of Jenkyn Place told Harpers Wine and Spirit Traders Review that he anticipated his harvest being between 30 and 40 per cent smaller than usual. He was confident that his vineyard in the North Downs, Hampshire, could still prdouce top quality wines: 'With selective picking and very careful pressing in the winery, we can ensure that we only use the best juice. There will be absolutely no compromise on quality. 'This is of the utmost importance to us but we are confident that we will be able to produce some great wine again this year.'","Frosty, wet conditions have shrivelled the UK's grape berries .

"Sherpa Tenzing Norgay's son has claimed that Mount Everest has become a cash-cow for the Nepalese government and the overcrowded peak is now strewn with rubbish. Norbu Tenzing says his famous Sherpa father would be saddened that the mountain has become something of a tourist attraction, with hundreds of climbers attempting to tackle the world's highest peak. Norbu has also urged Nepalese authorites to take action to limit the number of climbers, and to do more to protect the Sherpas in the wake of an avalanche that killed 16 of them last month. Anger: Sherpa Tenzing's son Norbu (left) says his father, pictured right with Sir Edmund Hillary, would be saddened by the fact the mountain has become a 'cash cow' for the Nepalese government . ‘If he were alive, he would be very sad to see how heavily trafficked and desecrated the mountain has become,’ he told The Sunday Telegraph. ‘It is a . travesty, what has happened to this beautiful mountain. Everest has . become a cash cow, where the government takes millions of dollars a . year, but very little or nothing actually goes back. Such is the popularity of climbing Everest that mountaineers now have to form queues to stand on the summit, and Norbu said that many leave the peak littered with rubbish. Last month 16 Sherpas died in an avalanche as they traversed a treacherous ice fall. Queue: Hundreds try to climb Everest every year and Norbu, Sherpa Tenzing¿s son, has said that his father who died in 1986 would be upset by what has become of the mountain . Crowds: A mountaineer returns to base camp to the cheers of fellow climbers after successfully climbing Everest . Several Sherpa guides were hauling . climbing gear between camps when a chunk of ice tore loose and triggered . an avalanche. Thirteen bodies were recovered and three Sherpas are . still missing, presumed dead. It was the worst single disaster on the mountain and speaks volumes of the demands placed upon the natives by Westerners, according to Norbu. The families of Sherpas killed on the mountain have received just £245 compensation, a figure that has resulted in many Sherpas threatening to stop escorting climbers up Everest. The Sherpas have argued that they deserve far more — including more insurance money, more financial aid for the families of the victims and new regulations that would ensure climbers' rights. Earlier . this year Nepalese tourist authorities announced a number of initiatives . aimed at cutting congestion on the mountain, including plans to . introduce separate fixed ropes for climbers ascending and . descending near the summit, and posting government officials at the mountain's base camp to monitor climbers. But Norbu has called upon the Nepalese government to go further and limit the number of mountaineers allowed to climb Everest every year, and urged climbers to consider the welfare of the Sherpas. Clmbing Everest has become a tourist attraction and the mountain is strewn with rubbish. Hundreds try to climb Everest every year and Norbu . Last year 800 people climbed the mountain . during the spring season, which amounts to just two or three occasions . in May when the weather is favourable enough to enable a safe climb. The Everest climbing season provides . livelihoods for thousands of Nepali guides and porters, and climbers have . long relied on Sherpas for everything from carrying gear to cooking food . to high-altitude guiding. Without them, reaching the summit would be . almost impossible. Norbu described how Sherpas now must not only help guide Westerners up the . world's highest mountain, but must also help carry the climbers' luxury . tents, and even items such as coffee machines. Norbu, 51, is vice-president of the American Himalayan Foundation based in San Francisco, which helps raise money for education and health-care projects for Sherpas, Nepalis and Tibetans throughout the region. He was . speaking on the release of Beyond the Edge 3D in cinemas this Friday, . which documents his father’s famous climb with New Zealander Sir Edmund . in 1953. On the way: Hillary (left) and Tenzing on their ascent to the summit of Mount Everest in May 1953 . Since their mission, more than 4,000 climbers have reached . the 29,035ft summit, while hundreds of people have died trying. Norbu . described the motivation that drove his father's team as 'pure', and . inspired by the drive to achieve something no one else had done before, . unlike some who make the climb today - many of whom, he says, simply . want to get an extra line on their CVs. Tenzing, who died in 1986 at the age of 71, and Sir Edmund were asked until the end of their days which of them had . reached the summit first — for many years they never answered, . insisting that they share the honour. Finally, they admitted that . Hillary, who died in 2008, was first. Norbu said: . ‘People of that generation climbed with the simple hope of going on an . adventure, of doing something no one had done before. Everybody was . working together and the sense of comradeship was unique.'","Sherpa Tenzing's son Norbu says his father would be 'very sad' to see how heavily trafficked the mountain has become .

"It’s not likely that many will poo-poo this idea. Britain uses three billion disposable nappies a year - but now they are set to be turned into roof tiles after a unique recycling plant opened its doors today. More than a half a million tonnes of waste from disposable nappies is generated in Britain every year going into landfill or incineration. And despite going green on other issues, families are still buying disposable nappies over traditional old-style washable ones. The average baby uses 6,000 before being potty trained and each one takes around 500 years to decompose. Nappy days: Waste at the Knowaste recycling plant . But now a Canadian company Knowaste is set to recycle 36,000 tonnes of the waste at the first facility of its kind in the UK. It is hoped the technology will reduce more than 22,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year - the equivalent of taking nearly 7,500 cars off UK roads. The plant, which opened in West Bromwich, West Midlands, is the first of five sites planned over the next four years. As well as nappies, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products will also be recycled. They will be collected from washrooms, hospitals, nursing facilities and child care nurseries. Knowaste said that state-of-the-art technology will be used to recycle sterilise and separate the products (known in the industry as AHPs) to recover highly valuable plastic and fibre. Unique: The Knowaste plant is the first of its kind in Britain - but four more will follow . Cool idea: The plant will help tackle global warming by saving 110,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year . These can then be used for making new products, such as roof tiles or plastic components and fibre-based construction and commercial tubes. Roy Brown, CEO of Knowaste, said: ‘This first site in West Bromwich represents the beginning of a £25million overall investment in the UK, that will produce capacity for handling about a fifth of the AHP waste stream - equating to a saving of 110,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year. ‘In the UK, more than one million tonnes of AHP waste is generated annually, much of which is landfilled. 'A significant proportion of which is produced by the commercial sector and we are proud to be working with some of the Midland's and nation's leading AHP collection companies already. They are embracing this opportunity. ‘We are also developing partnerships with local authorities and their waste contractors to recycle domestic AHP waste in the future. 'Our plant here in the Midlands and those intended for Scotland, the West and London will enable both commercial operators and local authorities to further cut carbon, increase recycling and divert waste from landfill.’ Big operation: The plant will recycle 36,000 tonnes of waste a year .","Britain uses three billion nappies a year .

"A super-spicy burger on sale in Brighton is being touted as the hottest in Britain - after five people landed in hospital attempting to eat it. Nick Gambardella, who serves the XXX Hot Chilli Burger in his restaurant in the popular seaside town, asks customers - who must be over-18 - to sign a legal disclaimer before trying it. The dish has a chilli sauce on it measuring an eye-watering 9.2million on the Scoville scale which measures spicy heat in foods - compared to an average chilli pepper at 500 Scoville units. Spicy challenge: The XXX Hot Chilli Burger is only on sale at Burger Off in Brighton to over 18s . On one occasion, a diner was taken to hospital with a suspected perforated bowel after eating the dish. Four others were admitted for treatment on the same night for suspected Anaphylactic shock. Now diners who want to eat the XXX burger are asked to sign a document first drawn up by Gambardella saying: 'I the undersigned accept all responsibility for any effects incured (sic) due to the consumtion (sic) of the above mentioned xxxx Hot Chilli Burger and release Burger Off, its owner and staff from any liability.' The dish is sold at his Burger Off restaurant in Brighton, Sussex, said: 'I am amazed I am allowed to sell it - but it's been a massive hit with the customers. 'I have spoken to people at environmental health but they think it is hilarious. Trading Standards came in and I tried to convince the guy to have one but he wouldn't have it. ""I have to admit I've not dared to try one of these burgers myself as they are so spicy. One night five ambulances arrived and I've heard the local hospital had people on crash mats on adrenalin drips from my chilli burger. Burger Off: Takeaway boss Nick Gambardella preparing his new super-spicy burger . 'Obviously I always take my responsibilities as a food retailer seriously but if my customers want super spicy food, I am entitled to give them what they want. The burgers are cooked properly - it's the sauce that is maybe too hot to handle. 'One of my customers works at the local hospital and they came down to tell me that staff held a two hour meeting about my chilli burger and that they are changing how they treat ""the fallen"". 'They've now decided that an adrenalin drip is more effective for dealing with the anaphylactic shock that the burger sometimes brings on. 'Why the customers eat it I don't know, because I always say to them that it is incredibly hot and give them all the health warnings under the sun. 'I think these people are slightly mad to eat it but I'm sure there is a certain level of peer pressure. A lot of people just regard it as a challenge.' The burger gets its heat from a red-hot sauce based on a piri piri chilli concentrate created through steaming and is later infused with carbon dioxide. Legal waiver: Nick won't allow anyone to try the spicy burger without signing a legal disclaimer . So far just 59 out of 3,000 challengers have succeeded in eating the whole burger. The dish, sold at £3.90, is said to have caused customers to adopt a number of undignified coping mechanisms from stripping naked, begging for mercy, punching windows and vomiting. Many suffer from anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction, can be brought on by certain foods, medication or animal stings and can leave the sufferer with swelling, rashes and difficulty breathing. Nick said: 'You get used to it. Unlike most man vs food challenges, here at Burger Off you don't get a reward. 'One guy came in and he was just a little bit cocky and when he left he was admitted to hospital because prior to eating the burger he had a stomach ulcer and we believe it perforated his bowel. 'He wasn't in a good way but he pulled through. 'The first time someone had the burger and couldn't take the heat it was a bit of a shock but we thought 'well we told you.' We never call an ambulance, it's always the customer who calls.' Hot sauce: The XXX Hot Chilli Burger sauce measures an eye-watering 9.2million on the Scoville scale . Customers willing to try the XXX Hot Chilli Burger vary in age from young men to parents attempting to show their kids how it is done, however Burger Off also offer a cocktail stick sample for those more timid customers. He added: 'People always ask where I get the sauce from but I always say ""If I tell you I will have to kill you."" I just got fed up with people saying ""well it's not really that hot"". 'So I thought, well let's make it hotter. Now it's got a bit of a following from people travelling for miles to challenge a friend or themselves. 'We aren't one of these gourmet burger places. But it seems to work as we are usually always busy.' Many of the foolhardy conquerors have taken to Twitter and The Burger Off Facebook page to spread the word about the burger. Even former Big Brother star Pete Bennett attempted the challenge only to end up writhing on the pavement. Douglas Hogarth posted: 'My brother had heard all these bold statements beforehand about how he went to Dubai and Delhi and demanded their hottest possible curry and it barely made him break a sweat. 'He got two bites into The XXX and gave up. Then spent two days recovering.' One Facebook user said: 'Sadly I can confirm that this Burger is no joke.'","Burger is 9.2million Scoville units - 18,000 times hotter than a chilli pepper .

"Pope Francis has won the admiration of his followers for his common touch and his accessibility. And yesterday his compassion for a disfigured man prompted comparisons to the 13th Century's St Francis of Assisi. The Pope kissed and prayed with the ailing man who was battling neurofibromatosis - the rare disease said to have affected the Elephant Man. Act of kindness: Pope Francis (left) comforted Vinicio Riva, a 52-year-old Italian who had travelled to Rome for a audience in Saint Peter's Square in November . Touching moment: The pontiff kissed the worshiper, who suffers from a rare disease called neurofibromatosis, which is genetic and not contagious . Images of Pope Francis comforting the ailing worshiper were taken at the end of the general audience Wednesday, when a man covered in neuronal tumors approached the leader of the Catholic Church asking for a blessing. Famous namesake: The pope has drawn comparisons to St Francis of Assisi - a revered 13th century holy figure, who according to legend kissed a leper . The man reportedly suffers from the rare and painful disease, which causes growths, impaired vision and in some cases cancer, according to the Catholic News Agency. Patients suffering from the ailment, which is genetic and not contagious - are often shunned by society because of their appearance. Pope Francis has been widely praised for his common touch and accessibility. Since being elected to the Holy See . earlier this year, the pontiff has made headlines around the world by . washing the feet of juvenile delinquents, personally calling distraught . worshipers on the phone and inviting homeless people to dine at St . Peter's Square. On . Wednesday, the leader of the world’s 1.3billion Catholics was greeting . pilgrims following his weekly public audience when he took a break to . comfort the disfigured believer. Pope . Francis then kissed the man on the face and blessed him. He was photographed with his eyes tightly shut in prayer. Show stealer: Last month, the pontiff allowed a young boy to remain on stage with him as he delivered a speech to 150,000 worshipers, occasionally patting the boy's head . Pontiff's penitence: Pope Francis washes the foot of a prisoner at Casal del Marmo youth prison in Rome March 28, 2013 . Earlier in today’s audience, the pope asked the people assembled in the square to pray for a sick little girl he had just met. Last week, the pontiff allowed a little boy to remain on stage with him and cling to his leg during a speech in front of a crowd of 150,000. Earlier this year, Francis tweeted to his 3.2million followers: ’The Pope must serve all people, especially the poor, the weak, the vulnerable.’ On Tuesday, the pontiff fired off this message: ‘We need courage if we are to be faithful to the Gospel.’ Neurofibromatosis has long been associated with the 'Elephant Man,' the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. But evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome . The man who met Pope Francis is believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps. Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of . their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a . gene mutation before they are born. There are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type one, Dr Anand Saggar, a London-based genetics expert, told MailOnline. Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious. The condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. However, in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms . such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head. The confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and Proteus syndrome. However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive. Other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat, light brown spots on the skin. These harmless marks, also called cafe au lait spots, are common in many people. People who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a centimetre wide should get investigated for NF1. NF1 is a condition someone is born with, although some symptoms develop gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. People with NH1 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and behavioural problems, a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, which affect around 10 per cent of people with NF1 over their lifetime, vision problems, high blood pressure and a curved spine.","Pontiff embraced and prayed with the man, who suffers from neurofibromatosis - a rare genetic condition that is not contagious .

"Russian space expert Leonid Ksanfomaliti claimed to have discovered life on Venus after analysing photographs taken by a Soviet probe that landed on the planet's surface 30 years ago. Nasa photo analysts have been quick to debunk his claims, based on photos taken by the Russian probe Venus-13 in 1982. The 'disc' that is seen 'moving' on the surface is in fact a lens cap, and the 'scorpion' seen by Ksanfomaliti is in fact 'noise' in a seocnd-hand picture which is not present in the original image. Images of the surface of Venus taken by the Soviet Venera-13 descent module in 1982: Russian scientist Leonid Ksanfomality claimed to have seen a 'disc' moving, but image analysts point out that it's more likely to be a lens cap . Venera 13 and 14 were identical Russian space probes built to take advantage of the 1981 Venus launch opportunity. They launched 5 days apart . Ksanfomaliti said the images showed a . scorpion-shaped body, a disc and a 'black flap,' which apparently moved . as the probe's camera records the scene. In comments reported by a Russian news agency, he said, 'They all 'emerge, fluctuate and disappear,' explained Ksanfomaliti, writing in the Russian journal Solar System Research magazine. 'What . if we forget about the current theories about the non-existence of life . on Venus, let's boldly suggest that the objects' morphological features . would allow us to say that they are living,' he added. Ted Stryk, a Nasa photo analysts says that it's more likely that the 'disc' in particular came from the craft. 'Venera-13 had two cameras, one in front and one in back. The one image shows the front camera lens cap and the other shows the rear camera lens cap, not one lens cap that moved,' he says, in comments on Life's Little Mysteries. New life? Russian scientist Leonid Ksanfomaliti, claims this image, taken from a probe that landed on Venus in 1982, shows a scorpion-shaped life form . The probe is bottom of the picture and left, with debris in the middle; Ksanfomaliti said that he had spotted several objects which seemed to 'move' as if alive, including a disc - but space experts say that the 'new life' is probably a lens cap . Venus is the most similar planet in our solar system in terms of size and structure to Earth. Its diameter is 7521 miles  – very close to Earth’s 7926-mile diameter. But the surface is very different -  it’s the hottest planet in the solar  system, thanks to its atmosphere being 97 per cent carbon dioxide – a heat-trapping greenhouse gas. It is 67.2million miles from the sun.Its constant surface temperature is 480C - hot enough to melt lead, and hotter than Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. The atmospheric pressure is 96 times higher than Earth’s.Uniquely in the solar system, it rotates ‘backwards’, with the Sun rising in the west and setting in the east. Experts believe this was caused by an impact with a huge object in the distant past. Jonathon Hill, a Nasa mission planner, echoes his comments, 'If those . objects were already on the surface of Venus, what are the chances that . Venera 13 and 14, which landed nearly 1,000 kilometers apart, would . both land inches away from the only ones in sight and they would be in . the same positions relative to the spacecraft? 'It makes much more sense that it's a piece of the lander designed to . break off during the deployment of one of the scientific instrument.' The scorpion 'found' by Ksanfomaliti is also just 'noise' in a digital image, say experts - and it's not in the original image. The Russian scientist is the author of several space publications including the book Mercury. There are no records of life on Venus, which has a surface temperature of 464 degrees Celsius. 'Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway ""greenhouse effect,' says Nasa. Scientists have not ruled out the . possibility of life having once existed on Venus - but most research has focused on whether . there were oceans, and possibly life, in the distant past, before the . 'greenhouse effect' created the scorching temperatures that exist on the . surface today. 'Current theories suggest that Venus and . the Earth may have started out alike. There might have been a lot of . water on Venus and there might have been a lot of carbon dioxide on . Earth,' Professor Andrew Ingersoll of Caltech said in a paper published . in Astrobiology in 2004.

"One US restaurant is planning to put on the spread to end all spreads for Thanksgiving this Thursday. Old Homestead Steakhouse in New York's Meatpacking district is hosting a $35,000 (£22,300) feast for four - that's $8,750 (£5,500) a head - making it the most expensive Thanksgiving feast of all time. What's more unbelievable, one group of four has already bought it (although its not yet been revealed who). Game bird: The meal includes turkey stuffed with seven pounds of ground Japanese Wagyu filet mignon . And it's not just a meal, but the ultimate American Thanksgiving experience that's up for grabs. Tourists with deep pockets will also be treated to four grandstand seats at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; a $6,000 (£3,800) gift card to Bloomingdale's; and dancing lessons at Fred Astaire dance studios to learn the Turkey Trot, a popular dance from the early twentieth century. The food itself with include a nine-course meal with squab (young pigeon) stuffed with foie gras and soaked in Courvoisier L'Esprit Cognac ($5,000/£3200 a bottle) followed by roasted organic turkey stuffed with  seven pounds of  ground Japanese Wagyu filet mignon and gravy made with Château Mouton Rothschild ($1,750(£1,100)/bottle), widely regarded as one of the word's finest clarets. Finest dining: New York Old Homestead Steakhouse promises a dinner 'with attitude and personality' A serving of butternut squash will be infused with winter black truffles ($160£100/lb) and whipped sweet potatoes are topped with three pounds of Royal Osetra 000 caviar ($1,600£1,020/oz). The creamy mash potato is accompanied by Swedish moose cheese and the cranberry orange relish is made with Gran Marnier. To finish diners will get poached bourbon-soaked pears with pumpkin paste dusted with 24-carat gold flakes. Far from a dry lunch, the drinks menu is unsurprisingly lavish with fine wine, champagne and Scotch. No expense spared: A bowl of the potato mash with Swedish moose cheese, made from moose milk . Feast: The whipped sweet potatoes is topped with three pounds of Royal Osetra 000 caviar . 'Let's face it, Thanksgiving dinner is boring, basic, and frankly, unimaginative. We're taking all of the traditional holiday fare — the turkey, gravy, stuffing, pumpkin pie — to a creative level never seen before. It's turkey dinner with attitude and personality,' co-owner Marc Sherry told the New York Daily News. 'We know it's over-the-top expensive, but Thanksgiving comes once a year. If you can splurge for this, you have a lot to be thankful for.' For the less Amex-ready the restaurant also has a $65 (£40) Thanksgiving package that comes with turkey, stuffing and the rare opportunity to watch four people eat a $35,000 dinner.

"Controlling the mind, and actions, of another person sounds like something from a sci-fi film, but researchers have taken a step closer to making it a reality. A student, fitted with an EEG cap, has successfully controlled the hand of a friend when playing a video game using direct brain-to-brain communication. And the reaction was immediate, despite the two players being in different locations and not being told when the game would begin. Scroll down for video . Darby Losey (left) and Jose Ceballos (right) were sitting half a mile apart. The 'sender', which in this case was Mr Loser, thought about firing a cannon in a computer game. That signal was sent over the web directly to the brain of Mr Ceballos, known as the 'receiver', whose hand twitched, pressed a touchpad and fired the cannon . The researchers from the University of Washington successfully demonstrated that brains could directly communicate with each other using this technology in August 2013. During these early tests, researchers used brain stimulation to control the hands of another on a keyboard. To join the brains of University of Washington student Darby Losey and Jose Ceballos, they used electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Mr Losey was connected to an EEG machine, which reads brain activity and sends electrical pulses over the web in one room on the Washington-based campus. These signals were sent to Mr Ceballos, sitting in another campus half a mile away, who was fitted with a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil placed near the part of the brain that controls hand movements. Mr Losey was then told to think about firing a canon and intercepting rockets launched by a pirate ship on a video game. Across campus, Mr Ceballos was sitting wearing headphones in a dark room - with no ability to see the computer game - with his right hand positioned over a touchpad. When Mr Losey thought about firing the cannon, the signals were sent to Mr Ceballos, whose hand then twitched, which pressed the touchpad and fired the cannon. But these latest tests have improved the accuracy and effectiveness of the communication, and shown how it could soon be used in real-world examples. To join the brains of UW student Darby Losey and Jose Ceballos, the research team used electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Mr Losey was connected to an EEG machine, which reads brain activity and sends electrical pulses over the web in one room on the Washington-based campus. These signals were sent to Mr Ceballos, sitting in another campus half a mile away, who was fitted with a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil placed near the part of the brain that controls hand movements. Mr Losey was then told to think about firing a canon and intercepting rockets launched by a pirate ship on a video game. Across campus, Mr Ceballos was sitting wearing headphones in a dark room - with no ability to see the computer game - with his right hand positioned over a touchpad. When Mr Losey thought about firing the cannon, the signals were sent to Mr Ceballos, whose hand then twitched, which pressed the touchpad and fired the cannon. In total, three pairs of students took part in the experiment to test the technology’s accuracy across different groups. Mr Losey (pictured) was connected to an electroencephalography (EEG) machine, which reads brain activity and sends electrical pulses over the web in one room on the Washington-based campus . These signals were sent to Mr Ceballos, sitting in another campus half a mile away, who was fitted with a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil (TMS) (pictured) placed near the part of the brain that controls hand movements. TMS is a noninvasive way of delivering stimulation to the brain to elicit a response . Researchers found that accuracy varied among the pairs, ranging from 25 to 83 per cent. Misses mostly were due to a sender failing to accurately execute the thought to send the ‘fire’ command. The researchers were also able to quantify the exact amount of information that was transferred between the two brains. The human brain is made up of billions of active neurons that have around 105,600 miles (170,000 km) of combined length. Every time you have a thought, your brain produces weak but distinct electrical signals corresponding to it. The electrical impulse is generated by the chemical reaction between neurons, which can be measured. Recording and deciphering those signals is called electroencephalography (EEG), and it has been medically possible since 1924. ‘The new study brings our brain-to-brain interfacing paradigm from an initial demonstration to something that is closer to a deliverable technology,’ said co-author Dr Andrea Stocco, a research assistant professor of psychology and a researcher at UW’s Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences. ‘Now we have replicated our methods and know that they can work reliably with walk-in participants.’ Dr Rajesh Rao, a computer scientist and engineer at the University of Washington who led the work, added: 'Our results show that information extracted from one brain can be transmitted to another brain, ultimately allowing two humans to cooperatively perform a task using only a direct brain-to-brain interface. 'Such devices, which have been long cherished by science fiction writers, have the potential to not only revolutionise how humans communicate and collaborate, but also open a new avenue for investigating brain function.' A separate research team, from Starlab in Barcelona, Spain, recently published results showing direct communication between two human brains. The technology makes it possible to control the body of another person with thoughts - something that Professor Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart (pictured centre) was able to do in the X Men films and comics . This graphic reveals how the process works. Brain signals from the 'sender' are recorded. When the computer detects imagined hand movements, a fire command is transmitted over the internet to the TMS machine, which causes an upward movement of the right hand of the 'receiver' But that particular study only tested one sender brain, instead of different pairs, and was conducted offline instead of in real-time over the web. The technology makes it possible to control the body of another person with thoughts - something that Professor Xavier was able to do in the X Men films and comics. The UW research team is planning to take the work a step further in an attempt to decode and transmit more brain processes. They are hoping to expand the types of information that can be transferred from brain to brain, including more complex visual and psychological phenomena such as concepts, thoughts and rules. The technologies used by the researchers for recording and . stimulating the brain are both well-known. Electroencephalography, or EEG, is routinely used by . clinicians and researchers to record brain activity noninvasively from the . scalp. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive way of . delivering stimulation to the brain to elicit a response. Its effect depends on where the coil is placed; in this . case, it was placed directly over the brain region that controls a person’s . right hand. By activating these neurons, the stimulation convinced the . brain that it needed to move the right hand. They’re also exploring how to influence brain waves that correspond with alertness or sleepiness. Eventually, for example, the brain of a sleepy airplane pilot dozing off at the controls could stimulate the co-pilot’s brain to become more alert. ‘Imagine someone who’s a brilliant scientist but not a brilliant teacher. ‘Complex knowledge is hard to explain - we’re limited by language,’ said co-author Chantel Prat, a faculty member at the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences and a UW assistant professor of psychology. Dr Stocco added: 'We have envisioned many scenarios in which brain-to-brain technology could be useful. 'A skilled surgeon could remotely control an inexperienced assistant’s hands to perform medical procedures even it not on the site, or a skilled pilot could remotely help a less experienced one control a plane during a difficult situation. 'It could help with neuro-rehabilitation. 'After brain damage, patients need to painfully and slowly re-learn simple motor actions, such as walking, grasping, or swallowing. 'We suspect that the re-learning phase could be greatly sped-up if we could provide the damaged brain with a 'motor template', copied from a healthy person, or the healthy part of the patient's brain, of what the intended action should look like. Earlier this year, a research team led by the University of Barcelona used EEG headsets to record electrical activity from neurons firing in the brain and send thoughts between participants (pictured). This was used to convert the words ‘hola’ and ‘ciao’ into binary . In the initial test, the greeting was sent from a volunteer, known as an 'emitter' (illustrated left) in Thiruvananthapuram, India to a 'receiver' in Strasbourg, France. There, a computer translated the message and then used electrical stimulation to implant it in the receiver’s mind .

"They look like exquisite vases made of finely-blown glass, placed carefully on a pedestal to receive the admiration of gallery visitors. But in fact these colourful images are not precious artefacts preserved for the ages, but show a split-second in which specially-manipulated liquids are captured in fantastic formation. They are the work of American photographer Jack Long, 55, from Milwaukee, who developed a special formula for the liquids himself. Split-second: The images could be mistaken for intricate glasswork, but are actually split-second snapshots of liquid in motion . Art: American photographer Jack Long, 55, took the images, created on pedestals, after viewers said that his pictures look like they could be valuable works of art . Alien: These images, part of the Wave/Cave series, look almost alive . The accomplished images require a camera with an extremely fast shutter speed to capture properly, and also requires artificial dyes to go in the water, and custom-built machinery to spray the liquids into the correct shapes. One of his projects, entitled 'Gallery' was prompted by viewers telling him that his images looked like solid glass sculptures - and that if they were real they would buy them. He decided to set up a series of the fleeting formations on top of pedestals, so that the shapes and colours would look as much like solid artefacts as possible to onlookers. Mr Long said: 'Someone told me that if my work were actual sculptures, they would buy them. Disembodied: These delicate formations only last a second before being lost . Bursting into colour: Mr Long uses special dyes to create the dramatic contrasts seen in images such as those above . Marine: These two formations look almost like jellyfish . 'I . decided to set the image up to make it look like it was in a gallery - . used pillars and pedestals and played on the idea that the liquid was a . sculpture.' Mr Long has been working on his technique for three years. He originally began taking commercial photographs of coffees, cocktails and milkshakes, but now focuses on artistic images. He said: 'I accidentally discovered the unique formation of liquids and I thought I'd push it a bit more. 'I realized it was completely unique within the world of splash art photography, and I wanted to take it to a new level.' Mr long Jack creates these beautiful images in his garage, and outdoors, and it sometimes spends months experimenting with new techniques, which have led to several other projects. Development: Mr Long took commercial photographs of beverages - like coffee, milkshakes and cocktails - before . Machinery: For this set, called River and taken near his home, Mr Long created a special machine to squirt the liquid, which could work while submerged in the water . His 'River' series was created in a river near his house, and features dramatic formations emerging from the water. He said: 'I had the idea for River in the back of my head. I thought it would be neat to have them coming out of the water. 'I had to build an apparatus below the water surface that was water tight so that I could shoot the water into the air and capture it. It was quite a challenge.' For another series, 'Wave/Cave' Jack built a fountain that would continuously flow in an arch over the exploding liquid forms. 'I really enjoy creating these images because I'm working in uncharted territory. It makes it that much more wonderful. 'I don't know what it will look like when I'm beginning - it's always rewarding when I see good results.'

"With a sheer drop of 415ft - higher than the Statue of Liberty - and travelling at speeds of 90mph, a new record-breaking ride will not be for the faint-hearted. A New Jersey company is planning to build the 41-story drop ride, making it the world’s tallest. Six Flags Great Adventure says Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom will hoist riders 415 feet in the air and drop them back to the ground at 90 mph.

"Officials in Pennsylvania’s state capital are dealing with an abysmal issue they can’t afford to fix: 41 massive sinkholes throughout the city as wide as 50 feet and as deep as a typical grave. The mix of loose sandy soil and century-old leaking water pipes under Harrisburg's streets have made the area susceptible to such holes, city officials say. But the city is too broke to replace many of the aging pipes and repave its roads as it deals with ongoing budget woes and the looming threat of bankruptcy, according to media reports. Sinkhole dilemma: Crews work on a sinkhole on North Front Street in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on Friday, January 4, 2013 . The cause: The mix of loose sandy soil and century-old leaking water pipes underlying Harrisburg's streets have made the area susceptible to such holes, city officials say . The first of the recent sinkholes perforating Harrisburg was reported on New Year's Eve when a chasm measuring an estimated 50 feet long and eight feet deep swallowed a neighborhood block, damaging water and gas pipes and forcing more than a dozen residents to evacuate their homes,  The Patriot-News reported last month. That neighborhood happens to be one of Harrisburg’s poorest districts and the unexpected sinkhole added to the financial dilemmas hitting low-income residents living in a broke city. ‘I thought the world was ending,’ said one resident, Sherri Lewis, 42, who recently told the Wall Street Journal that she heard a rumbling on December 31 that sounded like fireworks. Since that night, more holes have opened up throughout the 50,000-person city. Another resident, Sharaun Davis, 33, told The Patriot-News in January that she had to move her family to a hotel because construction on the hole that formed on her block was causing her home to shake. ‘I'm hearing literally the dry wall cracking,’ she said. ‘We've had to change our whole life.’ Deep holes, shallow pockets: Harrisburg is too broke to replace many of the aging pipes and repave its roads as it deals with ongoing budget woes and the looming threat of bankruptcy . In addition to the rising number of sinkholes, the struggling city has been unable to fix a sewage treatment plant that has been dumping toxic waste into the Susquehanna River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. ‘We can't do anything right now because no one will lend to us,’ William Cluck, chairman of the city agency that oversees the treatment facility, told the Journal. Harrisburg, which is in default on its debt, is unable to tap into the municipal-debt market, which cities and states use to finance their infrastructure, including bridges, roads and tunnels. After city officials rejected a state-sponsored financial recovery plan in July 2011, Harrisburg ‘was briefly transformed into the Greece of Pennsylvania,’ the New York Times wrote in an article published at the time. The city’s financial woes stem in part from a failed plan to borrow $350 million to upgrade an enormous trash incinerator. That plan fell through in 2010 after the federal government blocked the effort due to the threat of toxic air pollution. Stephen Reed, Harrisburg’s former Democrat mayor who ran the city for 28 years, brought it to near bankruptcy as the more than $500 million in bond deals he oversaw to finance development projects drained the city's coffers, according to Bloomberg. It would cost nearly half of Harrisburg's $50 million budget to permanently fix the 41 sinkholes, one city engineer recently estimated. Other issues: Harrisburg has also been unable to fix a sewage treatment plant that has been dumping toxic waste into the Susquehanna River, which flows into the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean .","Pennsylvania's state capital Harrisburg is struggling with  41 massive sinkholes running as wide as 50 feet .

"Giant ribbons of moist air flowing north from the tropics - each carrying 1,000 times more water than the Thames - are to blame for Britain's recent floods and wet summers, scientists believe. The 'atmospheric rivers', which bring the equivalent of the Amazon's content in rain, are thought to have caused the worst 10 winter floods to have hit the UK since 1970. Now scientists believe they may also be linked to heavy rain in the summer, suggesting they pose an all-year threat to the country's flood defences. Why does it always rain on us? This graphic shows how huge 'atmospheric rivers' in the sky are causing floods in Britain. Water from warm Atlantic waters west of Portugal and north Africa evaporates and the moist air is carried north by depressions. The air cools as it rises above Britain's mountainous west coast, producing heavy cloud and then downpours . Deluge: An aerial view of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, in the summer of 2007. Scientists believe giant ribbons of moist air flowing from the Atlantic are causing flooding in Britain all year round . Submerged: Scientists believe the 2007 flooding in Tewkesbury may have been caused by ribbons of moist air each carrying 1,000 times more water than the River Thames . Measuring up to 300 miles wide and . extending up to 2,000 miles from the tropics to northern Europe, they . can bring torrential rainfall that lasts days. Researchers . say there are only four or five parts of the world where the ribbons . form - and one of them is located above Britain. The . UK is particularly vulnerable because of its mountainous west coast, . which causes the moisture-laden air to rise and cool, creating rain . clouds. A . study by meterologists at Reading University found that atmospheric . rivers caused winter floods, including those which devastated Cumbria in . November 2009 and Cornwall in November 2010. But . the phenomenon has also been linked to the heavy downpours that hit . Britain in June, and scientists believe the ribbons may be to blame for . flooding which struck large parts of the country in the summer of 2007. Recurring problem: Tewkesbury was hit by flooding again in May this year. Scientists believe the heavy rainfall was caused by moist air flowing north from the tropics . Water, water everywhere: Researchers have found that atmospheric rivers are to blame for the worst 10 floods to hit Britain since 1970, including those which affected Cockermouth in Cumbria in November 2009 . Inundated: The River Derwent burst its banks and flooded properties in Cockermouth, Cumbria, in 2009 . For years, the cause of Britain's wet summers has been identified as the jet stream, a fast-flowing band of air more than 30,000ft up which brings Atlantic depressions over the country when it moves south. While the jet stream is almost certainly a factor, scientists now believe the atmospheric rivers also contribute to the heavy rainfall. The Reading University team looked into the subject at the request of the Natural Environment Research Council, which has set aside £15million to pay for studies into Britain's changing weather patterns. Led by atmospheric scientist David Lavers, the team's work involved flying research aircraft into storms and using satellites to follow the movement of masses of moist air. Dangerous: A car struggles to make its way through water in St Blazey, Cornwall, in November 2010, one of the 10 worst winter floods to hit Britain since 1970 . Help: A girl gets a piggyback during floods in the village of Lostwithiel, near St Austell, Cornwall, in 2010 . The scientists found that much of the rain falling in Britain comes from water evaporated from the warm Atlantic waters west of Portugal and north Africa. Between eight and 10 times a year, Atlantic depressions generate a narrow band of wind which carries the water to Britain. Having found the atmospheric rivers, which had been invisible to most scientific instruments, researchers are expected to look into how they could be affected by climate change. There are fears that rising temperatures will lead to more flooding as warm air can carry more moisture. Downpours: A Lostwithiel resident's home is protected by sandbags in November 2010 (left) and floodwater surrounds local shops (right) in the centre of Mytholmroyd near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in June 2012 . The study's abstract reads: 'Damage from flooding in the winter and fall seasons has been widespread in the United Kingdom (UK) and Western Europe over recent decades. 'Here we show that winter flood events in the UK are connected to Atmospheric Rivers (ARs), narrow ribbons along which a large flux of moisture is transported from the subtropics to the mid-latitudes. 'Combining river flow records with rainfall measurements, satellite data and model simulations, we demonstrate that ARs occur simultaneously with the 10 largest winter flood events since 1970 in a range of British river basins, suggesting that ARs are persistently critical in explaining extreme winter flooding in the UK. 'Understanding the physical processes that determine the persistence of AR events will be of importance in assessing the risk of future flooding over north-western Europe and other mid-latitude regions.'

"A grieving man recently widowed was so moved by seeing a young couple enjoying each other's company while out dining on Tuesday that he paid for their meal in a very generous ‘pay it forward’ gesture. The heart-warming incident happened at an unnamed restaurant in Barrie, Ontario, where Lee Ballantyne was dining alone for the first time since his wife Carol had passed away from cancer on December 30. As Lee watched the young couple and reflected on his 43 years of marriage he was so inspired that he wrote the couple a touching note on a napkin and paid their check. Lee Ballantyne, the grieving husband who paid for a young couple's dinner last week in Barrie, Ontario, because they reminded him of his recently deceased wife Carol, has modestly described his kind-hearted act as a 'selfish' gesture so he would feel better . ‘You don't know me, but my beautiful wife of 43 years died last week. Tonight I dined alone for the first time. You remind me of us many years ago. Please allow me to buy your dinner. It will put a smile on Carol's face and make me happy... for now,’ he wrote. The touching gesture has come to light after a photo of the napkin was posted on the social media site Reddit by user Turboturtle08, who explained that his friend owned the restaurant and that she had taken the photo after talking to the very grateful couple, who haven’t been named. When the note was initially posted on Reddit it attracted a mixed response from other posters, many of whom questioned its authenticity. This prompted the Ballantyne’s son Jason, who posts as Axe34, to respond to the internet trolls and confirm that the note was indeed authentic and the incident had really happened. ‘I know this won't convince those who don't want to believe it could be true but here's the deal,’ wrote Jason. Carol and Lee Ballantyne were high school sweethearts who married in 1970, she was diagnosed with lung cancer last Sept and died on Dec 30 . ‘Mom died on Dec. 30. Dad went to dinner last night [Tuesday] and then told me this morning about what he did. A friend sent us the link to the photo that had been uploaded here. It's all true. That's my dad's abysmal handwriting.’ In another post, Jason explained that he had written about his mom’s death because it helped him ‘process his feelings’ and he posted links to his personal blog and to his mom’s obituary. ‘I'm posting a link in the hopes it might help some of those so quick to dismiss the loss of a loved one see that not only is the story true but it's about real people dealing with a devastating loss,’ he wrote. Carol Ballantyne, who was 62, died over the holidays after being diagnosed with lung cancer in September. In her obit, Carol was remembered as a ‘loving and nurturing mother and grandmother.’ She and her husband had been high school sweethearts, who had married in 1970 and gone on to have three sons and five grandchildren, ‘her pride and joy’. Jason Ballantyne, pictured left as a baby and right in more recent times, responded to the internet trolls to confirm that the note was authentic and that the incident had really occurred . Carol was remembered as ‘a talented artist, an avid gardener, a seamstress who made clothes for her children, and an excellent cook and baker.’ Her funeral took place on January 5. Lee Ballantyne has been described as a ‘strong, compassionate man’ by his friend and former colleague Chris Malette, who is a journalist for The Belleville Intelligence. In his weekly column, Malette revealed that Lee had told his Facebook friends about his kind gesture on Wednesday. ‘Lee wasn't looking for accolades, just wanted to share his way of spreading the love and grieving in his own way,’ wrote Malette. He also wrote that the ‘inspirational’ gesture of kindness had made him proud to call Lee a friend. ‘Many of us struggle with the loss of a loved one. Lee and Carol were an inspiration in coping – most always, at least to us friends and family – with a smile and a kind word, caring always about how the rest of us were faring. ‘Now he moves on to a new chapter in his life without his dear wife and it's heartening to see he's taking the next steps on the wings of an angel.’ Jason Ballantyne, who posts as Axe34, was quick to respond to the internet trolls and confirm that the note was indeed authentic and the incident had really happened .","Lee Ballantyne lost his wife of 43 years, Carol, to cancer at the end of last year .

"The Obama administration arranged for Hollywood filmmakers to have special access to government officials involved in the commando operation that killed Osama bin Laden, it has been revealed. Conservative legal group Judicial Watch posted what it claimed was 153 pages of Pentagon documents and 113 pages of CIA documents about the film project on its website yesterday. The paper trail revealed that filmmakers were given access to top White House officials, the identity of a SEAL team member involved in the raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan and were taken to the top-secret 'vault' where the attack was planned. Access Hollywood: Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal . have been given special privileges to White House, CIA and Pentagon information to make a film about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden . The exchanges were between White House, CIA, Pentagon officials and Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, the director and screenwriter of The Hurt Locker, a 2008 film about the Iraq war that won an Oscar for Best Picture. The film project, titled Zero Dark Thirty about the May 2011 raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, became a focus of controversy last year when it was reported that its release date was weeks before the November 6 election - timed to boost President Obama's image to voters. Producers have now pushed the release back to December. The documents were obtained through a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act - which can be used to force government agencies to release undisclosed information. Neither the CIA nor the Pentagon disputed the authenticity of the documents. A spokesman for the National Security Council said the White House would have no comment on the documents beyond those issued last August by press secretary Jay Carney, who said the Obama administration had not given the filmmakers classified information. Destined for Hollywood: President Obama, VP Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton watch the raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan . The CIA and Pentagon said there was nothing unusual about their dealings with the filmmakers. 'The CIA has been open about our engagement with writers, documentary filmmakers, movie and TV producers, and others in the entertainment industry,' said Jennifer Youngblood, an agency spokeswoman. She added: 'Our goal is an accurate portrayal of the men and women of the CIA, their vital mission and the commitment to public service that defines them. 'The protection of national security equities is always paramount in any engagement with the entertainment industry.' Pentagon spokesman George Little said: 'The Department of Defence, as well as other agencies and departments, regularly engage with the entertainment industry to inform projects ranging from books to documentaries to feature films. 'Many individuals in the industry expressed interest in developing projects on what can only be described as one of the top intelligence and military successes of a generation. Our engagement on these projects was driven by a desire to inform, not by timing.' One to watch: A film about the Navy SEAL raid which led to the death of bin Laden in May 2011 was originally planned for release weeks before the November 6 elections - but has been pushed back . In a statement posted on its website, Judicial Watch said the documents indicated that the Pentagon granted Bigelow and Boal access to a 'planner, Operator and Commander of SEAL Team Six,' the Navy commando unit that carried out the raid during which bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Included was a transcript of a July 14, 2011, meeting with Pentagon officials in which Bigelow and Boal indicate that Boal met with White House National Security Council official Denis McDonough and chief counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan to discuss the film project. The transcript quotes Michael Vickers, the Pentagon's intelligence chief, giving the filmmakers the identity of a senior SEAL team member involved in the raid on the condition that 'you not reveal his name in any way as a consultant, because... he shouldn't be talking out of school'. Judicial Watch said that it also obtained an internal CIA email that indicates Bigelow and Boal were granted access to 'the vault' - a CIA installation where some of the planning for the bin Laden raid took place. Other correspondence released by the government indicated that although they were helping the filmmakers, Obama administration officials otherwise sought to limit media access to those involved in the bin Laden operation and other counter-terrorism insiders. Glamor: Jessica Chastain and Chris Pratt will reportedly star in the film titled Zero Dark Thirty scheduled for release in December . In another email, from June 13, 2011, Intelligence chief Vickers advises Douglas Wilson, the Pentagon's public affairs chief, that the Defence Department 'would like to shape the story to prevent any gross inaccuracies,' but it did not 'want to make it look like the commanders think it's okay to talk to the media'. Judicial Watch said another Pentagon email described how a representative of the Glover Park Group, a Washington lobbying firm with close ties to the Democratic Party, helped arrange the filmmakers' access to administration officials. The Glover Park group had no immediate comment. The protection of national security equities is always paramount in any engagement with the entertainment industry. Jennifer Youngblood, CIA spokeswoman . An investigation was undertaken by Judicial Watch into the Obama administration's dealings with the filmmakers after seeing press reports suggesting that the administration might have leaked classified information as source material for the film. Maureen Dowd, a columnist for the New York Times, wrote last year that the movie was scheduled to open on October 12, just more than three weeks before the November 6 presidential election. After the column appeared, U.S. Representative Peter King, the outspoken Republican who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, asked the Inspectors General of both the Pentagon and CIA to investigate the administration's dealings with the filmmakers, suggesting in a letter that he was concerned about leaks of classified information. At the time, White House spokesman Jay Carney rejected King's suggestion that security had been compromised as 'ridiculous' and denied the White House had disclosed any classified information to the filmmakers. The movie is being filmed in India and Jordan and stars Chris Pratt, Jessica Chastain and Joel Edgerton, according to movie website IMDB. With release scheduled for December 19, the movie is produced by Megan Ellison, daughter of Oracle Corp chief Larry Ellison, and backed by Sony Pictures. Media reports have said the release was delayed until after the presidential election to prevent the project from being associated with partisan politics. As the presidential campaign has heated up, some Republicans have accused Obama and the White House of exploiting the bin Laden raid and other counter-terrorism successes for political purposes.","Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, who made Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker, given access .

"A British al-Qaeda supergrass told yesterday how Osama Bin Laden gave him a hug and wished him well on his suicide bombing mission. Gloucester-born Saajid Badat was about to fly to the UK with explosives hidden in his shoes when he met the 9/11 mastermind in Pakistan just two months after the World Trade Centre and Pentagon terror attacks. 'He said the American economy is like a chain, if you strike one link you bring the entire thing down,' Badat told the trial of hook-handed Finsbury Park hate preacher Abu Hamza in New York. Saajid Badat (large screen) appeared via video link at the trial of hate preacher Abu Hamza (far left). Badat told New York Federal Court he met Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan two months after the 9/11 attacks . 'My understanding was that link was the aviation industry. 'Osama Bin Laden told me religion was central to justify al-Qaeda goals, motions and actions. 'He gave me a hug and wished me well.' Badat was given a pair of shoes with bombs concealed in the soles. He gave one to a group of Malaysian jihadists, then wore the other as he flew back to the UK. He told New York Federal Court that his mission was to find a suitable flight at a later date and set off the shoe bomb in mid-air. American, transatlantic and European routes were discussed during brainstorming sessions with Bin Laden’s deputy Khalid Sheik Mohammed. He said they also discussed plans to hijack a plane and crash it into Canary Wharf – then London’s tallest building. 'Hug': Osama Bin Laden 'hugged' Badat in Pakistan and told him how to 'break' the chain that forms America . Badat said he discussed plans to fly a plane into Canary Wharf with Bin Laden months after the 9/11 attacks . Bin Laden’s deputy, now in American custody and due to stand trial on terrorism charges, told Badat and other would-be suicide bombers to avoid checking flight paths on the internet. 'He instructed us on how to communicate with each other in general language and using swear words,' he said. 'The belief was that practicing, devout Muslims would not use that kind of language.' Badat, who was speaking via video link from the UK, ultimately backed out of the shoe-bombing after talking to his dad. 'I reconnected with my parents back in the United Kingdom,' he said. 'My father knew I had travelled to Afghanistan but he didn’t know who I was associating with. 'He’d heard of sleepers – covert terrorist operators – and said if he found out I was a sleeper he would kill me.' Abu Hamza faces life in jail. His trial in New York is expected to last five weeks . Badat’s associate Richard Reid was over-powered by passengers while attempting to light one of his shoe bombs on a flight from Paris to Miami. Badat, now 35, was arrested and jailed for his part in the conspiracy. His 15-year sentence was slashed when he agreed to testify against other alleged terrorists including Hamza. He was freed in 2010 after just five years in jail and last month gave evidence via video link against Osama bin Laden’s son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith. At yesterday’s hearing Badat told how he’d left home as a teenager and moved to London, where he became involved in a radical Muslim youth movement called the Tooting Circle. He told the court that he had twice heard Hamza preach at the Finsbury Park mosque in 1997. 'It was very crowded, there were hundreds there. Hamza, I saw had no arms and his tone was shouting,' he said. After hearing Hamza speak, Badat said he travelled with other members of the Tooting Circle to Bosnia to see how Muslims were fighting there. From there he went to Afghanistan and Pakistan for al-Qaeda training. Hamza, wearing a navy blue prison t-shirt and black jogging trousers, without the hooks he usually uses for hands, stared intently at the video screen and made notes using a fake arm with a clasp and pen attached to it. The 56-year-old one-eyed cleric has pleaded not guilty to 11 terrorism charges including a 1998 attack on tourists in Yemen that killed four. Hamza, who lost his hands and eye during an explosion in Afghanistan, was extradited from the UK two years ago. His trial is expected to last five weeks and if convicted he faces life in jail.

Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law prohibiting what he called the spread of 'gay propaganda' among minors, and promoting 'traditional values'. Putin claims gay people in Russia are not discriminated against, and the law was needed only to protect young people. However, members of the gay community say the law has led to increased problems for them. The 'gay propaganda' law caused outrage and protests in the West, particularly in the run-up to the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in February.

"Classical scholars have made an unusually large find of religious seals and amulets in an ancient sanctuary in Turkey. The discovery, which researchers are describing as ‘unparalleled’, was made close to the ancient city of Doliche at a former worship site. Researchers uncovered more than 600 stamp seals and amulets at the site dating back from the 7th to the 4th centuries BC. Researchers have uncovered more than 600 stamp seals and amulets at the site dating back to the 7th to the 4th centuries BC . ‘Such large amounts of seal consecrations are unheard-of in any comparable sanctuary’, said excavation director Dr Engelbert Winter. ‘The amazingly large number proves how important seals and amulets were for the worshipping of the god to whom they were consecrated as votive offerings,’ he added. The artifacts, identified as late Babylonian, local Syrian Achaemenid and Levantine seals,  were found at the ancient sanctuary of Jupiter Dolichenus, who was one of the most important deities of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century AD. Many pieces show scenes of adoration and provide a surprisingly vivid insight into the faith of the time. This late Babylonian seal found at the site depicts a praying man in front of divine symbols . Jupiter Dolichenus was one of the most important deities of the Roman Empire. He became identified with the Zoroastrian god Ahura Mazda as a lord of the universe. Returning legions carried his cult to Rome, where it became popular in the 2nd–3rd century AD. In Roman mystery religion he was believed to control military success and safety. He was usually represented standing on a bull holding a double ax and thunderbolt. Jupiter Dolichenus was the god of a Roman cult – the practices of which are still shrouded in a huge amount of mystery. The cult involved secret ceremonies known only to those initiated. Researchers hope the large find will help them  learn more about these practices. The stamp seals and cylinder seals, as well as scarabs, were made of glass, stone and quartz ceramics. Different themes were found ranging from geometric ornaments and astral symbols to elaborate depictions of animals and people. They included praying men in front of divine symbols. The excavations took place at the Jupiter Dolichenus sanctuary which is located at the Turkish mountain Dülük Baba Tepesi . Another popular theme was a royal hero fighting animals and hybrid creatures. During the excavations at the sanctuary, located at the Turkish mountain Dülük Baba Tepesi, Professor Winter’s team worked in an area of over 500 square metres. ‘The results are already extending our knowledge of all periods in this holy place’s long history,’ he said. ‘It covers the time span from the early place of worship of the Iron Age and the sacred site of the Roman era, famous throughout the empire, to the long phase of utilisation as a Christian monastery, which existed until well into the time of the crusaders.'","The seals and amulets date back from the 7th to the 4th centuries BC .

"Barack Obama may have got worse high school grades than George W Bush after new evidence showed the current president was among a college class with poor average SAT scores. Doubts about the supposedly superior intellect of Mr Obama were first raised after he refused to release his academic record. He has also made some factual errors during his time in the job – although he is still a very long way behind his gaff-prone predecessor. Hiding his grades? Barack Obama as a Columbia student in the early 1980s. He has refused to release his academic record and now a report sugests that he was among one of the lowest ever achieving group of transfer students to the university in New York . But now it has emerged that Mr Obama was among a 1981 intake of transfers to New York’s Columbia University that was at the time branded one of the worst ever. The president, who moved from Occidental Community College in Los Angeles, was among 67 students whose average combined math and verbal score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test is a 1,100, according to a report obtained by Breitbart News. Freshman: George W Bush wearing a Yale cap during his first year at the university in 1964 . By comparison, Mr Bush – who earned a history degree from Yale in 1968 – got 1206 out of a possible 1600 points in the same test he took at Andover boarding school in Massachusetts. If Mr Obama, who majored in political science at Columbia, were near the average of that year, it would mean he had worse high school grades than a president derided by many as the dumbest in history. Of course, Mr Obama went on to distinguish himself by going on to earn the second highest honour in a graduate law degree at Harvard . And he became the first black president of the prestigious legal journal, the Harvard Law Review. He also taught at the University of Chicago for twelve years – with eight years spent as senior lecturer in constitutional law. But, the possibility that he got lower high school scores than Mr Bush, would take some of the shine off his image as an intellectual heavyweight. In his autobiography, Dreams From My Father, Mr Obama describes himself as an unfocused high school student whose mother criticised him for being a ‘loafer’. The two presidents: Mr Obama beside Mr Bush during a speech in 2010 . He also describes his attitude toward his studies at Occidental as ‘indifferent’ and called himself a ‘bum’ who was notorious for partying. However, despite his apparent lack of focus, he was able to win a place at Columbia. Of the 450 students applied to transfer to the Ivy League university in 1981, only 67 were admitted, according to the Columbia Spectator. This compared to 650 applicants just four years before, signifying that those who wanted to study there has lower grades. A November 18, 1981 article in the Columbia Spectator revealed the SAT average for the transfer intake that year. Prestigious: The Low Memorial Library at Columbia University . It stated: ‘On paper at least, the quality of the students accepted [as transfers] has declined along with the number of applicants, the officials say.’ In that story, Robert Boatti, the then Assistant Dean of Admissions, also attributed the drop in transfer application to the College’s policy of requiring transfer students to take courses in its core curriculum and to the limited availability of financial aid for them. ‘He had said that many come from community colleges, rather than the nation’s top schools. ‘Even the unhappiest people don’t transfer from Harvard,’ Boatti added.","Average SAT score of Obama's 1981 transfer group to Columbia was 1,100 .

"The policeman who arrested Mel Gibson for suspected drink-driving has blasted Gary Oldman for accusing him of making anti-Semitic comments and racist remarks about African-Americans. In the now infamous Playboy interview in which Gary Oldman said 'political correctness was c**p', the actor also he doubted whether the arresting officer had never used a racist term. Gibson, 58, made anti-Jewish slurs when he was arrested in 2006 in Malibu, two years after his film The Passion Of The Christ was criticised for depicting Jews negatively. James Mee (right) the policeman who arrested Mel Gibson in 2006 for suspect drink-driving has blasted Gary Oldman, left,  for accusing him of making anti-Semitic comments and racist remarks about African-Americans . And in the interview which is out later this month Oldman sided with Gibson saying: 'We're all f**king hypocrites. That's what I think about it. The policeman who arrested him has never used the word n****r or that f**king Jew?"" ' The comments have angered James Mee, the officer who arrested Gibson, and he has hit back telling TMZ: 'I'm Jewish and why would I say that to discredit my own religious makeup?' 'The N-word is a scary word.  I would never even dream of using it.  It sickens me that anyone would use that word.' 'Jews have been persecuted and put down over the years. Why would I, as a Jew, do that to other races?' Notorious: Mel Gibson has been an Hollywood outcast since his infamous drink-driving arrest in Malibu in 2006 . According . to the police report, Gibson made anti-Semitic remarks to the  saying: 'F****** Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the . wars in the world.' He has since apologised for his 'despicable' behavior, explaining that the comments were 'blurted out in a moment of insanity'. He was sentenced to three years probation and entered a rehab programme as well as attending self help meetings for alcoholics. In the wide-ranging interview in Playboy's July/August double issue out on Friday that covers Oldman's 'wild nights' with groupies and his four . marriages, the actor - whose new movie Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is . out next month - says: 'I don't know about Mel. He got drunk and said a . few things, but we've all said those things. 'Mel . Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews and he said the wrong thing . because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him - and . doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough. 'He’s like an outcast, a leper, you know? 'But . some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn’t turned and said, “That . f***ing kraut” or “F*** those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and . try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me.' 'We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That’s what gets me. It’s just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone, that we all stand on this thing going, “Isn’t that shocking?”' After . then jokingly saying, 'f*** the Pope,' the True Romance actor admitted . the interview had taken a fateful turn, and insisted he was not 'a . bigot.' Working . class Londoner Oldman, who is the son of a welder, said: 'No, but I’m defending . all the wrong people. I’m saying Mel’s all right.' Following news of his comments yesterday Oldman issued a grovelling apology. Oldman's controversial interview has derailed his tour promoting Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes . After he was attacked over his choice . of words by the Anti-Defamation League, he issued his fawning apology, . in which he hailed Jews as 'the chosen people.' The 56-year-old insisted he is a huge admirer of the contribution Jewish people have made to showbusiness. He in a statement: . 'If, during the interview, I had been asked to elaborate on this point I . would have pointed out that I had just finished reading Neal Gabler’s . superb book about the Jews and Hollywood, An Empire of Their Own: How . the Jews invented Hollywood. 'The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution. 'I hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt, genuine, and that I . have an enormous personal affinity for the Jewish people in general, . and those specifically in my life.'

"A new book has branded Thailand one of the world’s most dangerous tourist destinations. Australian author John Stapleton suggests that widespread police corruption, violence and crime are all blighting a country once commonly referred to as the ‘Land of Smiles’. In his book Thailand: Deadly Destination, Mr Stapleton attempts to expose the reputation of Thailand as a welcoming country, claiming a boom in tourism since the 1960s has created a hatred of foreigners and a ‘murderous indifference’ to the millions of tourists who flock to the country’s white-sand beaches, picturesque countryside and thriving nightlife each year. Scroll down for video . The country’s much-prized tourist industry, which accounts for 10 percent of the GDP, is in decay following more than 12 months of political unrest . He also says that the death rate among tourists, which he claims often goes unrecorded, is ‘the worst scandal in the annals of modern tourism’. ‘Thailand’s carefully manufactured reputation for hospitality, as a land of palm trees and sun-drenched beaches, happy-hour bars, world class hotels and welcoming people, as paradise on Earth, is very different to the reality many tourists encounter,’ Mr Stapleton says in the book, which is being published next week. ‘The rapid growth in Thai tourism has been a triumph of advertising and image creation; building the perception, firmly entrenched in the West, that Thais embrace strangers. ‘In reality, the relations between ethnic Thais and foreigners are often difficult; and there has been growing friction and disengagement, a drift from curiosity to contempt, as visitor numbers have increased. In the first nine months of 2014, there were more than two million fewer foreign tourists who visited Thailand compared with the same period a year previously . ‘While many foreigners leave the country happy, there are equally thousands of travellers from Europe, America, Australia, India and the Middle East, both short-time tourists and long-term residents, leaving the country impoverished, distressed, frightened and unlikely to ever return. ‘If, with the murder or accidental deaths of tourists a common event, they leave at all. ‘Life in Thailand is cheap. And the deaths of foreigners often go unlamented; even unrecorded. Tourists are still given few warnings of the reality of the situation they are entering.’ Mr Stapleton previously worked as a news reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald from 1986 to 1994 and for The Australian between 1994 to 2009. He has been visiting Thailand since the 1970s before moving there in 2010. After being repeatedly robbed and attacked, he began looking into news reports on the welfare of tourists, which he describes as ‘scandalous’, suggesting that the police have little interest in helping foreigners who report crimes. From an initial forecast at the end of last year of 30.27 million foreign visitor arrivals Thailand’s Ministry of Tourism and Sports is now forecasting 25.5 million foreign visitors in 2015 . Figures released by the British government showed that between 2011 and 2012 there were 296 British deaths in Thailand. In the 12 months up to April 1, 2013 there were 389 British deaths in Thailand, while in the same period up to April 2014 there were 362 deaths and 267 hospitalisations of British tourists. Mr Stapleton said: ‘The attitude of murderous indifference to the welfare of strangers is ingrained enough in the Thai psyche for it to justify formal government warnings to the many hundreds of thousands of tourists venturing into the bars and clubs of Thailand on a nightly basis. ‘It is standard operating procedure in Thailand for the bars and clubs to pay bribes to the local police and municipal authorities in order to be able to open their doors. ‘If a bar, club or parlour does not make this payment in all likelihood they will be closed down. 'The police are not acting in the best interests of the visitors making complaints for the simple reason that they are being paid by bar and club owners; the commonplace complaints of tourists about being robbed are simply shrugged off.' As well as the murder of British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller in mid-September, there was a bloody military coup in Thailand in May . Thailand's much-prized tourist industry, which accounts for 10 per cent of the country's GDP, is in decay following more than 12 months of political unrest. As well as the murder of two British backpackers in mid-September, there was a bloody military coup  earlier this year. In the first nine months of 2014, there were more than two million fewer foreign tourists who visited Thailand compared with the same period a year previously. From an initial forecast at the end of last year of 30.27 million foreign visitor arrivals, Thailand’s Ministry of Tourism and Sports is now forecasting 25.5 million foreign visitors in 2015. Talking about the country’s widespread crime, Mr Stapleton adds: ‘Visitors to Thailand are not warned by travel agents, airlines or their own governments that their passports are highly prized in Thailand. Australian author and journalist John Stapleton has written a new book  branding Thailand one of the world's most dangerous destinatons. It will be released next week . ‘Depending on the nationality, a passport can fetch thousands of dollars on the black market, several months’ pay for many Thais. 'There are gangs stealing passports to order. European, American, Australian and Canadian passports are particularly prized. ‘There is an established practice across the country of bike, car, jet-ski and other rental services requiring passports as collateral. When punters return to claim their documents, they have disappeared.' Stapleton adds: ‘The daily robbing, bashing, drugging, extortion and murder of foreign tourists on Thai soil, along with numerous scandals involving unsafe facilities and well established scams, has led to frequent predictions that Thailand’s multi-billion dollar tourist industry will self-destruct.' British backpackers Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were killed  on the island of Koh Tao in September . The book's author claims that those who know Thailand well were unsurprised by the murder of British tourists Hannah Witheridge, 23, and 24-year-old David Miller, who were killed in an attack on the island of Koh Taoin September. He said: ‘The international coverage of the recent brutal killing of two British backpackers on the island of Koh Tao has highlighted what many long-time observers of Thailand already knew, that its tourist industry is poorly managed and the Land of Smiles has come to justifiably be regarded as one of the most dangerous tourist destinations on Earth.’ The UK government has issued official warnings about violence to the 860,000 British tourists who travel to Thailand each year. Asked why he decided to write the book, Stapleton told the MailOnline: ‘At the beginning of 2010, uncertain of what to do next after leaving full-time journalism, I decided to head to Thailand, which I remembered fondly from previous visits. ‘It only came to me slowly, after having my drinks repeatedly spiked, being robbed, bashed and having my passport stolen, that Thailand was not quite The Land of Smiles that I had once thought it to be. Australian author John Stapleton began visiting Thailand in the 1970s before moving there in 2010 . ‘I badly wanted to live in Thailand, and spent more than three years in and around Bangkok. Unlike many expatriates and tourists, I spent a lot of time with the Thais themselves. ‘Having spent so much time with them, I finally began to understand how they thought; and to understand that they actively dislike foreigners, have no compunction in robbing them, and that their cultural distaste for foreigners and ultra-nationalistic pride in their own country fuels and justifies the crimes against tourists.' He added: ‘Unfortunately, with millions of tourists besieging the country, the locals’ response to foreigners has gone from curiosity to contempt. ‘Overwhelmed with millions of tourists, many of whom appear to save their worst behaviour for the streets and bars of Thailand, cries of “Mai Chop Farang”, I don’t like foreigners, and “Thailand is for Thais” can be heard from one end of the country to the other. ‘Those who think that mishaps only befall those who are misbehaving are fooling themselves.' Britons are warned that assaults and robberies are reported regularly in the Koh Samui archipelago . The Foreign Office warns British travellers: 'Western tourists including British nationals have been victims of vicious, unprovoked attacks by individuals and gangs in Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao (the Samui archipelago). In January 2013 a British national was killed in a shooting incident while at a beach party in Haad Rin on Koh Phanang and in September 2014, 2 British nationals were killed in Tao.' It adds: 'Violent sexual assaults and robberies against both men and women are reported regularly in the Koh Samui archipelago and Krabi province. These are particularly common during the monthly Full Moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars.' A spokesman for the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) dismissed Mr Stapleton’s claims of the dangers facing tourists, calling them ‘an exaggeration’. ‘TAT are of course disappointed to hear of this but as an organisation has much confidence in Thailand as a tourist destination as do the 860,000, and growing, number of British travellers who visit Thailand annually. They said: ‘The vast majority of visitors enjoy a safe and trouble free time and 65 percent repeat tourist arrivals is testament to how much they love Thailand and wish to return year on year. ‘This number wouldn’t be so high if tourists didn’t feel safe and enjoy visiting our country. ‘Accidents, robberies and deaths are not exclusive to Thailand, sadly we read tragic news stories about tourists travelling all over the world. A spokesman for the Tourism Authority of Thailand called Mr Stapleton's claims ‘an exaggeration’ ‘The author, John Stapleton’s, book title is somewhat an exaggeration and we are certain that those who come across this book will conclude themselves that Thailand is by no means the most dangerous country in the world to visit. ‘Tourist safety remains of upmost importance and priority to TAT. Thailand accepts that some of the country’s safety and security measures need to be improved and just this month the Prime Minister of Thailand, Prayut Chan-o-cha and the Minister of Tourism & Sport, Mrs Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul announced several new measures to upgrade and improve safety standards within the travel and tourism industry. ‘As always, we recommend tourists exercise common sense and courtesy, be considerate and respect local culture and law when travelling abroad to ensure a problem free and rewarding holiday.’","Thailand: Deadly Destination penned by Australian author John Stapleton .

"Over 100,000 people have signed a petition to prevent convicted rapist Ched Evans from returning to play for his former club Sheffield United. The former Wales international was jailed for five-years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire - but is now preparing to be released from prison within days. Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor had stated that the 25-year-old should be allowed to return to the game, saying: 'I didn't know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still can't do anything.' Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence . Gordon Taylor  believes Evans should be allowed to play professional football again . Tony Adams - Was miles over the drink-drive limit when he crashed his car into a wall in 1990 and spent 57 days in prison. After release, captained Arsenal and England with distinction. Lee Hughes - Served three years for causing death by dangerous driving in 2003. Played for Oldham and Port Vale among others following his release. Joey Barton - Was imprisoned for 77 days in 2008 after being convicted of assault outside a McDonald's. Now playing for QPR. Duncan Ferguson - Jailed in 1994 for headbutting an opponent on the pitch, he went on to become an Everton hero. Jermaine Pennant - Another drink-driving conviction, the winger spent 30 days in prison then became the first Premier League player to take to the field wearing an electronic tag. However, 101,917 people have disagreed by signing the petition - while a counter petition by fans wishing to see Evans back at the League One club has attracted less than 5,000 names. Jean Hatchet, who started a charge.org petition, told the Daily Mirror: 'I'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. 'Unfortunately, he still hasn't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd re-sign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans. 'They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that the importance of gaining a woman's consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.' Evans arrived at the Blades for £3million in 2009, but was released along with 10 other players shortly after his conviction .

"The father of a young British man who has been lost in the thick bushland and gullies of Australia’s Blue Mountains for 10 bitterly cold nights today admitted he believes that his son is dead. David Tweddle, who has flown out to Australia from his home in Reading with his wife Michelle, has been waiting anxiously in the mountains as hundreds of searchers hunted for 23-year-old Gary Tweddle. Gary was last heard from during a late night phone call to friends staying at a hotel resort in the mountains, west of Sydney, when he told them he was lost in bushland. Losing hope: David Tweddle, 48, from Reading, pictured left, believes his missing 23-year-old son Gary Tweddle, pictured right, may have died after going missing in the Blue Mountains, Australia, for 10 days . Curiously, however, a motorist has told police that he saw a man answering Gary’s description - and wearing the same checkered pink shirt - trying to wave down a car at the roadside not far from the hotel shortly after midnight. It is not known if that sighting was before or after Gary told his friends that he was lost. His father today said in a farewell message to his son which he posted on Facebook that he loved him very much - but told followers that what had been a search and rescue operation conducted by police and fire service officials had now been re-classifeid as a ‘recovery operation’. The change of circumstances in the search means that rescuers are now looking for a body, rather than someone who might have been able to survive the unforgiving conditions during which temperatures have dropped below zero at night. In an emotional message to his son, who moved to Australia four years ago to start a new life and had won a top job at a technology firm, Mr Tweddle wrote: ‘I miss and love you unconditionally, Gaz. Missing: Gary Tweddle, 23, had gone for a walk from his hotel in the mountains, near Sydney, when he called friends to say he was lost in bushland - that was the last time anyone heard from him . ‘I am so proud of all you have achieved at Oracle’  - the technology company - ‘and with your private life. The depth of this pride is infinite. You are a true star in all our lives. ‘We have had so many incredible times together in UK, ZA (South Africa) and Goa to name a few and there is nothing I would not give for 1 more second of time with you. ‘Money, possessions and material becomes irrelevant now. It’s all about time, so my closing message to you my friends is cherish every second you are fortunate enough to have with the people you love. ‘Waste not one moment, be available and show love at every opportunity. I love you so much son, so, so much. Dad X.’ Mr Tweddle compared Gary’s plight with that of British bushwalker Jamie Neale, who was found alive after going missing for 12 days in the Blue Mountains at the same time of year four years ago. Mr Neale was wearing warm clothes and had supplies in a backpack, whereas Gary, who had earlier been drinking with his friends before deciding to take a walk from the resort hotel, was wearing just a shirt and jeans. Mr Tweddle and Gary’s stepmother are expected to return to the UK at the weekend or early next week.

"Burglars have struck twice at Peaches Geldof’s home since her death last month, police revealed last night. The house where Bob Geldof’s daughter lived with her husband, Thomas Cohen, and their two children has been targeted by thieves in recent weeks. CCTV had been installed in the £1million home, in Wrotham, Kent, but the cameras were damaged by the trespassers. Peaches Geldof with her husband Tom Cohen and sons Phaedra, left, and Astala right.

A red ride-on lawnmower, which featured in one of their family photographs taken before Miss Geldof’s death, was stolen in the first incident in mid-April. No items were stolen in the second attack, which happened on Friday. Miss Geldof was found dead in her home on April 7. Mr Cohen found her slumped in her bed after he had been unable to contact her the night before. It was revealed at the opening of the TV presenter and columnist’s inquest that recent heroin use ‘was likely to have played a role’ in her death. Peaches Geldof's house in Wrotham in Kent, pictured at the time of her death, which has been targeted by thieves . A spokesman for Kent Police told the Mail last night: ‘Police are investigating a burglary at an address in Wrotham on May 9. 'Officers were at the address within five minutes and no personal items are believed to have been stolen. ‘Additionally, in mid-April a lawnmower was reported to have been taken from the grounds.’ A source told The Sun: ‘The people who did this are just vultures.’ There has been speculation Mr Cohen would sell the house because of its association with his late wife’s death. The star’s death has tragic similarities to that of her mother, Paula Yates, who died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000 at the age of 41. After launching an investigation into Miss Geldof’s death, Kent Police said it was ‘unexplained with no third party’ involvement. Earlier this month, police confirmed that drugs paraphernalia had been found in Miss Geldof’s home following her death, and added that Mr Cohen was not under suspicion of any involvement.","Kent Police confirmed home has been targeted twice since her death .

"More than a third of workers are sleepwalking into a retirement nightmare because they have no plan for a pension, a new report has revealed. Many who are banking on a company pension will discover it is worth far less than hoped. Those newly auto-enrolled into company schemes are likely to be left disappointed, meanwhile, because contributions made over the years won't afford them the retirement they dreamed of. Planning ahead: Just a fifth of people are meeting savings targets for their pension, a report found (file photo) The report, compiled by a pension firm and a research centre, is drawn from research which also showed Britain lagging behind developing countries such as India and China. It will add to fears that Britain is sitting on a pensions time bomb, with the system unprepared for the demands put on it in years to come. Former Number 10 adviser and pensions expert Ros Altmann said: ‘This is another wake-up call. ‘If you leave planning your pension until the time of retirement, it is much too late. ‘Planning for later life is a journey and someone needs to help you get on the right path. ‘Pension schemes should have to send people regular statements explaining how to people make a financial plan and how important it is to have one.’ Speedy closure of final salary schemes is also to blame, the report said. At the end of last year, only 1.7million private sector workers were still contributing to a final salary pension scheme. In 1995, the figure was five million and as recently as 2008, there were still 2.6million. In 1997, more than a third (34 per cent) of staff at private sector companies were members of a final salary scheme but by 2012, this had slumped to just 8 per cent. Shock: Many on company pensions will find them less valuable than they first thought, it is claimed (file photo) The report from British pension provider Aegon, in collaboration with the U.S. research centre Transamerica Centre for Retirement Studies, asked 16,000 workers and retirees in 15 developed countries about their preparations for old age. In the UK, 900 employees and 100 fully-retired people were interviewed. It found 39 per cent have yet to save any money or consult a financial adviser about their later years. Nearly half admit they have an idea about retiring in their heads, but have yet to sit down and formally make a plan about how much they want – or how to save enough to get there. 'A good retirement income doesn't happen by accident. Current measures might . make sure most people don't starve but if you want any more than . that then you need to take responsibility for your own future' Tom McPhail, head of pensions at Hargreave Lansdown . The findings also showed that in Britain barely a fifth of people (22 per cent) said they were on track with their pension contributions to meet the target they needed for retirement. Half of workers also expect to continue working into their retirement and just 29 per cent expect to stop work entirely, even though their parents’ generation enjoyed such a privilege. A key conclusion was that in Britain the complexity of financial products and a lack of financial understanding ‘can make saving unnecessarily difficult’. In a bid to help address the problem, the Government has embarked on a series of radical reforms. These include the introduction of a new £155-a-week state pension in 2016 and an overhaul of the current system which forces savers to swap their pension savings for an annuity – or annual income for life – when they stop work. From next year, workers will no longer have to buy an annuity and will be able to access their pension pot from age 55. Overall, the UK ranks joint sixth with Canada in the retirement readiness index, behind countries like Germany and the U.S. Tom McPhail, head of pensions at Hargreave Lansdown wealth manager, said: ‘A good retirement income doesn't happen by accident. ‘The current measures such as auto enrolment and the state pension might make sure that most people don't starve but if you want any more than that then you need to take responsibility for your own future.’","Report said company pensions will prove far less valuable than people hope .

'I watched it and I was in disgust, I was so angry and ashamed,' he told the Evening Standard. 'We've done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it's brought it all right back down. 'I don't care if it's the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention Chelsea this will be the response. I can't believe this has come about.

Powerful: The quake was felt as far away as New Delhi, the Indian capital, some 1,200 kilometers (about 740 miles) away, but no damage or injuries were immediately reported there . A Pakistani Navy team reached the island by midday Wednesday, navy geologist Mohammed Danish told the country's Geo Television. He said the mass was about 60 feet (18 meters) high, 100 feet (30 meters) long and 250 feet (76 meters) wide. 'There are stones and mud,' he said, warning residents not to try to visit the island. 'Gasses are still emitting.' But dozens of people had already visited the island, said the deputy commissioner of Gwadar district, Tufail Baloch, who traveled by boat himself to the island Wednesday morning. Water bubbled along the edges of the island, in what appeared to be gas discharging from under the surface, Baloch said. He said the area smelled of gas that caught fire when people lit cigarettes.

"New documents filed by the U.S. Justice Department against Libyan militant Ahmed Abu Khatallah further shut down claims made by the Obama administration that the Benghazi attack sprouted from from an anti-islam film. The documents come after recent comments made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that some of the attackers may have been influenced by the online video. The court filings make clear those who organized the attack were part of a 'conspiracy' involving several members of the Ansar al-Sharia 'Islamic extremist militia', reports Fox News. The government are trying to ensure Khatallah remains behind bars. Scroll down for video . In custody: Ahmed Abu Khatalla, pictured, was in federal law enforcement custody .

Khattala leaves the federal U.S. District Court Saturday after Khattala . pleaded not guilty to conspiracy at his first appearance in federal . court in the U.S. A motion filed Tuesday says that in the days preceding the attack, the defendant 'voiced concern and opposition to the presence of an American facility in Benghazi'. A group of 20 or more 'armed men', including militia members, assembled outside the U.S. compound at 9:45 p.m. the night of Sept. 11, 2012, and 'aggressively breached' the gate carrying rifles, handguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. They then stole a U.S. vehicle, 'forcibly entered' buildings and stole U.S. property. 'During this initial attack, buildings within the Mission were set on fire,' the court document says, according to Fox Noews. The attack 'ultimately led to the deaths' of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information Management Officer Sean Smith. Some personnel were able to escape the a nearby building. Khatallah entered the compound and 'supervised the exploitation of material from the scene'. The government motion went on to describe how Khatallah spent the days following the attack obtaining weapons and other equipment to defend himself 'from feared American retaliation' and capture. The documents are part of the case the U.S. government is building against him as the defendant is prosecuted in federal civilian court.

The defendant is being held at a detention center outside Washington, D.C. At a hearing on Wednesday, a Khatallah defense attorney complained that the defense team had limited access to the Justice Department's evidence. The details in the first few U.S. court documents are a far cry from the Obama administration's initial narrative. officials said the impetus of the attack was an anti-Islam video that was 'the result of opportunism, taking advantage of and exploiting what was happening as a result of reaction to the video that was found to be offensive'. Then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice infamously cited the video on several Sunday shows after the attack. The Obama administration has since acknowledged that there was no protest leading up to the attack, as there had been in other countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The State Department's Accountability Review Board report concluded 'there was no protest prior to the attacks, which were unanticipated in their scale and intensity'. The motivation of the attackers is still not known. Clinton, in her new book Hard Choices, argued that it is 'inaccurate' to say no one was influenced by the video. 'I was trying to make sense of it. I think that the investigations that have been carried out basically conclude we can't say that everybody was influenced [by the video], and we can't say everybody wasn't,' she said in a Fox News interview. Even a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in January said: 'Some intelligence suggests the attacks were likely put together in short order, following that day's violent protests in Cairo against an inflammatory video.'","Ahmed Abu Khattala faces .

"Hundreds of Nigerian criminals will be sent home to serve out prison sentences under a deal set to be struck by ministers within weeks. Talks are continuing into reaching a compulsory prisoner transfer agreement, which could see more than half of the 500 criminals from Nigeria currently in UK jails repatriated. Prisons minister Jeremy Wright told MailOnline how 'more foreign prisoners must serve their sentences in their own countries'. Deportation: Ministers want to send hundreds of Nigerian criminals to serve out their sentence at home to cut the cost for British taxpayers . Ministers have been ordered to step up efforts to end the scandal of more than one in eight prisoners being from overseas. David Cameron vowed to end the practice of the British taxpayer picking up the bill for criminals with no business in the UK. The Prime Minister said in 2010 that he would ’personally intervene’ to send more foreign criminals home. Britain has even made clear it would pay to build new prisons in countries like Nigeria to speed up the process of sending foreign criminals home. Up to £1million has been promised to upgrade Nigerian jails, including a new wing at Kirikiri Prison in Lagos. But to date little progress has been made. When the coalition was formed there were 11,135 foreign prisoners in UK jails, and this figure has fallen by just three per cent since to 10,786. Each felon costs an average of around £40,000 a year to keep inside. Last week it was announced that notorious Liberian warlord Charles Taylor is to serve his 50-year sentence for war crimes in the UK. A prisoner-transfer agreement was struck with Albania earlier this year to 'free up space in prisons here and reduce the cost to the British taxpayer’. It was the first major bilateral prisoner transfer agreement with a country outside the European Union. There were around 250 Albanians in UK jails in June this year. But securing an agreement with Nigeria would be seen as a much more significant breakthrough. Latest figures show there were 534 Nigerian nationals in British jails, 485 men and 49 women. Nigerians account for one in 20 of all foreign prisoners, putting the country fifth in the league table of nations whose citizens have been jailed in the UK. Justice Minister Mr Wright said: ‘I am clear that more foreign prisoners must serve their sentences in their own countries. ‘That is why we are currently working with the Nigerian Government on a compulsory prisoner transfer agreement to increase the number of prisoners who are transferred. ‘Legislation allowing Nigeria to enter such an arrangement was passed earlier this year by the Nigerian Parliament. We are now working with them on the text of a final agreement.’ Overflowing jails abroad have made it increasingly difficult to deport prisoners to their own country. It is argued that by paying for building new jails or making existing ones more ‘comfortable’ so they approach British standards, will be repatriated. Deal: David Cameron, who promised to help Nigeria improves its jails, hopes to strike a deal with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan . In April Mr Cameron said: ‘When people are sent to prison in the UK we should do everything we can to make sure that if they’re foreign nationals, they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence in a foreign prison. ‘And I’m taking action in Government to say look we have strong relationships with all of the countries where these people come from. ‘Many are coming from Jamaica, many from Nigeria, many from other countries in Asia. ‘We should be using all of the influence we have to sign prisoner transfer agreements with those countries. Even if necessary frankly helping them to build prisons in their own country so we can send the prisoners home.’","A total of 534 Nigerian nationals are serving sentences in British prisons .

"A 42-year-old British arms dealer who is accused of smuggling 80,000 guns and 32 million rounds of ammunition worth £840,000 from China to Nigeria has dismissed the allegations as ‘ludicrous’. Gary Hyde, of Newton on Derwent, East Yorkshire, allegedly smuggled 40,000 AK47 assault rifles, 30,000 other rifles, 10,000 9mm pistols and the ammunition across the world in 2007. The York-based businessman - a former director of UK companies York Guns and Jago Ltd - is said to have organised the trade and transportation of the weapons in contravention of UK arms laws. Allegations: Gary Hyde, 42, of Newton on Derwent, East Yorkshire, is accused of smuggling 40,000 AK47 assault rifles, 30,000 other rifles, 10,000 9mm pistols and the ammunition across the world in 2007 . But this is the second time Hyde has faced the accusations and he continues to refute the charges, with his barrister telling Southwark Crown Court that the allegations are ‘completely ridiculous’. ‘The idea Mr Hyde sat down and made a decision to breach this law willy-nilly, knowing full well the consequences, is, we suggest, ludicrous’, Stephen Solley QC, defending, told the court. ‘Mr Hyde is a legitimate businessman, and to suggest he had a cavalier, couldn’t care less approach and is going to go ahead regardless we suggest that was simply not the picture. ‘The idea you could be sure this man put two fingers up to the criminal law knowingly is completely ridiculous.’ However, prosecutors say Hyde failed to obtain the correct export licence, and a record of flights in 2006 and 2007 to China when the sales allegedly happened has been put before the jury. But Mr Solley said prosecutors had not given a complete picture of Hyde’s travel, missing out several overseas trips not seen as relevant but gave a fuller picture of his working life. In court: Hyde's barrister told Southwark Crown Court (pictured) that the allegations are 'completely ridiculous' ‘Some people think there is a glamour to international travel,’ he told the court. ‘But the glamour wears off pretty quickly. What a struggle it must have been to keep up all the various components of his life, his English business, and his international business.’ 'The idea Mr Hyde sat down and made a decision to breach this law willy-nilly, knowing full well the consequences, is, we suggest, ludicrous' Stephen Solley QC, defending . Mr Solley told the court Hyde was working for one of the largest arms-dealing firms in the north east of England, juggling international deals, a domestic business, and his family life. He also pointed to 38 other potential deals with China which were being negotiated at the time the alleged crimes took place. Hyde, who has been trading in arms and dealing regularly with government departments for 20 years, gave a prepared statement protesting his innocence when brought in for questioning. ‘I do not believe that I engaged in any activity in the UK which I understood to require a licence but where instead I decided to ignore that obligation,' he said. ‘Apart from a couple of administration errors, I have always been compliant.’ Charge: Hyde is accused of smuggling 40,000 AK47 assault rifles (file picture) among other guns to Nigeria . Mr Solley also warned the jury not to think badly of Hyde because of his profession. ‘There’s nothing wrong with arms dealing’, he said. ‘This was nation state to nation state sale and purchase, between the government of China and the government of Nigeria. 'I do not believe that I engaged in any activity in the UK which I understood to require a licence but where instead I decided to ignore that obligation' Gary Hyde . ‘It was not to some ramshackle gang somewhere - it was government to government arms sales.’ Hyde has pleaded not guilty to smuggling the 80,000 guns and 32million rounds of ammunition. A previous trial into the charges against Hyde was abandoned, the jury was told. Hyde denied two counts of becoming knowingly concerned in the movement of controlled goods between March 2006, and December 2007. He also denied one count of concealing criminal property between March 2006, and December 2008. The trial continues.

"Google's chief executive has bowed to a landmark 'right to be forgotten' ruling and has today introduced a new form letting people apply to get themselves removed from search results. The . changes come after the European Court of Justice ruled people have the . 'right to be forgotten' - meaning Google searches linked to individuals . can taken down if they tarnish their reputation. But in his first interview since the decision, company co-founder Larry Page suggested authoritarian . states around the world will see the changes as a green light to . internet censorship. Co-founder and CEO Larry Page has warned that a European court ruling on 'the right to be forgotten' will help corrupt governments around the world . In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'It will be used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things. 'Other people are going to pile on, probably... for reasons most Europeans would find negative.' He also told of his fears that the ruling, seen as the biggest ever privacy setback for an online company, would discourage would-be internet entrepreneurs from setting up new businesses. Google is launching the online form . today to allow people to have links to information taken down from the website's search results. The . company will review the deluge of requests it is expected to receive, . with some links expected to be taken down within weeks. From today, Google's website will contain a form for users who want links to information about them removed . The . ruling has been criticised after it emerged many of the 3,000-plus requests . the company has already received were from corrupt public figures and . criminals desperate to hide their past. Google . says it wants to strike a balance between people's right to privacy and . maintaining links to information that is in the public interest. A . company spokesman said: 'In implementing this decision, we will assess . each individual request and attempt to balance the privacy rights of the . individual with the public's right to know and distribute information.' People who want links about them taken down from Google will have to give the company the URL or web address of the offending webpage, their home country and an explanation of why they think the link should be removed. Google insists 'humans, not algorithms' will make the decision after looking into the applicant's case. The plans only extend to local or national sites, e.g. Google.co.uk, and searches in Google.com will still show the person's undesired results. Cases where Google does not agree with the applicant will be passed on to national data protection agencies. Searchers will then be notified if a link has been removed, although the original webpage will remain online. Mr . Page said the powerful and famous will still be scrutinised online, . adding: 'I'm a public figure. There are lots of things that are written . about me that I'm sure are untrue. I kind of deal with that.' The . original information about people will not be removed from the internet . and will still exist on the relevant website, but web users will not . see it in their Google searches or be able to link to it through the . site. Cases . which Google refuses to act upon will be handed over to national data . protection agencies, such as Britain's Information Commissioner's . Office, which are braced for a flood of requests in coming months. Germany, . whose citizens have contributed 40 per cent of the requests to Google so . far, is even considering bringing in a new division of courts to hear . internet privacy disputes. Concerns have been raised that the ruling could . lead to censorship after it emerged that an actor who had an affair with a teenager, a celebrity's child who was convicted of criminal offices and a man who . tried to kill members of his family were among the first requests . received. Around . 30 per cent of the requests Google has been sent so far concern fraud, . 12 per are related to paedophilia and 20 per cent concern reports of . people's arrests or convictions. The . original case regarding the right to be forgotten was brought by a . Spanish man who claimed his privacy had been infringed by an auction . notice for his repossessed home. Under . Article 17 of the European Data Protection Regulation, internet users . who are mentioned in data have the right to 'obtain from the controller . the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from . further dissemination of such data'. Yahoo . Inc which also operates a search engine in Europe, has previously said . it is 'carefully reviewing' the decision to assess the impact for its . business and its users. Microsoft, which operates the Bing search engine, has previously declined to comment on the ruling.","Company chief warns the changes will play into the hands of tyrants .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans should be allowed to play professional football again, according to Professional Footballers’ Association chief Gordon Taylor. Taylor believes the 25-year-old should be accepted back into the game when he is released from prison despite his five-year sentence for rape in April 2012. The PFA chief told the BBC: ‘I didn't know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still can't do anything. Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence . Gordon Taylor (above) believes Evans should be allowed to play professional football again . Tony Adams - Was miles over the drink-drive limit when he crashed his car into a wall in 1990 and spent 57 days in prison. After release, captained Arsenal and England with distinction. Lee Hughes - Served three years for causing death by dangerous driving in 2003. Played for Oldham and Port Vale among others following his release. Joey Barton - Was imprisoned for 77 days in 2008 after being convicted of assault outside a McDonald's. Now playing for QPR. Duncan Ferguson - Jailed in 1994 for headbutting an opponent on the pitch, he went on to become an Everton hero. Jermaine Pennant - Another drink-driving conviction, the winger spent 30 days in prison then became the first Premier League player to take to the field wearing an electronic tag. ‘As a trade union we believe in the rule of law... besides that, he still wants to contribute to society. ‘If he earns money he'll pay taxes. Those taxes will go to help people who maybe can't get a job.’ Sheffield United signed Evans from Manchester City for £3million in 2009, but released him the month after his conviction for raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl in north Wales. The South Yorkshire club have refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction. Wales boss Chris Coleman told a media conference on Thursday: ‘I've not thought about Ched Evans. That story has come from outside our camp. ‘I'm my own man but with respect to Ched and everyone involved that's not on my mind.’ Evans has always maintained his innocence and legal representatives for the striker are preparing a submission to the Criminal Cases Review Commission aimed at quashing his conviction.

"Homes owned by a string of celebrities have vanished from Google’s Street View Map following draconian European privacy laws, it emerged yesterday. Mansions owned by Sir Paul McCartney, former Prime Minister Tony Blair and singer Katherine Jenkins are included in those that have disappeared from the controversial online tool. The popular map feature allows users to view homes, buildings and areas along almost every road in the world on a computer screen. Scroll down for video . Now you see it... now you don't: Tony Blair's London home has been blurred out on Google Street View . Normal scene: How the London home belonging to Mr Blair (right), which is protected by police, normally looks . A mansion owned by Sir Paul McCartney are included in those that have vanished from Street View . But following a landmark ruling in a European court in favour of people’s ‘right to be forgotten’, the computer programme has seen dozens of requests from the rich and famous to have their homes removed. The house of former Beatles star McCartney can now not be seen on the 3-Dimensional online map, despite most of the London street that it is on being visible. A click of the mouse to show the west London home of Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page also comes up against a blank. Street View users are instead left having to view the distinctive property from a long distance away – blocking out any of the home’s features. Hidden: The Cotswolds mansion owned by pop star Lily Allen (left)  is hidden from the public eye of Street View, as is the Surrey home of Katherine Jenkins (right) Privacy: Street View users can only view Katherine Jenkins' mansion from far away - and parts are blurred . The same barrier is in place at the Surrey home of Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. This is despite it being seen by millions of people when it featured in a series of the BBC One’s Apprentice. The world’s biggest search engine has also blurred out the £5million Georgian townhouse in central London where the former Prime Minister Tony Blair and wife Cherie live. Blair, who has made millions of pounds trading off his image and former office since leaving Downing Street, moved to the property, where he is continually protected by a police guard, in 2004. Caught on camera: A Google street-mapping car used to compile the online map . The Cotswolds mansion owned by pop star Lily Allen and her husband Sam Cooper is also hidden from the public eye of Street View. It comes as the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland banker Fred Goodwin’s £3.5million Edinburgh mansion was revealed to have disappeared from the Google application last month. Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood, was held up as a figurehead for the bank’s disastrous crash in 2008 and the epitome of capitalist excess in the UK. A Google spokesman confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a ‘compelling case’ to convince them to remove images of their homes. But it has been hit by a huge increase in requests to remove data from its search archives after European judges ruled in favour of citizens’ ‘right to be forgotten’. The legal decision means that companies holding vast quantities of data - such as search engines - can be forced to take down information which is deemed ‘inadequate, irrelevant or excessive’. It also allows people to suppress embarrassing information about their pasts if it is no longer relevant. Services such as Google Street View are thought not be covered by the ruling. Google has already disclosed that it has been asked by MPs, celebrities and public figures to have search results removed. It has employed a team of workers to evaluate each request. As seen on screen: The popular map feature allows users to view homes, buildings and areas along almost every road in the world on a computer screen . Removal: A Google spokesman confirmed that it has always been possible for users with a 'compelling case' to convince them to remove images of their homes . The Mail’s website, MailOnline has also received notification from Google of which links it has decided to remove. They include a story about Dougie McDonald, who was a Scottish top-flight football referee who was found to have lied about his reasons for granting a penalty in a Celtic v Dundee United match; a story about Tesco workers posting stories on social media attacking their workers; and a story about a Muslim man who accused Cathay Pacific, the airline, of refusing to employ him because of his name. The stories have not been removed by MailOnline, which described the move as similar to ‘burning books in a library’.","Online map shows homes and buildings on almost every street in the world .

"One of Mexico's most notorious drug lords is in custody after he apparently inundated Twitter and Instagram with photos showing his penchant for ill-gotten sports cars, yachts and guns.

He is a suspected top enforcer for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel and is wanted on drug charges in Southern California, a U.S. federal law enforcement official revealed . According to local media, Arechiga is one of the two leaders of a group of hit men who call themselves the 'Anthrax,' like the deadly disease . The group is blamed for a series of murders, including the killings of three men who were hung off a bridge in 2011, that were seen as revenge after one of their leaders was murdered. The Anthrax also helped the Sinaloa organization as it engaged in a bloody war with the Beltran Leyva cartel, when the latter decided to splinter in 2008. Several folk songs, known as narcocorridos, mention 'El Chino Antrax' as an elegant and fit man with a taste for sports cars, yachts and Champagne. And it appears he couldn't help but boast about his extravagant lifestyle on social media, something which may have helped U.S. investigators build their case against him. Less-than-discreet Twitter and Instagram accounts reportedly belonging to Arechiga show a man with his face blurred out in luxury cars, wielding automatic weapons and posing with scantily clad women. Other flashy shots show boats, helicopters and expensive jewelry and one picture even shows the man with Paris Hilton. According to a report, he photobombed the socialite while she was giving an interview to an Asian TV network. However, one image, posted Tuesday morning cast doubt on whether the feed in fact belonged to the alleged drug boss. In almost every other picture he is seen with a prominant ring, and in the most recent photo, posted when Arechiga is in custody, shows a hand wearing the ring perusing newspaper articles of his arrest.

It's not clear the exact role social media played in Arechiga's arrest but the International Business Times reported the information garnered provided important clues about his movements and contacts. Arechiga is a right-hand man of Sinaloa bosses Ismael Zambada and Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. His identity was initially kept secret by Dutch police, who simply said they'd arrested a 33-year-old Mexican man on behalf of U.S. authorities. His name was later leaked to the Associated Press by the law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss the case. He is being held in a Dutch jail, pending his extradition to the U.S. The Mexican Embassy in The Netherlands said it was aware of the detention of a Mexican citizen and that it was willing to offer consular assistance if he requested help. The U.S. attorney's office in San Diego didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment on his arrest and possible prosecution. But the federal official said the charges stem from a federal court in San Diego.

"Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who is preparing to run for president on a populist platform of fighting income inequality, demanded $2,777 per minute for two university speaking engagements and insisted on contracts that cut off reporters' access to her and limited the number of photos she would take with well-wishers. The Harry Walker Agency drew up legal agreements for Clinton's speeches at the State University of New York at Buffalo in August 2013 and at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas next month. Combined, the two gigs netted the Clintons' family foundation $500,000 for three hours' work, and allowed her to cancel or reschedule the events 'for any reason whatsoever.' The once-and-maybe-future White House resident is routinely granted iron-grip control over the circumstances surrounding her speeches. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE CONTRACTS . Prickly: Hillary Clinton's image-control is in top gear, with her speaking agents making a laundry list of diva demands . Pacing: Hillary's contract forbids anyone else to be on stage when she talks to her audience . Both contracts, one published online by The Washington Post and the other by The Daily Caller, paint a picture of a control-freak PR machine surrounding Hillary. Her 'participation at the event including the speech and reception will be closed to the press, unless otherwise agreed to in writing,' the UNLV contract reads . 'There will be no other media opportunities or availabilities (i.e.. press conferences, statements. etc.).' The Buffalo appearance earned Clinton $275,000 for an hour on stage and a 30-minute photo line – limited to 50 photos of her alongside no more than 100 people. UNLV will pay her another $225,000 for a similar 90-minute commitment, although angry students there have asked her to refund her fees since their tuition has nearly tripled since a decade ago. Both schools had to agree to her prickly list of demands before her agent would sign on the dotted line. The contracts they signed insist that Hillary must be 'the only person on stage during her remarks.' The . Buffalo paperwork specifically demands a 'presidential glass panel . teleprompter,' although video of that speech shows she strayed from the . podium and didn't use it. Hillary has the exclusive right to approve 'sets, backdrops, banners, scenery, logos, [and] settings' connected to her speeches, and gives her 'sole discretion' over what she talks about in public. She 'may elect to reschedule or cancel her appearance ... for any reason whatsoever and at any time prior to the engagement.' Crowd control: During a post-speech Q-and-A, only a moderator who has been approved in advance -- and never the audience -- is allowed to speak to the former first lady or ask her questions . She gets 20 complimentary VIP tickets and a university-paid stenographer – . at a price of $1,000 in Buffalo and $1,250 in Las Vegas – just for her . personal records. And her speaking agency can veto any potential Q-and-A moderators, and only those moderators – never members of the audience – can talk to her directly. One audience member in Buffalo didn't get that memo, the Buffalo News reported in August 2013. 'A heckler tried to interrupt Clinton,' the paper reported, 'screaming about the terrorist murders of American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, in September 2012.' 'Clinton simply talked over him, and then took him down, saying solving problems ""doesn't involve yelling; it includes sitting down and talking"".' The public college, officially named the University at Buffalo, released a statement on Wednesday that said 'no state funding or student tuition revenue is used to fund the Distinguished Speakers Series and the fees of guest speakers, including that of Secretary Clinton.'

"More than nine in ten cashpoint crimes are committed by Romanian gangs. The fraudsters come to Britain  specifically to target cash machines, and use a range of sophisticated  equipment to acquire the bank details of unsuspecting victims. £30million is stolen through the crimes each year. In the first three months of last year, detectives identified 120 Romanians linked to cashpoint crime, with the majority from or connected to the Bacau region. Too young to know: The baby in the picture is the child of thief Adu Bunu - from Bacau - who was jailed in 2008 for a hole-in-the wall scam estimated to have netted more than £1million . Dirty cash: Proceeds of crime is now thought to make up 70 per cent of Bacau's economy . Detective Chief Inspector Paul . Barnard, who leads the police’s cheque and plastic crime unit, said: . ‘The fact is, 92 per cent of all automated teller machine (ATM) fraud we . see in this country is committed by Romanian nationals. Very, very . tight communities, very tight gangs.’ The most common cash machine crime is . skimming, in which a device fitted to an ATM copies a customer’s bank . details and a small overhead camera records their PIN. Criminals then . place the victim’s details on to another card, which they use to . withdraw money. Bacau-based Adu Baunu, convicted in 2008 for credit card fraud, took a picture of his baby rolling in cash stolen from British cash machines . Fitting the equipment on to a cashpoint takes less than a minute. On average, £500 is taken from each cloned card. ‘The criminals constantly try to evolve their technology to beat the technology the banks put in place,’ said Mr Barnard. ‘It’s a constant battle to try to work out where the criminal is going next.’ Improved security has seen cash machine fraud fall by 12 per cent, from £33.2million in 2010 to £29.3million last year. However, officers warn there  are an . estimated 1,000 Romanian cashpoint gangs still operating  in Britain, . and fear there may be  a surge in activity during the London Olympics. Detective Chief Superintendent Steve . Head, of City of London Police, said: ‘We can see quite clearly what . they are doing with the money back in Romania. They are spending it on a . lavish lifestyle, flash cars, flash houses. ‘What sits behind it all is the greed – . the greed of the people who are organising it, the greed of the . professionals along the way who are enabling it and the greed of those . people who are actually creating the technology to enable systems to be . overcome. Sheer criminal greed.’ In 2008, Romanian fraudster Adu Bunu, . from Bacau, was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning . more than 2,000 cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million. Photographs found by fraud police . showed that instead of giving his baby son toys to play with, Bunu . presented him with a mountain of stolen banknotes. An episode of ITV1 documentary Fraud . Squad, to be broadcast next month, follows officers on a raid in Essex . to arrest another Romanian, 22-year-old Maxim Catana, and his fellow . gang members Nikolajs Delvers and Daniel Anghell. One step ahead of the banks: Police fear the fraudsters' technology is evolving as fast as the banks that are modernising their cash dispensers . Inside the house, detectives . discovered what they called ‘a working ATM factory’, including skimming . machines, cloned cards, £2,000 and a list of cash machines in the south . of England. They also found more than 4,000 victims’ stolen bank account . details. A spokesman for industry group . Financial Fraud Action UK said: ‘Although cash card fraud has decreased . in the past year, it is still an issue that cardholders need to be aware . of. If they think a card machine has been tampered with, they should . immediately end the transaction and use an alternative ATM.’ He said users should keep the keypad . covered when entering their PIN, and check their bank statement for any . suspicious withdrawals. ‘If you spot any transactions you . didn’t make, contact your card issuer immediately,’ he added. ‘If you . are the innocent victim of card fraud you have legal protection and . should not suffer any financial loss.’ Fraud Squad returns to ITV1 on Thursday, April 5 at 9pm.","More than 90 per cent of cash machine fraud in UK attributed to Romanian criminal gangs .

"Telescopes come in all shapes and sizes - from orbiting space telescopes just a few metres long to the ambitious 'square kilometer array' planned for South Africa or Australia, where a network of linked dishes will stare at the sky together. But detecting neutrinos - tiny, fast-moving particles that pass easily through matter - is more difficult. Neutrino detectors are often located deep underground, to cut out interference. A new telescope planned for the sea bed under the Mediterranean will be a network of detectors with a volume of several cubic kilometers - each detector is taller than the 830m Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. The KM3net telescope planned for the sea bed under the Mediterranean will be a network of detectors with a volume of several cubic kilometres, built to detect neutrinos - tiny, fast-moving particles that pass straight through water and even solid rock . 'Any time you detect a particle, what you're always doing is having the particle interact with some kind of matter, whether it's water, steel, air or ice,' says Peter Fisher, a particle physicist at MIT. 'The less the particle interacts, the more material you need for it to interact in.' The sea water in between the 900m KM3Net detectors works as a giant optical 'detector' - the detectors look for 'flashes' caused by neutrinos hitting water molecules. Most of the neutrinos pass straight through, but the few that do collide with atoms will be picked up by the huge telescope. The detector's discoveries could propel research in dark matter and high energy physics. Construction could start as early as next year. The KM3net's detectors compared to some of the tallest towers on earth - each one will be higher than Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower . Over the past decade the three pilot projects have explored the idea, building and deploying smaller scale prototype telescopes designed to operate at depths ranging from 2500 to 4500 m. Antares - on the floor of the Mediterranean near Toulon, France - is now the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern hemispere, made of twelve 350-metre detectors on the sea bed. The Antares detector - a prototype for KM3Net - consists of 12 750m detectors on the sea bed near Toulon, France. It's the current largest on earth . 'The Mediterranean Sea is ideal for these huge structures - thanks to water of excellent optical properties at the right depth and excellent shore-baseddata processing,' says the KM3Net organisation. 'The KM3NeT neutrino telescope will be unique in the world in its physics sensitivity and will provide access to scientific data that will propel research in different fields, including astronomy, dark matter searches, cosmic ray and high energy physics.'","Detector uses 'towers' taller than Burj Khalifa in Dubai .

"It may be unusual bedtime reading for the President of the United States. But Barack Obama today picked up a copy of the novel which inspired the dystopian war film Apocalypse Now at a publicity appearance to promote small businesses. Alongside some children's titles weighty non-fiction books on medicine and China, the President picked up Joseph Conrad's classic Heart of Darkness on a visit to the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington, D.C. The novella, a mainstay of high school and university literature programs, was the main source material for Apocalypse Now, a film which details the madness and slaughter of the Vietnam War. Scroll down for video . Shopping trip: The President picked up Heart of Darkness - which has anti-West undertones - on a visit to a Washington book store . Helping him choose? Sasha and Malia Obama (center and right respectively) accompanied their dad . Conrad's original, published in 1899, was set along the Congo River in Africa, and tells the story of ivory trader Marlow finding the feared Mr Kurtz, a European who has gone mad in the jungle and rules over a tribe of natives. The work has been lauded for its feverish portrayal , and Kurtz's last words 'The horror... the horror' have become iconic. Many have taken it as a criticism of the way Western civilization at the time asserted its dominance on the world. Likewise, the Hollywood adaptation - which casts Marlow and Kurtz as U. S. servicemen in Vietnam - has been taken as a criticism of America's intervention in the affairs of other countries, as well as a more general examination of the darkness in human nature. Inspiration: Heart of Darkness, the Joseph Conrad book on the President's reading list, was the basis for the Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now (pictured above starring Martin Sheen) Meaningful? Apocalypse Now transferred the scepticism of the West's actions in Africa to the Vietnam war . 'Small Business Saturday': Obama's trip to the store came as part of a push for consumers to visit independent retailers . It worked! Obama made a joke about his credit card to the checkout attendant, after he was declined in a New York City restaurant this year . Obama's visit came on a day increasingly advertised as 'Small Business Saturday', an attempt to lure shoppers to mom-and-pop retailers after the mass consumption madness of Black Friday. Obama bought 17 books in total at Politics and Prose, which is owned by two former staffers at the Washington Post. The President browsed the bookstore's racks with his daughters, Malia and Sasha. He held one shopper's baby and chatted with author David Baldacci. While paying at the cash register, another patron encouraged Obama to close the U.S. facility in Cuba where suspected terrorists are detained. 'Hope you can close Guantanamo,' the patron said. Standing guard: The Secret Service were in force outside the Washington, D.C., store while Obama was visiting . 'We're working on it,' Obama replied, then added to the crowd: 'Any other issues?' Obama also joked, 'Hope it works,' when he handed his credit card to the cashier, in reference to an incident earlier this year when a New York City restaurant declined his card. Obama bought a mix of titles apparently chosen to satisfy readers young and old. The White House declined to reveal how much he paid.

"In a remarkable interview a North Korean defector has revealed details about assassination attempts on the country’s former leader and plots to overthrow him that help explain the dangerous paranoia that engulfs his son's regime. What makes the revelations so extraordinary is that they’ve come from a highly credible source – a former intelligence officer now living in South Korea. Plots to kill Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il, who ruled North Korea from 1994 to December 2011, have involved a lone gunman, a 20-tonne truck and even missile strikes, he said. Scroll down for video . Plots: A North Korean defector has revealed details about assassination attempts on the country's former leader, Kim Jong-il - as well as plans to overthrow him . The defector, who gave his name only as ‘Mr K’, said that in one assassination attempt a lone gunman plotted to murder Jong-il with machine gun fire, but he was arrested before he could carry out the attack. Another attempt came a bit closer to succeeding. Mr K said that Jong-il’s motorcade was rammed by a 20-tonne lorry, but the driver was fooled by Jong-il’s tactic of deploying decoy cars and he struck the wrong limousine. Mr K also revealed details about two attempted coups. Both were plotted by members of the Korean People’s Army that had been trained at Moscow’s Frunze military academy and established strong links with Russia, according to The Daily Telegraph. Both involved officers taking full advantage of military equipment at their disposal. One group of officers wanted to blow up the Russian consulate in the city of Chongjin in the hope that the attack would prompt military action against North Korea by Russia. Father and son: Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un watch from a podium as soldiers march in a parade celebrating the 65th anniversary of the ruling Korean Workers Party in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 2010 . Another was even more audacious - multiple missile strikes on Pyongyang. Both plots were uncovered before they had a chance of being put into action. The North Korean regime is so secretive that it’s extremely difficult to verify Mr K’s revelations. However, two incidents do back-up his claims. In 1994 officers that had studied in Russia were arrested in what was known as the ‘Frunze Affair’ and in 1997 a firefight erupted at the headquarters of the North Korean Army’s Sixth Corps when soldiers stormed it to make arrests. The latter incident has never been fully explained. Mr K, who defected in 2005, went on to describe in his briefing to journalists the extraordinary paranoia of Kim Jong-un. He said that even family members are patted down before meeting the dictator, who is constantly surrounded by multiple tiers of security, including bodyguards and regular police. He also described how the country’s notorious gulags were run by a sinister organisation called The Farm Guidance Directorate. Once you check in to a gulag, he said, ‘you do not check out’. Even dead bodies remain there, he added. It has been reported that Kim Jong-Un is planning one of his 'purges' to rid North Korea of one of the country's most powerful figures, after the country's records reveal that they, not the son of Jong-il, might be the rightful heir to the communist state. Watchful: Kim Jong-Un pictured during an inspection of North Korean Navy units in 2013 . Two hundred figures in Pyongyang are supposedly expected to be in the sights of the current leader of North Korea, because of their loyalty to his uncle, Jang Song-taek, who was executed late last year. But Choe Ryong-Hae, currently joint chairman of the powerful Politburo Presidium and political director of the North Korea People's Army has been singled out because of the new evidence which could threaten his leadership. New evidence from the 1930s show that it might have been the father of Kim Jong-Un's uncle who led the attack against the Japanese, and that this attack was later claimed by Kim's grandfather so they could be the ruling family. The attack was a turning point for North Korea, and helped them to claim a part of the Korean peninsula back from Japanese occupation. The grandfather of Kim Jong-Un, Kim Il-Sung, is documented in North Korea's official history as the leader of the 1937 attack on the Japanese base defending the town of Ponchonbo, which helped him gain a foothold of legitimacy in the claim of leadership of the country. These reports that North Korea is looking to change it's history again are not the first incidence of such an occurrence. North Korea regularly changes its own country's history, with children in the North being taught that the Korean War was started in 1950 by an invasion by the South, and that Kim Jong-il was born in a cabin on the slopes of Mount Paektu, when historians claim that the late leader was actually born in a refugee camp in the Soviet Union.","North Korean defector 'Mr K' revealed details of assassination plots .

"A princess who made racist comments about 'killing Muslims' before stripping and assaulting staff at an exclusive party is related to senior German officer decorated by Hitler, we can reveal today. Her Serene Highness Princess Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein yesterday pleaded guilty to a series of crimes, including assault and disorderly conduct, at Dundee Sheriff Court. The court heard how the princess made racist comments before assaulting first-aiders and lashing out at police when she was told to stop at a University of St Andrews Oktoberfest party. Arriving at court in a brown wig, the princess was fined £1,000 for her actions - . with her defence admitting her behavior had . 'brought shame on herself and her family'. Her serene highness Therese Sayn-Wittgenstein, wearing a dark wig, arrives at Dundee Court with her father. She admitted a series of offences including assault and disorderly conduct and was fined £1,000 . The Princess's grandfather Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg joined the army aged 20 - and fought in some of the most notorious battles of the Second World War. He was awarded a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and posthumously promoted to Oberst . Now, we can exclusively reveal the princess's aristocratic heritage - including a decorated military grandfather, a link to a Colonel who tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler, and a friendship with the British royals. The princess's mother is Countess Yvonne Wachtmeister af Johannishus, who married Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in Barbo, Sweden, in 1975. Her father is a huge investor in windpower - and is often seen at town hall meetings in local Bad Berleburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, trying to convince locals of the benefits of windmills upon farmland and other open spaces. He was one of the five children of decorated soldier Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg. Born in 1910, after graduating he joined the Cavalry Regiment 18 - 'Cannstädter riding' aged 20. The family seat of the Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburgs - Schloss Berleburg Castle in North Rhine-Westphalia . The family, who reside at the estate pictured, are also friends of Princess Beatrice. The British Royal attended Princess Theodora's borther's wedding to Countess Camilla von Stauffenberg . As Commander of the reconnaissance . detachment of the 35th Infantry Division, he won the coveted German . Cross in Gold for bravery in the invasion of Poland in September 1939. He fought in some of the largest Nazi . battles of the Second World War, including the invasion of Poland, the . Battle of Moscow and the Battle of Kursk - one of the most notorious tank battles of the conflict. During the invasion of France, he personally destroyed a heavy French tank in close quarter combat. He was blown to pieces by an artillery shell serving in the Ukraine in 1943 where he remains buried. For his service, he was awarded a prestigious Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and posthumously promoted to Oberst. According to her court papers, Princess Theodora calls this Chelsea townhouse home when she is in London. It is thought it belongs to businessman and Oxford graduate Claes Kockum . Princess Theodora has three brothers and sisters: Carl-Albrecht, Anna-Natascha and August-Frederik. The . youngest child's brother Carl- Albrecht married Countess Camilla von . Stauffenberg at Amerdingen castle, near Nuremberg, Germany. The countess is a . relation of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg - who famously attempted . to assassinate Adolf Hilter in 1944. The . German officer and aristocrat was one of the main members of the failed . 20 July plot to remove the Nazi leader from power in a bid to crush the . party. For his involvement, Stauffenberg was executed by firing squad known as Operation Valkyrie. The story was turned in to a film in 2008 - with Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise playing the Colonel. Princess Theodora's father, pictured during the wedding of his other daughter Princess Anna in 2005, was one of five children of senior German military officer Ludwig Ferdinand Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg . The couple married in the Church of . Amerdingen - and were joined by none other than Princess Beatrice and her partner Virgin Galactic businessman Dave Clark. The countess works in the city - which could explain her link to Beatrice and Mr Clark. Princess . Theodora's sister Anna-Natascha is married to Prince Manuel of Bavaria. She is a German political journalist who works for Bild am Sonntag. More generally, the Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg family can be traced back to the twelfth century. For . centuries the family has marked on forest land - with 13,000 ha area of . operation is the largest private forest management in North . Rhine-Westphalia. Princess Theodora's mother Yvonne Wachtmeister at her daughter's wedding . The . family seat is a castle, Schloss Berleburg - which is a stately home . open to the public. It is thought they live in a property on the estate. Is . believed the family could be linked to the philosopher Wittgenstein - . who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the . philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. Princess Theodora had a low profile in Germany. She was educated at schools in Switzerland and the UK before going to St. Andrews where she studied International Relations before working in Jordan. While she lives in Germany with her family, it is thought she stays with Chelsea businessman and Oxford graduate Claes Kockum while in the UK. He is the CEO of Mobilize Systems - a telephonics company with bases in London, Sweden and Florida. The businessman is thought to own a £1.2million townhouse in London's SW3. The Princess appeared in court yesterday after a night out with University friends took a debauched turn. Princess Theodora attended the exclusive Oktoberfest party held at Kinkell Byre every March with friends and at the end of the night she tried to climb a fence before stripping off some of her outfit. She was taken to the first aid room - making the racist remarks before attacking a security guard and a first aider.The princess then had to be restrained by numerous security guards - before police turned up and handcuffed her. Princess Beatrice and boyfriend Dave Clark, pictured Queen's tennis competition in London, who attended the wedding of Countess Camilla von Stauffenberg and Carl-Albrecht . Officers were even forced to put her in leg restraints to get her into a police car. She then lashed out at police - later telling them she did so because she 'thought she was being kidnapped'. Fining her for her actions, Sheriff Mark Stewart QC said: 'The overwhelming impression one gets is of disorderly and violent conduct occasioned by far too much drink for someone who was unble to properly deal with that level of intake. 'I deal with you in the same way as I would deal with anyone who behaves in this way. These comments you made are unacceptable - they would cause nothing but division, concern and unhappiness.'","Princess Theodora Sayn-Wittgenstein appeared in Scottish court yesterday .

"The Muslim activist who sparked an uproar with a planned lecture on honour killings won't say if he believes they are justifiable, telling critics they will have to wait to read his writing on the topic instead. Uthman Badar, spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, was due to speak at the Sydney Opera House in August on whether honour killings could be morally justified, but it was cancelled within hours of being announced due to public outrage. Mr Badar said the backlash against his slated Festival of Dangerous Ideas talk said more about bigotry in Australia than it did about him. Scroll down for video . Uthman Badar defended a cancelled speech he was due to give on the topic of honour killings at the Opera House in August, saying the organisers insisted he talk about them . 'I think the hysteria says a lot about Islamophobia,' Mr Badar told reporters on Wednesday. 'People want to say “Hang on, there is freedom (of speech), you can say what you want, but that was just beyond the pale”. 'The reality is I hadn't even opened my mouth… words were shoved in my mouth, the position was assumed.' Mr Badar did not choose the lecture title but said he was consulted by organisers. Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Mr Badar, said 'hysteria' won out after the Sydney Opera House back flipped on plans for a public talk on honour killings during its Festival of Dangerous Ideas on August 30 . 'I, in fact, suggested a more direct topic about Islam and secular liberalism ... something like 'The West needs saving by Islam'… but the organisers insisted on this topic, which I think is still a worthy topic of discussion,' he wrote on Facebook. 'The suggestion that I would advocate for honour killings, as understood in the west, is ludicrous and something I would normally not deem worth of dignifying with a response.' The Opera House would not answer questions about who decided on the title of the talk, while festival co-organisers the St James Ethics Centre did not respond to a request for comment. 'The point of the speech was to question some of the assumptions on the issue of honour killings,' Mr Badar said on Wednesday. 'In the end, the issue is not about violence towards women or anyone else, but it's about cultural and political imposition, imposing liberal values in third world countries.' Mr Badar wouldn't be drawn on the central question - whether he personally believed honour killings, a term usually used to mean the killing of women deemed to have 'shamed' their families, could ever be justified. 'Wait for my opinion piece,' he said. But he did say Islam opposed violence against women and has previously hit back at suggestions he would advocate honour killings as 'ludicrous'. Mr Badar's decision to speak out came after federal and NSW politicians Julie Bishop, Pru Goward and Fred Nile, as well as high-profile radio broadcaster Alan Jones, slammed the lecture plans. 'In this current period where there is so much concern about home-grown jihadists, the last thing we need is a debate like this,' Ms Goward told ABC Radio. 'It is a truly dangerous idea.' In a statement on its Facebook on Tuesday, the Opera House said: 'The Festival of Dangerous Ideas is intended to be a provocation to thought and discussion, rather than simply a provocation'. 'It is always a matter of balance and judgement, and in this case a line has been crossed... It is clear from the public reaction that the title has given the wrong impression of what Mr Badar intended to discuss. 'Neither Mr Badar, (festival organisers) the St James Ethics Centre, nor Sydney Opera House in any way advocates honour killings or condones any form of violence against women.' Mr Badar's defence comes as it was revealed the Prime Minister's plan to stop extremists fighting in the Middle East from returning to Australia was in legal limbo. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been faced with a legal problem in the wake of news that most Australians fighting in the middle east are Australian-only citizens . The government, who had been determined to strip the rights of jihadists on dual citizenship from entering and exiting the country, will not have the same powers to do so with those on a single citizenship. Under constitutional law, it is illegal to withdrawal a person of their citizenship rights if it renders them stateless. Fairfax Media reported that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told a Coalition party-room meeting on Tuesday the majority of the 150 people involved in extremist activity in the Middle East are believed to be Australian citizens only. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had previously said she vowed to continue canceling the passports of Australians suspected of being a threat to national security, including those thinking of going abroad to fight.

"Arrest: Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, 45, was one of four people held in Syria-related terrorism raids across Birmingham today . A Guantanamo Bay inmate given £1million compensation by Britain for alleged complicity in his torture was arrested yesterday on suspicion of waging jihad in Syria. Moazzam Begg was questioned about claims he attended a terror training camp and facilitated terrorism overseas. In 2010, the Government paid him ‘hush money’ to silence his claim that UK spies were complicit in his torture at Guantanamo. He was held in the notorious US prison camp for nearly three years as a suspected Al Qaeda terrorist. Yesterday the 45-year-old was arrested by police in the Hall Green area of Birmingham in a dawn raid on the £395,000 house he bought for cash with his compensation money. There has been increasing concern from police and MI5 about an estimated 400 young British Muslims who have travelled to Syria to wage holy war with Al Qaeda-linked groups. Earlier this month, a British suicide bomber blew up his lorry at a prison in Syria, one of an estimated 20 Britons to have been killed fighting in the wartorn state. Police fear others will return to the UK battle-hardened. Begg has made no secret of travelling to Syria in 2012, and has even claimed his visit there was sanctioned by MI5. Two weeks ago, he wrote a blog explaining that his two trips were humanitarian missions in which he visited wounded civilians and gathered evidence from torture victims. He claimed he has been ‘continually harassed’ by police and MI5 because of his campaign to expose the British Government’s complicity in torture. West Midlands Police arrested another man, aged 36, from Shirley, Solihull, and a mother, 44, and her 20-year-old son from Sparkhill, Birmingham, on suspicion of facilitating terrorism overseas. Detective Superintendent Shaun Edwards, head of investigations for the regional counter-terrorism unit, said: ‘All four arrests are connected. They were pre-planned and intelligence-led.

Seized: An officer carries a bag out of the property in Birmingham today after Begg was arrested . ‘We continue to urge anyone planning to travel to Syria to read the advice issued by the Foreign Office.’ The Mail can reveal Begg was recently stopped by Kent Police at Dover as he accompanied a Syria aid convoy. Several . such convoys have been stopped and at least one, in December 2012, was . found to contain £36,000 and $10,000 in cash. Police are still . investigating what the money was for. Last . October, Charity Commission chairman William Shawcross warned it was . almost inevitable that some charity money would end up in the hands  of . terrorists. In Germany, it . has been claimed that Syria relief convoys have picked up weapons after . travelling beyond the jurisdiction of European intelligence agencies. Yesterday, . Birmingham-born Begg and the other suspects were questioned at a police . station in the West Midlands, and their three home addresses were being . searched. Police took away . two cars belonging to Begg and his wife Sally, 42, who live at the . four-bedroom detached house with three of their four children. A . West Midlands Police spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that Moazzam Begg . was arrested this morning’, but added that naming Begg did ‘not imply . any guilt’. Begg’s younger brother, who did not want to be named, said yesterday: ‘We don’t think he’s done anything wrong.’ Arrested: Moazzam Begg, seen at an Amnesty International press conference in 2010, was arrested by West Midlands Police officers today . Musarat . Siksek, 41, who is married to Sally’s brother Samur, said: ‘Moazzam has . been arrested before, quite a few times, so it hasn’t really shocked . me.’ In December last year, . the Home Office stripped Begg of his UK passport because he had visited . Syria and had been assessed as being involved in terrorist activity, he . said. Begg has said he was . being harassed because of his work with CagePrisoners, a charity that . campaigns for the rights of individuals detained during . counter-terrorism operations. He . was detained in Pakistan in 2002, branded an ‘enemy combatant’ and . taken to an internment centre before being transferred to Guantanamo. When he was freed in 2005, the CIA was still privately calling him an Al Qaeda terrorist. Probe: Police were seen entering and leaving Moazzam Begg's property in Birmingham throughout the day .

"Apple’s Classic iPod (pictured) has been silently removed from the tech firm's online store . It managed to hold on for seven years, but the final generation of Apple’s Classic iPod has been silently killed off. The Classic was the Apple’s first digital music player, and although the original debuted in 2001, there were six generations released up until 2007. When Apple’s online store came back online yesterday, following its iPhone 6 event, this later model was missing from the iPod lineup. Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line. According to an earnings report earlier this year, Apple's iPod Classic sales in the final quarter of 2013 had dropped 52 per cent year-on-year. Apple also lost 55 per cent in revenue on all models of the music player, compared to the previous year, and the iPod makes up less than 2 per cent of the company's overall income. The drop in sales is being attributed to the increase in music apps, cloud storage and streaming services including Spotify. Additionally, Apple iPhones come with iTunes built-in, making the iPod redundant for most iPhone owners. The trend hasn't been helped by the fact Apple hasn't released a new version of the music player since the fifth-generation Touch, and seventh-generation Nano launched in 2012. Scroll down for video . When Apple’s online store came back online yesterday, following its iPhone 6 event,  six-generation iPod Classic model was missing from the iPod lineup (pictured). Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line. According to an earnings report earlier this year, Apple sold 6 million iPods in the final quarter of 2013. Although that was almost double the sales of the previous three months, it equated to a 52% drop in sales year-on-year. The drop is being attributed to the increase in music apps, cloud storage and streaming services . Sales of iPods were at their highest during 2008 following the launch of the first iPod Touch at the end of 2007. The iPod Touch was designed to look like an iPhone, played music and ran apps, but could not make calls. Similar sales were seen across 2009 thanks to the launch of the third-generation Shuffle, fourth-generation Nano and second-generation Touch. Since January this year, reports claim Apple has sold around 12 million units, which is less than half of 2013 sales figures. The highest capacity iPod now available is the 64GB version of the iPod touch, which costs £249 in the UK and $299 in the US. Customers may still be able to get their hands on an iPod Classic through third-party retailers, until stock runs out.

"No-frills airlines and Europe’s free travel rules are being exploited by Romanian gangs to target Britain, it was revealed yesterday. Up to 240 crime networks have been identified in the country by Europol, the European criminal intelligence agency. Its director Rob Wainwright said crooks are using low-cost airlines to target cities for one-day sprees. Airport: Criminals are flying in and out of a country in just one day, Europol's director has said (file picture) Romanian and Bulgarian gangs are thought responsible for 90 per cent of all European card-skimming crimes . Thieves, credit card fraudsters and pickpockets buy cheap tickets to fly in and out in just a few hours. As a result police are almost powerless to identify those responsible. An . estimated 68,000 Romanians live in Britain, but there have been 28,000 . arrests of Romanian people for serious offences in the past five years. Mr Wainwright said his agency was facing ‘petty criminals operating across multiple jurisdictions’. He added Romanian and Bulgarian offenders are responsible for 90 per cent of all card-skimming in Europe. ‘We . have this travelling criminal gang phenomenon that has become much more . prevalent in the last three or four years; gangs from Lithuania, gangs . from Poland, gangs from Romania that are operating in 20 or more . European countries,’ he added. ‘They . fly on low-cost airlines, do a few hits in one city and get back in . time for tea. It’s very difficult for local police to respond.’ Europol estimates that Romania’s organised crime gangs account for 6.7 per cent of such networks in Europe. It claims this figure is out of proportion for a country with a population of 21million. Experts think gangs have divided Europe into two, along a rough line from Gdansk in Poland to Lisbon in Portugal. The main crimes being carried out by the travelling gangs are thought to be card-skimming and pickpocketing . Romanian gangs control the north, including Britain,  Bulgarians the south. Romanian . criminals are  specialists in pickpocketing and card-skimming, in which . devices fixed to cash machines steal card details, they say. The information, combined with a PIN recorded by a hidden camera, is used to drain a victim’s account. Often . data is used by accomplices in countries that do not require security . chips, such as the US, Canada and Asia. This summer, police blamed Roma . gipsies who were living rough on London’s Park Lane for a surge in . begging, pickpocketing and shoplifting. Police . are working closely with colleagues in Romania and other countries to . uncover suspects’ criminal records, and have won funding for eight . Romanian and Polish officers to work as liaison officials. In one case a . shoplifter was found to be a notorious Romanian criminal wanted for . more than 60 offences including kidnap and armed robbery. 'They fly on low-cost airlines, do a few hits in one city and get back in time for tea' Rob Wainwright, Europol director . Last . month, the Home Affairs Committee heard that foreigners with . convictions overseas can enter Britain, go on a crime spree and leave . hours later without being caught. The warning came as a report said staff shortages and a failing screening system have left Britain’s borders in chaos. The National Audit Office said terrorists and offenders are slipping through the net. Last year a family of pickpockets who built ‘palaces’ at home in Romania were jailed. The . Rostas family preyed on passengers on late-night trains out of London. They lived on benefits and stole hundreds of thousands from at least 185 . victims over two years. Government . figures suggest the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK has . gone up by a third in the past year. The number working in the UK rose . from 91,000 in April to June 2012 to 127,000 during the same period this . year. Both countries joined the EU in 2007, and from January 1 their citizens will have full rights to live and work here. France’s . foreign minister has called for Romanians and  Bulgarians to be stopped . from travelling freely. Laurent Fabius said there were security fears . over crooks using the two impoverished countries as a way into the rest . of the EU.

"Charged: Enrique Alberto Machado, from Texas, has been charged with murder over the tragic death of his 13-month-old son, Carlos, on April 27 . A baby boy has drowned in the bath tub after his drunken dad who was bathing him fell asleep on the floor, police said. Enrique Alberto Machado, from Texas, has been charged with felony murder over the tragic death of his 13-month-old son, Carlos Enrique, on April 27. The 36-year-old truck driver allegedly admitted to police that, before he bathed Carlos, he had driven at least 10 hours from Colorado to Houston, Texas and drank six beers with colleagues. Machado's girlfriend, Cynthia Veliz, found their son floating face up in the tub at her Houston home and Machado fast asleep about 11am. 'He [Machado] loved his son. I know he really did love him and I really know he never would have wanted this to happen,' Veliz told Digital Journal. 'Nothing is going to take away the pain that I feel.' Veliz said Machado came over to the house on Sunday morning to visit his son and offered to bathe him. Veliz then went back to bed and woke up two hours later when the phone rang. When she went to the bathroom, she was horrified to see her little boy's lifeless body in the bath. 'I went in there and I found the father asleep on the little step in the restroom and the baby was floating under the water,' she said, according to Click2Houston. Scroll down for video .

"Violent thugs (illustrated witha  stock image) aren’t criminalised by society, but may be born that way, researchers claim . Researchers have claimed that some people may be born with genes that makes them inherently violent. If true it would indicate some are simply born to be violent, rather than being criminalised by society. The scientists identified two genes that may be associated with extremely violent behaviour. One of them is a variant of cadherin 13 (CDH13), which is involved in neural connectivity, and has been linked to impulse control in extremely violent offenders. Experts at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden say that the majority of violent crime is committed by a small group of anti-social, repeat offenders and set out to discover why this may be. Previous studies have linked certain genes to violent crime, including a gene called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) that contributes to less recycling of the neurotransmitter, dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells. It plays a major role in reward-motivated behaviour. Previous studies investigating  MAOA’s connection with violence have proved inconclusive. Professor Jari Tiihonen and colleagues at the Institute analysed the genes of 895 Finnish people found guilty of criminal behaviour, organising them by the crimes they have committed. These ranged from non-violent offences - such as drug or property crimes - to extremely violent offences, such as homicide and battery. The researchers found a possible link between violent offences and MAOA, with the strongest association in the extremely violent offending group. Through additional research, including a genome-wide association study, they identified a gene involved in neural connectivity - a variant of cadherin 13 (CDH13) - that has been linked to impulse control in extremely violent offenders. The researchers identified two genes that may be associated with extremely violent behaviour. They also suggested that low dophamine recycling associated with the MAOA genotype, may result in higher aggression levels during intoxication (stock image pictured), increasing the risk of violent behaviour . ‘When compared to the control population, non-violent offenders were not observed to exhibit either variant to a greater degree, indicating that these genetic variants may be specific to extremely violent behaviour,’ Dr Tiihonen said. The researchers, whose findings were published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, suggest that the low dopamine recycling, which is associated with the MAOA genotype, may result in higher aggression levels during intoxication, increasing the risk of violent behaviour. German neurologist Dr Gergard Roth claims to have found the 'evil patch' in the brain's central lobe (ringed) that lurks in violent criminals . Last year, a German neurologist claimed to have found the area of the brain where evil lurks in killers, rapists and robbers. Bremen scientist Dr Gerhard Roth said the 'evil patch' lies in the brain's central lobe and shows up as a dark mass on X-rays. He discovered it when investigating violent convicted offenders over the years for German government studies. 'We showed these people short films and measured their brain waves,' he said. 'Whenever there were brutal and squalid scenes the subjects showed no emotions. In the areas of the brain where we create compassion and sorrow, nothing happened.' The dark mass at the front of the brain, he says, appears in all scans of people with records for criminal violence. His research has led him to believe that some criminals have a 'genetic predisposition' to violence. He added: 'When you look at the brain scans of hardened criminals, there are almost always severe shortcomings in the lower forehead part of the brain. 'There are cases where someone becomes criminal as a result of a tumour or an injury in that area, and after an operation to remove the tumour, that person was completely normal again. 'Or there are physiological deficits, because certain substances such as serotonin in the forebrain are not working effectively. 'But this is definitely the region of the brain where evil is formed and where it lurks.'","Experts at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden say the majority of violent crime is committed by a small group of anti-social, repeat offenders .

"A violent temper: Vincent Sisounong has been accused in the grisly crime, one which his brother believes he committed . Two men have been accused of breaking into a Washington home last month looking to torture strangers for a ‘thrill kill' but their target escaped before dying. Vincent Sisounong, 21, and Blessing Gainey, 19, broke into a Kirkland home Oct 12, pulled a teenager from his bed and methodically stabbed and sliced his writhing body while trying to slowly bleed him to death - at one point even trying to hack one of his legs off, officials said. Though Mr Sisounong's mother told MailOnline she does not believe he committed the horrific attack, the troubled man's brother told a local television station he believes the 21-year-old was involved. Prosecutors told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer the 18-year-old victim suffered ‘bone-deep cuts to his legs, shoulder and head and was losing large amounts of blood’ by the time paramedics arrived. Charging papers detailed by the Post-Intelligencer contend the two men broke into the house just before 6am with plans to kill. ‘They broke into the home of complete strangers with the intent to kill,’ said the papers. The son of Laotian immigrants, Mr Sisounong told detectives that he wanted the victim to ‘fight for his life’ and acknowledged the torture was enjoyable. Sound asleep in his bedroom, the unidentified victim was dragged from his bed a knife-point with threats made against his sister and parents if he failed to go along with the plan, said the papers. The doomed teen was moved to the family’s garage, where the two sickos first tried to chop off his leg, detectives said. Quickly losing blood, he somehow broke free and set off a car alarm in the garage - but was ordered to his knees as Mr Sisounong hacked at his shoulder and face - before escaping back into the house and cowering inside a bathroom. Scroll down for video . Shocking crime: This is the neighborhood where the attack happened, though it is not clear in which house it occurred . While Mr Gainey ran from the home, his partner went after the tortured teen, breaking through the door and trying to stab the 18-year-old through the door in a scene reminiscent of the film ‘The Shining.’ The terrified teenager punched his attacker in the face, causing him to flee the grisly scene just before cops arrived. Hospitalized for five days, the teen has mostly recovered from his injuries, but his tormenters remain in custody. Motivated by ‘pleasure and greed,’ the two sociopaths ‘broke into the home of complete strangers and tortured and stabbed a young man,’ the prosecutor said in the charging papers, according to the Post-Intelligencer. ‘They made repeated threats to kill the victim and stabbed him in his legs, shoulder, head and hands,’ the papers continued. Cops charged Mr Gainey after matching a fingerprint left on the teen’s door, he copped to the charged and turned stoolie on Mr Sisounong, said the papers. Further questioning of the duo led investigators to determine that Mr Sinsounong initially found the sleeping teen on the home’s third floor while Mr Gainey waited on the floor below. Also accused: Blessing Gainey, 19, has been accused to trying to hack the teen's leg off . ‘Sisounong stated that after finding (the teen) and his sister asleep in their beds on the third floor, he returned to Gainey on the second floor and stated that they had to kill them,’ detectives said. ‘Sisounong said that Gainey agreed to participate after debating the decision for ‘3-5 minutes,’ setting the horrifying chain of events into motion. Mr Sisounong, who appears to have been the main aggressor in the attack, said he ‘really wanted’ to kill the young man after talking to him for about half an hour, officials said. Phayvanh Sisounong, mother of Mr Sisounong, refuses to believe her son was responsible for the attack. When asked by MailOnline, she replied 'not really, I don't believe my son [would] do anything bad.' The shocked mother said her son is the father of a five-year-old boy. She also revealed that his father was never part of his life and that she hasn't spoken her son since his incarceration. Though not still with the mother of his son, the 22-year-old woman is the only person who can visit Mr Sisounong in jail, as Ms Sisounong must provide round-the-clock care for her disabled daughter. She noted that he has never been in trouble in school or with the law in the past, to her knowledge. Additionally, Dan Sayaseuth, Mr Sisounong's brother, told KIRO that the troubled young man has a violent temper and has threatened him with violence in the past.

"Remains discovered in mass grave under Pentridge Prison and identified by DNA tests . Bushranger was shot by police in Glenrowan in 1880 . Notorious: The body of Ned Kelly, Australia's most infamous criminal, is to be returned to his family for burial after more than a century . Australian outlaw Ned Kelly is to have his body returned to his family at last, after 130 years. Authorities have agreed to give the notorious bushranger's descendants his remains for burial, more than a century after he was  hanged for murder and dumped in a mass grave. His body was later exhumed from the grave at the Old Melbourne Jail and . buried in another mass grave at the city's Pentridge Prison. But it might not be third time lucky for the rogue, who was hanged for killing three policemen while on the run in the hills of Victoria. Historians say that his new resting place could become a target for grave robbers. Kelly's descendants have not yet chosen a cemetery for their infamous ancestor, but they have been warned to pick in a private place. It will be 131 years ago this Friday that 25-year-old Kelly was executed in Old Melbourne Jail in 1880. What were believed to be his remains were exhumed from Pentridge Prison in 2009 and DNA tests later proved the bones were those of the bushranger. 'From a family perspective, we want what every family wants - just a dignified family burial,' said Mr Anthony Griffiths, Kelly's great-great nephew, after Victoria's Attorney General, Mr Robert Clark, agreed this week to approve the return of the remains to the family. Kelly's family were horrified last month when the Victorian authorities . said they wanted to put the outlaw's bones on public display. Dramatic capture: The burnt remains of the Glenrowan Inn, where Kelly was caught before being hanged . Mr Jeremy Smith, senior archaeologist at Heritage Victoria, who led the team that uncovered the remains, said: 'They were just about the best preserved of all the remains at Pentridge, so they were about 95 per cent complete. 'To get that definitive identification of the remains of Ned Kelly… I really never thought that was possible.' Mr Smith told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the majority of the skull was missing from the skeleton, which was found jammed into an old axe box. Kelly was hit in the legs when he confronted police in his crude body armour made out of farm machine parts in the small town of Glenrowan in 1880. Mr Smith said the skeleton showed damage from the bullet wounds. Headless: Kelly's remains were identified after forensic examination . 'There are a few elements, I guess . his battle wounds from Glenrowan... there's damage to the toes on one of . the feet where we know he was injured at Glenrowan, but largely other . than those elements the skeleton is almost complete.' Mr . Griffith said one option for the burial place was the small town of . Greta, south of Glenrowan, where Kelly's mother Ellen and several of his . brothers and sisters and other relatives are buried. But . Kelly biographer Mr Ian Jones said graves of other family members have . been interfered with and unless the master criminal's grave was 'an absolute bunker, a . vault of some kind, I think his remains would not be safe.' He . added: 'Ned, you know, brings out the worst in some people. Even a . headstone, you know, Ned Kelly's headstone, would be incredibly . vulnerable to vandalism and theft.' Ned Kelly as the Australian-born son of an Irishman, John 'Red' Kelly, who was sent to Tasmania for stealing two pigs. His father died when he was 11-years-old, meaning he had to leave school and work on his grandfather's cattle farm to support his family. As a teenager, Kelly was already having run-ins with the law and was repeatedly accused of stealing livestock. He was first arrested, aged 14, for assaulting a Chinese man. Master criminal: Late actor Heath Ledger as the bushranger in the 2003 film Ned Kelly . He was also arrested for receiving stolen property and assault offences, and served three years hard labour while still in his teens. The family felt they were unfairly targeted by police. Kelly later shot a policeman who came to visit in the wrist because he was trying to get friendly with his sister, Kate. The officer vowed to pay the family back and made a false report which led to Kelly's mother being jailed for three years. Kelly and his brother went into hiding, fearing more repercussions. Three officers were then killed in a struggle after trailing them and they became outlaws. Over two years, the gang laid low in the bushlands of north-eastern Victoria - emerging to rob banks and the rich. During this time, they became folk heroes and symbols of Irish Australian resistance. They were eventually cornered at the Glenrowan Hotel where, after a nine-hour siege, Kelly emerged in a full suit of armour but he was captured after being shot in the legs and charged with murder. He was later hanged but his name became one of legend because of tales about his daring and he is not an iconic Australian figure.","Remains discovered in mass grave under Pentridge Prison and identified by DNA tests .

"The Carolina Panthers have kicked Greg Hardy, one of their biggest stars, off their roster - but only two months after he was convicted of strangling and threatening to kill his girlfriend in May. Team officials did not comment on the decision to deactivate 25-year-old Hardy - but it comes days after the release of video showing Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice brutally punching his wife in the face. Hardy has not been disciplined by the NFL. He played in last week's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and recorded one sack and three tackles. Greg Hardy, one of the Carolina Panthers' biggest stars, was kicked off the roster today after playing last weekending and during the pre-season . The Rice video has re-ignited national outrage over the NFL's handing of domestic violence. Rice was given a two-game suspension, but then kicked off the team and banned from the league when the video leaked. Hardy was convicted of assaulting Nicki Holder in a bench trial by a judge in Charlotte on July 16. He has appealed the ruling and is still awaiting a jury trial, which he is allowed under North Carolina law. Miss Holder told police that the 6-foot-4, 290lb defensive end, nicknamed 'Da Kraken,' choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his Charlotte condo in May. Officers noted bruises and scratches on her and she arrived at court the next day with her arm in a sling. Hardy was convicted in July of assaulting girlfriend Nicki Holder after a night out together. His lawyer claims that 6-foot-4 defensive end is actually the victim in the case . Hardy's lawyer has said that Hardy didn't abuse his girlfriend - and claimed that he was the victim after she became violent. In a ten-hour trial, Miss Holder testified that Hardy became upset when a Nelly song came on in the club where they were partying. She had had a brief fling with the rapper and she claimed Hardy was jealous. Hardy's lawyer, in turn, said that Miss Holder was high on cocaine and drunk and she herself became enraged when Hardy asked her to leave his condo after a night out together. A judge ultimately sided with Miss Holder and convicted Hardy. His appeal of her ruling is still open. Hardy had been named a 'franchise player' this year and was guaranteed a minimum $13.1million contract.","Hardy played last week and in the preseason, but will not play today .

"Study: Pregnant women with high perchlorate levels are more like to have children who go on to score in the bottom 10 percent for IQ . A chemical used in rocket fuel that is found in some regions' drinking water has been linked to significantly lower IQ's in the children of mothers exposed while they were pregnant, a new study has found. Perchlorate, which is also found in fireworks, explosives and is a byproduct of using fertilizers, may cause this by disrupting the thyroid's normal hormone production. 'Our report highlights a pressing need for larger studies of perchlorate levels from the general pregnant population and those with undetected hypothyroidism,' the authors wrote. The study, which was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, identified pregnant women in Cardiff, Wales and Turin, Italy who had iodine deficiency and thyroid dysfunction. Researches then tested their perchlorate levels. Three years later they tested their children's IQ. They found that women with the highest 10 percent of perchlorate levels were over three times more likely to have children with an IQ score in the lowest 10 percent. Perchlorate is found in around 4 percent of the U.S. public drinking water, according to Scientific American. That affects 5 to 17 million people. Perchlorate is most prevalent in the Western U.S., specifically near Las Vegas and Southern California. A Canadian survey released in May reported that all samples of fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products and infant formulae analyzed for perchlorate were safe for consumption. The CFIA tested a total of 611 samples, including 433 fresh fruit and vegetable, 89 dairy product , and 89 infant formula samples, collected from Canadian retail stores. The 2010-2011 study found that 65 percent of fresh fruit and vegetable, 87 percent of dairy product, and 63 percent of infant formula samples analyzed were found to contain very low levels of perchlorate, in the range of 2 to 540 parts per billion. EPA officials have long gone back and forth as to whether to cap the amount of perchlorate allowable in drinking water. In 2002, an EPA draft risk assessment found that 1 part per billion should be considered safe. Six years later, the Bush administration decided not to regulate the chemical, instead recommending that concentrations not exceed 15 parts per billion. At the time, federal scientists estimated that 16.6 million Americans could be exposed to unsafe levels through their drinking water. California and Massachusetts in the meantime have set state-level drinking water standards. Currently, the EPA plans to unveil new standards for perchlorate in water in summer 2015. Rocket fuel: The EPA has debated for decades over whether or not to put a limit on how much perchlorate may be present in drinking waterThe chemical is most prevalent in areas adjacent to military bases .","Pregnant women with high perchlorate levels are more like to have children who go on to score in the bottom 10 percent for IQ .

"Psychedelic drugs such as LSD and magic mushrooms do not cause mental health problems in users, a new study has claimed. Researchers in Norway have said they in fact found 'significant associations' between the drugs and fewer psychological problems. The team, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU) Department of Neuroscience, studied more than 130,000 random people, including 22,000 who had used the drugs at least once, included in a health survey in the US. A new study claims the use of psychedelic drugs including LSD (pictured) and magic mushrooms does not cause mental health problems . Clinical psychologist Pål-Ørjan Johansen, who carried out the study with researcher Teri Krebs, said: 'After adjusting for other risk factors, lifetime use of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline or peyote, or past year use of LSD was not associated with a higher rate of mental health problems or receiving mental health treatment.' The team studied the 2001-2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health which asked people about mental health conditions including general psychological distress, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and psychosis. Krebs and Johansen used the data to investigate connections between the use of psychedelic drugs and the mental health issues. The researchers said rather than finding a connection between their use and an increase in problems, they discovered long-term use of drugs such as psilocybin or mescaline was linked to 'lower rates of serious psychological distress'. Meanwhile, people who had used LSD in the last 12 months were also associated with lower rates of distress, while those who had used the drug long-term had a lower rate of treatment for mental health issues. The researchers have said it is not possible to determine the reason behind their discoveries, because of the nature of the study, and warned the drugs could be harmful to some. The researchers used the 2001-2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which asked people about a range of mental health conditions, for the study . They wrote: 'We cannot exclude the possibility that use of psychedelics might have a negative effect on mental health for some individuals or groups, perhaps counterbalanced at a population level by a positive effect on mental health in others.' The researchers pointed out that recent trials 'have also failed to find any evidence of any lasting harmful effects of psychedelics'. Krebs said: 'Everything has some potential for negative effects, but psychedelic use is overall considered to pose a very low risk to the individual and to society.' The results are published in the journal PLOS One.","Researchers in Norway studied data of more than 130,000 people .

"Drunk driver: Dorota Wysoczanska, 36, was at more than twice the legal drink-drive limit when she took a wrong exist onto the A14 dual carriageway . A drunk nurse who drove her Mini Cooper twenty miles down a dual carriageway in the wrong direction at 3.30am has walked free from court. Dorota Wysoczanska, 36, turned down an exit lane onto the A14 outside Newmarket, Suffolk, and continued through Bury St Edmunds at around 60mph until she was stopped by a rolling police roadblock. Wysoczanska, who was at more than twice the drink-drive limit, had earlier driven past several patrol cars which had tried to pull her over during the incident on Boxing Day last year. A hearing at Ipswich Crown Court heard that Wysoczanska was fleeing a violent encounter with her boyfriend at the time, and trying to get home to Ashford, Kent when she entered the main road the wrong way. Lori Tucker, prosecuting, said passed turn-offs and lay-bys and didn't stop, and was only brought to a halt when two police cars closed the road in front of her. Tests showed the repeat offender had 75mcgs of alcohol in 100mls of breath. The legal limit is 35mcgs. Wysoczanska  admitted dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol. The court also heard she had a previous drink-driving conviction from 2008. She was given a two-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and a 40-month driving ban. Wysoczanska will also have to take an extended retest to regain her licence, and must pay £120 in costs. Recorder Jonathan Seely said she was very fortunate that traffic had been so light at the time, and branded her driving 'highly dangerous'. Mr Seely said he accepted she had been 'distressed' after allegedly being assaulted by her partner on Christmas Day night as they stayed with friends in King's Lynn, Norfolk. But he said that even if she had a genuine reason for wanting to get away from him she should not have got behind the wheel after downing the amount of alcohol she had that night. Steven Dyble, defending, said . Wysoczanska was a nurse and had lost her job which involved driving in . the community as a result of the terrifying incident. Mr Dyble said she had got a new post working with dementia patients which let her use public transport. Wrong way: Wysoczanska drove the wrong way down a dual-carriageway stretch of the A14 (pictured) Pitch black: Wysoczanska, who was driving at 3.30am, was eventually stopped by police . He said she had been assaulted by her boyfriend and had fled the house where they were staying to drive after he had fallen asleep. Mr Dyble added that she had been relying on the sat nav in her car to find her way home. He said that after missing the right turning on to the A14 she'd taken the next one which took her the wrong way on to the usually busy route. Mr Dyble said that because Wysoczanska was travelling the wrong way there were no signs indicating lay-bys or turn offs and she had panicked. He said that once she realised her catastrophic blunder she flashed her headlights and turned on her hazard lights in a bid to warn shocked motorists heading straight towards her.","Dorota Wysoczanska, 36, drove her Mini Cooper onto the A14 at 3.30am .

"A graphic designer confessed to a friend she hoped her mother 'dies soon' a year before she plotted to poison her in a Breaking Bad-style plot, a court heard. Kuntal Patel, 37, is accused of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly toxin after the 60-year-old 'forbade' her from marrying her boyfriend, Niraj Kakad. The phials of poison, ordered from the US, came hidden inside a candle, but the parcel was tracked by the FBI prompting a swoop by counter terrorist officers on Patel's home, Southwark Crown Court heard. 'Plot': Kuntal Patel, 37, (left)  is accused of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel, 60, (right) by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly poison in a Breaking Bad-style plot . Mrs Patel, a magistrate who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates’ Court in Bow, east London, drank the poison last December, but survived. Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard that Patel duped her close friend Julie Wong into having the package containing the deadly poison, which she had bought online using Bitcoins, delivered to her home in Streatham, south London. She pretended it was a romantic gift of an expensive candle from Mr Kakad, who she had met on a dating site, which she did not want her mother to discover. Ms Wong told London’s Southwark Crown Court that Patel, who she had known since university, was bullied and beaten by her mother, who was determined to break up her relationship. The court heard that in a series of increasingly desperate emails and texts, Patel confided in her friend about the 'relentless' abuse and violence she suffered at her mother’s hands. In one message in August 2012 she said: 'My life is so messed up right now, I actually wish I was dead or wish my mum died. I hate her so much.' The following month, on September 24, she messaged Ms Wong again about her mother, saying: 'She got what she wanted, ruining my life. She should be happy. She blatantly said to me ""I don’t care if you’re unhappy because I made the right decision"". Friends: The court heard that Patel told her friend Julie Wong (left) that she wished her mother was dead, and told another pal Darcia Babb (right) that her mother was a 'psycho', and she was afraid she might kill herself . 'She keeps bringing it up, I don’t. She just sits on the sofa crying, I hope she dies soon.' Shocked, Ms Wong had replied: 'Oh f*** Kuntal, you didn’t just say that?' Patel shot back: 'What, it is true. I’m sorry, I won’t talk about it. It’s killing me. I really miss Niraj and we would have been really happy together.' Peter Rowlands, defending, said Patel’s mother inflicted a 'war of abuse and physical violence' on her daughter, who lost weight and became suicidal under the strain. Patel, who worked as a graphic designer for Barclays Bank, complained that her mother banned her from seeing her boyfriend and beat her. In an email in July 2012 she confided in an email to Ms Wong that her mother beat her. She wrote: 'I can’t hit her back. My life is so worthless I just sit and take it because I deserve it and my life is not going to change at all. 'She just sits and shouts at me like a bulldog. No reason or logic apart from being a psycho.' Ms Wong said Patel sent her photographs of her bruised arm after her mother hit her. She told jurors that Patel had been hit by her mother 'a few times', adding: 'There was one time she sent me a picture message. It was of bruising on her arm. She said it was caused by her mother.' Ms Wong said her close friend became increasingly depressed and her weight plummeted in the two years before the alleged poisoning. She encouraged her friend to break free of her mother’s stranglehold, and said she had no suspicions when she asked her to accept a package for her at her home last November. Patel initially told her the package was a watch which Mr Kakad was posting to her from America. But when the black A3-sized package arrived at Ms Wong’s neighbour’s house on December 10 last year, Patel changed her story and said it was an expensive candle. Ms Wong said: 'She told me it was a candle given to her from Niraj. It was a memory for her. It was a very expensive candle. Accused: Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard that Patel (pictured in a court sketch) duped her close friend Julie Wong into having the package containing the deadly poison, which she had bought online using Bitcoins . 'They were at a hotel one time, she liked this candle, he remembered it and bought her one.' Mr Rowlands told jurors that Patel had an extremely strained relationship with her mother, who 'treated her like a child' and gave her curfews. The day before the package arrived she had told Ms Wong she was desperately unhappy and considering 'killing herself', jurors heard. After Kuntal bought the substance from American Jesse Korff, the FBI tracked the sale to London, and alerted British counter terrorism police, jurors heard. Jonathan Polnay, prosecuting, said: 'The order of event is information was received from the American authorities on January 25, 2014. 'A search was carried out at two addresses in Wyatt Park Road in Streatham - these are the addressees of James Sutcliffe and Julie Wong.' Specialist officers trained in chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear substances then searched Kuntal's home. DC Simon Thomas from the Met's Counter Terror command said: 'Due to the nature of the substances we were seeking, we had CBRN officers trained for dealing with chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear material. 'They wore protective equipment.' He added that their main concern was if there was 'any immediate threat from the substance or people in the address'. DC Thomas told the court that when Kuntal's East London home was raided on January 26, this year, she claimed not to have known there was anything inside the candle she received. When asked by him what had arrived in the package, Kuntal allegedly said: 'It was just a candle that I ordered. I don't have it because it was destroyed in the post - the glass smashed.' DC Thomas asked her where it had been ordered from, why it had been sent to Ms Wong's address and why she bought it. The graphic designer for Barclays in Canary Wharf replied: 'Online - I can't remember. Because I wasn't available at home, she was. 'It was like a surprise gift - a present. I was going to give it to my mum.' Role: Mrs Patel, a magistrate who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates’ Court in Bow, east London, drank the poison last December, but survived . She also told police that because the glass had smashed she threw the candle away in the dustbin. Kuntal was initially arrested on suspicion of keeping the drug without permission. Jurors also heard from Darcia Babb, Kuntal's best friend of 20 years and a detective constable with the Met's Trident unit. She said in a string of emails she was told by Kuntal that she 'could not live without' Mr Kakad and she had confronted her mother but was told 'over my dead body'. Upon reading this, Ms Babb replied: 'Make a decision, are you going to stay there or leave. I fear she is going to kill you.' Responding to this, Kuntal said: 'You don't know what she is capable of, she is psycho. She will go all out to ruin me or anyone associated with me. 'I am scared now my mum will kill herself.' Later, DC James Galvin, who questioned Patel over three days, read the interview transcripts to the court, and said she had described her mother as 'quite healthy', despite suffering with high blood pressure. She had said: 'I still don't agree with how she has dealt with it [her engagement] but at the end of the day she is still my mother.' She went on to claim she bought the poison to kill herself, after seeing at TV documentary. 'That's when things started going in my head - will this be good to probably use,' she had said. 'It is just something you could just drink and just die from.' Patel told the police the poison arrived in a candle, but the glass shell had smashed so she threw the contents away. 'It was a candle and the glass had smashed. I was quite scared so I threw it away.' She added she had spent between £600 to £900 on the product. Patel said she had been 'fairly desperate and wanted to find a way out'. 'I didn't want my mum and my sister to open it', she explained. 'I think the lid of the jar was on but the surrounding jar had all smashed....when I opened it I saw the glass was everywhere.' Patel went on to deny she had ever suffered mental health problems and stated she was no longer feeling suicidal. US series Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston as chemistry teacher Walter White, who cooks crystal meth to fund his cancer treatment. He kills a character using poison. Earlier in the trial the court heard that Patel called the man who sold her the poison ‘Heisenberg’ – White’s alias. Patel, of Plaistow, east London, denies trying to murder her mother and acquiring a biological agent or toxin. She has pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin last December. The trial continues.

"For the last seven years, Rick and Cindy Krlich claim they've been the target of 'terrorist honkers'. The Hubbard, Ohio couple say motorists driving past their home have beeped more than 5,000 times out of revenge for trying to buy a neighbor's house in 2007. The married couple allege the honking, in addition to ongoing harassment and stalking, has ruined their lives and are suing 40 of their neighbors, including some of the small town's most prominent citizens.

Long-time Hubbard, Ohio, residents Rick and Cindy Krlich claim they're the subject of a honking harassment campaign and have been beeped 5,000 times over seven years following a property dispute . The house that 'started it all' 'The Clemente House': The Krlichs say the honking started when they tried to buy their neighbors' house (pictured) in 2007 . Rick Krlich told ABC News the trouble began in 2007 when he tried to buy the house next door. Krlich filed a lawsuit to stop John Clemente from buying the house while it was in probate court, even though it had been in the . Clemente family for several generations. The lawsuit failed and the Clementes moved in, but Krlich claims the action annoyed John Clemente who at the time was . the town fire chief. Krlich . contends John Clemente and his family retaliated by organizing a 'vast . conspiracy' of horn honking, even getting senior figures and law . enforcers in the town to join in. Krlich . has gathered mountains of 'evidence', including surveillance footage of cars driving past honking their horns, to prove that he's being harassed. He also maintains a website stating his case in detail and documenting hundreds of his complaints to police. On the site, he calls the alleged honking campaign 'small town terrorism'. The Clementes .

"David Moyes has held talks with Juventus’s chief transfer negotiator after planning a bold double move for Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal. The Manchester United manager met boardroom boss Beppe Marotta after Juventus’s game at Cagliari on Sunday and discussed the possibility of signing either, or both, of his top two targets. After travelling to Cagliari with first-team coach Jimmy Lumsden to see Juve roar back from 1-0 down to win 4-1 and maintain their lead at the top of Serie A, Moyes outlined his transfer plans with the Turin club’s top administrator. VIDEO: Watch Paul Pogba's brilliant volley against Napoli earlier this season . Audacious: Manchester United are in talks over a move for Juve midfielders Paul Pogba (left) and Arturo Vidal . Scouting mission: Manchester United boss David Moyes flew to Italy to watch the Italian giants on Sunday . But by the time he headed back to Manchester, he was forced to accept he would have his work cut out to entice Pogba back to Old Trafford and would have to wait until the summer to capture Vidal. Zinedine Zidane said Pogba’s departure from United 18 months ago was ‘the biggest mistake of Sir Alex Ferguson’s career’, but Moyes is clinging to the hope he can rectify it, despite the cost. Paris Saint-Germain’s interest and willingness to offer Pogba a route back to his home city is likely to push the asking price beyond £40million. He is understood to favour PSG but has not ruled out a  second spell at Old Trafford. For now, Juventus are adamant about hanging on to him and Marotta said: ‘From our point of view, we do not want to sell Pogba and, so far, we have closed the door to any possible buyer.’ Bad move: Zinedine Zidane (second left) said allowing Pogba to leave was the 'biggest mistake' of Sir Alex Ferguson's career . Sadly for Moyes, those close to Marotta . fully expect him to resist all approaches for the likes of Pogba, Vidal, . Claudio Marchisio and striker Fernando Llorente during the January . window but be more receptive to  overtures in the summer, particularly . for Marchisio. It has also emerged that Moyes fared little better in his efforts to off-load fringe players. Juventus remain keen on Nani but are being deterred not by his hamstring injury but the asking price of between £16m and £18m. They will offer only half as much. Fiorentina are discussing a loan option for midfielder Anderson, with a view to a £5.4m deal in the summer. Full back Fabio is also attracting interest from Italy but he could be heading to Cardiff after being targeted by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. On the move: Anderson (right) could be on his way to Fiorentina . Big offer: Galatasaray are set to offer Nemanja Vidic a huge amount of money to sign for them in the summer . Meanwhile, Monaco have joined Galatasaray in bidding to sign Nemanja Vidic on a free transfer this summer.

But Ligue 1 Monaco are also showing interest in taking the Serbia centre half, who is out of contract at the end of the season.","Manchester United manager David Moyes met Juve's chief transfer negotiator Beppe Marotta .

"The Danish man who claims he worked with the CIA to infiltrate al-Qaeda and helped take out radical anti-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, had a lesser-known job: matchmaker to the terrorists. Morton Storm, a Danish convert to Islam, was a trusted al-Qaeda associate when he was offered $250,000 by the CIA to find a wife for Awlaki - who already had two - in an effort to track him down. To do this, Storm turned to Facebook, and found 'Aminah' - who said she was a fan of Awlaki. He then orchestrated an exchange of previously unseen video messages between the two, and - despite an assassination order on Awlaki from the U.S. - they agreed to marry. But while successful in its early stages, the rest of the CIA's plot was thwarted. Scroll down for video . Morten Storm has come forward to claim that he was an al-Qaeda double agent and helped the CIA track down and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, a top figure in the terror group . Made for each other? Storm says he conducted an exchange of videos between Awlaki and Aminah, in which they talked about her becoming his third wife . The CIA plan, Morton says, was to . plant a tracking device on Aminah's luggage when she came to Yemen to . meet her new husband - which would lead the agency directly to Awlaki's hideout. In a video appearing on the . site of Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, she said: 'I would go with him anywhere. I am 32 . years old and I am ready for dangerous things. I’m not afraid of death . or to die in the sake of Allah.' Homeland Season 2 spoiler alert: . Croatian Aminah, who used to work with disabled children in Zagreb, also adds: 'I feel nervous. This is very awkward for me. I just taped this so you can see how I look.' In his reply, Awlaki - who had specifically requested a white Muslim convert to be his 'companion in hiding' - said: 'If you . can live in difficult conditions, do not mind loneliness and can live . with restrictions on your communication with others, then that is . great.' He also mentions an associate, purported to be Storm, saying: 'The brother who is carrying this video is a trustworthy brother.' The pair exchanged encrypted video messages, with Awlaki saying in one: 'I currently do not live in a tent, but in a house [that] belongs to a friend. I'm not leaving the house and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time. I prefer this residence [to] a tent in the mountains because it gives me ability to read, write and research.' At a meeting in Vienna, Austria, Storm showed . Aminah a video recording made by Awlaki, who was dressed in . white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif. In it he says: 'This recording is . done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request. I pray Allah . guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter. And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this . proposal.' Storm said Aminah burst into tears when after watching the video. In videos she sent to Awlaki, wearing a headscarf, she says: 'I will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that I have chosen . and inshallah Allah will help us.' In another, with the headscarf removed, she says: 'Brother, it's me without the scarf, so you can see my . hair. I hope you are happy with me, inshallah.' The CIA and Storm both knew the . dangers of the mission meant there was a risk Aminah would be killed, . but were content to continue in their bid to track Awlaki. And during another trip to Vienna, Storm bought Aminah her plane ticket and gave her $3,000 from Awlaki. She and the bugged suitcase arrived in Sanaa as planned and Storm received a text from the CIA saying 'Congratulations brother, you just got rich, very rich'. He was handed a briefcase just outside Copenhagen, Denmark, containing $250,000. When he asked the combination for the lock, he was told simply: 'Try 007.' But the plan to plant a tracking device on Aminah collapsed when she was contacted by al-Qaeda operatives, who told the woman to ditch . her suitcase before meeting Awlaki. Dead: Anwar al-Awlaki (left and right) was killed in a . drone attack in Yemen in September 2011 - Morten Storm claims it was . directly helped by him . While the plan for Aminah to lead the U.S. to Awlaki failed, the marriage ended up working out. But their bond was cut short when Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike on September 30, 2011. But Aminah has reportedly taken up . her husband's cause, writing for the online terror magazine Inspire, . which famously included the article, 'How to Build a Bomb in the Kitchen . of Your Mom.' She also told al-Qaeda leaders that she would carry out a suicide mission in an act of revenge, but she was told not to. Storm, who has come forward to Danish . newspaper Jyllands-Posten, has said that he was a former Islamic . supremacist before the Danish intelligence service PET convinced him to . change sides and work for them and eventually the American CIA. Storm has claimed that he became so . deeply trusted by Anwar al-Awlaki that President Obama knew his name . and that it was him who delivered a USB stick the Americans used to . track al-Awlaki to the convoy that they destroyed in Yemen in September . 2011. In a statement issued in response to . the story, the Danish spy organisation said that as a matter of policy . it does not publicly confirm sensitive information about its past, . current or future operations, nor does it deny incorrect information. Three peas in a pod? President Obama and Defense Secretary and former CIA boss Leon Panetta were allegedly aware of Morten Storm's existence . The CIA and the White House have not commented on Storm's role in the death of al-Awlaki. Storm told Jyllands-Posten that he suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime. In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran. He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni woman with whom he had a son named Osama. According . to the newspaper report, in 2006, he had a dramatic and unexplained . change of heart and was turned double agent by the Danish intelligence . service, PET. After . five years, Storm claimed to have worked his way to the top of al-Qaeda . in the Arabian Peninsula's inner circle and gained direct access to . al-Awlaki. Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, . had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the . Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into hiding. Before his death, he was believed to . be responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk . Abdulmuttalab to conceal explosives in his underwear which he tried to . use to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on December 25th, 2009. He also played a role in the 2009 .

"The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to overturn California’s same-sex marriage ban in a historic act that would affect several other states that offer benefits to gay and lesbian couples. The administration’s friend-of-the-court brief today was notable as it marked the first time any U.S. president spurred the high court to expand the rights of gays and lesbians to marry. The ban, otherwise known as Proposition 8, prohibits same-sex couples from marrying and was approved by voters in California in 2008; the case is set to be argued on March 26. Showing support: The Obama administration has asked the Supreme Court Thursday to over turn Proposition 8, a 2008 law that banned gay marriage . California is one of eight states that give same-sex couples the legal benefits of marriage through civil unions and domestic partnerships. The other states are: Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Nevada, and Oregon. None of these states, however, allow gay couples to marry. The administration suggested that it is unconstitutional to block these couples from wedding, in direct opposition of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The administration wrote: 'They establish homes and lives together, support each other financially, share the joys and burdens of raising children, and provide care through illness and comfort at the moment of death.’ Mr Obama's position, if adopted by the court, would likely result in gay marriage becoming legal in the seven other states. The president was publically against gay marriage in his first term, famously saying that his views were ‘evolving,’ and also became the first president to openly support the institution. He told ABC News’ Robin Roberts in an interview last May that he continues to believe ‘this is an issue that is going to be worked out at the local level, because historically, this has not been a federal issue, what’s recognized as a marriage.’ Point of contention: Protestors of Prop 8 pictured in Los Angeles in 2008; its supporters say that the law is discriminatory . Moment of change: The Supreme Court justices will begin hearing arguments on March 26; the ruling is due at the end of June . Mr Obama, who himself is a former constitutional law professor, signed off on the administration's legal argument last week following lengthy discussions with Attorney General Eric Holder and Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. In a statement following the filing, Mr Holder said 'the government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law.' Friend-of-the-court briefs are not legally binding. But the government's opinion in particular could carry some weight with the justices when they hear oral arguments in the case on March 26. Despite the potentially wide-ranging implications of the administration's brief, it still falls short of what gay rights advocates and the attorneys who will argue against Proposition 8 had hoped for. Those parties had pressed the president to urge the Supreme Court to not only overturn California's ban, but also declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional. Upholding the Constitution: Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement 'the government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law' Still, marriage equality advocates publicly welcomed the president's legal positioning. 'President Obama and the solicitor general have taken another historic step forward consistent with the great civil rights battles of our nation's history,' said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign and co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which brought the legal challenge to Prop 8. The president raised expectations that he would back a broad brief during his inauguration address on January 21. He said the nation's journey 'is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.' Benefits: Eight states allow same-sex marriage, while 30 have banned it; states like California have a constitutional ban on marriage, but allow civil unions and domestic partnerships . 'For if we are truly created equal, than surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,' he added. A Field Poll found that California voters now favor same-sex marriage in a near two-to-one margin, the highest level of support LGBT marriage has ever had in the state. As Reuters notes, the findings signify a paradigm shift in voters, who in 2008 voted to approve Prop 8. Those who still did not favor gay marriage tended to be voters who were 65 or older, with 48 percent against. AP and Reuters contributed to this report.","Obama administration made friend-of-the-court brief Thursday asking Supreme Court to overturn Proposition 8, which bans gay marriage in California .

"Britain's first Muslim free school is controlled by religious hardliners who ban children from singing or reading fairy tales and force staff to wear headscarves - according to the former head teacher and deputy who claim they were forced to leave. Andrew Cutts-McKay resigned from his role as head of al Madinah School in Derby in August, two months after deputy Suzanne Southerland stepped down from her post. Both allege they were 'bullied and sidelined' by members of the school's trust, which is predominantly Muslim. The school strongly denies the pair's claims. Allegations: Staff claim religious hardliners have banned singing and fairy tales at the al-Madinah School, Derby . But earlier this week, concerns were raised by teachers who complained they were being ordered to wear the hijab – even if they are not Muslim. Now claims have been made that alongside the strict dress code, the school's 200 pupils are banned from playing stringed instruments, which are forbidden in the Islamic faith. Singing is also forbidden unless it involves Islamic faith songs, while youngsters are not allowed to read fairy tales as these are 'non-Islamic'. A staff member told The Sunday Times: 'When teaching children the alphabet, you could not associate the letter 'p' with pig.' They added: 'We were told that we couldn't read the children a story about a witch because it's seen as being non-Islamic.' Other staff have highlighted ‘concerns’ over the school's practices, which include banning non-halal food and forcing female pupils as young as four to sit at the back of the class away from boys. Claims: A Muslim member of staff from Al-Madinah School. Some other members of staff are claiming they have been asked to wear headscarves . Female members of staff, some of whom are not Muslims, say they have been told to sign new contracts which force them to wear the hijab. These also ban them from wearing jewellery on the school’s premises in Derby. One woman, who had been interviewed for a position, claimed she was told she was not allowed to shake hands with male teachers to avoid ‘insult’. Another staff member, speaking anonymously to the Mail, said the school was ‘like being in Pakistan’. She said: ‘Girls are treated very separately from boys, the girls sit at the back of the classroom. ‘Boys go and eat first at lunchtime and then the girls are allowed to go. ‘It is like being in any school in Pakistan. That is why it was founded, that is the idea.’ The decision to make all female members of staff, regardless of religious beliefs, wear the Islamic headscarf – which covers the head but not the face – was apparently introduced over the summer. But some female members of staff have been spotted removing the headwear immediately after stepping out of the school building during their lunch hour. And around half a dozen teachers at the free school, who could face losing their jobs if they refuse to comply with the rules, are now seeking legal advice from the National Union of Teachers. Regional NUT officer Nick Raine said: ‘We are very worried about the school and the education of the 200 children there. ‘There are worries over practices . concerning the discrimination between male and female pupils in the . school, with the girls being told to sit at the back of the class . regardless of whether they can see the board properly.' He added: ‘It’s one thing to have a dress code which we can challenge and quite another to build it into a contract. ‘The school is publicly accountable so there needs to be a greater level of transparency.’ As a free school, Al-Madinah operates outside local authority control but still qualifies for government funding. It was set up in September last year. Sue Arguile, branch secretary of the . Derby National Union of Teachers, said the new demands stem from the . Al-Madinah’s free school status. A hijab is typically worn by a Muslim . female beyond the age of puberty in the presence of adult males - it . covers the head and chest, but not the face. It . not only refers to the physical body covering, but also a state of . mind, where al-hijab refers to ‘the veil which separates man or the . world from God’. Hijab can also be used to refer to the seclusion of women from men in public. Most . often, it is worn by Muslim women as a symbol of modesty, privacy and . morality. If differs from a burqa, a veil that covers the entire body . head and face, and the niqab which covers the entire head and face . except for the eyes. She said: ‘We have always had a number of concerns about this school ever since it was first set up, as essentially they can do what they like. ‘There is no buffer between them and the state and no protection for staff and pupils. ‘Free schools set their own rules, curriculums and dress codes, and so long as pupils and staff are aware of them before joining, then there is no upset. ‘But forcing people to agree to contractual changes or face being out of work could breach employment law.’ Former head teacher Andrew Cutts-McKay, who left after less than a year in the post, previously said the school would ‘honour all faiths’. However he admitted that he thought at least half of the school’s pupils would be Muslims. The school’s acting principal Stuart Wilson, who began his job on September 5, denied claims of bullying towards his former colleagues. He also disputed that there was anything within staff contracts requiring women to wear the hijab or a headscarf. However, he added: 'The expectation for female staff, raised in adverts and interviews, is that the head is covered while on site. To date, no complaint has been raised with the governing body relating to female staff wearing the hijab or headscarf.' Banned: Non-Halal food is thought to have also been banned at the school, some of which is based in Norman House in Derby, pictured.","Andrew Cutts-McKay, former head of al-Madinah School in Derby and former deputy Suzanne Southerland claim they were 'sidelined' by the school .

"The Drug Enforcement Administration paid an Amtrak employee hundreds of thousands of dollars over two decades to obtain confidential information it could have gotten for free, according to internal investigators at the railroad. According to a report released Monday by Amtrak's inspector general, the DEA paid an Amtrak secretary $854,460 to be an informant. The employee was not publicly identified except as a 'secretary to a train and engine crew.' Amtrak's own police agency is already in a joint drug enforcement task force that includes the DEA. According to the inspector general, that task force can obtain Amtrak confidential passenger reservation information at no cost. Amtrak is not a federal agency but it runs its own police force -- which already partners with the DEA and shares information like passenger lists and cargo manifests . The office of Amtrak Inspector General Tom Howard declined to identify the secretary or say why it took so long to uncover the payments. Howard's report on the incident suggested policy changes and 'other measures to address control weaknesses that Amtrak management is considering.' DEA spokeswoman Dawn Dearden declined to comment. Amtrak is officially known as the National Railroad Passenger Corp. and is not a government agency, although it has received tens of billions of dollars in federal subsidies and is subject to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Passenger name reservation information is collected by airlines, rail carriers and others and generally includes a passenger's name, the names of other passengers traveling with them, the dates of the ticket and travel, frequent flier or rider information, credit card numbers, emergency contact information, travel itinerary, baggage information, passport number, date of birth, gender and seat number. Amtrak's inspector general said the secretary provided the passenger information without seeking approval from Amtrak management or police, but Amtrak's own corporate privacy policy expressly allows it to sell or share personal information about its customers and passengers with contractors or a category of others it describes as 'certain trustworthy business partners.' It was not immediately clear whether the DEA has rules against soliciting corporate insiders to provide confidential customer information in exchange for money when providing that information would cause the employee to violate a company's or organization's own rules or policies. The DEA does not publish on its website its staff manuals or instructions for employees. Drug Enforcement Administration  Administrator Michele Leonhart will face pressure after the revelation that her agency paid an Amtrak secretary $854,460 over nearly 20 years to obtain confidential information about train passengers . Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said the hundreds of thousands of dollars in payouts were unnecessary, and demanded more information from the DEA . The report said the secretary was allowed to retire, rather than face administrative discipline, after the discovery that the employee had 'regularly' sold private passenger information since 1995 without Amtrak's approval, said the IG's summary. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the $854,460 an unnecessary expense and asked for further information about the incident in a letter he released Monday to DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart. Grassley said the incident 'raises some serious questions about the DEA's practices and damages its credibility to cooperate with other law enforcement agencies.' It's not unprecedented for law enforcement to have professional people who are informants employed in transportation and other industries, said a federal law enforcement official who is familiar with the incident involving Amtrak. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record. The official said that years ago during the investigation of drug lord Pablo Escobar, an informant at a U.S. chemical company provided a major assist to law enforcement by informing authorities that thousands of gallons of acetone were being shipped to Colombia. Acetone is used to manufacture cocaine.","DEA paid nearly $43k per year for 20 years to an 'informant' who was passing along private passenger data .

"By the end of her life, there was a chasm between me and my adored mother that was really rather sad. We visited each other’s worlds, bewildered tourists both, before scuttling back to what each believed to be the ‘sanity’ of her own. And no wonder. For worlds apart is what we were. My mother was clever, no doubt about it; at 14 she won a scholarship for a further education that her family could neither afford her to take nor imagine to be useful. So she worked - courageously, too: as operator of the Swansea air raid sirens, she could not take shelter as the bombs rained down. But she stopped work altogether when she married, kept kith and kin together and dallied with women of similarly mundane lives over coffee mornings and afternoon teas. Rings true: Carol can identify with the points made in the book The XX Factor . For me, just one generation later, further education was a birthright. Nobody was surprised that my sister and I went to university in the Seventies, then into law and the media respectively. Which places us, we now learn, in a history-making elite: the XX women. The title comes from a groundbreaking new book by Alison Wolf, The XX Factor — How Working Women Are Creating A New Society, in which she describes this elite as the 15 per cent of women who are graduate professionals, high achievers and top earners; the women who live to work against the 85 per cent who work to live, if they work at all. And these ‘alpha women’ are finding more in common with men like themselves than with less accomplished members of their own sex — thus creating a yawning gap between two different classes of women. To which I can only say to Alison Wolf: what took you so long? More than a mother: Carol is proud to be a grandmother to Milly, pictured, but she doesn't let these roles define her . At last, somebody has noticed what I have felt all along: that there are easily 85  per cent of women in this country with whom I have nothing in common — and I count my mother among them. This book explains what I have always known — that, to women like me, most other women’s lives and conversational topics are dreary, cliched and uninteresting. Even as a teenager, I never understood the bonding girl thing. The sleepovers, where you spent the evening painting each other’s toenails in somebody’s (usually pink) bedroom. So instead, I hung around with boys who would become alpha men. Together we smoked and argued about Vietnam. When the boys became young men, I still sought their company. Not because I wanted to be a man, but because I wanted what men had. And, by and large, I got it. Time in male company taught me that my intellect and abilities were as good as theirs. So it figured that if I put in the hours that they did, I was entitled to the same rewards. And if others were too stupid or too idle, well, lock them in their pink bedrooms. 'For us XX women, children do not define you in the way that other achievements do' Kind? No. Honest? Yes. But I’ve largely kept my opinions to myself since then. Why? Because the Seventies brought the myth of ‘sisterhood’: that we women all had more in common with each other than with men. That we were victims, standing united against the male oppressor. The movement believed itself progressive. In fact, it harked back to my mother’s coffee mornings and afternoon teas when it didn’t really matter who attended, for what they had in common (home, husbands, wombs, children, boredom) outranked all else. It was a silly, insidious notion that grew to a corralling of women that has continued since: ‘sisters under the skin’, we are basically all the same. How often do you hear phrases that lump us all together, like ‘from a woman’s point of view’? We similarly lump together ‘women’s forums’, the most renowned being Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: woe betide she (i.e., me) who admits to finding much of it utterly alien. I might feel vaguely sorry for the plight of a woman from the low-achieving 85 per cent. But you cannot possibly expect me to feel closer to a migrant Bulgarian charlady of 30 just because we both have mammary bumps on our chests, than I do to a man of my own age, education, income and class. I do, of course, have many female friends. But I have none who is not an XX woman; not a graduate and not in paid work. Many of my friends have children, but for us XX women, children do not define you in the way that other achievements do. For example, without question, I take greater pride and joy in my daughter and my granddaughter than in anything I have achieved professionally. Outside the sisterhood: Carol has never understood how women bond over coffee mornings and make-up . And yet I would be astonished to be introduced as, ‘Carol — she has a daughter, you know,’ rather than, ‘Carol — she’s a writer,  you know’. I have met women from the other side of the yawning gap who attempt to define themselves by their domestic skills but, for me at least, it simply doesn’t work. One, Joanne, is so proud of her blessed fruit cake that she speaks of it as her signature achievement. Once, she tried to teach me how to make it. First, apparently,  you soak the raisins in brandy for six weeks … . But I quickly lost track. I’m simply not interested. Much like my teenage conviction that make-up is a small pleasure not a night out, so I think that cake is a sweetmeat, not a conversation. 'I believe I am a woman with a life fully lived, who has never, ever wasted time on a coffee morning' All of this, and much more, is the stuff of Alison Wolf’s liberating book: at last, ruthlessly exposing the feminist myth of ‘sisterhood’, here is a woman who says that, yes, these days, there are two kinds of women. Furthermore, you don’t have to feel guilty if you’ve made it to XX factor status; there’s a lot that we XX women get right. We lose our virginity later than the 85 per cent — research shows that British girls who go on to become graduates are less than half as likely to have underage sex as those who do not. We marry and we marry for keeps; our divorce rate is the lowest among women. We marry our own: contrary to popular belief, XX women do not marry men who become ‘house husbands’. Such creatures are few and the arrangements usually unsuccessful. XX women have fewer children, with 40 per cent choosing to have none. But when they do have them, they spend more time with their children than the women who work less. Astounding? Only at first thought. Wolf’s findings are that although non-XX women spend more time under the same roof as their children, that includes time while the children are left playing video games in another room. And before we all burst into a chorus of ‘I don’t know how she does it’, there are clues: XX woman pays for housework to be done and is much more likely to take the family out to eat, so saving valuable time. She also watches only a third as much television and sleeps an hour less, every night, than the low-achieving 85 per cent. So I’m proud to be an XX woman. Unlike the majority of my sex, I believe I am a woman with a life fully lived, who has never, ever wasted time on a coffee morning. In fact, if you visit my home, you’ll not find tea or coffee there at all. I don’t keep it, I don’t drink it and never have; even the smell makes me queasy. I think it must remind me of something. Sorry, Mum.","Alison Wolf's The XX Factor is about 'elite' women .

It is highly unusual for the secretive Stalinist state to publicly announce negative incidents. But on this occasion the official KCNA news agency not only revealed the tragedy but also spoke of an 'intensive' emergency rescue effort being carried out to rescue survivors and treat the wounded. Leader Kim Jong-un was said to be so upset that he had been unable to sleep. Public apology: A construction division officer apologises to residents after the collapse of a tower block in Pyongyang left a large number of people dead . Just how many people have died or were injured in the collapse at an apartment complex under construction in the capital, Pyongyang, has not been announced. However, an extraordinary photograph has been released which shows a construction worker apologising to residents. The group of citizens stand quietly, some with heads down, as the official offers his apologies. It is known that some 100 families had moved into apartments before the work was officially completed - a scenario that often occurs around the country. The news agency did not elaborate on the cause of the collapse but senior officials have stepped forward to accept responsibility. Among those who have offered a lengthy public apology is the Minister of People's Security, Choe Pu-il. Dictator: Kim Jong-Un, here with wife Ri Sol-Ju at an air force base, is said to be so upset about the tragedy that he has not been able to sleep . The agency said that Choe had 'repented of himself, saying that he failed to find out factors that can put at risk the lives and properties of the people and to take thorough-going measures, thereby causing an unimaginable accident.' Tour guides accompanying western visitors always boast of how newly- married couples are able to move immediately into a free apartment. 'This is why we do things better than anywhere else in the world,' a guide told a busload of tourists on a typical visit. 'They get a free home and free medical treatment. We are very proud.' The accident occurred late Tuesday and, said KCNA, was the result of 'irresponsible' supervision by officials in charge of the construction. It is likely that those directly responsible for the building work will be punished with imprisonment. In neighbouring South Korea an official agreed that it was common for people in the North to move into a new apartment building before construction officially ends. He said it was believed 92 families were living in the collapsed building and the final death toll was likely to be 'considerable'. Some 2.5 million people - most of them political elites who include senior party members or those with a privileged background - are thought to be living in Pyongyang.

"Biologist Dr John Bradshaw believes when cats are affectionate towards their owners they are treating them as other cats . Cats actually think their owners are just larger, non-hostile version of themselves, according to an expert in animal behaviour. Biologist Dr John Bradshaw believes when cats are affectionate towards their owners they are just treating them as other cats. An upright tale is a greeting sign between felines and is also a way of cats showing affection to their owners. The biologist also believes that despite years of domestication, cats are still wild animals. He writes: 'The transformation of the cat from resident exterminator to companion cohabiter is both recent and rapid, and—especially from the cat’s perspective—evidently incomplete.' It has often been thought that when a cat brings home a dead animal it is a gift for its owner. However, Dr Bradshaw does not agree and believes cat remember they like tinned food when they re-enter the house and so leave the animal on the floor. Dr Bradshaw is a biologist who founded and directs the world-renowned Anthrozoology Institute, based at the University of Bristol. He has been studying the behaviour of domestic cats and their owners for more than 25 years, and is the author of many scientific articles, research papers and reviews. He is also the author of bestseller, In Defence of Dogs. In the book he writes: 'One of my reasons for writing this book is to project what the typical cat might be like fifty years from now. 'I want people to continue to enjoy the company of a delightful animal, but I’m not sure that the cat, as a species, is heading in the right direction. Cats actually think their owners are just larger, non-hostile version of themselves, according to an expert in animal behaviour . 'The more I’ve studied cats, from the wildest feral to the most cosseted Siamese, the more I’ve become convinced that we can no longer afford to take cats for granted: a more considered approach to cat keeping and cat breeding is necessary if we are to ensure their future.'","Dr John Bradshaw has studied cats and their owners for more than 25 years .

"Roy Cockrum had once vowed to lead a life of poverty - but a winning $259million Powerball ticket has changed everything for the former Tennessee monk. Cockrum, 58, of Knoxville, appeared at the Tennessee Lottery headquarters in Nashville Thursday to claim Tennessee's largest ever jackpot. He plans to accept a lump sum payment of $115million. The 58-year-old former member of an Episcopal monastic order bought the ticket at a Kroger store in Knoxville June 11. Lucky strike: Roy Cockrum, 58, a former monk and actor, appeared at the Tennessee Lottery headquarters in Nashville Thursday to claim Tennessee's largest ever jackpot . The winning numbers in the June 11 drawing were 14-18-25-33-49 plus a Powerball of 23. Lottery officials say it's the largest prize ever won in Tennessee Lottery history. The . store where Cockrum purchased the lucky ticket received $25,000, but . the owners of the business turned around and donated the entire sum to . five charities in the Knoxville area. A native of Knoxville, Roy Cockrum earned an acting degree from Northwestern University in Illinois and worked for 20 years as an actor and stage manager for theater and TV productions. He later switched gears, becoming Brother Roy with the Society of Saint John the Evangelist, an Episcopal community in Massachusetts, the station WATE reported. ‘I really believe the best way to prepare for this tsunami of cash has been to live under a vow of poverty for a number of years,’ Cockrum said. ‘It gives great perspective.’ Mr Cockrum left monastic life in 2009 and moved back to Knoxville to take care of his elderly parents. He is single and self-employed. Speaking at a press conference at the Tennessee Lottery offices Thursday, a beaming Roy Cockrum described the heart-pounding moment when he realized that he hit the jackpot. At first, he thought he only matched three numbers and was thrilled that he won $500. Life-changing check: Cockrum, who is single and self-employed, plans to accept a lump sum payment of $115million after taxes . Golden ticket: The 58-year-old Knoxville man had initially thought that he only won $500, but later realized that he matched all six numbers . ‘But then -- wait a minute, wait a minute -- there’s another number, and finally I realized I hit the jackpot. It literally knocked me to my knees. My prayer was simple – “Lord have Mercy!” the former monk said. Eventually he collected himself and went about his day, taking his mother to a medical appointment. All the while, the winning ticket was burning a hole in his pocket. Brother Roy: Roy Cockrum pictured far left in a monk's habit during his time as a member of the as a member of the Episcopal Society of Saint John the Evangelist in Massachusetts . It took Cockrum a long three weeks to claim his prize. During that time, the Knoxville resident said that everywhere he went, people speculated about the identity of the mystery Powerball winner not knowing that he was in their midst. After setting aside a portion of his fortune toward his pension fund, Cockrum is planning to use a large chunk of the money to start a foundation that will support performing arts organizations around the country. The rest of the prize will go to a long list of religious organizations and local charities. Cockrum was quick to point out that he has already selected all the beneficiaries of his largesse. And it was not the first time that Lady Luck has smiled upon Roy Cockrum. He revealed that years earlier, Publishers Clearing House Prize Patrol came knocking on his door with balloons and an oversize check. ‘I have no doubt that I am one of the luckiest people in the world. I am so grateful. I am so blessed,’ he said.","Roy Cockrum, 58, from Knoxville, Tennessee, matched all six numbers in June 11 Powerball drawing .

"A British student has urged Muslims to join the 'golden era of jihad' and fight for the Islamic State. Londoner Hamzah Parvez's family had thought he had left the UK earlier this year to study in Germany. But in a new video the 21-year-old claims he has been fighting for the violent extremists for five months. Parvez also calls on other British Muslim  to give up their weekly Nandos and 'come to the land of jihad and shout Allah'. His face hidden behind a black scarf which only shows his eyes, and speaking in a thick London accent, he tells the camera: 'This is the golden era of jihad. Hamzah Parvez, 21, has called on British Muslims to 'come to the land of jihad and shout Allah' 'What are we doing sitting in the UK? Sitting in the land which kills Muslims everyday. What are we doing in their lands? It is not the lands for us.' In the clip - believed to be the first footage of a Briton fighting for the militants in Iraq rather than Syria - he urges others to take up arms and join the growing ranks of foreign fighters. He said there are 'jobs for doctors, nurses, architects, builders even for street cleaners in the Islamic State'. He added: 'Are we content with eating Nando's every week? Come to the land of jihad and shout Allah.' Parvez comes from a stable home in west London, but earlier this year he lied to his family claiming he was travelling to Germany to study. He convinced them to pay for his trip, but instead slipped out of Europe and travelled to the Middle East where he joined the estimated 2,000 foreign fighters there. Parvez comes from a stable home in west London. He is pictured here before he travelled to Iraq . A member of Parvez's family (right) spoke to ITV's Rageh Omaar and told of their horror if finding out what their relative is doing . Mohammed Nasser, who is believed to be the latest British IS fighter to have been killed in Iraq and was a close friend of Parvez . Close friends Mohammed Nasser and Hamzah Parvez travelled  to join up with the Islamic State (file picture) group terrorising Iraq and Syria . In an interview with ITV News, one of his close family members told of their devastation at Parvez's decision to abandon his home and join the IS - the same Islamic militants who recently beheaded American journalist James Foley. He said the swaggering militant in the clip bears little resemblance to the young man he knew as his brother and best friend. He said: 'That's not my brother. My brother doesn't act like that. My brother doesn't call people to do violence against others. 'I don't recognise him, that's just the same body, it's not the characteristic of my brother, it's not the way he speaks. It's not the way he acts, it's not the way he addresses people, that's not my brother. 'My brother, I don't know what my brother is anymore. He's my best friend. He was my best friend.' Parvez called his family earlier this week and admitted he was abroad fighting, but his relative said the young militant just laughed when confronted about his lies. The family member said: 'I feel let down. I feel betrayed. I said can you admit that you lied to us and I had to push for that.' He said he asked Parvez 'can you admit that you lied to us can you say it to us that you are sorry? And he said I'm sorry and the way he said it, he laughed. I felt like he didn't mean it.' Parvez's close friend, fellow Briton Mohammad Nasser, died fighting with IS jihadists - but despite this the young Londoner has vowed to continue fighting. His appalled family are speaking out to warn against the dangers of radicalisation among young British Muslims. And they are starting to accept the possibility that they may never see him alive again. The family member said: 'He said 'I have no plans to come home'. My sister asked the question what if your mum or dad died, he said 'I would pray for them'. 'That's when I lost it. I started shouting at him, I started swearing at him - these are your parents, these are the people since day one have been there for you, and you say you wouldn't attend their funeral and why? 'Because you want to serve this stupid leader, this self-proclaimed leader, over my parents.'","Hamzah Parvez claims he's been fighting in Iraq for five months .

"All around her are the signs of chaos and destruction, buildings reduced to rubble, walls riddled with bullet holes. A slab of concrete sticks up precariously from the ground, perhaps the result of an airstrike or mortar attack. Yet right beside it, sitting dutifully at a table, the little girl smiles warmly as she sells round loaves of bread, a tiny slice of normality for the citizens of the beleaguered city of Deir al-Zor. Defiant: A girl sits amid the rubble and destruction as she sells bread on a damaged street in Deir al-Zor, Syria . The truly humbling image, captured last week by Reuters photographer Khalil Ashawi, offers a rare glimmer of hope that, despite the violence and destruction things can return to normal. Deir al-Zor, in a key oil region in the east of the country, has been the scene of fierce fighting with skirmishes between Free Syrian Army soldiers and government forces reported as recently as this week. The surrounding area is now under the control of a lose network of tribes who have seized control of the oilfields and have been exploiting the instability by smuggling barrels of crude into Turkey. Last week video emerged appearing to show a Syrian rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead government soldier. The . unverified clip, posted by a pro-government campaign group, claims to . show a man - believed to be Abu Sakkar, the well-known founder of Homs' Farouq Brigade - standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while . ranting against President Bashar al Assad. Free Syrian Army fighters return fire during . clashes with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in Deir al-Zor on . Monday this week .

He then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite. According to the London-based Syrian Network of Human Rights, 7543 women including 2454 girls child and 257 infants have been killed by Syrian Government's Armed Forces. Today the U.N. General Assembly is expected to approve an Arab-backed resolution calling for a political transition in Syria and strongly condemning President Bashar Assad's regime for its escalating use of heavy weapons. The 193-member world body is scheduled to vote Wednesday morning on the resolution which also condemns Syria's 'gross violations' of human rights, assembly spokesman Nikola Jovanovic said. The Arab group decided to seek . approval for a resolution in the General Assembly to reflect . international dismay at the increasing death toll, now more than 70,000, . and the failure to end the ongoing conflict. Unlike Security Council resolutions, which are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions cannot be enforced. Horror: Last week video emerged appearing to show a Syrian rebel cutting out and eating the heart of a dead government soldier . But . approval of an assembly resolution would counter the paralysis of the . deeply divided Security Council, where Syria's allies, Russia and China, . have vetoed three Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad . to end the violence. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin has sent letters urging all U.N. members to vote 'no' on the new resolution. He called it 'one-sided and biased' as well as 'counterproductive' given the understanding reached by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Moscow earlier this month to convene a follow-up international meeting on a political transition in Syria. Argentina's U.N. Ambassador Maria Cristina Perceval, asked Qatar, the lead sponsor, to water down language welcoming the establishment of the Syrian National Coalition, the main opposition group, and to eliminate a reference to 'the wide international acknowledgment' that it is the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. She said in a letter, written on behalf of a group of Latin American countries, that they also objected to language welcoming Arab League resolutions on a political resolution of the situation in Syria because Latin American countries didn't participate in their adoption. Perceval also demanded that language be inserted 'explicitly calling for no further militarization of the conflict.' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Moscow met earlier this month to convene a follow-up international meeting on a political transition in Syria . But the Qataris refused to make any . of these requested changes, putting support from this group of Latin . American countries in doubt. The . last Arab-sponsored General Assembly resolution in August was approved . by an overwhelming vote of 133-12 with 31 abstentions. It strongly condemned Syria's use of heavy weapons, deplored the Security Council's failure to act, said Syria must take the first steps to stop the violence, and stressed that rapid progress on a political transition represented the 'best opportunity' to resolve the crisis peacefully. President Bashar Assad speaks during an interview on Syrian state television last month . Diplomats predicted that the . resolution being voted on Wednesday will get a reduced majority of . between 100 and 110 'yes' votes because of concerns about the divided . opposition. Using . similar language to the August resolution, the proposed new resolution . stresses that 'rapid progress on a political transition represents the . best opportunity' to resolve the Syrian conflict peacefully. It would promote the roadmap for a Syrian transition adopted at a meeting on June 30, 2012 in Geneva by key nations including the five veto-wielding council powers - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France. The roadmap starts with the establishment of a transitional governing body vested with full executive powers and ends with elections - but there has been no agreement on how to implement it, which would require Assad to relinquish power at some unspecified point. The draft resolution would reiterate the General Assembly's call 'for an inclusive Syrian-led political transition to a democratic, pluralistic political system, in which citizens are equal regardless of their affiliations or ethnicities or beliefs.' It says this should be done by starting 'a serious political dialogue between credible, empowered, and mutually acceptable interlocutors representing the Syrian authorities and the Syrian opposition.' The draft strongly condemns the continued escalation in the Syrian regime's use of heavy weapons, including indiscriminate shelling from tanks and aircraft, as well as the use of ballistic missiles, cluster munitions and other weapons against populated areas. It expresses 'grave concern at the threat by the Syrian authorities to use chemical or biological weapons, as well as at allegations of reported use of such weapons.' It demands that Syria 'strictly observe' international laws prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons and refrains from transferring such weapons 'to non-state actors.' Syria has said if it had such weapons, it would never use them against its own people.","Poignant photograph was taken in the city of Deir al-Zor .

"It might be gaining popularity among retailers, but Bitcoin’s reputation as a secure digital currency has taken a hit in recent months. Only last week, up to two million European computers were compromised after hackers infected them with malware from adverts on Yahoo. In a well-timed move, London-based Elliptic has today launched the world’s first insured Bitcoin storage service in the UK. London-based Elliptic has today launched the world¿s first insured Bitcoin storage service in the UK . Named Elliptic Vault, the service claims to use ‘deep cold storage’ techniques to secure the digital currency. Deep cold storage refers to storage techniques where both strong encryption and secure physical locations are used. A simple example of deep cold storage is opening a safety deposit box and putting a USB stick containing an encrypted wallet file in it. ‘Securing your Bitcoins involves implementing advanced encryption and even then you are still at risk of losing them,’ said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic. Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as the Bank of England . Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer . digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as . the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. A . Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than . half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four . years ago. The current price of Bitcoin is $840 (£511). However, its value rose to over $1000 (£613) last year. The dramatic rise has left many early-adopters with digital wallets worth millions of pounds sitting on their hard drives. It has also prompted increasingly sophisticated techniques from cyber criminals hoping to ‘mine’ Bitcoins. For instance, the security breach on the Yahoo homepage last week used malware infected adverts to make computers into Bitcoin slaves. Other than a slow computer, those infected with the maleware were unaware that their machines were being used to mine Bitcoins. Experts estimate that these criminal networks generated as much as $100,000 (£60,000) each day over the four day period the malware was active. Lloyds of London is the underwriter for the Elliptic Vault service which charges a flat fee of two per cent of the value of a user's deposit. This means if you want to store £10,000 worth of coins, it will cost £16.67 per month. The company added that it has seen some demand for the storage of other crypto-currencies, including as litecoin, and is currently looking into expanding the service. In November, James Howells revealed he had lost 7,500 Bitcoins when he unintentionally threw away the hard drive they were stored on. But he is now ruing his decision – after he realised his stash would now be worth £5 million. The Bitcoins, that could make him a millionaire, are now buried under four feet of rubbish and mud in a landfill site. As Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, hackers have found increasingly sophisticated ways to illegally ‘mine’ the virtual currency. Now a new method has been uncovered which uses malware infected adverts on Yahoo to make computers Bitcoin slaves. Yahoo has confirmed that the breach took place last week and experts now believe as many as two million European users could have been affected. In this recent attack, the hackers used malware to exploit something known as ‘Bitcoin mining’. The . mining process works on the premise that there are 21 million Bitcoins . hidden across an internet-based network, which are expected to all be . found by 2040. To . unearth Bitcoins, computers have to solve the complex . processor-intensive equations which hold them. The more powerful the . machine the better it is at solving the riddle. Bitcoin mining malware is designed to . steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to collect the . virtual currency, without using their own high-powered computers. Other . than a slow computer, those infected with the maleware be unaware that . their machine is being used in what could become known as a ‘bitnet’. Experts estimate that these criminal networks could be generating as much as $100,000 (£60,000) each day.","London-based Elliptic will use ‘deep cold storage’ to .

"A friend who knew Robin Williams through a self-help group reached out to the star last month and said he 'really needed support'. Dean Kendrink, a KPIX 5 news photographer, met Williams while working for the Bay Area Backroads travel show more than 10 years ago. However, Mr Kenrick said he was surprised to see him at a treatment centre in Mill Valley, San Fransisco, just weeks before his death. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Dean Kendrink passed his number to Robin Williams and told him to call if he needed support . Speaking to San Fransisco CBS, Mr Kendrick said: 'He was very slow in his movements and his demeanor was also very low. 'He really, really needed support at that time.' Mr Kendrick said Williams was the very first to raise his hand in the group to speak about his own battle with drug and alcohol addiction. After the support group had finished the session, Mr Kendrink handed Williams his telephone number and told him to get in contact if he needed someone to talk to. Williams returned to rehab in 2006 after being sober for 20 years.

In . a moving message on Tuesday to well wishers, Williams' first son Zak . Williams, 31, said that the 63-year-old's suicide meant 'I lost my . father and a best friend and the world got a little grayer.' 'I . would ask those that loved him to remember him by being as gentle, . kind, and generous as he would be,' said Zak, whose mother, Valerie . Velardi was the comic legend's first wife. The Good Will Hunting star's younger son, Cody Williams, 23, simply said, 'There are no words strong enough to describe the love and respect I have for my father. 'The world will never be the same without him. I will miss him and take him everywhere I go for the rest of my life, and will look forward, forever, to the moment when I get to see him again.' The Oscar winner's daughter, Zelda Williams, 25, who has already posted a heart felt message to social media, offered up a bittersweet statement that praised the comic genius' fans, but offered a chastening word to his critics too. Zelda Williams said: 'Dad was, is and always will be one of the kindest, most generous, gentlest souls I've ever known, and while there are few things I know for certain right now, one of them is that not just my world, but the entire world is forever a little darker, less colorful and less full of laughter in his absence. We'll just have to work twice as hard to fill it back up again. Flowers and tributes are placed at the make-shift memorial on the Hollywood Walk of Fame star for actor Robin Williams in Hollywood . Shortly after the news broke on Monday, Zelda posted an excerpt from French poet and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince on Twitter, and in her statement today added: 'My family has always been private about our time spent together. It was our way of keeping one thing that was ours, with a man we shared with an entire world. But now that's gone, and I feel stripped bare. 'My last day with him was his birthday and I will be forever grateful that my brothers and I got to spend that time alone with him, sharing gifts and laughter. He was always warm, even in his darkest moments. And his second wife, Marsha Garces Williams also published her first statement on her ex-husband's passing, calling him a 'genius'. Williams was last seen alive about 10.30pm on Sunday by his third wife Susan Schneider when she went to bed. Williams locked himself in a different bedroom, Marin County Sheriff's Lieutenant Keith Boyd said. By the time an assistant found the Oscar-winning actor's body at 11.55am on Monday, rigor mortis had set in. After going to bed Sunday night, Susan got up and left the house to run errands about 10.30am - believing her husband of three years was still asleep. An assistant, worried when Williams couldn't be roused at 11.45am, broke into the bedroom and found Williams dead. The official preliminary cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging, police in California said, and conclusion of the investigation is still weeks away. Emergency personnel arrived at noon. At 12:02 he was pronounced dead. Toxicology reports are pending and will take two to six weeks. The Mrs Doubtfire and Good Will Hunting star's suicide comes after decades of battling depression and alcohol and drug addiction. He was also facing significant financial pressures and admitted he was selling a $35million estate in Napa because he could no longer afford it.","Dean Kendrink met Williams while working for a travel show 10 years ago .

"Andrea Pirlo has told Manchester United to forget about the prospect of re-signing Paul Pogba and live with the grave mistake they made in allowing him to leave. The French midfielder’s future at Juventus has been the talk of Europe for the last six months and any battle to land him is only set to intensify further. Louis van Gaal’s United are among those interested in Pogba, who would command a fee in the region of £70million. Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has been linked with a move back to Manchester United . Andrea Pirlo does not believe Juventus team-mate Pogba will ever return to Manchester United . But Pirlo is insistent that the 21-year-old won’t be moving back to Old Trafford given Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t do enough to persuade him to remain in England. ‘For whatever reasons they chose not to give him a chance - and that is a mistake they will have to live with now,’ Pirlo said. ‘I can’t see that he (Pogba) will ever return to Manchester United.’ Real Madrid and Chelsea have also kept tabs on the youngster, whose astonishing drag and hit for Juventus in the weekend win over Chievo just typified the season he is having. Pirlo has lavished praise on  Pogba by calling the Frenchman 'one of the best players in the world' The veteran Italian is well placed to rate Pogba having played in the same midfield as the young Frenchman . And that sort of ingenuity in possession is what has pricked up the ears of Europe’s elite – something Pirlo spotted within weeks of Pogba joining Juve three years ago. ‘When he first joined us in training at Juventus we knew there was something about him - and in just two years he has become one of the best players in the world,’ he added. ‘Of course he is going to have options - he knows that. You can’t play at the level he is and not attract attention - but he also knows that at Juventus he is already at one of the biggest clubs in Europe. ‘I have spoken with him, and told him if he carries on working hard and makes the right decisions - there is no limit to what he can achieve.’ Pogba has oly played for giants of the European game - Manchester United and Juventus .

"Airlines have cancelled nearly 14,000 flights for today and tomorrow with more cancellations expected as Hurricane Sandy barrels up the Atlantic coast of the United States. The massive storm threatens to bring a near halt to air travel for at least two days in a key region for both domestic and international flights. Flight-tracking service FlightAware reported cancellations by major carriers including American Airlines, United and Delta into and out of three area airports in New York, the nation's busiest airspace. Tens of thousands of stranded passengers are now waiting out the storm across the world, in travel hubs including London, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Changed plans: Nearly 15,000 flights have been cancelled over the last three days . Cancellations: All flights out of New York's three airports, including JFK (pictured), have been grounded . Airports in the metropolitan New York City area are open, but air carriers are not operating. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said today that travelers should not even try to go to Kennedy, Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and Stewart airports. Both Philadelphia International Airport and Newark International Airport, a hub for United Airlines, each had more than 1,300 cancellations for last night and 6,814 cancelled as of 9am on Monday. Amtrak says it has canceled all Tuesday service in the Northeast due to high winds and heavy rain from Hurricane Sandy. The railroad said passenger service between Boston and Raleigh, North Carolina, and between the East Coast and Chicago, New Orleans and Florida will be suspended for the second day in a row. Cancellations include Acela Express, Northeast Regional, Keystone and Shuttle service, among other trains. Passengers were urged to follow developments on Amtrak.com and Facebook and Twitter sites. No decision has yet been made on when service will be resumed. Amtrak said passengers who have paid but who didn't travel because of the service disruption can receive a refund or a voucher for future travel. Stranded: Tens of thousands of passengers, including these tired travellers at JFK, face further delays today . She's coming: A satellite image taken Sunday morning by the National Hurricane Center shows Sandy heading north . Businessman Alan . Shrem was trying to return home to Boca Raton, Florida this morning, but . his Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to New York's Kennedy airport . was canceled. He was told he . could be stuck in Hong Kong for nearly a week because the next available . seat was November 4. He was put on a waiting list for seats that could . become available earlier. 'They . just say: Yeah, it's a pretty big waiting list,' said Shrem, throwing . up his hands. In the meantime, he will have to pay $400 a night to stay . at a nearby hotel. The airline will not pay for accommodation for . stranded passengers if delays are weather related. Air travel in the Northeast began having . problems last night, when passengers were reporting delays of hours at . airline call centers. Eileen Merberg, 50, was booked on a United flight from her home in Rochester, N.Y. to New Orleans, connecting at Washington D.C.'s Dulles airport. She received an email saying the Washington flight was canceled. United rebooked her first on a flight through Newark and, when that flight was also canceled, on another flight through Chicago. Ominous: In this handout image provided by NASA, Hurricane Sandy churns off the east coast on Sunday out in the Atlantic Ocean . View from Space: Handout satellite image made . and released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . (NOAA) on 28 October 2012 of Hurricane Sandy east of the US state of . Georgia . By that point, she . had told the higher education conference that she was scheduled to . speak at that she would not be coming. She tried to cancel her flight . over the phone but waiting times were so long she could not get through. FlightAware said it expects the number of flight cancellations to 'rise considerably.' A . spokesman for United Airlines parent United Continental Holdings Inc. said the carrier has suspended an unspecified number of flights to New . York and Washington-area airports from last night, with plans to . resume on Tuesday if conditions permit. JetBlue . Airways Corp., which flies out of JFK, said it has canceled more than . 1,000 flights from Sunday through Wednesday morning. While other airlines will most likely . follow United in paring down their confirmed flight schedules, carriers . can point to last year's Hurricane Irene as a precedent of likely . action they will take. The New York Stock Exchange floor will be closed today as Hurricane Sandy churns up the coastline . During . a four-day period in August 2011, as Irene approached the Eastern . Seaboard, 14,000 flights were halted as the hurricane traveled over . major hubs such as Philadelphia, Newark and JFK airports. Every . major airline in the U.S. has at one hub or 'center city' and some, . such as United (Newark and Washington Dulles) and US Airways . (Philadelphia and Washington National), have two. Even a slight disruption to one of these airports would affect thousands of flights and tens of thousands of passengers. If . the flight cancellations continue, it could lead to havoc which would . create gridlock in the U.S. aviation system and create a backlog of . stranded passengers. However, Sandy is expected to remain in . the area for at least 48 hours and disruption to flights is expected to . be far greater than that experienced during Irene. Prepared: The NYSE opened a day after Hurricane Irene reached NYC last year but that storm hit on a Sunday rather than the start of the business week . Stay home: Along with the NYSE most New York transportation is on hold and schools are closed as the city waits for Sandy . Forecasters say Sandy is about 310 miles . (505 kilometers) southeast of New York City, and the center of the . storm is expected to be near the mid-Atlantic coast tonight. The . National Hurricane Center said early today that the storm has top . sustained winds of 85 mph (140 kph), with higher gusts, and is on . track to collide with a wintry storm moving in from the west and cold . air streaming down from the Arctic. Every airline has issued a flexible travel policy that allows customers . to make changes to their reservations with no penalty and passengers have been told to contact their carrier. New York is bracing for the storm, with the mass transit system shut down last night, as the city waits for Sandy. The New York Stock . Exchange's trading floor will be closed Monday and Tuesday as Hurricane Sandy bears . down on the East Coast, but Big Board trading will continue . electronically.

"Michael Redman, father to at least 26 children, poses for a photo with Nicola in 1997 . Until today, she was an attractive blonde known to the world as ‘Woman 7’. The reason for the rather disparaging description? Unfortunately for her — and especially for her four children — their father is Michael Redman. The name might not be immediately familiar, so here is his brief CV. Mr Redman is the 59-year-old bus driver who was splashed across the front page (and two inside pages) of a red-top tabloid a few days ago under the headline: ‘My Fare Ladies’. He was, we were informed, Britain’s most ‘prolific dad’, siring 26 offspring in 37 years: a brood of 13 girls and 13 boys. In one shameful year alone, Mr Redman, a former trooper with the Royal Armoured Corps, fathered three children by three different women — two of whom were cousins. He now lives in a large, semi-detached house in Ash, Surrey, with his current partner (who, at 39, is just one year older than his first child) and their seven children, including a nine-month-old girl. Perhaps the only positive thing that can be said about him is that, at least, he has a job. Even by the standards of sink estate Britain, the story of Michael Redman is both shocking and depressing. Not surprisingly, most of the nine women he bedded and made pregnant that we know of are too embarrassed or ashamed to be identified. To date, they have been referred to only as Woman 1, Woman 2 and so on, to denote the order in which they met him. Now, though, Nicola Redman — Woman 7 — has broken her silence. You might have thought there were no further shocks she could reveal about Mr Redman. But you would be wrong. Apart from anything else, Nicola, 41, an assistant manager of a clothing store, had four children by him — not two, as previously reported — which means Mr Redman has at least 28, not 26 progeny. Moreover, she was just 16 when they met. Redman was 35. She carried his surname for six years, but broke off contact with him in 1997. Nicola has now changed her name by deed poll, and refuses to reveal what it now is. Who can possibly blame her? ‘He hasn’t changed one bit, which is why I have come forward, so other women know what he’s like and don’t go through what I did. He hasn’t paid me a penny in child support,’ she says. How different Nicola’s life might have been if she hadn’t boarded the number 221 bus, travelling from Edgware to Turnpike Lane in North London, in April 1990. Redman was at the wheel and noticed the pretty teenager, who was on her way home after a night out. ‘The next time I got on the bus, he obviously recognised me,’ she says. ‘I was dressed a little more conservatively and he said, “I prefer the way you were dressed before”, and it went from there. We often had sex at the end of his route, when he’d have a five or ten-minute window before his next journey.’ Scroll down for video . Michael Redman pictured with his family today. The 59-year-old met Nicola when she was 16 and he was 35 . Michael Redman, posing with three of his children by Nicola, who he met on a bus, in 1996 . Remember, Nicola was still a schoolgirl and had barely reached the age of consent. Redman, on the other hand, was old enough to be her father. Within weeks of meeting him on the bus, Nicola was pregnant. Although mortified by her relationship with a much older man, her parents stood by her and she remained living at home, where Redman would visit her several times a week. They never lived together. It was only during her pregnancy that Nicola began finding out about his nefarious past. ‘I knew he had other kids, as he had custody of his second eldest, but I didn’t know just how many he had,’ she says. ‘He was just a single parent, as far as I was aware. By that stage, I had fallen head over heels in love with him and I didn’t want to believe everything I heard. I didn’t want anyone to crush my bubble.’ But Nicola began to unravel more of his lies after she gave birth to her first born, a son, in 1991. ‘It was quite a traumatic birth and I was in quite a bad way,’ she says. ‘But about six weeks after the birth, Michael contacted me and asked me if I could do him a massive, massive favour. The favour was that the woman I later discovered he was living with (Woman 6, in fact) had also gone into hospital to have an emergency operation. ‘I knew he had had a child with her before we met, but he assured me that the woman played no part in his life and that they were no longer together. ‘The only contact the two had was when he went to see their child, a little boy, he told me. Michael said he had work commitments and needed someone to look after the child. So I did, like the stupid lapdog I was. ‘It was only when I was at the house with the boy that I noticed there was a ‘mother-to-be pack’ in the kitchen, which gives expectant mums parenting information and vouchers for your baby. Having recently given birth myself, I knew you only got these packs when you were pregnant. ‘My heart sank. I knew the reason the other woman had gone into hospital wasn’t for an “operation”, but that she must have gone into labour. ‘I thought, “oh my God, you’ve gone and had another child with someone else and you got me here under false pretences to look after your toddler, while the mother is in hospital having another one of your children.” That’s how I found out.’ Of course, Nicola should have walked away there and then. But she would not be the first impressionable young woman — and certainly not the last — to make the mistake of giving a cheating partner another chance. But few could be less deserving than Michael Redman. It is claimed that Michael Redman is Britain’s most ‘prolific dad’, siring 26 offspring in 37 years: a brood of 13 girls and 13 boys . In fact, Nicola, as we know, went on to have three more children with Redman, a daughter in 1992, and two more sons, one in 1993, and another in 1996. During that time, Redman became increasingly controlling. ‘He wanted to know where I was 24/7 and insisted I travel with him on the bus,’ she says. ‘If I didn’t go with him, he’d get angry. My kids spent half their childhoods going up and down on buses. He was just a control freak.’ Redman even tried to get Nicola to be friends with his other woman (Woman 6). ‘He used to invite me round to their house,’ she says. ‘The first time I met her, we went to Pizza Hut with all the kids as he wanted us all to be friends. Needless to say, she was heavily pregnant again. ‘I was a complete idiot for going along with it. I can see that now. But, at the time, I was young and very naive. ‘He even used to take us on the same holidays to the same caravan park near Frensham, in Surrey. He would take us at different times in the year, but we stayed in the same caravan. ‘He used to tell me about it and I went along with it. It was almost like he brainwashed me.’ Shortly before she finished with him in 1997, Nicola even ended up living next to the mother of one of his other girlfriends (Woman 8). ‘One night, the woman herself knocked on my door after noticing Michael’s car parked outside,’ she says. ‘I was not aware they were even in a relationship. ‘I later found out we were pregnant at the same time [in 1996]. I used to see her in the neighbourhood with a bump. I had no idea, at the time, that Michael was the father.’ There was a final twist to this story, however. After they split up, Nicola received a card in the post. ‘Dear Nicola,’ it read, ‘Michael and ***** [partner] are very pleased to announce the arrival of their fifth child [a little girl who cannot be named for legal reasons] born on the 21/6/99. Time: 10am. Weight: 7lb.’ By then, Nicola was no stranger to such contemptuous behaviour. ‘He’s full of compliments when you first meet him,’ she says. ‘He wines and dines you, and spends money on you, all to get you to fall for him hook, line and sinker. ‘I think he is an absolute disgrace to the male population.’ But perhaps the most damning assessment of Michael Redman’s character comes from one of his own daughters, now in her 20s, who says, ‘I’m ashamed of the blood running through my veins and his genes will always be in the poisonous part of me.’","One of the mothers of some of Michael Redman's 26 children speaks out .

"An almost-complete skeleton of a woolly mammoth, complete with tusks, is being offered up in a rare auction. The specimen, which is an incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long, is expected to attract bidders from both museums and private collectors. Rupert van Der Werff, director of Summers Place Auctions that is selling the mammoth, says the Ice Age remains could fetch up to £250,000 ($409,000). Scroll down for video . An almost-complete skeleton of a woolly mammoth is being offered up for auction – complete with tusks. The rare specimen, which is an incredible 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long, is expected to attract bidders from both museums and private collectors . 'Nearly complete skeletons are pretty rare. This is a fabulous skeleton in pretty good condition,' he told Ashish Joshi at Sky News. 'All sorts of people are collectors. The most famous ones are John Travolta and Leonardo DiCaprio. It's something to really show off about.' The woolly mammoth is thought to be a male who would have weighed over six tonnes when it roamed Earth 10,000 years ago. Alistair Morris and Linsay Hoadley from Summers Place give the enormous mammoth a final dusting.  Anyone with with enough room to house this skeleton can now bid for it at Summers Place in West Sussex . Resurrecting a prehistoric creature might seem like a sci-fi dream, but scientists say they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen. Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000-year-old carcass found in Siberia. The announcement follows the autopsy on the female mammoth found last year in permafrost in Russia's diamond region of the Sakha Republic, which is also known as Yakutia. There was palpable excitement among the team which included scientists from Russia, the UK, the USA, Denmark, South Korea and Moldova,’ The Siberian Times reported. The researchers expect test results on blood extracted from the woolly mammoth to provide the genetic material needed to attempt to clone the animal. Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago. Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’ But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it. Rupert van Der Werff, director of Summers Place Auctions that is selling the mammoth, says the Ice Age remains could fetch up to £250,000 ($409,000) James Rylands, of Summers Place Auctions, said: 'What’s exceptional about this one is it’s more or less complete with two magnificent tusks. There are one or two toes missing. 'It looks very impressive, the inside curve of the tusks is about 8ft (2.4 metres). It’s bigger than an elephant.' It would have been covered in long fur on top, with a shorter undercoat. Although quite similar to today's elephant, it had smaller ears and a shorter tail to retain heat. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, stretching across northern Eurasia and North America, so its diet was mainly grass and rushes, which explains why it only had four molar teeth and curved tusks. The woolly mammoth co-existed with early humans, who hunted them for food and used their bones and tusks for making art. Woolly mammoths and modern-day elephants are closely related, sharing 99.4 per cent of their genes. Mammoth remains can be dated from the rings on the tusks. A thick line denotes a year and a thinner line the weeks and days in between. Their trunks had two finger-like projections at the end to help them pluck vegetation. Japanese scientists are working on a project to bring the species back from extinction using DNA from a carcass and an egg from an elephant which will act as the surrogate mother. The species gets its name from the Russian ‘mammut’, meaning earth mole, because it was once believed they lived underground and died on contact with light – explaining why they were always half-buried. Up until now, the mammoth has been part of an old Eastern European private collection. Due to its huge size, it has only been pieced together recently. 'To the best of my knowledge, I don’t think there has been one sold at auction, certainly not in the UK and I don’t think in Europe, so it’s a first in that respect,' said Mr Rylands. 'It could either go to a museum or if you have a big conservatory it would definitely make a serious statement. 'It’s not like a number 14 bus, there isn’t going to be another one coming along.' The mammoth will be sold at Summer Place Auctions' 'Evolution' sale on Wednesday, 26 November in Billingshurst, West Sussex. Last year a diplodocus skeleton sold at auction for more than £400,000 ($654,000).","Rare specimen is 11.4ft (3.5 metres) high and 18ft (5.5 metres) long .

"Red warning logos will appear on food considered ‘bad’ for health under a new traffic light labelling scheme. The colour will signal products that are high in fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt as part of an anti-obesity drive designed to encourage healthy eating. Amber and green will indicate foods deemed ‘medium’ or ‘good’ in terms of health value, according to the Department of Health and Food Standards Agency (FSA) policy. kit kat label.jpg . The voluntary scheme is being unveiled by the Government today and has already received backing from those supermarkets and manufacturers that had previously opposed it. Nestle, Mars, PepsiCo, Premier Foods and McCain have signed up along with major retailers such as Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons, Marks & Spencer, the Co-operative and Waitrose, which together account for 60 per cent of UK food sales. Other companies are now under pressure to back the controversial regime, which has been welcomed by some health and consumer groups as a major breakthrough in efforts to combat obesity. Almost two in three adults and one in three children are overweight. Public health  minister Anna Soubry said it  is time for a standard traffic light system to replace the current confusing mix of nutrition labels . The labels will also carry figures to identify the level of fat, salt and sugar in terms of grams and as a percentage of the so-called ‘reference intake’ – the recommended daily maximum for adults. While the system will identify processed food, red warnings will also appear on choices such as salmon, cheese, full fat milk and some meat, because they are high in fat even though they contain important nutrients. The system will aim to reduce the £5.1billion a year spent by the NHS on obesity-related illnesses such as  cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Almost two in three adults and one in three children are overweight. Public health  minister Anna Soubry said it  is time for a standard traffic light system to replace the current confusing mix of nutrition labels. ‘We all have a responsibility to tackle the challenge of obesity, including the food industry,’ she said. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, called it a ‘first class scheme’ that will make it easier for shoppers make more informed choices. And Richard Lloyd of Which? added: ‘With levels of obesity and diet-related disease on the increase, it’s vitally important that people know what is in their food.’ Sainsbury’s boss Justin King said the industry has a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ chance to take a consistent approach, but Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation, said the Government should have made the labelling compulsory. ‘The problem we have is that 40 per cent of food will not be covered by the new label and that will create confusion,’ he said. ‘Also we have a situation where foods which are important for health, such as oily fish, cheese or milk will get a red label, which is internationally understood as a warning to steer clear. ‘I would have preferred a series of shades of red to make the scheme reflect this.’ There is also concern that the figures on the new labels, which are being phased in from today, give nutritional information in the context of an adult’s daily diet. As a result, the information beyond the colour is not much use for children. Professor Mitch Blair, of the Royal College of Paediatrics, called for a more drastic approach. ‘We need to look at reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods by measures such as taxation of sugary drinks, responsible advertising that doesn’t target children and ensuring healthy foods are readily available and affordable,’ he said.","Public health  minister Anna Soubry said it is time for a standard traffic light system to replace the current confusing mix of nutrition labels .

"Helping hand? Harvard researchers found that we now use the internet to remember 'for us' - and decide not to store facts if we think we can Google them later . The Internet is becoming our main source of memory instead of our own brains, a study has concluded. In the age of Google, our minds are adapting so that we are experts at knowing where to find information even though we don’t recall what it is. The researchers found that when we want to know something we use the Internet as an ‘external memory’ just as computers use an external hard drive. Nowadays we are so reliant on our smart phones and laptops that we go into ‘withdrawal when we can’t find out something immediately’. And such is our dependence that having our Internet connection severed is growing ‘more and more like losing a friend’. Researchers from Harvard University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Columbia University in the U.S. carried out four tests to check their theory. They involved giving test participants a trivia quiz and then seeing whether they recognised computer-related words more quickly than other words. The other tests involved seeing if people remembered 40 pieces information they would typically later have normally looked up. The third and fourth parts of the study involved checking how well people remember where to look up information on-line and whether or not they remembered the location more than the actual data. The results showed that when people don’t believe they will need information for a later test, they do not recall it at the same rate as when they do believe they will need it. Your Google brain . In fact, some of those in the study ‘actively did not make the effort to remember when they thought they could later look up the trivia statements they had read’, the paper says. The other results showed that when continuous Internet access is expected, people are better at remembering where they can find it than the details. The study was lead by Betsy Sparrow, an assistant professor at the department of psychology at Columbia University. In their paper, the researchers say that we now have access to the Internet 24 hours a day meaning we are 'seldom offline unless by choice' and it is 'hard to remember how we found information before the Internet became a ubiquitous presence in our lives'. The paper reads: ‘The advent of the Internet, with sophisticated algorithmic search engines, has made accessing information as easy as lifting a finger. ‘No longer do we have to make costly efforts to find the things we want. We can ‘Google’ the old classmate, find articles online, or look up the actor who was on the tip of our tongue. ‘When faced with difficult questions, people are primed to think about computers and that when people expect to have future access to information, they have lower rates of recall of the information itself and enhanced recall instead for where to access it. ‘The Internet has become a primary form of external or transactive memory, where information is stored collectively outside ourselves.’ The study is not the first to touch on such anxieties and similar fears were addressed in ‘The Shallows: How the Internet is rewiring our brains’, a book released last year. Its author, American technologist Nicholas Carr, talks of how we are unable to concentrate for long periods because of how using the web has affected us. In research he commissioned for the book, test subjects said they were unable to read copies of Tolstoy’s ‘War and Peace’ because their minds had been altered. Others were disturbed at how they could only think in ‘staccato’ bursts because they had become little more than ‘decoders of information'.","People remember where to look up information - not the info itself .

"A female hostage kidnapped during a Northern California bank robbery was killed by police in an ensuing chase and shootout, likely during a final gun battle where the lone surviving suspect used her as a human shield, authorities said Monday. The results of a preliminary ballistics report show that police in the city of Stockton fired the 10 bullets that struck Misty Holt-Singh, 41, and all her wounds likely came during a final burst of gunfire, Stockton Police Chief Eric Jones said at a news conference. Three men robbed a bank July 16, taking hostage Holt-Singh, a customer whose 12-year-old daughter was waiting in the car, and two bank employees, police said. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Beloved wife and mother Misty Holt-Singh was . killed when she was caught in the crossfire of a shootout between the . bank robbers who took her hostage and the Stockton police on July 16. It has now been revealed that it was police bullets that killed her . Violent: The armed men fired over 100 bullets at police, who returned fire. The final gunbattle occurred after a chase in a car stolen from a bank employee (pictured). Two other female hostages were thrown from the car . The suspects fired AK-47-style rifles from the windows of their SUV during the deadly pursuit .

Repeat offender: Alex Martinez, shot dead during the gun battle, is believed by police to have robbed the exact same . Stockton bank almost six months ago . They survived by either jumping or getting thrown from the SUV as it sped through town. 'We wanted, but never had the opportunity for, hostage negotiations,' Jones said. Jones said 33 officers fired at the vehicle, most of them during the final shootout. Officers were under constant fire and were concerned the suspects would kidnap other hostages, take over businesses or even a school. 'We believe July 16, 2014, brought dynamics never before seen in law enforcement,' he said, adding that the suspects attempted to kill officers, fired more than 100 bullets and had about 200 rounds remaining when the gunfire ended. Holt-Singh's family released a statement through their attorney, Greg Bentley, saying the ballistic information saddened them. 'The manner in which Misty's life was taken raises serious questions and concerns. The family is hopeful, however, that the promised information, policies, and procedures concerning the events of July 16 will be provided so that a fair, complete, and transparent investigation can take place,' the statement said. Bentley has filed public-records requests . for 911 calls, photographs, video and any other evidence documenting . the incident, as well as law enforcement protocols for kidnappings, . pursuits and the use of deadly force. Caught in the crossfire: Holt-Singh left her 12-year-old daughter waiting in the car as she went into the bank, potentially saving the girl's life . Armed response: Stockton police reacted will fill force and were shot at by over 100 bullets, they said . Robbery: The three men allegedly robbed this Bank of the West branch at Hammer Lane and Thornton Road . Bentley has said he wants to know whether police made mistakes or suffered a communication breakdown. Two of the suspects, identified as Alex Gregory Martinez, 27, and Gilbert Renteria Jr., 30, and Holt-Singh were found dead at the end of the final gunbattle. Jaime Ramos, 19, the sole surviving suspect, has been charged with murder. Police previously said Ramos used Holt-Singh as a human shield, but they could not immediately tell whether she died from police gunfire or shots fired by the suspects. They also did not know when she was killed. While the full investigation will take . more time, Jones said, he felt a need to release the preliminary . information as soon as possible amid questions from the woman's family . and the community. He disclosed the results of the preliminary ballistics report to Holt-Singh's family over the weekend. Devastated: Misty Holt-Singh's grieving family - . (from left to right) daughter Mia, husband Paul and son Paul Jr. - said they wanted answers for the death of the beloved wife and mother, leading police to release the report .

Investigators say they have linked Martinez to a robbery on Jan. 31 at the same bank branch through surveillance video, witness statements and comparable circumstances. Police said Monday they believe the suspects' AK-47 was used in other shootings. Police were also continuing to try to identify the driver of a dark Buick sedan seen on video dropping off the suspects at the bank. The car, which has since been recovered, had no license plates and was abandoned in a neighborhood about a 10-minute drive from the bank.","Misty Holt-Singh, 41, was taken hostage by the armed robbers who held up the Bank of the West in Stockton, California, on July 16 .

"Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola faces a touchline ban after an altercation with a female fourth official on Sunday. As his side struggled to a 0-0 draw against Borussia Monchengladbach, Guardiola became increasingly agitated. His frustration boiled over when Gladbach's Granit Xhaka sustained an injury in stoppage time, delaying the game for over a minute. Guardiola clearly feared that his side would be denied the full three minutes they had been granted to score – or concede – a winner, and immediately began to talk heatedly with fourth official Bibiana Steinhaus. Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola faces a touchline ban after an altercation with a female fourth official . Guardiola began to talk heatedly with fourth official Bibiana Steinhaus during Bayern's 0-0 draw on Sunday . Steinhaus, a policewoman from Hamburg and well-respected matchday official in the Bundesliga and Germany's second tier, rebuffed his complaints, prompting Guardiola to storm away, clapping sarcastically. The Catalan quickly had second thoughts, returning to Steinhaus and placing an arm around her. The 35 year old shrugged him off sternly, and continued to watch the game. As it is an offence to make physical contact with any official, Guardiola may now face a ban. Though the officials declined to send him to the stands immediately, he could be punished retroactively by the DFB football court. Bayern  defender Medhi Benatia reacts after the German giants were held to a 0-0 draw on Sunday evening . Even if he isn't punished, the Bayern coach has made few friends with his touchline antics this weekend. Social media was immediately awash with people claiming the Catalan was showing 'his true face', and on a Sky Sports discussion show afterwards, Guardiola was accused of being patronising. 'It showed a lack of respect, the way he behaved towards Bibiana,' said former manager Ewald Lienen, 'it almost looked like he was asking her on a date. The way she shook him off was brilliant.' Guardiola himself justified his actions by explaining that Steinhaus had informed him there would be no more time added on after Xhaka had delayed the game in injury time. 'I wanted more time, but she said ""no, we are not doing that""', Guardiola said later. As it turned out, Bayern did get their chance, with the game only finishing after 96 minutes. It made no difference, though, as Gladbach held to complete a well earned draw.

"Roy Hodgson has urged his England assistant Gary Neville to give up being a TV pundit and become a full time coach when he takes a decision on his career in 2016. Neville, who would be a contender to succeed Hodgson if he were to leave the England job after Euro 2016, has said that he will make a decision next year on whether to opt for the media or football management full time, recognising that he can’t keep a foot in both camps indefinitely. If Hodgson wished to retire in 2016 and the team had been successful, Neville would be a natural replacement as England manager – but Hodgson hopes that when the time comes he will opt for coaching over his media work with Sky Sports. VIDEO Coach or journalist? Scroll down for some Mourinho humour on Neville's dilemma . England manager Roy Hodgson (right) has urged Gary Neville to become a full time coach . Sky Sports pundits (L-R) Graeme Souness, Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry, Jamie Redknapp and Neville . ‘From a selfish point of view, thinking about the importance good coaches are going to have in our game, personally would see him more valuable to me as an English football lover as a coach than as a pundit,’ said Hodgson. ‘Punditry, to be honest, is not that difficult if you know a little bit about football. You don’t win or lose in punditry. You don’t have to deal with players. You don’t have the daily contact with them, you’re not coaching them. You’re just watching the game and giving your opinion. ‘But the fact that he’s so good at it, who knows? Maybe he’ll be under great pressure from Sky to keep that up. Maybe there won’t be any jobs that he wants to take. If you’re asking me personally would you like to see Gary Neville being a coach or a manger in the future, then of course I would. Hodgson and Neville attend a Premier League game earlier this month between Arsenal and Aston Villa . Neville has been England coach under Hodgson since 2012, accompanying him to last summer's World Cup . ‘He’d be a loss to England at the moment because he’s working with us. I don’t know what he’ll be doing in future terms. I think he’s a very good coach now. He’ll become an even better coach with experience. He’ll enjoy working with players. 'I think players will enjoy working with him. I think from a selfish coaching orientated point of view I would like to see him in coaching. Of course, were I in the mass media TV world I’d be having a completely different argument. I’d be saying: “He doesn’t want to be doing that.” ‘He’s never actually said to me there is a cut-off point here where I’ll make a decision. But of course we talk a lot about what he wants to do because we talk a lot. We’re together all the time. I think he’s going to become a very fine coach. He’ll become a very fine manager also in time.’","Roy Hodgson urges his assistant Gary Neville to become full time coach .

"Thousands of patients face being left without a doctor’s surgery after two GPs suddenly quit, complaining about their workload. Dr Holly Hardy and Dr Karen Houghton have handed in their resignations to NHS England, blaming the Government's NHS reforms and cutbacks. But the move means 6,000 patients will be left without a GP unless the NHS finds replacements - something the Bristol, surgery has failed to do since January 2012. Dr Holly Hardy (left) and Dr Karen Houghton (right) have resigned in protest at their workload - blaiming the Government's NHS reforms and cutbacks . There is growing dissatisfaction with GP services, a new poll has revealed. Patients' ratings of services  have fallen across the board, according to the survey of 900,000 people across England. Families are less satisfied with their overall experience of the GP surgery, how they make appointments and their out of hours care, the poll found. Fewer people would also recommend their practice to someone else, according to the GP Patient Survey. While the levels of satisfaction have dipped, 85.7% of patients still rate their overall experience of their GP surgery as good. But this is a one percent down on last year. The number of people who thought making an appointment was good, meanwhile, dipped 1.7 percent. Satisfaction levels about out-of-hours GP services has also fallen four percent since June last year to 66.2%. Meanwhile, less than eight in 10 would recommend their GP surgery to someone who had just moved into their local area - a decrease of 1.3 percent. Dr Hardy, 49, blamed NHS restructuring which she said is putting off new recruits and driving older doctors into early retirement. She said the last two years at St Martin’s Surgery in Knowle had been 'horrible'. The doctor said: 'For the last six months it has been another doctor and myself who are supposed to work just three days between us, running a practice for 6,000 patients. 'It has been a very difficult decision to resign our contract with NHS England but we have been running at a third capacity. It has been horrible. 'We’ve been working extra hours - sometime till midnight - to clear paperwork.' Asked for the reasons behind the shortage in staff, she said: 'I think it is a reflection on a national issue that has been in the background. 'There is more work for GPs than ever before. There has been a move to bring services out into primary care from secondary care which is great, but the funding and resources have not followed. 'Also there is an issue with recruitment. Young doctors don’t want to go into GP practice because they are seeing how difficult it is. 'And a lot of GPs are retiring early because it is just too much.' South Bristol Labour MP Dawn Primarolo has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt demanding action. She said: 'There is no doubt this will cause significant anxiety and distress for patients registered at St Martins, which I know has an outstanding local reputation. 'They will want to know why young doctors don’t want to join a well-run successful surgery and what action NHS England has taken. 'The bigger question is how many GP surgeries in Bristol and in other parts of the country are under similar threat? 'Rather than focusing on patients, this Government has created chaos within the NHS with a massive reorganisation which has created a crisis in primary care. 'Jeremy Hunt should stop criticising GPs and get a grip of what is really happening.' St Martin's Surgery in Knowle, Bristol, is now facing closure - leaving thousands of people without a doctor's surgery . A spokeswoman for NHS England said the move does not necessarily mean the surgery will close. She said: “While the resignation of the current contract holders at St Martin’s Surgery has been accepted, this does not mean that the surgery will close. 'We will be seeking a provider for an interim GP service whilst options for the long-term future of the surgery are considered. 'We will engage with stakeholders and patients about these options as they are developed. 'We are committed to ensuring that patients have access to high quality, local GP services.'","GPs have quit leaving up to 6,000 patients without a doctors surgery .

"A grieving widow took her late husband’s ashes into a mobile phone shop – to persuade staff to stop his contract. Maria Raybould, 56, was still receiving bills from T-Mobile after her husband David, 57, died of cancer – and was threatened with bailiffs if she didn’t pay up. The day after Mr Raybould’s death, her son informed the phone company which asked to see a death certificate so staff could cancel the contract. Maria Raybould's husband David died of cancer in August, but even after providing his birth certificate to T-Mobile, she received letters demanding money . But after complying with their wishes, Mrs Raybould continued to receive threatening letters telling her to pay £129 or face a cancellation charge. She said: ‘It’s gone downhill since then. I’ve had texts asking if David wanted to pay an extra £2.50 for broadband and letters saying that the bailiffs would be coming.’ Her husband died on August 29 after a long fight with cancer. He had been paying £26 a month by direct debit for a Samsung Galaxy SII Mini on a contract with T-Mobile. Mrs Raybould, from Cardiff, said she visited her local T-Mobile branch three times in an attempt to convince them her husband had died. On a third visit to a T-mobile shop, Mrs Raybould said she even showed her husband's ashes to staff - but still the letters asking for an overdue amount of £129.48 . ‘I’ve been up to the shop with the death certificate, with a letter from the crematorium, the funeral bills – even his ashes. I took in everything I could,’ she said. ‘I lost it in the shop. I gave them 20 minutes to sort it out. ‘I went outside and had a panic attack. ‘When I went back in the girl told me she had spoken to the manager and they were going to stop the contract. Then I had another letter about the bailiffs. ‘My son spoke with T-Mobile again and was assured it was sent in error and that it wasn’t going to happen again.’ But last week, Mrs Raybould received yet another letter addressed to her late husband from the firm’s customer finance department. It asked for a payment that was overdue and said the account would be passed to a debt collection agency. She said it had been easier to bury her husband than end his phone contract. ‘How dare they put me and my sons through this? I wouldn’t want anyone to go through what we have over the last few months,’ she said. ‘It was easier for us to bury him than sort this out.’ A spokesman for T-Mobile yesterday apologised and said there was a delay to the automated process that cancels the balance, resulting in the letters being issued. He added: ‘We apologise to Mrs Raybould for any distress caused. We can confirm that the account has been closed and the balance cleared.’","Maria Raybould's husband David died of cancer in August aged 57 .

"With all the glitz and glamour of being an international football icon, you may have thought comes a wealth of beautiful women. But former Brazil superstar Ronaldo would have you believe otherwise. Speaking with Sports Illustrated, the new part-owner of National American Soccer League side Fort Lauderdale Strikers reflected on a glittering career that saw him win two World Cups and three World Player of the Year awards. Revealing that his best friend while playing was compatriot and former Real Madrid team-mate Roberto Carlos, the 38-year-old didn't hold back on all the nitty-gritty.

'I’ve been last year a couple times to Paris to watch his matches. His movement! He’s very, very good, the best at the moment.' Dubbed 'The Phenomenon' in his playing days, Ronaldo never fell short of a plaudit or two - and was duly crowned the world's best player in 1996, 1997 and 2002 for his efforts - but it was without hesitation that he named the best player he'd ever played against.

"The largest bounty hunt in history is underway - after anonymous donors handed a German private detective company $30million (£18.3million) to find out who shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The plane was shot out of the air on July 17 over Russian rebel territory in  eastern Ukraine, and someone is so desperate to uncover the mystery that they have promised this huge war-chest. The task has been given to fraud investigation company Wifka, based in Schleswig-Holstein in north Germany. Scroll down for video . A $30million bounty has been offered up to anyone who can find out who shot down flight MH17 in July . There is an ongoing investigation into the tragedy, which left all 298 people on board dead, but it was made difficult by Russian separatists, who had control of the area where the plane crashed and were also largely blamed for shooting down the flight. 'After the terrible assassination or ""accident"" all political parties, at home and abroad, said they owed it to the victims, their families and the public to clarify the circumstances of the crash and present evidence for what happened. None of this has yet been done,' said Wifka in a statement reported by The Local. The bounty hunt is being led Josef Resch, who has 30 years of private investigation experience and told Capital finance magazine: 'Everyone can be bought, it's just a question of how much.' The tragedy left 298 passengers and crew members dead when the plane was brought down over Ukraine . The bounty  is the biggest of all time - beating that offered for clues leading to Osama bin Laden's capture . Mr Resch confirmed that he had already received a 40,000 euro fee, and had no doubt about the seriousness of the promised bounty. Wifka said that whoever can tell them what they need to know - who was involved in the shooting, who covered up the truth and what happened to the weapon - will get the $30million. The company added that anyone who does provide information will be provided with a new identity, for protection. The bounty is being held in Zurich, but Wifka say they do not know who has put it up. The only information is that one of the middlemen spoke with a Swiss accent. The huge sum is being offered by German fraud investigation company Wifka, with the money held in Zurich . The $30million bounty is $5million more than the previous largest of all time - the $25million offered up for clues that might lead to the capture of Osama bin Laden. The detective in charge of the official investigation into the Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight said last week that the plane was most likely shot down from the ground. 'It's going to be a long investigation. I don't rule out that we can identify a suspect and bring this to a prosecution,' said Detective Fred Westerbeke after revealing the theory that the flight was shot down was 'the one getting the most attention' from the Dutch National Prosecutors Office. It has previously speculated the flight was brought down accidentally by pro-Russian rebels fighting over territory in eastern Ukraine. The theory that the Kremlin aided rebel fighters by supplying them with weapons has been vehemently denied by President Vladimir Putin. Shortly after the disaster in July, a highly placed rebel revealed in a press interview that the plane had been shot down by a mixed team of rebels and Russian military personnel who believed they were targeting a Ukrainian military plane. Intercepted phone calls between fighters supported his claims. Dutch police chief Patricia Zorko said detectives were considering more than 300 million web pages and thousands of images as part of the investigation into the tragedy.","German fraud investigation company Wifka given the money anonymously .

"The number of immigrants coming into Britain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade. Half a million from abroad came to live here in the 12 months to the end of last September, the smallest number since 2001. The drop was a result of fewer immigrants coming to study at language or further education schools – although those going to universities went up by 5 per cent – fewer people coming to join their families, and a fall in migrants from New Commonwealth countries such as Pakistan. The Coalition is pledged to reduce net migration, the number by which the population goes up after immigration and emigration are counted, to below 100,000 a year. Drop: Net migration is now at its lowest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed . Yesterday’s figures from the Office . for National Statistics put net migration at 153,000 over the 12 months, . compared to 242,000 in the previous 12 months. It is the lowest net . migration figure since 2003. The 500,000 immigrants in the 12 months to September 2012 compares to 581,000 in the previous period. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Net migration is now at its lowest level for a decade showing we are continuing to bring immigration back under control. ‘Today's statistics show another significant fall in net migration - down by more than a third since June 2010. This has been driven in the most recent period by a decline in the number of people coming to the UK.’ More up to date figures showed that applications for further education colleges and English language schools were down by almost half in the year to March 2013. Applications to universities were up five per cent. Immigration minister Mark Harper said tougher action on bogus colleges had seen the number of students coming to Britain fall dramatically . Mr Harper added: ‘The figures show we . have cut out abuse while encouraging the brightest and best migrants who . contribute to economic growth, with a fiver per cent increase in the . number of sponsored student visa applications for our world-class . universities, and a fiver per cent increase in the number of visas . issued to skilled workers. ‘We have made substantial inroads in cutting immigration and now have a more selective system that works in our national interest.’ Mr Harper is leading a ministerial taskforce looking to curb benefits, housing and healthcare access for immigrants to deter thousands of people moving to Britain. The government also wants to make it easier to identify and deport people who are in Britain illegally. Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May want to reduce net migration from non-EU countries to less than 100,000 before the next election in 2015. However, the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research warned attempts to cut immigration ;levels could harm the economy. Sarah Mulley, associate director at IPPR, said: ‘Today's statistics show a continued decline in net migration to the UK. But the Government's progress towards its target of reducing net migration to less than 100,000 by 2015 is still in large part being driven by falling numbers of international students. ‘This decline in international student numbers comes at considerable economic cost to the UK at a time when we can ill afford it. ‘In any case, falling student numbers will not help the Government meet its target in the medium term. ‘Because most students stay in the UK only for a short time, reduced immigration now will mean reduced emigration in the future, which by 2015 could partially reverse the falls in net migration we are seeing now.’ The most common reason given for migrating to Britain remains study, the ONS said, with 190,000 foreign students arriving in the period, although this was down 22 per cent or 56,000 from 246,000 in the previous year. The number of visas issued fell 6 per cent to 499,780 in the year ending March 2013 - the lowest 12-monthly total since comparable data was first published in 2005. There was a ‘significant’ decrease in the number of immigrants arriving from New Commonwealth countries, which includes African countries such as Botswana, Kenya and Malawi and Indian subcontinent countries such as Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Some 105,000 immigrants from New Commonwealth countries arrived in the UK in the year to September, down 36 per cent or 61,000 from 166,000 in the previous year. A total of 58,000 immigrants arrived from countries which joined the EU in 2004, including Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania, down 22 per cent or 17,000 from the previous year.","Net migration falls from 242,000 in September 2011 to 153,000 in 2012 .

"A pair of 350-year-old pistols stolen by the Nazis from the Rothschild family one year before the start of World War II have emerged for sale for £80,000. The ornate guns were seized from the Rothschild family along with numerous works of art kept in their collection in Vienna, Austria, just 48 hours after the country signed a pact with Germany in March 1938. On the instructions of Hitler, the SS raided the homes of Baron Louis Von Rothschild and his brother, Baron Alphonse Von Rothschild - two influential members of the banking dynasty. Ornate: The 350-year-old pistols were seized from the Rothschild family from their Vienna collection in 1938 . Looted: The guns, pictured, were taken when Hitler instructed the SS to raid the homes of the prolific Jews . Louis Von Rothschild had been arrested and imprisoned just days before for being a Jew. Alphonse Von Rothschild had been warned not to return to Austria and therefore evaded arrest. The stolen artifacts, including the two 21-inch pistols from 1670, were intended for Hitler's Führermuseum which he had planned in the Austrian city of Linz. In 1944 they were were taken to salt mines in the small Austrian village of Altaussee to protect them from heavy bombing. A year later they were discovered by US troops and returned to Vienna. The Austrian government immediately passed a law banning the items from being taken out of the country. The items remained in the possession of the state as Louis and Alphonse Von Rothschild had moved their families abroad following the end of the war. Details: The pistols, pictured above, made by Pietro Manani in around 1670, are now for sale for £80,000 . The government ordered the collection broken up and individual items distributed among various state galleries, museums and other institutions. There they remained until 1999 when they were finally returned to the Rothschild family. The pistols, made by Pietro Manani in around 1670, are now for sale for £80,000 through London auction house Bonhams on behalf of a private collector. Experts say the 21-inch Brescian flintlock holster pistols are so valuable because of their sheer quality. Rare: Experts say the 21-inch Brescian flintlock holster pistols are so valuable because of their sheer quality . David Williams, from Bonhams' antique arms and armour department, said: 'There can be few pistols with a more interesting history than these magnificent survivors of centuries. 'They are artistic and technological marvels of their time and remain today a window into the superb craftsmanship of the past. 'They were stolen by the Nazis from the Austrian string of the Rothschild family in 1938 and kept in a salt mine during the war to protect them. 'The pistols were given to a museum after the war and were returned to the family in 1999. 'They're now being sold by a private collector who acquired them shortly after they were returned. 'The story behind them is fascinating but what makes them really valuable is their quality, workmanship and condition. 'They are incredibly high end pistols in fantastic condition.' During World War II, the Nazis went on a rampage destroying and stealing an estimated 750,000 pieces of European art. The years between 1933 and 1945 are a black hole in the art community, with thousands of pieces of art changing hands and going missing. While priceless pieces of art were auctioned off at extremely low prices. The Nazis took so-called degenerate art - mostly avant-garde modern art, such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the German people. Looted art was stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell under duress during the Third Reich. For the heirs of those collectors, the discovery raised hopes of recovering art, but the slow release of information by the German government stirred frustration. In 2012, German authorities seized 1,280 pieces from the apartment of reclusive art collector Cornelius Gurlitt. He inherited the art collection from his father, Hildebrand, who was commissioned to obtain artworks on behalf of Adolf Hitler and bought works confiscated from Jewish familes. A number of works, including those by Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall, were discovered during the probe. Shortly before he died, Gurlitt reached a deal with the German government to check whether hundreds of works were looted from Jewish owners by the Nazis. Authorities say that deal is binding on any heirs.","Ornate guns were seized from the family's collection in Vienna in 1938 .

"Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions singled out Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday for taking jobs away from American workers and giving them to immigrants to drive down his company's costs. Sessions, a Republican who is known for his fierce opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants, railed on the Senate floor against Zuckerberg and other Democrats backing executive action by the president and legislation authored by the Gang of Eight that would increase the number of guest worker permits. 'The “masters of the universe” are very fond of open borders as long as these open borders don’t extend to their gated compounds and fenced-off estates,' he claimed at one point, according to National Review Online, which reprinted a version of his speech. Scroll down for video . Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican who is staunchly opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants, took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to attack Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his allies over their support for immigration reform policies that Sessions says would rob American workers of job opportunties . The crux of Sessions' argument was that it's unnecessary to increase the number of temporary work visas, particularly for the purposes of filling information and technology positions, because there's a plethora of jobless Americans who could fill those voids. The Republican Senator targeted Zuckerberg because he is the founder of a Silicon Valley based non-profit organization that lobbies the government to make reforms to the immigration system. The goals of FWD.us include getting the government to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who currently reside in the U.S. and to allowing skilled workers to jump to the front of the immigration line. Reports that the president could grant work permits to up to six million illegal immigrants this fall has Sessions especially riled up about the influence that special interests could have on the White House's decision. 'The administration is meeting with the elite, the cosmopolitan set, who scorn and mock the concerns of everyday Americans who are concerned about their schools, jobs, wages, communities, and hospitals,' Sessions said. 'These great and powerful citizens of the world don’t care much about old-fashioned things like national boundaries, national sovereignty, and immigration control — let alone the constitutional separation of powers.' In his rant against Zuckerberg and his allies, Sessions claimed they were pushing the White House to issues executive orders that admit foreign workers to the U.S. 'for the explicit purpose of taking jobs in the United States.' 'Many of us have heard for a long time the claim that there is a shortage of STEM [science, technology, energy and math] and IT workers,' Sessions said. 'This has been the central sales pitch used by those making demands for massive increases in foreign-worker programs across the board — programs that bring in workers for every sector in the U.S. economy. 'But we know from the nation’s leading academics, people who studied this issue and are professionals in it,' he said. Zuckerberg is pictured here at the Mexico XXI Century Forum  at Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City, Mexico last Friday. Zuckerberg is the founder of FWD.us, an organization that lobbies the government on immigration reform, among other issues . Sessions proceeded to read from a July op-ed published in USA Today in which five professors of public policy from five universities assert that they've been unable 'to find any credible evidence' that there's a shortage of workers in those fields. 'Imagine, then, how many more Americans would be frozen out of the middle class if politicians and tech moguls succeeded in doubling or tripling the flow of guest workers into STEM occupations,' the op-ed states. Sessions offered up the op-ed as proof that tech companies like Facebook and Microsoft are using the H-1B visa program' to keep wages down and to hire less expensive workers from abroad.' 'Indeed, the same companies demanding more guest workers are laying off American workers in droves,' he said, referring to Microsoft's decision to lay off 18,000 workers. 'So I would pose a question to Mr. Zuckerberg. I read in the news that Facebook is now worth more than $200 billion. Is that not enough money to hire American workers for a change?' he said a few minutes later. 'Let me just say one more thing: Facebook has 7,000 workers . . .Why doesn’t Mr. Zuckerberg call his friend Mr. Gates and say: Look, I have to hire a few hundred people; do you have any résumés you can send over here? Maybe I will not have to take somebody from a foreign country for a job an unemployed U.S. citizen might take.' Gates is also a founder FWD.us. Sessions pointed out that several other large technology companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, United Technologies and T-Mobile, have also had massive lay-offs in the last two years. 'There is no shortage of workers,' he concluded. The president, he said, has already acted unilaterally to expand the work visa program this year by 100,000 more people. Meanwhile, real median hourly wages have declined by 3.4 percent since 2009. 'So what about the good, decent, and patriotic citizens of our country who fight our wars, who obey our laws, who follow our rules, and want a better future for their children? Should their needs not come first?' Sessions asked. 'We cannot put the parochial demands of a few powerful CEOs ahead of an entire nation’s hopes, dreams, and aspirations,' he added. 'The job of elected officials is to answer to the people who sent them to Washington — not to scorn them, not to demean them, not to mock them, and not to sell their jobs and dreams to the highest bidder.' The Senate has already passed the White House approved Gang of Eight legislation, proposed by four Republicans and four Democrats. That legislation stalled in the House more than a year ago. The House has since passed legislation that would bar President Barack Obama from using executive orders to give amnesty to illegal immigrants but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has refused to bring the legislation to the floor in the upper chamber. On Wednesday Sessions encouraged his fellow Senators to 'stand up' to Reid and the president, . 'This body is not run by one man. We don’t have a dictator in the great Senate. Every member has a vote,' he said.","Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said Wednesday that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg and his allies want to take jobs away from American workers .

"A lamp bought for just 50p at a church fete turned out to be an ingenious device that helped the Allies bring about the downfall of the Nazi regime in the Second World War. The beacon lamp was used to flash Morse code signals from the beaches of Normandy during the D-Day landings in 1944, directing troops to landing points on the five designated beaches as they raced over the sea in landing craft. Martin Billenness, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, had no idea of the lamp’s history when he was given it as a present from his mother, who had bought it for next to nothing in the 1990s. Landing light: This Second World War beacon lamp was bought at a church fete by for just 50p . To his amazement, specialists at London’s Science Museum and Imperial War Museum identified it as a beacon lamp specially commissioned by the War Office. The 11in lamp displays the Morse signal for any chosen letter of the alphabet, helping to direct soldiers to their correct landing zones. To understand the inner workings of the lamp better without damaging it, two x-rays were taken. They revealed a small 2.5v electric motor driven by a 2.4v battery. Innovation: Specialists at London's Science Museum and Imperial War Museum used x-rays to identify it as a beacon lamp commissioned by the War Office . A dial on the top of the lamp allows it to be set to the desired Morse code letter, and when switched on it flashes its signal every seven seconds. The lamp would have been taken onto the beach by an advance party and turned on, identifying the correct beach and correct landing point for the landing craft. The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies’ assault on German-occupied western Europe. The mission, which took place on June 6, 1944, was the largest amphibious invasion in history and mainly involved British, American and Canadian soldiers. The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah. The savage and bloody landings turned the tide against the enemy forces, opening up a second front (the Russians were advancing on Germany from the east) and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe. Mr Billenness, 52, took the beacon lamp along to the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow in his hometown of Eastbourne to show experts and reveal the remarkable story. The lamp is now on display to the public at the Redoubt Fortress and Military Museum in Eastbourne. Mr Billenness, a self employed glazier, said: 'I was given this lamp as a present from my mother who had picked it up at a church fete. Signal: A dial on the top of the light allows it to be set to the desired Morse code letter, and when switched on it flashes its signal every seven seconds . The lamp would have been taken onto the beach by an advance party and turned on, identifying the correct beach and correct landing point for the landing craft . 'At the time I was into beach fishing so she had bought me a Tilley lamp but at the same time spotted this lamp and thought it looked interesting. 'I had no idea what it was or where it had come from. 'The only giveaway was the Ministry of Defence stamp on the top of it so I knew it had something to do with the military. 'It also had a very strange dial on the top with each letter of the alphabet on it. 'I was really intrigued so I took the lamp to the Redoubt Fortress and Military Museum in Eastbourne and asked them.

D-Day was the largest amphibious invasion in history and opened up a second front against the German war machine . American soldiers disembark from Coast Guard landing craft at the shores of Normandy on 22 June 1944 . 'They were equally bewildered and said they had never seen anything like it before. 'They then sent it to the Science Museum and the Imperial War Museum to study. 'The experts there told me it was a beacon lamp that would have been used for beach landings such as the D-Day raids. 'It is incredible to think this lamp could have been used in the D-Day landings. 'As I understand it, very few of these exist now, probably because they would have been left behind or thrown away once the job had been done. 'It’s a very special and unusual item.'","Martin Billenness, 52, was given the unusual lamp by his mother .

"Thousands of people flocked to San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday for a spectacular celebration of the famous landmark's 75th birthday. But a less cheery presence at the festivities was this display of 1,558 shoes representing those who have killed themselves by jumping off the bridge into the San Francisco Bay. The moving installation was the work of the Bridge Rail Foundation, an organisation dedicated to stopping suicide jumps from the bridge. 'It's a symbol of how deep and serious this problem has been,' said spokesman Paul Muller. 'We're still losing 30 to 35 a people a year off the bridge.' Poignant: These 1,558 pairs of shoes represent all the people who have committed suicide by throwing themselves off the Golden Gate Bridge . Moving: The shoes were installed by the Bridge Rail Foundation, which pushes to cut down on the number of suicides at the bridge . The day-long party attracted pleasure boats, tug boats and other vessels to the waterfront ahead of a magnificent evening fireworks display. Crowds gathered for the exciting events taking place along the shoreline from Fort Point, south of the bridge, to Pier 39 along The Embarcadero. Many walked and biked across the 1.7-mile-long bridge bridge before rounding off the day by watching the nighttime show over the city's enduring symbol. Memorable sight: Fireworks explode over the Golden Gate Bridge as of its 75th anniversary celebrations draw to a close . Glittering vision: One of the modern Wonders of the World, the 1.7-mile-long bridge opened to traffic on May 27, 1937 . The bridge was shrouded in fog for part of the day, but skies were clear by twilight for the 18 minute-long display, which coincided with Memorial Day weekend. 'It's such an iconic structure, depending on the day or the hour, it just looks like it changes continuously,' said San Francisco resident Daniel Sutphin as he walked through the Fort Point area with his wife and their three young children. Since it opened in 1937, more than 2billion vehicles have crossed the mammoth structure. The imposing tourist attraction was named after the Golden Gate Strait, the entrance of water to San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean, which was championed by engineer Joseph Strauss in the 1920s. Dazzling: The steel suspension bridge was bathed in colour and pleasure boats and tugs encircled the water beneath . Arches of light: The San Francisco landmark is illuminated by the beautiful display as thousands watch from the city's shore . Hotspot: Tourists collect at the famous orange vermilion location on the day of its 75th anniversary celebrations . The bridge, which rises majestically above a Civil War-era fort on the San Francisco side and arches across to the Marin County headlands to the north, is in the middle of a seismic upgrade that has seen many of its structures replaced or modified. Plans for a moveable barrier to separate north and southbound traffic and a net system to prevent suicides are also moving forward. On the water, Golden Gate ferries were running again after a one-day strike disrupted service across San Francisco Bay on Saturday. Workers represented by the Inlandboatmen's Union walked off the job on a day strike, forcing the cancellation of ferries operated by Golden Gate between Larkspur, Sausalito and San Francisco. The strike was called after nearly a year of negotiations over workloads and other complaints, according to Marina Secchitano, the union's regional director. Burning our bridges: The attraction, which is undergoing major refitting work to extend its lifespan by another 150 years, looked as though it were on fire . Riot of colour: Eye-catching rockets flew into the air and crackled outwards from the bridge over San Francisco Bay . Shimmering delight: The water was bathed in gold and scarlet as the 18-minute extravaganza brought a day-long party to an end . California Governor Jerry Brown issued a statement on Saturday evening, saying that he was appointing a board to investigate the strike, which he said had disrupted public service. Ms Secchitano disputed the governor's claim, questioning the motivation to call for an investigation after a one-day strike and saying: '[This is] an action to try to silence us. 'They're counting on this process to back our membership off the issue.' Service resumed Sunday when workers returned to work. The bridge was built as the US emerged from the Great Depression, and was heralded as an engineering marvel when it opened in 1937. Now an iconic sight, it was the world's longest suspension span at the time, built across a strait that critics said was too treacherous to be bridged. Illustrious history: The bridge was built as the US emerged from the Great Depression, and was heralded as an engineering marvel when it opened in 1937 . Incredible feat: The tourist attraction was the world's longest suspension span at the time, built across a strait that critics said was too treacherous to be bridged . Crews had to install a bracing system after high winds lashed and twisted the span in the 1950s, raising fears it would collapse. Years later, they had to replace vertical cables when they were found to have corroded in the bridge's damp, foggy climate, potentially destabilising the span. 'When (one of the bridge's designers) made his final speech during opening day ceremonies in 1937, he said, ""I present to you a bridge that will last forever,""' said Daniel Mohn, the bridge's former chief engineer, who co-authored a book about the span. 'What he should have said is, ""I present to you a . bridge that will last forever if properly maintained.""' Eleven men died during construction from 1933 to 1937 - ten of them when scaffolding fell through a safety net that had been set up to protect workers. The conditions were difficult, cold, foggy and windy, and workers who helped construct supports for the south tower had to contend with dangerous tides. The current retrofit project is expected to extend the bridge's lifespan by another 150 years.","Bridge Rail Foundation erected a moving display of 1,558 pairs of shoes to represent those who have jumped from the bridge to their death .

"Scandal-hit banks are facing an exodus of customers - with more than 1,000 people deserting them every day for mutual Nationwide. Some 1,200 new current accounts are being opened daily at Nationwide alone, as customers reject rotten service, punitive fees and a string of mis-selling scandals, Britain’s biggest mutual revealed yesterday. More than 430,000 new accounts were set up over the past 12 months. Nationwide is tempting new customers with a popular current account paying 5pc interest to those who stay in the black – more interest than you can get in any savings account. Scroll down for video . Nationwide has revealed some 1,200 new current accounts are being opened daily as customers reject rotten service, punitive fees and a string of mis-selling scandals by other banks . It has also lured many customers from rival mutual Co-op which was tarnished by the drug revelations of former chairman Paul Flowers and poor financial performance including a £2.5 billion-pound loss. A new switching service which ensures a seven-day transfer between bank accounts has also helped boost its appeal. Although the building society couldn’t confirm where all its new customers were coming from, it’s understood the bulk stem from High Street banks including RBS/NatWest and Lloyds Banking Group. Jafar Hassan, bank specialist at price comparison uSwitch.com says: ‘It’s a boon to see such huge numbers prepared to desert their banks. ‘At long last, people are confident to shake off mis-placed loyalty and go elsewhere for better treatment.’ Scandal: Nationwide lured many customers from rival mutual Co-op after it was tarnished by the drug revelations of former chairman Paul Flowers, pictured . Now with 5.5 million current account customers – a market share of 6.2 per cent - Nationwide is so far one of the biggest winners in the battle for bank accounts on the high street. Graham Beale, chief executive, said: ‘Most people leave their bank because something wasn’t resolved or couldn’t be sorted. People do want an alternative and we want to be the place people come to.’ It picked up one in ten current switchers in March. However, the competition is getting fiercer. Earlier this month, Marks & Spencer launched a free bank account with a £100 gift card and loyalty points in a bid to shake up high street rivals. Others muscling in on traditional banks include the Post Office, which is rolling out new current accounts in branches, while Tesco Bank and Virgin Money will unveil new deals later this year. Earlier this year, figures from the Payments Council – the body behind the new switching service – showed 609,300 customers had changed accounts in the six months to the end of March. This is a 14 per cent rise on the 532,500 switches in the year before. Under the new rules current account holders should be able to move their bank account to another provider within seven days. It had taken up to 30. And money wrongly sent to the old account will be automatically swept into the new one for 13 months. So far, nearly 2 million payments that have gone astray have been redirected to the new account. A spokesman for the Payments Council said the service had removed the ‘fear factor’ from switching. However, experts have been disappointed that the overall numbers switching remain low. ‘With roughly 70 million of current account holders in the UK, the proportion prepared to up sticks for a better deal every year is low,’ said David Black, of analyst Consumer Intelligence. Graham Beale said that customers wanted an alternative and the Nationwide wants to be the place people come to . Last year, a report by the Office of Fair Trading discovered that three-quarters of people had never switched bank. The vast majority of customers had never even considered switching, it found. On average, only three in every 100 customers bother to switch accounts each year because they are fearful the move will go wrong. Separately, the boss of Britain’s biggest building society said the UK’s housing market did not look set for a crash. Fears of a bubble – with prices rising at up to 18 per cent in parts of London and 8 per cent across the country - have triggered concern of a crash. Mr Beale said: ‘Anecdotally, there is some evidence of a slowing down in the housing market. ‘At the end of December 2013 and earlier this year, the market was quite frenetic; now it’s only busy. ‘All regions are now experiencing some growth but the big increases are mainly centred in London and the South East, and there are few signs of affordability being stretched in other UK regions.’ In the 12 months to April 4, it lent out £28.1 billion in home loans it said – nearly a third up on the year before. One in five of first-time buyer mortgages were given by Nationwide.

"The internet has revolutionised the way we communicate and a third of the world’s population use it to stay connected. Now, Texas-based internet cartographer and computer scientist John Matherly has used software to ‘ping’ all of these global web devices and create a map demonstrating the technology’s global reach. In the majority of cases, this signal was sent to routers rather than individual gadgets, but Mr Matherly said iPhone and Android devices have appeared previously. Connected: Texas-based internet cartographer and computer scientist John Matherly has used software to ‘ping’ global web devices to build a map (pictured) demonstrating the technology’s global reach . The cartographer said it took around five hours to ping all IP addresses on August 2. The map then took more than 12 hours to create. 'Pinging' an IP address involves sending a signal to the device from a server, which causes the connection to 'light up' - albeit not physically. Mr Matherly is founder of Shodan, a search engine for connected devices. Different colours represent the density of devices in that region, and unsurprisingly, the world’s largest cities in developed countries glow the brightest. Red areas contain a lot of web-enabled devices, while green areas contain fewer. Black areas are regions where no signal was received. While it may be no surprise that there seem to be less internet-connected devices in parts of Africa, Mr Matherly explained his map is not precise because some organisations block ping requests. It is thought that areas of China should be coloured bright red on the map, but the country’s ‘Great Firewall’ explains why most of the country looks dark. The cartographer said it took five hours to 'ping' all IP addresses on 2 August. The map then took more than 12 hours to create. Red areas contain a lot of web-enabled devices, while black areas contain the fewest. It is easy to see how well-connected areas like Europe and the US (pictured) contrast with Greenland and Africa . Internet blackout: It is thought that areas of China should be coloured bright red on the map, but the country’s ‘Great Firewall’ explains why most of the country looks dark (pictured). ‘There's basically not a lot of information available on where an IP address is located within China, which makes mapping it very difficult. The majority of devices simply get lumped into Shanghai or Beijing, even though they might be located somewhere else within the country,’ he wrote. Explaining how he made the map, Mr Matherly said: ‘The data was generated using a stateless scanner used to create Shodan (a computer search engine that he founded). ‘A free, open-source scanner called Zmap is readily available for anybody that wants to do it themselves, and the map itself was generated using the Python matplotlib library. In the last year, it has become easy to scan the whole internet using such tools, where an individual sends and receives packets to everyone connected to the internet, Motherboard reported. Mr Matherly essentially asked computers, smartphones, tablets and games consoles to send him their location so he could create his map. To do this, he used a database that pinpoints a city for each IP address and used another tool to find them easily on a map of the world. A firm called IVPN recently created a map of internet freedom around the world (pictured) based on a Freedom House report in 2013.

Bacary Sagna, Laurent Koscielny, Olivier Giroud, Hugo Lloris, Loic Remy, Mathieu Debuchy, Moussa Sissoko and Patrice Evra are in the 23-man squad, while Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin is on standby.

And he even replied to his girlfriend: 'Love you dont get upset life sometimes is unfair but you have to accept it and deal with it.' Deschamps was questioned about the high-profile omission during his press conference on Tuesday, and doubted Nasri's international credentials. 'He has important status with Manchester City because he starts, which is not the case today in the France team.'

'I think the dye is cast. I respect [Didier Deschamps'] choice. I'll watch the World Cup on TV,' he told Canal+. 'If starting games in a club like Manchester City and winning two titles isn't enough, too bad, I won't regret anything.'

Out: Gael Clichy will also not be involved, but Morgan Schneiderlin is on a seven-man standby list . Big man: Olivier Giroud makes the 23, along with Arsenal team-mates Bacary Sagna and Laurent Koscielny . Nasri was banned for three matches by the French FA during Euro 2012 after the playmaker launched an expletive-laden rant at reporters following France's quarter-final defeat by Spain. He has played just six times since that tournament but club boss Manuel Pellegrini believes it's a mistake to leave Nasri out. 'The manager of France hasn't said about the list but I can't believe Samir Nasri won't be in it because he was one of the best players in the Premier League and very important for our squad,' Pellegrini said after the Premier League victory on Sunday. 'It will be an important mistake if he doesn't play in the World Cup.' Snub: Nasri has barely featured since a three-game ban after Euro 2012 for swearing at reporters .","Samir Nasri left out of the France World Cup squad by Deschamps .

"A University professor who claimed he was fired after giving Oscar nominated actor James Franco a poor grade is suing the star for damages. Jose Angel Santana alleges he was sacked for giving the '127 Hours' star a D after he failed to attend almost all of his classes at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. The former professor, who has already taken legal action against the university, is reported to have criticised Mr Franco for making 'disparaging and inaccurate public statements,' about him. At odds: Professor Jose Angel Santana, left, . says New York University bent over backwards for Mr Franco, right. When . Mr Santana gave the star a D, the university sacked him, he says. He is now suing Mr Franco for damages . Passed out: James Franco was mocked after a fellow student caught him snoozing at a Columbia University lecture in March 2009 . Mr Franco was enrolled in a fine arts degree course and was scheduled to attend a film directing course. Mr Santana, 58, . claims he was sacked after giving Mr Franco a poor grade for only . attending two out of his 14 classes. He said other professors gave Mr Franco high grades and the university wanted high profile celebrities on their courses. He accused the university of doing 'everything in its power to curry favour with James Franco.' Mr Santana has since labelled the actor a 'bully' who uses his celebrity status to punish anyone who doesn’t do his bidding,' the New York Post reports. Mr Santana is now seeking damages in Manhattan Supreme Court against Mr Franco, who played a rock climber who amputated his own arm in the blockbuster film 127 Hours. Nominated: Mr Franco was up for an Oscar for his portrayal of a trapped hiker who hacked off his own arm in '127 Hours' Mr Santana, who was sacked in September 2011, said he 'didn’t deserve to be on the receiving end of those falsehoods,' the Post reports. 'I was outraged that someone with his attendance record at NYU had the audacity to make those statements.' Mr Franco had told reporters that he 'didn’t feel like I needed to waste my time with a bad teacher', according the Post. He reportedly claimed the university would not have sacked Mr Santana just for giving him a 'D' grade. Mr Franco reportedly told several media outlets in April that Mr Santana 'wasn’t fired, he was asked not to come back after three years because they didn’t think he was a good teacher.'Mr Santana claims the actor defamed him despite having access to teaching records which showed he had received 'overwhelmingly positive' evaluations from students. Mr Franco was later hired by the university as a lecturer on how to adapt poetry into short films. Earlier this year a student at the . university posted a photo of Mr Franco fast asleep during a lecture at . Columbia University. He was also reported to have been spotted asleep in . the school library. Higher learning: Mr Franco was taking classes at NYU's Tische School of the Arts in Manhattan . Mr Santana said Mr Franco joined his class 'Directing the Actor II,' last year. He was the only professor to give Mr Franco a poor grade but denied he had a problem with the actor. Mr Franco has directed 13 short films and documentaries with his most recent, called 'The Broken Tower,' being described as 'quite tedious' by Variety magazine. James Franco has shown a keen interest in advancing his education, even as he continues to work as an actor and director.","Teacher sues actor for damages after he made 'disparaging and inaccurate public statements,' about him .

"Savers investing in the new tax-free Super Isas are being blocked from receiving the most attractive interest rates, it has emerged. Just days ahead of the launch of the Chancellor’s flagship savings policy, many banks and building societies are preventing customers from transferring existing Isa funds into the new top-rate, easy access accounts. Pensioners and savers who had hoped to switch to the highest rates to boost their income could now find themselves denied the chance to make more than £500 extra a year. Pensioners and savers who had hoped to switch to the highest rates to boost their income could now find themselves denied the chance to make more than £500 extra a year . Under current rules, savers can transfer up to £11,880 into a tax-free Individual Savings Account (Isa) – only half of which can be cash. The new super-Isa, which launches on July 1, will allow savers to put in up to £15,000 a year however they want, either in cash or shares. Customers would normally be allowed to transfer money held at rival banks and building societies into their Isa. But the huge rise in the allowance has prompted many providers to end the practice. Nationwide, National Savings & Investments, Derbyshire, Cheshire and Skipton building societies are among those who have already slammed the door shut on Isa transfers on some accounts – and there are fears more will follow. The lenders are saying that only new money can be invested in the super-Isa at table-topping rates of at least 1.5 per cent – worth at least £150 a year on £10,000 savings. Savers would then have to keep nest eggs in other accounts on existing Isa rates – which average at about 1.18 per cent but are as low as 0.5 per cent. Careful older savers who have invested the maximum allowed into a cash Isa every year since they were introduced in 1999 would have saved at least £57,540 by April 5 this year, excluding interest earned. On an interest rate of 0.5 per cent, they would earn £512.70 on all of their tax-free savings across the year. But at the higher rate they would earn £1,088.10 – £576.60 more. It comes just days ahead of the launch of Chancellor George Osborne's flagship savings policy . Although HM Revenue & Customs says all Isa accounts must allow customers to transfer their cash whenever they want, providers are not obliged to accept it. Sue Hannums, co-founder of Savingschampion, said: ‘With rates as low as they are, savers are absolutely desperate for a decent rate. ‘So you can understand their outrage when they see one, but which bans transfers. If you’re a building society, this is a commercial decision – it’ll simply cost you more to take on the bigger balances.’ One option for savers is to cash in some of their existing cash Isa money, put it into their bank account, and apply for the full £15,000 rate at the more generous rate. But this can be an administrative nightmare – taking weeks to complete and losing interest in the process. Skipton Building Society said record interest in its 1.5 per cent Bonus Cash Isa had triggered its curb on access. If it allowed transfers, it would not be able to offer the rate to as many customers, it said. NS&I, which is state-backed and guarantees 100 per cent of savers’ money, said accepting transfers into its popular 1.5 per cent Direct Cash Isa would risk breaching Government rules about how it raises money from the public. Kevin Mountford of price comparison site Moneysupermarket said: ‘We have created a savings wilderness, where banks and building societies simply don’t want savers’ cash. It means consumers need to be much more aggressive and change on even the smallest interest rate difference – even half a percentage point. ‘My concern is that unhappy savers hunting for higher rates will end up taking on more risk with a retail bond, say, or peer to peer, and won’t get the protection they want or need.’ Meanwhile, providers continue to cut rates for new savers. Newcastle Building Society has trimmed the rate on its cash Isa from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent. Yorkshire Building Society’s e-Isa and Instant Isa is falling to 1 per cent from 1.25 per cent next month.","Savers investing in tax-free Super Isas being denied healthy interest rates .

"Two suicide bombers detonated their explosives outside a historic church in Pakistan today killing 85 people in the deadliest-ever attack on the country's Christian minority. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing in the city of Peshawar, saying it would continue to target non-Muslims until the US stopped drone attacks in the country's remote tribal region. The latest drone strike came on Sunday when missiles hit a pair of compounds in the North Waziristan tribal area, killing six suspected militants, Pakistani intelligence officials said. Explosion: A Pakistani man helps an injured victim of a suicide attack at a church in Peshawar, Pakistan . Mourning: People gather at the site of suicide attack on a church in Peshawa this morning . The attack on All Saints Church, which also wounded 140 people, underlines the threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban at a time when the government is seeking a peace deal with the militants. The attack occurred as hundreds of worshippers were coming out of the church in the city's Kohati Gate district after services to get a free meal of rice. 'There were blasts and there was hell for all of us,' said Nazir John, who was at the church with at least 400 other worshippers. 'When I got my senses back, I found nothing but smoke, dust, blood and screaming people. I saw severed body parts and blood all around.' Help: A Pakistani Christian carries an injured woman on her arrival at the hospital . A relative cries after the victims of twin suicide bombings that targeted the Church are moved to a hospital . People stand beside the coffins to be used to repatriate bodies of the victims of the twin suicide bombings . A woman mourns the death of her relatives following the explosion which also injured about 140 people . Survivors wailed and hugged each other in the wake of the blasts. The white walls of the church, which first opened in the late 1800s, were pockmarked with holes caused by ball bearings or other metal objects contained in the bombs to cause maximum damage. Blood stained the floor and was splashed on the walls. Plates filled with rice were scattered across the ground. The attack was carried out by a pair of suicide bombers who detonated their explosives almost simultaneously. Authorities found body parts and have been trying to determine their age. The blasts killed 85 people and wounded another 140. The dead included women and children. The number of casualties from the blasts was so high that the hospital was running out of caskets for the dead and beds for the wounded, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, a former information minister of surrounding Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province who was on the scene. Protest:  Members of the Pakistani Christian minority burn tyres as they shout slogans against the bombing . Grief: Relatives clutch the coffins of their loved ones following the explosion today. Hospitals have run out of caskets for the dead and beds for the wounded . Tragedy: Coffins are lined up near the church as relatives flock to the scene to mourn their dead . Pockmarked holes caused by ball bearings contained in the bombs to cause maximum damage are seen . 'This is the deadliest attack against Christians in our country,' said Irfan Jamil, bishop of the eastern city of Lahore. One of the wounded, John Tariq, who lost his father in the attack, asked of the attackers, 'What have we done wrong to these people? Why are we being killed?' Ahmad Marwat, who identified himself as the spokesman for the Jundullah wing of the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack. 'All non-Muslims in Pakistan are our target and they will remain our target as long as America fails to stop drone strikes in our country,' Marwart told The Associated Press by telephone from an undisclosed location. Agony: This man's pain is clear to see as another man helps walk to safety . Fury: Christian men shout anti-government slogans in protest against the bombings . Jundullah has previously claimed responsibility for attacks on minority Shiite Muslims in the southwestern Baluchistan province. Hard-line Sunni extremists like the Taliban consider Shiites to be heretics. The bishop in Peshawar, Sarfarz Hemphray, announced a three-day mourning period in response to the church attack and blamed the government and security agencies for failing to protect the country's Christians. 'If the government shows will, it can control this terrorism,' said Hemphray. 'We have been asking authorities to enhance security, but they haven't paid any heed.' Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack in a statement sent to reporters, saying, 'The terrorists have no religion and targeting innocent people is against the teachings of Islam and all religions.' 'Such cruel acts of terrorism reflect the brutality and inhumane mindset of the terrorists,' he said.","Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing in Peshawar .

"Police in Waco, Texas, who set up an online sex sting were shocked when their Internet post advertising child sex got more than 180 responses in just 12 hours. The operation, which had detectives posing as minors online, resulted in the arrests of 20 people, age 19 to 63. They were busted after arranging what they believed would be meetings to have sex with children. When they arrived, however, they found cops and handcuffs. 'It's really just about every kind of weird sicko you can think of,' McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara told the San Antonio Express-News. Cops nabbed Raymond Shattuck, 29, (left) at a H.E.B. grocery store. John Hinson, 25, (center) was busted at Walmart. Chelsea Robinson, 22, (right) was arrested at Home Depot .

Charles Thiel, 19, (center) one of the youngest suspects, was busted at a gas station. Christopher Aguilar, 33, (right) was arrested at his home . McNamara said his detectives were horrified by the massive response to an online posting they made that advertised a minor wanting to have sex with adults. Of the 180 responses that cops got in 12 hours, many followed through and exchanged messages with detectives . According to the Waco Tribune, detectives were so busy responding to the messages that they continued the exchanges even during off hours when they were away from work. 'The response was incredible; these creeps came out of the woodwork,' Sheriff McNamara told the Tribune. In the end, 20 people - 18 men and two women - from three counties agreed to meetings with the detectives posing as vulnerable children. The law: McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara branded the 20 suspects 'weird sickos' and said he was surprised how easy it was to snare so many of them .

'I think it’s extremely dangerous. These people are shopping in the same places we shop,' the sheriff said. All 20 of the people arrested are dangerous 'child predators,' he added. They are charged with felony online solicitation of minors. Authorities said they are trying to add more charges as well.

"A nurse has had her visa application rejected because her son has autism and, according to the Immigration Department, would be a 'burden on the Australian health system'. Maria Sevilla has lived in Australia since 2007, when she arrived in the Queensland town of Townsville - a single mother wanting to become a nurse, in the hope of finding a better life for herself and for her baby. Her son was diagnosed with autism at the age of two, six months after they arrived in Australia, but Ms Sevilla says 'Tyrone is not a burden, he is a joy.' Ms Sevilla 'worked for years', juggling part time jobs while she studied. She has worked her way up and has been promoted to a clinical position at Townsville Hospital, working hard to help rehabilitate stroke and amputee patients. Scroll down for video . Tyrone (pictured) and his mother Maria Sevilla have had their visa application rejected and are facing deportation back to the Philippines, for the sole reason that Tyrone has Autism . Ms Sevilla, a single mum and nurse in the Queensland town of Townsville, has lived in Australia with her son since 2007. She says it is the only place he knows, and he only knows English . Being a nurse was not possible in the Philippines, where university is only possible for 'the well-off families.' 'Being in Australia changed everything for Tyrone and I, being a nurse was always a dream,' Ms Sevilla told Daily Mail Australia. 'Coming here and becoming a nurse has given me assurance for our future and a sense of fulfilment.' But Ms Sevilla explains the life she worked so hard to build for her little family could be taken away at any moment. 'All of it could be taken away because the government thinks that children with autism are going to be more of a cost to Australian society than a benefit – but that's just not true. Ms Sevilla has made a petition and is appealing the decision to send herself and her son back to the Philippines - a place where she has no family and no network of support. 'Everything is here for us. My work, our family, our home is here, Tyrone's school...' Ms Sevilla's application for a Skilled-Region visa subclass 489 has been rejected by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection due to Tyrone's autism. The rejection letter states that Tyrone 'has a severe autism spectrum disorder, a condition that is likely to be permanent in nature'. It stated that he would likely need special education services, state disability services, Commonwealth disability services and residential care services. 'Tyrone would be likely to result in a significant cost to the Australian community in the areas of health care,' the rejection letter said. A spokeswoman for Mr Morrison released a short statement to news.com.au about Mrs Sevilla's case. 'The visa was refused because the child did not meet the health requirement,' the spokeswoman said. 'The applicant was advised of her options for independent review of the decision. People can only seek ministerial intervention once a refusal decision has been upheld at merits review'. Tyrone is a 'very cheeky, happy little boy' who is thriving at his specialised school in Townsville . Ms Sevilla is appealing the decision – fighting for the life she has worked so hard for. But she says she isn't angry about the decision – she's sad. 'I feel sad, not angry, that they don't know or understand what Autism is. 'As a mother of a child with Autism, I know it isn't a disease you have to cure, but one you have to manage. 'I have received so many messages from mums of children with Autism; it's very prevalent in Australia,' Ms Sevilla told Daily Mail Australia. 'Tyrone is a happy child with full of life attitude and can lighten the mood of a room with his presence. 'The idea that he can't contribute because of his condition is just wrong. People with autism can be excellent at a whole range of things; he just needs to be given a chance!' Tyrone loves bike riding, scootering, water – and Tiger Woods! 'He loves to watch YouTube videos of Tiger Woods and to borrow his uncle's golf clubs and pretend to be Tiger!' Ms Sevilla is sad, not angry, that the Immigration Department does not understand Autism, and says that her son deserves a chance . Due to Tyrone's autism, even minor changes to their routines troubles him, meaning having their deportation would cause enormous issues for the little boy. 'Tyrone notices any change to his routine. Even if I drive him a different route to school, he'll notice and react with a tantrum. But once you calm him down he's fine. 'But if we're asked to go back to the Philippines, we'd have to start from scratch. Tyrone only knows English. He only knows life in Australia.' When asked about their possible deportation, Maria is lost for words. 'I have no answer to that question. I can't think about it. 'I can't see myself going home. I probably just have to cross that bridge when I get there. Ms Sevilla lives with her brother and his wife, with her mother only fifteen minutes away - or as Ms Sevilla explains it 'just a phone call away'. They are a crucial support for her and adored by Tyrone. Ms Sevilla says there is no support for them in Tyrone, compared to Australia, where her beloved mother, brother, sister-in-law, aunty, uncle and cousins live. Tyrone is very happy with them, and are a crucial support for Ms Sevilla, including caring for Tyrone when Ms Sevilla is on night shift. 'I have found a better life for my family in Australia with my close family. My mother, stepfather and Tyrone's uncle and aunty are so important for Tyrone and I. 'They are a big help, as any single mum would understand. 'But to go back - the Philippines is a third world country. We have opportunities here. Ms SEvilla (pictured second from the left, in pink) and her son Tyrone (centre, in blue cap) say they have 'never felt lonely' in Australia, despite their challenges, because of all the support they have been given . The mother has been 'overwhelmed' by the support since she made her change.org petition, and hopes the Immigration Department reconsider their decision to deport her son. 'I'm hoping for compassion form the tribunal and from the minister for Immigration. 'I'm wondering if they can change the immigration law about people in situations like this. There must be other people who have been affected by it before me.' Ms Sevilla says that through all her challenges, Australia has been a safe, caring place for her and her son. 'I have a lot of support from the community. I have my family. I have never felt alone.'

"Nearly every rumoured feature of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus turned out to be true, except one – the sapphire screen. Instead Apple unveiled 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets that both feature ‘ion-strengthened glass,’ during last week's launch. And now reports claim the sapphire screens were set to be included on the new devices, but the plans had to be abandoned when they kept failing drop tests. Scroll down for video . Sapphire screens were rumoured to be a feature on the iPhone 6 (left) and iPhone 6 Plus, (right) but the new handsets feature ‘ion-strengthened glass instead. Source claims Apple had to abandon its sapphire screens after they repeatedly cracked during tests carried out by Apple suppliers . Apple already uses sapphire crystal in its iSight Camera lens on the iPhone 5S (pictured) Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. IDC analyst Danielle Levitas told VentureBeat that recent supplier checks spotted ‘several reports of the sapphire failures.’ During standard drop tests, the screen was said to have repeatedly cracked, forcing Apple to resort to another method. VentureBeat additionally reports that the decision to switch screens was made just weeks before the launch event. A sapphire screen, however, was included on the Apple Watch and it is thought the smaller, 1.5-inch display wasn’t as fragile as the larger displays. A recent survey from usell.com found that the sapphire screen was the most wanted new feature on the next-generation devices, among 45.5 per cent of customers. This was higher than the number of people who wanted an improved battery life and larger screen. Mobile phone insurance firm, Protect Your Bubble, has seen a 31 per cent increase in damage claims across the UK over the past year, and this has been linked to weak screens. The only full sapphire-screened mobile phone currently available is the Vertu Signature Touch, a super-deluxe model that costs £6,750 in the UK and $11,300 in the US. Aside from the drop test claims, Apple is also thought to have abandoned sapphire screens because of the technology’s price. It’s estimated that a traditional glass screen costs a manufacturer around £1.80 per phone; a sapphire screen is believed to cost around £18. By the time that extra cost has filtered down to the consumers on the high street, customers could be looking at a phone that’s £100 more expensive than a normal glass-fronted model.

Before the launch, a YouTube user claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it. Marques Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claimed last month to have got the screen from well-known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video showcasing the display. 'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' Mr Brownlee said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.' The glass is also extremely high-quality, Mr Brownlee noted: 'There’s absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.' Apple already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front display is made of Gorilla Glass.","Sapphire screens were rumoured to be a feature on the iPhone 6 .

"It may previously have been mainly associated with being a staple of smoky strip clubs, but pole dancing has undergone something of a transformation in recent years. For huge numbers of people across the world, the demanding craft is now more likely to be seen as a workout activity, including many of those who attended the 3rd Annual Pole Expo in Las Vegas. The expo, held at the Palms Casino, offered workshops on everything from strength conditioning to lap dancing. Scroll down for video . Quinn McCrimmon, front, and others take part in a workshop at the Pole Expo in Las Vegas. Pole dancers from around the world gathered in the city this month to swap ideas and learn tricks of the trade . Roz Mayes, centre, teaches a group how to 'twerk' during a workshop at the Pole Expo in Las Vegas . Fawnia Dietrich, who got her start as a stripper but has since launched a Las Vegas studio offering fitness-focused pole classes, said: 'Most people that pole dance in the studios are everyday women, not strippers. 'It has that connotation of sensuality or eroticism that makes it a little more fun.' Vendors at the event sold sparking two-piece pole dancing outfits as well as the poles themselves and heels. Some of the best dancers however decide against wearing the stilettos and opt instead to go barefoot so they can better point their toes and stick to the pole. Showing off the splits and gravity defying handstands off the side of the pole, their athletic performances are more akin to an Olympic gymnast on the uneven bars than a burlesque show. Dietrich said her students have many different reasons for choosing pole dancing. Some want to build upper body strength and lose weight while others may want to surprise their husband with an anniversary dance.

"A Chicago police officer has been charged in the death of a 95-year-old World War II veteran who was shot repeatedly with a bean-bag gun at a nursing home last year. Park Forest Police officer Craig Taylor, 43, was charged last Wednesday with a felony count of reckless conduct in the death of John Wrana. Taylor was released on his own recognizance Monday after a brief hearing. According to a court document filed by the Cook County prosecutors, Taylor and other officers were called to Victory Centre where Wrana lived on July 26, 2013, after a staff member reported Wrana was threatening other residents and was combative with emergency workers attempting to take him to the hospital. Scroll down for video . Charged: Park Forest Police officer Craig Taylor, 43 (pictured center) was charged last Wednesday with a felony count of reckless conduct in the death of 95-year-old John Wrana . Tragic: John Wrana (pictured with his late wife, Helen) died after being Tasered and shot with bean-bag rounds in July 2013 . When police arrived, they were told Wrana, who had served with the U.S. Army Air Corps in Burma during World War II, had struck the emergency worker with his cane. Chicago Tribune reported Wrana, who was about a week off his 96th birthday, had become belligerent and combative after refusing medical treatment for a urinary tract infection. When officers entered Wrana's room they saw him holding a long metal object that they thought looked like a knife or machete. It was actually a metal shoe horn. A short time later, Wrana grabbed a knife, according to prosecutors, and threatened to throw the knife at them and then 'cut' them, refusing their orders to drop the knife. One officer fired a Taser at Wrana, but the prongs of the weapon did not strike Wrana and when Wrana, still holding the knife, moved toward the officers, prosecutors contend that Taylor fired once with the bean-bag gun, paused and fired four more times. Charged: Prosecutors say Craig Taylor (center) was needlessly violent and didn't try to calm Wrana before shooting him . The Cook County medical examiner's office said Wrana died of internal bleeding and blunt force trauma and ruled his death a homicide. In the court document, prosecutors criticized the officers for even entering the room the second time because Wrana was alone and 'posed no threat to others', and said officers 'ignored' other options, including leaving the room and trying to 'calm him down through the closed door'. All the shots, according to prosecutors, were fired from no more than eight feet away, far closer than what prosecutors said the 'optimum distance' of 15 to 60 feet that are spelled out in training standards. Taylor, prosecutors said in the document, failed to consider, as he was trained to, what effects firing the bean bags at close range at a 95-year-old man might have. Scene: Wrana was shot at Victory Centre, an assisted living facility in South Chicago (pictured) In a statement, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, while acknowledging the difficult job that police officers have, said that in light of the 'other viable options to resolve this matter and the number of shots fired at this senior citizen at close range in rapid succession, we believe this officer's conduct to be reckless'. Taylor's attorney did not immediately return a call for comment. Nicholas Grapsas, an attorney representing Wrana's family, said no decision has been made about whether to file a lawsuit, but suggested the family has a strong case against Taylor and the other officers involved. 'I don't understand how anybody could say they couldn't have done anything they considered less lethal to a man 11 days shy of his 96th birthday sitting in his nursing home room,' he said. Park Forest police, who have said the officers acted as they did because they had no choice, did not immediately return a call for comment. Veteran: Wrana (pictured as a soldier) was honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Corps in the rank of a sergeant after fighting in India and Burma . Grapsas said last year that Wrana had been honorably discharged from the U.S. Air Corps in the rank of a sergeant after fighting in India and Burma. During his service in the Pacific, he was shot down once. After the war, the Massachusetts native moved to California and got into real estate before settling in Glenwood, Illinois. His wife of more than 30 years, Helen, passed away in 2005. The veteran lived with his 74-year-old stepdaughter, Sharon Mangerson, until his health took a turn for the worse. An autopsy found that the 95-year-old man died from internal bleeding after being shot in the stomach from a bean-bag gun. ‘The Japanese military couldn’t get him at the age he was touchable, in a uniform in the war,’ Grapsas told the Tribune last year. ‘It took 70 years later for the Park Forest police to do the job.’ Mangerson described the 95-year-old as a fiercely independent and vital man who still enjoyed playing cards. The Victory Centre is a 112-apartment supportive living community for adults 65 and older, according to its website.","John Wrana was shot dead with bean-bag rounds in his Chicago assisted living home in July last year .

"Disgraced Clippers owner Donald Sterling has spoken out for the first time since he was fined $2.5 million and banned for life by the NBA for racist comments that shocked the basketball community. Sterling spoke to Jason Binn of upmarket DuJour magazine, telling the publisher that he has no intention of selling the team and that he believes he could have avoided the controversy if he had paid Stiviano off. Speaking of reported former girlfriend V. Stiviano, who allegedly recorded and released audio of Sterling's tirade, Sterling said, 'I wish I had just paid her off.' Happier times: Donald Sterling, seen here with V. Stiviano in 2011, has said he believes he could have avoided his racism controversy if he'd 'just paid her off' Payroll: Stiviano lives in a million-dollar condo and is often seen out with ostentatious handbags, emerging from one of several luxury cars, all allegedly purchased by Sterling . The excerpt adds that Sterling 'expressed remorse' during the interview, but gave no further detail. Sterling also told Binn that he's not planning to do any further interviews on the subject - though he is willing to speak with Barbara Walters and to the NBA. Alleged interview: It's not clear how in-depth the 'exclusive discussion' Jason Binn (pictured) had with Donald Sterling delves into the V. Stiviano debacle . Jason Binn is the publisher of DuJour, once described by the New York Times as 'a magazine for the wealthy.' Subscribers must meet a criteria of wealth before they are added to the publication's mailing list. He also publishes such niche publications as The Hamptons and Ocean Drive. The National Basketball Association on Thursday launched its bid to oust Donald Sterling as owner of the Los Angeles Clippers for racist comments as a panel of 10 fellow team owners or their proxies unanimously agreed to proceed 'as expeditiously as possible,' the NBA said. The decision, reached during a telephone conference call of the NBA Board of Governors' advisory-finance committee, seemed to indicate a strong base of support among Sterling's fellow owners for his removal, as urged by league Commissioner Adam Silver. Silver on Tuesday declared Sterling banned from the NBA for life, fined him $2.5 million - the league maximum - and called on the 29 other club owners who make up the governing board to exercise their authority to force Sterling to sell the Clippers. The unprecedented move would require a three-fourths majority vote under the league's constitution and bylaws. If approved, the board could then go further still and vote to seize ownership of the team for the NBA itself to sell, cutting Sterling out of the negotiations. Embattled: Despite a lifetime ban from the NBA, Sterling has indicated that he has no intention to sell the Clippers . The decision came hours before sports network ESPN and other media reported Sterling has been battling prostate cancer. Reuters could not independently confirm the reports. Silver and at least two of the owners, including the interim chairman of the board, Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves, have expressed confidence they could muster the votes necessary to force a sale. The teams represented in Thursday's initial strategy session were Minnesota Timberwolves, the Miami Heat, the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Los Angeles Lakers, the New York Knicks, the Boston Celtics, the San Antonio Spurs, and Phoenix Suns, the Indiana Pacers and the Toronto Raptors. In a brief statement, the NBA said the panel discussed terminating Sterling's ownership and 'unanimously agreed to move forward as expeditiously as possible.' It said the panel would reconvene next week. The committee's decision was in line with an outpouring of support expressed by the owners as a whole for Silver following Tuesday's announcement of a ban. Saving face: V. Stiviano has been seen about town in numerous revealing ensembles, but rarely without a face-shielding visor . Constant scrutiny: Stiviano, seen here out the front of her home with a pet turtle, denies leaking the recorded audio . But experts have suggested that some of Sterling's fellow owners might be hesitant to support action they felt could set a precedent weakening their own future property rights. Sterling, who bought the Clippers in 1981 for $13 million when the team was based in San Diego, has not indicated whether he would relinquish ownership without putting up a fight. Experts have estimated that the franchise, which moved to Los Angeles in 1984, could now be worth as much as $1 billion, posing an enormous potential capital gains tax liability on Sterling if he were to sell the team. A number of legal scholars and sports business analysts have said they expect Sterling and the NBA to be on a collision course that will be fought out in court. 'The guy has a reputation for being highly litigious. I just can't possibly imagine him rolling over and handing the team over and not fighting back,' said Adam Schlatner, a sports business attorney and commercial litigator. Schlatner, who handles legal matters for the National Hockey League's New York Islanders' owner Charles Wang and has had dealings with clients involving the NBA, said the league might consider allowing Sterling to sell the team himself by a prescribed deadline. Estranged: Rochelle Sterling, Donald Sterling's wife, has publicly distanced herself from her husband, and is suing V. Stiviano . But he predicted that, one way or another, Sterling would end up severed from the Clippers and would realize that 'the franchise would not be economically viable if he continues to own it.' The scandal sparked outrage from fans and players, and numerous commercial sponsors pulled their support from the team before and after the NBA moved to expel Sterling. Sterling was banned from any further ties with his team or professional basketball, and stripped of his seat on the NBA governing board, days after two websites released audio recordings in which a voice said to be Sterling's is heard criticizing a female friend for 'associating with black people.' Silver said Tuesday that Sterling has acknowledged to the NBA that the recording was authentic but did not apologize. The sale of the Clippers could take weeks. According to NBA bylaws, Silver must present Sterling a written copy of any allegations justifying a forced sale within three days, and Sterling would have five days to answer. A special hearing of the Board of Governors, consisting of all the owners, would then be held on a date no more than 10 days after Sterling's reply. The prospect of Sterling's ouster led several luminaries of sports and show business to signal interest in buying the team. Among them were talk show host turned media mogul Oprah Winfrey, Hollywood executive David Geffen, computer technology titan Larry Ellison, former Los Angeles Lakers star Earvin 'Magic' Johnson and boxing promoter Oscar De La Hoya.","Clippers owner Donald Sterling has spoken out about his racism controversy .

"This is the first picture of the grandfather who poured beer over a crying toddler in a pub because he ‘just wanted the child to be quiet’. Danny Polak, 64, lost his temper when a 15-month-old boy’s tears disturbed his lunch in the Ernehale pub in Arnold, Nottinghamshire. He soaked the toddler in ale and then kicked the boy's mother, Rachel Atkin, in the backside when she went to confront him. Anger: Grandfather Danny Polak, 64, poured ale over a crying child because the boy disturbed his lunch . Mr Polak was fined £355 and ordered to pay £50 in compensation, and admitted two counts of assault, when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Monday . Today Mr Polak apologised for his actions but said he had been treated too harshly. ‘I’m sorry about it. I had gone out for lunch and the baby was crying for a good 15 minutes. I just wanted them to be quiet,’ the grandfather said. Miss Atkin, 25, had gone to the Ernehale with her son and sister-in-law, Rebecca White, on the afternoon of June 11 this year after a morning at a soft play centre. After they took seats at a table next . to Mr Polak and his wife, Miss Atkin went to order food at the bar, . leaving Miss White to look after the child. Assault: Danny Polak claims the child had been 'crying for 15 minutes' when he poured the beer over his head at the Ernehale pub . Catherine Picardo, prosecuting, said that the child: 'started to whine as though he was missing his mother.' 'The . defendant, with a half-full pint in his hand, approached the table and . poured it over the baby’s head, which caused him to scream.' Ms . Picardo told the court that, when confronted by Miss Atkin, Mr Polak . told the mother: 'You shouldn’t bring kids in a pub,’ to which Miss . Atkin responded by throwing her drink in his face, saying: 'See how you . like it.' The court heard that Miss Atkin then turned her back on Polak, who kicked her in the bottom and left the pub. After the ruling on case, Mr Polak defended himself saying he did not intend to pour the beverage over the child’s head. ‘There was very little drink in the glass and I didn’t aim at the baby. I feel I have been treated very harshly. It has made my wife poorly. ‘I’ve not been back to the pub since.’ Miss Picardo said: 'It is quite shocking behaviour as it involved a 15-month old child. 'It took place in a family pub where children are entitled to be.' Brawl: When the boy's mother Rebecca Atkin was alerted to Mr Polak's action she confronted him and threw her own drink in his face after which he kicked her in the backside . Maria Bines, defending, said: 'He was having a quite drink with his wife. He thought rather than go to the bar, the mother should have stayed to attend her son. 'He threw the beer in the general direction of the table where the females were sitting. 'He accepts that beer went over the baby and that his actions were reckless. 'He accepts he kicked her in the bottom. It wasn’t done in malice, it was just so he could have the last word. 'He accepts that what he did was wrong. He is not proud of what he has done, and accepts that it will have to be punished.' Mr Polak, of Sherwood, Nottingham, told . police that he had been angry because the noisy child had forced him and . his wife to abandon plans to have lunch at the pub, which they only did . once a month. Guilty: Mr Polak, 64, admitted two counts of assault when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court . Speaking shortly after the incident, Miss Atkin said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was so shocked. 'I just stood there for a second and then I ran up to his table and shouted at him. 'I could hear my son crying when I was at the bar and my friend said he’d been shouting about it before he poured the drink over my son. 'But it’s no excuse to pour a drink on him, it just made him cry even more. 'It’s just scary to think someone would do that to a baby that is crying.' After the case the boy’s father Tony White, 30, blasted the ‘very lenient’ sentence. He said: ‘It’s not enough. All my son was doing was crying and this happened to him. It is a very lenient sentence. ‘It has really affected my partner. She won’t go to another pub as she’s worried it could happen again. ‘It has really shaken her up. That’s why I expected the punishment would have been more severe.’","Danny Polak, 64, lost his temper in Nottinghamshire pub and soaked a crying baby in beer .

"The rotting carcass of a mysterious-looking 'sea monster' has been found washed ashore on a New Zealand beach. A YouTube video filmed by Elizabeth Ann on Pukehina Beach shows the half-buried head of the carcass with jagged teeth and gaping jaws. Most of the rest of the creature's body is missing. Scroll down for video . The 30-foot long carcass of the mysterious sea creature is seen almost buried under the sand on the New Zealand beach in the Bay of Plenty. Only its head and what appear to be flippers are visible . A close-up of the creature's gaping mouth shows its fearsome jagged teeth. This image is one of a series of photographs taken by YouTube user Elizabeth Anne on the Pukehina beach off the coast of New Zealand . A gigantic sea beast measuring 55ft was discovered washed up on a beach in Guangdong, China in 2011. It was found wrapped in fishing lines, leading locals to suspect that fishermen cut it free from their nets because it was too big to haul in. It was thought to have weighed around 4.5tons. Marine experts claimed it is likely to have come from a whale. Mysterious masses of marine flesh have also occasionally washed ashore on beaches around the world. Dubbed 'blobs' they are so badly decomposed there is rarely enough material to make a definitive identification . The strange 30-foot long carcass washed up off the coast of the Bay of Plenty coast in New Zealand after storms in last month. The coastline is about 120-miles south east from the city of Auckland. Ann filmed the discovery and posted the video to YouTube. The description said: 'Can anyone identify what it is?' 'It is has a huge head and teeth with rudimentary flippers.' 'It seems about 9M in length but the lower part of the body is probably mainly entrails from an attack.' An idyllic scene - until you spot the giant sea monster in the foreground. One marine expert believes the carcass is that of a killer whale, an animal that is commonly found around the Bay of Plenty, the location where the beast was found . The creature's mouth, and skin around it resemble a bizarre prehistoric beast. Other suggestions as to what creature is include a giant moray eel and a saltwater crocodile . The creature was found washed ashore Pukehina beach in the Bay of Plenty off the coast of New Zealand . On another video by Elizabeth Ann, she added: 'The huge marine creature washed up after a storm. 'It had been attacked by something in the water. 'The locals are not sure what it is although it has stimulated lots of discussion.' Suggestions as to what the creature could be include a saltwater crocodile, a giant moray eel, a dolphin or a dinosaur. Photos of the animal have been sent to the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Kelly Tarlton's Aquarium for identification. Marine mammal expert Anton van Helden rejected all these ideas and told New Zealand's Channel 3 that the creature's fin structure is similar to that of a killer whale. Killer whales are common in and around Fiji and the Bay of Plenty. Further tests are being carried out to confirm this theory. The sea monster found off the coast of New Zealand is said to be around nine metres long. It has large flippers, seen below the head, but the rest of the animal's body had been torn out . The bizarre creature has large, jagged blackened teeth, which experts believe could help identify it as a killer whale .

"An elderly man suffering from dementia died after he was locked out of a care home in the middle of the night. Gerry Green, 83, who also had a heart condition, died in hospital shortly after he was seen trying to get back into the council-run Kenrick Centre, in Birmingham, at 4.30am. Birmingham City Council has ordered an independent investigation into the case following a complaint by the pensioner's son, Steve Green. 'Neglected': Gerry Green, who suffered from dementia, died after he was locked out of a care home in the middle of the night . Complaint: Steve Green (left), holding a photograph of his father, believes that staff neglected the vulnerable elderly man (right), who was seen trying to get back into the care home at 4.30am . Mr Green, 52, believes that staff at the home neglected his father, and wants to know how he was able to wander outside on his own. Mr Green usually looked after his father himself at home, but he arranged for the pensioner to stay at the Kendrick Centre for two weeks while he went on holiday. On April 2 this year, CCTV footage showed the elderly man trying to get back into the home after wandering out. Staff found him in the grounds after the alarms went off, and took him to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he died. An investigation began in April, but Mr Green said he was still awaiting answers. Devoted: Gerry Green, pictured as a child (left), was married to his wife Ida (right) for 50 years. She died in 2004 . He said: 'If he was found in my back . garden in the middle of the night, I'm sure somebody would have had me . in court or social services would want to know what the hell I was . playing at. 'To be outside is total neglect. There should be no way a person with dementia can get out of a building. 'It's . a disgusting state of affairs. I'm absolutely shocked by it and to . think that I had faith in them to care for my dad is awful.' Mr Green, of Bartley Green, West Midlands, said his father had gone for a walk along a corridor at the home and got out through a fire door.' Relaxing: Gerry and Ida Green enjoy a day out. Their only son, Steve, has demanded answers after Gerry died shortly after being locked out of a care home . Concerns: Steve Green said the death of his father Gerry (right), pictured with wife Ida (left), was 'a disgusting state of affairs' He added: 'The alarms went off and they said they found him quickly. 'But why didn't they just get him back to bed before he went outside? He'd have been back to sleep in ten minutes. Alarm: Staff found Gerry Green, with his wife Ida, in the grounds of the care home and took him to hospital, where he died . 'If he'd died in his bed that's fair enough, that's life. But not outside, like a tramp. 'I was told Dad was seen on CCTV walking up and down two to three times trying to get back in. 'By the time they found him he was probably almost dead.' Mr Green also alleges that care home staff failed to give his father his medication, including a sleeping tablet, on the day he died. 'Having a heart condition it must have been a shock for him being locked out at 4.30 in the morning,' Mr Green added. 'I don't think he would be dead now if it wasn't for that.' Mr Green cared for his father after his mother Ida died from a heart attack in 2004, aged 78. The couple were married for 50 years and Mr Green was their only child. A spokesman for the council said: 'We wish to express sympathy with Mr Green's family. 'Upon receiving the complaint we spoke to Mr Green and agreed to commission an independent investigator to look into the case. 'The investigation is currently ongoing so it would be inappropriate to make any further comment.'

"A three-year-old girl who was fighting for life after a house fire which killed her mother and four siblings has died. Maheen Shakoor had been in a critical condition in the burns units at the Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford since being transferred there after the blaze in Harlow, Essex. Her mother, doctor Sabah Usmani, brothers Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, 9, and Rayyan, six, and 12-year-old sister Hira died in their end-of-terrace house in Barn Mead in the early hours of Monday. Maheen Shakoor (third from left) died three days after the fire which killed her sister Hira (right) and brothers Rayyan (left), Muneeb (second from left) and Sohaib (front). They are pictured with their father . Father Abdul Shakoor, also a doctor, suffered minor injuries as he fought to rescue his family from the blaze. A spokesman for the Princess Alexandra Hospital, where Dr Shakoor worked and where Maheen was initially taken, said: 'None of us can come close to understanding his suffering and the terrible loss of Maheen, Rayyan, Muneeb, Sohaib, Hira and his wife Sabah.' The statement continued: 'On behalf of all our staff at Princess Alexandra Hospital, we extend our deepest sympathy to Dr Shakoor. 'All of us have been saddened by this tragedy and as a close-knit hospital community, many of us knew Dr Shakoor and have been overwhelmed by what has happened. 'Our book of condolence, which is available for staff to sign in our hospital, is being filled with the most heartfelt and genuine messages which are truly humbling. 'Our thoughts and our prayers are with our dear friend and colleague.' Tragic: Essex Police initially suspected an arson attack but it is now thought that the fire was a tragic accident . The family  moved to the . rented house a year ago from Winchester, Hampshire. They were originally from Pakistan but moved to the UK in 2009. Dr Shakoor, 45, an endocrinologist and hospital registrar, suffered severe smoke inhalation as he fought to save his family. He was transferred from the Princess . Alexandra Hospital in Harlow to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford to be . close to Maheen. Tests carried out at the scene of the fire suggest that the blaze may have started accidentally. Police have refused to rule out the possibility that the mother and her children died in an arson attack. However, early results suggest the blaze started in the lounge at the rear of the house and that no accelerant, such as petrol, was used. Doctors: Abdul Shakour (left), pictured with his wife Sabah Usmani (right), fought to try to save his family . Terrifying: Black marks on the wall at the rear of the house show how the blaze damaged the property . Detective Superintendent Rob Vinson, of Essex Police, said officers were continuing to investigate 'many lines of inquiry'. Forensic work at the property is . nearing completion and experts have so far found no evidence that an . accelerant was used to spark the blaze. Police said investigators could not . yet draw final conclusions but the possibility of a tragic accident is . now considered increasingly likely. Mr Vinson said: 'We know already from . the fire service and our own findings that temperatures would have been . extremely high, with thick toxic smoke permeating the house. 'Initial indications show that the fire appears to have taken hold in the lounge area, which is at the rear of the property. 'The ferocity of the blaze has made the forensic work more challenging.' Sealed off: Police placed a cordon around the scene of the fire as their investigation into the suspected arson got under way . Devastating: A close-up view of an upstairs window with the glass missing. The frame is also charred . Mr Vinson urged residents and bystanders to come forward urgently to help establish what happened. 'Although we have spoken with many people, there are still those who have not made contact with us,' he said. 'Very probably they feel they have no . information and do not want to waste police time, but, in reality, if . you were at or near the scene of this incident we need you to come . forward urgently. 'Naturally local residents are . concerned about what happened and this investigation will not end until . we have exhausted every line of inquiry.' Work has begun to board up and secure the Shakoor family home. Family friend Parvez Hamid, 43, who lives nearby, said the fact that a Ford Focus parked nearby was set alight at about the same time as the house fire raised doubts in his mind that it could be accidental. He said his first thoughts were with Dr Shakoor, but he added: 'Of course, we want to know what happened and how the fire started and the whole community will work with the police to help establish that.'

Inquests into the deaths of Maheen's mother and siblings were opened and adjourned at Chelmsford Coroner's Court on Wednesday. The short hearing was told that the . bodies of all five members of the family had been released and a funeral . could be held in days. Coroner’s officer Laura Howarde . confirmed that Dr Shakoor had been through the heartbreaking task of . confirming the identity of the five dead members of his beloved family. Deputy coroner’s officer, Eleanor . McGann, said it had been a 'terrible fire' and asked for her sympathy to . be passed on to Dr Shakoor. Dr Shakoor's friend Abdul Khaliq, a . taxi driver, said the father had spoken of moving the family out of . their rented house to a permanent address elsewhere in Harlow. A white forensics tent is set up at the scene and a special fire sniffer dog can be seen with its handler . Mr Khaliq said: 'He had spoken at the mosque about how he would like to buy a house in the area. 'He planned to settle down in Harlow.' Mr Khaliq said that he saw Dr Shakoor only hours before the blaze as they prayed at the Harlow Islamic Centre on Sunday evening. He added: “That evening I was sitting and praying with him and his children. 'He was a regular at the mosque with his family who were always very well behaved. 'He shook my hand before he left. It is a complete mystery why this has happened. 'We pray five times a day and every time we are praying for him and his family.'

"It has been one of London's most familiar sights for more than a century, as instantly recognisable to visitors as the red telephone box or the Tube stop. But whether the distinctive black cab will continue to come off the assembly line in years to come is now in question. Coventry-based manufacturer Manganese Bronze, which makes the London taxi, is to appoint administrators and faces an uncertain future. Warning light? The maker of the distinctive London taxi is to appoint administrators after it failed to secure a funding boost from one of its largest shareholders . Recognisable: A black taxi cab makes its way over Westminster Bridge in London. Manganese Bronze's London Taxi Company division has made more than 100,000 vehicles since 1948 . The group made the announcement after it failed to secure a funding boost from one of its largest shareholders. Manganese . was reportedly in talks with Chinese private car maker Geely, which . owns a 20 per cent stake in the firm, over a £15million loan. But the group said it had been unable to secure funding with various parties and will bring in administrators. It said it 'remained hopeful' that the business would survive. Motorised . taxis first appeared in London at the end of the 19th century. There . are now more than 20,000 licensed cabs serving the capital. Funding blow: Manganese was reportedly in talks with Chinese private automaker Geely, which owns a 20 per cent stake in the firm, over a £15million loan . Distinctive: A London taxi driver rests on the bonnet of his vehicle as he takes a rest in 2009. Future production of the black cab has been thrown into doubt, although Manganese insists it is business as usual . The decision to appoint administrators comes after a torrid few months for Manganese, which employs almost 300 staff in its London Taxi Company division. Earlier this month, the group recalled 400 black cabs due to a steering box fault. It . said it had discovered a defect with new steering boxes in its TX4 . models, which were introduced in production at its Coventry factory in . late February. The . fault came to light after two cab drivers reported problems with . steering, although there had been no crashes or injuries as a result.

Better view: A London cabbie peers from his window to survey the route ahead in this picture, taken circa 1960 . Shiny model: A new London taxi goes on display at the 1958 Commercial Motor Show at Earls Court . Manganese has been trying to contact drivers of the affected vehicles to make sure they are taken off the road. Before . the administration announcement, it had warned that recalling and . suspending sales of the vehicle would have a 'material and detrimental' impact on its cashflow. In . its statement today, Manganese said that the group would continue to . operate during the administration process and a 'speedy' resolution of . the recall remained a top priority. Manganese Bronze traces its roots to the 19th century as a maker of ship propellers. It has also produced motorcycles and, through its London Taxi Company division, is universally recognised for providing the UK with the black cab. As well as its Coventry manufacturing facility, the division has six wholly-owned retail sites and has more than 60 service dealers supporting the network across the UK. Manganese recently reported group-wide half-year losses of £3.6 million. The . group said it 'remains hopeful that the fundamental strengths of the . company, the TX4 model and its global reputation will provide the . platform for a successful business in the future'. Manganese . has been loss-making for the past four years as its London Taxi arm has . been hit by a consumer spending slowdown and increased rivalry from . competitors, such as Eco City vehicles. The . group’s London Taxi Company division makes about 2,700 cabs a year and . has produced more than 100,000 since 1948. Its newest model, the TX4, was launched in October 2006. Earlier . this month, Manganese boss John Russell vowed to keep the troubled . group's meter running but warned that it was in a 'very uncertain . situation'. He said he would do everything possible to prevent the company from going under. ‘We’re . focused on making sure that doesn’t happen,’ he said at the time. 'Clearly we’re in a very uncertain situation and until we get more . accurate analysis we can’t answer that question.' Mr Russell, . the former boss of Harley Davidson in Europe, said investors had every . right to feel aggrieved by the product recall situation and added that . he shouldered full responsibility.

"For most mothers, the moment when they first see their child after giving birth is filled with love and affection. But for Charlene Machin, it was a moment of terror - for her son had been born with half of his face missing. The 33-year-old had given birth to twin boys Oliver and Harry - but doctors discovered baby Harry had been born with a severe facial deformity. Twins Oliver and Harry are the best of friends - with Oliver fiercely protective of his brother . Charlene, with son Harry, says that initially it took her years before she could love him . Mrs Machin, from Stoke-on-Trent, recalled how, when her sons were born seven years ago, she kept apologising to husband Mark after hearing the news. She said: 'I'd only just recovered from giving birth by caesarian to the twins. 'Doctors had whisked Harry straight off after his birth and I hadn't been able to see him. 'The doctor lifted his hand to his own face, and made a sweeping gesture across the left side. ""'It's as though his face has been erased completely,"" he told me. He has no eye on that side, no ear or nostril.' 'I started crying and kept saying I was sorry to Mark. I felt like it was my fault. Charlene and her two sons Harry and Oliver have overcome other people's prejudices and are a loving, close family . Charlene says a turning point came when Harry was 18th months old, and she explained to staring children about her son's condition . 'I saw him the following morning and I was so shocked. 'Half of his face was missing, it just wasn’t there. it was like it had been rubbed out. 'As I cuddled him for the first time, waves of terror swept over me. How could I possibly love this little boy when he looked like this? 'People assume that maternal instinct kicks in as soon as you hold your child for the first time. 'But mine didn’t. I didn’t feel anything, just emptiness. I fixed a smile on my face, but behind the smile, I was in pieces. 'I just couldn’t love my son when he looked like this. Instead I just felt grief - grief for a life that I felt had been taken from me, a normal life that should have been Harry's.' The Machins had been thrilled when they had found out Charlene was pregnant with twins. At 32 weeks, Mrs Machin's waters broke . and she had to have an emergency caesarian to deliver the boys as . Oliver was in a breech position. The boys were born weighing 3Ib9 each, and they were taken off by doctors to assess them. It was four hours later when doctors returned and explained to them about Harry's condition. The Machins says occasionally adults stare and whisper and sometimes children scream and run away from Harry . Charlene, pictured with Harry, says that she felt grief for Harry, who she says was robbed of a normal life . The pair are now firm friends and Oliver defends Harry from anyone who thoughtlessly stares of points . The . baby was transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford, Manchester, where . scans ruled out any kidney, spine or heart problems and stayed under . medical care before he was allowed home. Now, seven years later, Mrs Machin has overcome the dread and sadness she felt when she first heard the news about Harry. Her sons are energetic, adorable and the best of friends - with Oliver fiercely protective of his twin brother. And she has learned to overcome her initial horror at her son, and accept him for the loveable, brave boy that he is. 'I just went through the motions with him, feeding and changing him. But still I couldn’t feel anything for him. 'And I couldn’t bring myself to take them out in the double buggy. 'The occasional time that I did dare . to venture out, the double buggy attracted attention. People came over . to ask about the twins, and when they saw Harry, some even ran away . screaming. 'It took me a . long time to start loving my little boy. It was two years before I . finally loved him properly, like I’d always imagined that I would love . my children. 'I gradually came to accept what he looked like. 'The turning point came for me when he was 18 months old and I took the twins out to Mothercare shopping. 'As . soon as I walked in the store, children came running up to look at the . twins, and I felt like the Pied Piper as I walked through the store with . them behind me, staring and pointing. Harry has had three operations on his face, and is due to have a prosthetic eye fitted this year . The Machins say that Oliver and Harry are close, and Harry will always have Oliver to rely upon . 'I’d had enough. It was time to help Harry face the world. I swung the buggy round. '""This is Harry,"" I said. The children asked what was wrong with him. So I told them. And afterwards I felt stronger. 'Instead of trying to hide my son away, I’d faced it head on, and I felt better. 'From then on I got more confident taking the twins out. It still isn’t easy. 'I can’t predict how people are going to react to him. Adults stare and whisper and sometimes children scream and run away from him.' The boys are firm friends, and Oliver stands up to anyone who stares or makes comments about Harry, . Mrs Machin said: 'It is difficult for Oliver to deal with and my heart goes out to him. Recently we were a child’s attraction in Birmingham and I heard Oliver say to a group of children ""He’s my brother. It doesn’t matter what he looks like"". 'It breaks my heart to hear him. I’m pleased that Harry will always have Oliver there to help him through, but it’s a lot for Oliver to take on. 'It has knocked his self confidence, but he’s so protective of his brother. I’m very proud of them both.' Harry has had three operations on his face, to reposition his eye socket and in July last year he had a ten-hour operation at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool to remove the front of his face and skull and to reposition his brain. This year he is due to have his eyelid stretched and a prosthetic eye fitted. 'Harry and I have such a close relationship now. 'I’ve got no shame in admitting that I couldn’t love my son when he was born. 'I don’t want people to think that it’s easy to love a child straight away like this. 'But I want my story to give hope to other mums who may find themselves in my position. 'Because don’t give up hope - I’ve learned to accept Harry’s deformity and the love I have for both my sons is so strong. 'And I’m very proud of what Harry and I have achieved together, to make that bond between us as strong as it is today.'","Charlene Machin describes how she was 'terrified' at her son's deformity .

"'Charismatic': Former Army Sergeant Major Dean Henderson-Smith, 46, died after falling through a barn roof . A former Army Sergeant Major who served in Iraq and Afghanistan has died after falling through a barn skylight on a farm. Sergeant Major Dean Henderson-Smith, 46, had been working on the roof when he plunged to his death. He was flown to hospital by air ambulance helicopter but was declared dead shortly afterwards. Today his grieving partner Sacha paid tribute to the former soldier, describing him as 'my soul mate, best friend, partner and ray of light'. She added: 'We shared a common love for each other which made us ""us"" and our special bond will last forever. 'What little time I had with my sweetheart was filled with happiness, love and joy and I will hold those memories in my heart forever. 'Our dreams and ambitions I promise to fulfil in time.' Mr Henderson-Smith's stepson Jake said: 'There is no definitive way to describe my dad. 'I can confidently say that he was the happiest, bubbliest, most charismatic man I have ever met. 'As a father I could have asked for nothing more. He was caring, generous, kind, loving and honest. 'The list is infinite. Not only have I lost my dad, I have lost my best friend.' Mr Henderson-Smith was 18 when he joined the former Royal Corps of Transport. This later became the Royal Logistic Corps and he was based at Abingdon. As well as Iraq and Afghanistan, he served in Germany, Kuwait, Bosnia and Northern Ireland during a 22-year military career. Thames Valley Police and the Health and Safety Executive have begun a joint investigation into his fall, which happened on a farm in the Oxfordshire village of Besselsleigh on October 18. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield said: 'This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the man’s family at this time. 'We will now conduct a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident alongside the Health and Safety Executive.'

"North Korea has a new communist heir after the wife of dynastic dictator Kim Jong Un secretly gave birth late last year, it was claimed today. The newborn, whose gender is not known, could become the fourth-generation to lead the communist dictatorship, but Pyongyang watchers believe the baby is most likely a girl. 'If it was a boy, [the North Koreans] would have made an announcement,' Michael Madden, editor of the online newsletter North Korea Leadership Watch, told the Washington Free Beacon. This picture shows Kim Jong-Un (centre) with his wife (left) and Mr Rodman (right) on a previous visit . Stepping into the limelight: Kim Jung Un's wife Ri Sol-Ju is being seen more often in public, fuelling claims that she has given birth . The birth is seen as significant . because the communist regime in Pyongyang has evolved from a . Soviet-installed Marxist-Leninist regime in the 1950s to an Asian family . dynasty. The newsletter said: 'South Korea’s government recently confirmed that Ri Sol-ju, Kim’s wife who was shown in recent months wearing designer fashions and expensive jewelry, had a child in late 2012.' Kim . Jong Un, who last week spent time with former NBA star Dennis Rodman, . has dramatically increased the provocation his father was known for, . with multiple tests of nuclear weapons and missiles. Yet . Rodman, who went to North Korea with the Harlem Globetrotters and an . HBO camera crew, described the dictator as 'awesome' and lavished . praised on him. Speculation has been growing that the wife . of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-Un has given birth since she was pictured looking significantly slimmer at the end of 2012. Photographs seen on North Korean TV . show Ri Sol-Ju wearing a neatly-fitting two-piece skirt suit in contrast . to the loose-fitting clothing she was seen wearing in mid December and . which suggested she was heavily pregnant. Before-and-after photos were run on . South Korean TV and in Seoul newspapers today resulting in widespread . agreement that Kim Jong-Un’s wife has had a child. ‘The bulging stomach has gone down – has Ri Sol-Ju given birth?’ asked one newspaper, the Dong-A Ilbo. The . caption in another South Korean paper, the Chosun Ilbo, read: ‘Ri . Sol-Ju with her tummy reduced in 11 days. Has she come out right after . childbirth?’ United: This screen grab taken from North Korean TV today shows North Korea's young leader Kim Jong-Un, right, and his wife Ri Sol-Ju, left. The images suggest that the leader's wife has recently given birth . Birth: The seemingly pregnant belly sported by Ri Sol-Ju in mid-December appeared to be gone in these recent pictures . Pregnant? Ri Sol-ju, centre, Kim Jong Un's wife, is pictured in December looking as though she may be expecting a child . Child: This picture in December of Ri Sol-Ju, second left, which was taken from the side, shows her apparently bloated frame . The photographs have undergone the most intense scrutiny and the verdict is that Ri Sol-Ju is a mother. A South Korean government official, . quoted by the national Yonhap news agency concluded that Ri ‘appeared to . have already given birth based on analysis of the TV images.’ Defectors from North Korea are also said to have provided new details of Ri, who is considered a future power player in the Pyongyang leadership hierarchy and a growing influence on Kim Jong-un. 'Ri Sol-ju is a fresh face who is clearly stepping out but it’s much too early to say if her public activity will have any political relevance in North Korea,' said a U.S. official who did not answer questions about the birth. Whether North Korea will officially announce what would be the equivalent of a royal birth is open to speculation. No official announcement was made that Kim Jong Un even had a wife until state media eventually revealed it. Kim Jong-Un was . elevated to leader of the secretive Stalinist state following the death . of his father, Kim Jong-Il, who had succeeded his own father, ‘Great . Leader’ Kim Il-Sung. According . to South Korean media, citing intelligence reports, the couple were . married in 2009 and already have one child. But that has never been . confirmed. Birth: Speculation is growing that the wife of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un, left, has given birth in recent weeks, continuing the family dynasty into a fourth generation. Ri Sol-Ju is pictured right with her husband earlier this year . Couple: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un walks arm in arm with his wife Ri Sol-ju while attending a ceremony earlier this year . Ri is said to . have come from an ‘ordinary family’ – although her father being an . academic and her mother a doctor raises them above the average level. The young wife of North Korea’s leader made her first public appearance in two months in October -  bringing to an end . what might have been a period of ‘home detention’ for being too . carefree. Ri Sol-ju had been . photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual . manner when accompanying her husband. But . then she disappeared from view, provoking speculation that she might be . pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image . promoted by her husband’s late father, Kim Jong-il. Analysts say that despite the young . Kim’s appointment as supreme commander of the nation, he is still under . the control of the military hierarchy who make sure he presents a rigid, . authoritative image to the rest of the world. That means that his wife must remain aloof and untouchable in the eyes of the masses, say North Korean experts.","Experts say leader's wife Ri Sol-Ju gave birth to a baby girl late last year .

"Hundreds of rare images charting one German soldier's experiences of the First World War have been made public for the first time. The rare glimpse into life in the trenches reveals Walter Koessler's journey from the smiles and hopes of signing up to fight, to the stark the reality of war. The poignant album begins with Walter smiling and 'playing at war' with his friends to dead soldiers lying buried in muddy trenches. German officer Walter Koessler's rare collection of photos that have been preserved by his descendants show his devastation of the First World War . The unique set of images provide a glimpse into what daily life in the trenches was like for a German officer . Pictures such as this one of German soldiers playing cards together next to their trenches 'garden' give an insight into the reality of the boredom, as well as the violence, of warfare . He also records for posterity the devastation that was wrought on Europe. Walter took almost 1,000 photos while serving in the Reserve Artillery Battalion and as an aerial photographer. While beautifully preserved by Walter's descendants, the unique window into the war has been hidden in a cupboard for almost a century. However, Walter's great grandson Dean Putney has now launched an ambitious project to share the images and hopes to turn them into a book. Software developer Mr Putney only discovered the album's existence during a Thanks Giving visit to his mother in 2011. He said the day before he was due to return to his home in San Francisco, California, she 'casually' pulled it out to show him. Mr Putney told Mail Online: 'I thought ""this is incredible"". 'There were hundreds of photos over a century old. 'I am in publishing and spend a lot of time looking at stuff like this. I immediately knew it was something really special that lots of people needed to see. The albums and negatives have been preserved immaculately by Walter's family but they have only now been made public by his great-grandson Dean Putney . Mr Putney now wants to turn the images into a photo book and is raising money to kickstart the project while sharing images of his great grandfather and friends online . Mr Putney feels a connection to his ancestor. He is one year younger than Walter (pictured left and right with friends) was when he was conscripted into the war . The software developer said early photos seem to show the men playing at war and the first sets in the album show them having fun. Pictured, two soldiers wrestle in the snow . The smiling early portraits, such as this one left, are gradually replaced by images of devastation and dead soldiers (right) 'Not only did lots of people need to see it, it was something that I needed to spread and share. 'I hope people can get in touch with that understanding - how different life was back then.' Mr Putney said he immediately felt a connection to the pictures of his great-grandfather. At 23, he is just one year younger than his ancestor was when he was conscripted into the war. But they also look strikingly similar. Mr Putney said the album is a 'real treasure' and especially important because it tells the personal story of a German, when most of the photographs that remain are from the Allies' side. The negatives have also been kept and among the collection is a box of more than 100 3D stereographs from the war. Mr Putney, who is currently sharing the images through the Walter Koessler Project Tumblr blog and on Boing Boing, has spent the past two years researching the images. He has even visited France so he can compare some of the photos with how the sites look today. Towards the end of the album, Walter's images increasingly begin to show the stark realities of the First World War . Mr Putney said the images, such as this one of men carrying heavy artillery and a German soldier posing, are a 'real treasure' The relaxed early images in the album reflect the initial ease the German Army had in moving across Europe before the stalemate of the trenches . Walter Koessler's early pictures show his friends relaxing together and posing for his photographs . Others pictures in the vast collection show the heavy artillery at the disposal of the German Army . None of the pictures are annotated so Mr Putney said one of the only clues to the time of year is if there is snow on the ground . Walter survived the war and went to have a hugely successful career in Hollywood as an art director. He moved to Los Angeles soon after the Armistice where he worked on the Charlie Chan films and worked for Universal Studios. The family believe he was also the set designer for the classic World War One film, All Quiet On The Western Front. Next year is the 100th anniversary of the start of the war and Mr Putney said the images are a crucial reminder of what life was like for soldiers on both sides of the devastating conflict. Walter had trained as an architect before being conscripted into the German Army. As an aerial photographer, he was one of the first to chart battlefields and help create maps from the air, in biplanes and hot-air balloons. At the beginning of the album, the photographs of him and his friends look like a picture postcard to be sent home. But with every page turned, the reality of the war kicks in and Mr Putney said by 1918 his great-grandfather was a staunch pacifist. Mr Putney has spent the past two years researching the images and has even travelled to France to compare them to the actual sites . Because Walter was not an official photographer, his images show a different side to the First World War . Mr Putney said the personal images 'humanize a terrible war' and how life was for those fighting on both sides . He hopes the project will help people get in touch with First World War and is aptly timed as the 100 anniversary next year . Mr Putney said: 'I think that his album and his photos are humazing of this really terrible war. 'He tells a brilliant story. The first pictures are of him and his friends going off to war. 'At the beginning of the album they are almost playing at war - they are swimming in lakes and taking photos. They are almost glamour shots. 'When you reach the middle of the album the aerial shots . 'There are pictures of a crashed airplane . 'Towards the end of the album you really see his understanding of what they are doing. 'He stops taking photos of his friends. It is pretty much taking photos of destroyed churches, of dead men in the trenches, blown up tanks. 'It's scary stuff. The smiling faces disappear.' The poignant images also put faces to just some of the hundreds of thousands of forgotten people who died in the war .","Walter Koessler took almost 1,000 images while he served in the German Army during the war .

"A night at the opera has traditionally provided an opportunity to dress up, with men wearing dinner jackets and women opting for formal gowns. But the English National Opera (ENO) is scrapping its dress code for a series of performances aimed at attracting new audiences. Spectators coming for the first time will be encouraged to wear casual clothes, such as jeans and trainers, and cocktails are to be served from 'club-style' bars. De rigeur: Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene of Monaco don formal wear on a night at the opera. The English National Opera is relaxing its dress code to entice younger spectators . The Undress for the Opera scheme has been supported by Blur singer Damon Albarn and Monty Python star Terry Gilliam. ENO . artistic director James Berry said he wanted to build on the success of . Albarn's Doctor Dee show which attracted a new audience to the venue. He . added: 'In a sense, Undress For The Opera, this new audience . initiative, was really inspired by Doctor Dee and seeing a completely . different audience in this magnificent theatre was so heart-warming.' Mr . Berry said that 30 per cent of the ENO's audience was under 44 and they . wanted to raise that to 40 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months. Blur frontman Damon Albarn (left) and Monty Python star Terry Gilliam (right) have backed the Undress for the Opera scheme . The plan includes a series of informal evening shows which will have no dress code and a 'more relaxed' atmosphere. Prices for the best seats will be held at £25 and the audience will have an introduction to the show, be able to download a synopsis of the opera, and be invited to a post-performance party with cast and company members. Albarn, who admitted to a 'struggle with the word opera', compared its reputation to world music. He said: 'We are carrying into this century ideas that belonged to a previous generation and really it's just a case of clarifying what the state of play is now and it's quite clearly different and the more that word is spread the easier it will be to translate and bring in new ideas.' Gilliam, who is appearing in a short film guide to opera, said there was a perception it was an 'art for the rich, the successful and almost dead'. Campaign: A rehearsal for a production of The Nutcracker at the English National Opera. The company is relaxing its dress code for a series of performances aimed at attracting new audiences . Rufus . Norris, Albarn's collaborator on Doctor Dee, told the Daily Telegraph . that the word 'opera' carried negative connotations for younger . audiences but had much to offer. Thursday, November 15, 2012: Don Giovanni . Thursday, February 7, 2013: La Traviata . Thursday, April 18, 2013: Sunken Garden . Thursday, June 13, 2013: The Perfect American . He said: 'The big difference between opera and a gig or a festival is a simple technical one - it's not amplified. 'You have a huge, live, acoustic musical experience with a story at its centre, and it's immensely powerful. 'There's something about the process which gives you a communion with what's happening on the stage.' One of the informal nights will be a performance of Sunken Garden, based on a story by novelist David Mitchell. Mr Berry said the show would feature stage performance and 3D film footage. Mitchell, whose novel Cloud Atlas has been filmed with Tom Hanks and Hugh Grant, teamed up with Dutch composer Michel van der Aa for the production.","Terry Gilliam supports English National Opera move .

"When it comes to losing their virginity, most women wait for the right man, while others prefer to wait for the right price. Elizabeth Raine, 27, has decided to auction off her virginity online and hopes to get at least $400,000 for the exchange. ‘The reason mainly was the money,’ Miss Raine tells MailOnline. Anonymous: At first Kern tried to protect her identity, with images on her Elizabeth Raine website carefully concealing her face . Elizabeth Raine, pictured here, has started a blog in which she is detailing her journey from being a virgin to a 'whore,' as she auctions off her virginity online . ‘I have no emotional attachment whatsoever to my virginity and never have, which is why it’s so easy for me to do this. ‘More to the point, why would I NOT want to do it? ‘It’s a compelling and easy way to make money.’ Miss Raine says she understand that, for some women, losing their virginity is a significant moment in their lives. But, according to her, it’s merely  a physical act and this is nothing more than a business  transaction. ‘Sex is just sex,’ she says. Miss Raine has never had any form of sex, including letting a man see her naked. Nor has she seen a naked man in the flesh. ‘I’ve dated but for no more than two to three months and have never had a boyfriend because I’ve never felt anyone I’ve connected that strongly to and who’s made me think that sex is anything more than a physical act. ‘I like guys but I’ve just never felt strongly enough for anyone or had a real emotional connection. ‘I study, work on projects and spend time with my friends and that’s enough for me. While her friends have been largely supportive, Miss Raine’s brother – understandably - isn’t so keen on the idea of his sister auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder. ‘My friends think it’s my choice and trust me implicitly, but my brother definitely has some moral objections to the idea,’ she says. ‘It hasn’t affected our relationship. He knows I am smart and trusts me to execute it properly.’What is perhaps even more surprising, is Miss Raine’s unequivocal support from her parents, who she says accepted the choice ‘easily.’ In her blog, 27-year-old Elizabeth Raine, pictured here, writes that she is comfortably off and isn't simply selling her virginity for cash - she claims she will donate 35 per cent to charity . ‘They could tell I’d given it a lot of thought and that I was smart enough to do it properly,’ she says. Miss . Raine started her blog, Musings of a Virgin Whore, ‘several months’ ago, though her various posts date back to February 1st 2014. In . her posts, she answers questions such as, ‘Isn’t this prostitution?’ ‘What kind of doctor will a girl like me be?’ and ‘Can a virgin whore . still be a feminist?' Because . prostitution is largely illegal in the US, Miss Raine has found an . agent and publicist in Sydney, Australia, where prostitution laws are more relaxed and . will, as Miss Raine says, ‘permit this exchange.’ She will be deciding on the winning bidder, and maintains that her endeavour is ‘100 per cent legal.’ She will be paying taxes and even donating 35 per cent of her fortune to charity, though would prefer not to disclose which one. Miss Raine is a medical student in the US, but has not disclosed at which college. Elizabeth Raine, pictured here, stands by her decision to sell her virginity, and says, 'I cannot imagine losing it in any other way' The . photos on her blog show her slim body in a tight, slinky black dress . with her blonde hair but face out of the eye of the camera. In an interview with Elite Daily, Miss Raine said she hopes to earn upwards of $400,000 from the auction, which she expects to last for roughly a month. ‘I don’t really know how the bids will work, my agent will be handling it all,’ Miss Raine tells Mail Online. She will ‘probably’ go for the highest bidder, as long as she has no ‘major objections.’ ‘I don’t care who he is really, as long as he’s not a psychopath and we get on well, then I’ll be happy,' she says. 'We’ll do some sort of background check and I’ll definitely have communication with him beforehand, probably a few emails and a Skype. ‘If I feel unsafe at any point I'll not go through with it, but I don't feel strongly that I need to meet him beforehand.’ Whilst Miss Raine says she hasn’t ironed out all the details of the exchange, she says that for his payment the winner will receive 12 hours in her company in a high end hotel, with security and her friends and family knowing where she is at all times. ‘I won’t have anyone waiting outside the room with a baseball bat or anything,’ she says. And . anyone hoping for a Pretty Woman-style ending, with a couple falling in . love after he’s paid her for sex, will be left disappointed. ‘I have a good understand of what this is and know myself well enough to know that it won’t affect me emotionally . It’s nothing more than a one-night exchange and unlikely I’ll form any emotional attachment. ‘I mean, any girl runs that risk when they sleep with a man, whether or not she’s being paid.’","Elizabeth Raine says selling her virginity is an .

"Jumping on a trampoline, Blaze Duckworth seems to be playing as happily as any two-year-old. But the little girl is bravely battling arthritis and requires daily injections to help her walk. Blaze was diagnosed with the crippling condition after being bedridden with a mystery illness for almost four months. Bouncing back: Two-year-old Blaze Duckworth, pictured playing on a trampoline, suffers from arthritis and needs daily injections to help her walk . Smiling: Blaze Duckworth (right) undergoes daily injections which are administered by her mother, Kelly O'Sullivan (left) Her mother, Kelly O'Sullivan, 23, who administers the injections herself, said: 'When we say to people that she has arthritis they always reply in shock and disbelief and they don’t accept that she has it. 'It’s still a shock to us too but, when you tell people and they don’t believe us, that can be really hard. 'Everybody understands arthritis in the elderly but they don’t expect it to be something a young person has.' Blaze, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, began feeling unwell at Christmas last year and developed symptoms including a rash, a temperature and sore knees. But when Ms O'Sullivan took the girl to her GP, she was told it was merely a viral infection. The girl was put on a course of antibiotics. Suffering: Blaze was bedridden for almost four months before her arthritis was diagnosed . Painful: Blaze began feeling unwell at Christmas last year and developed symptoms including a rash, a temperature and sore knees . Blaze's problems became worse during January as she became unable to walk and was in constant pain. After five visits to a GP, she was referred to Royal Bolton Hospital - where doctors were unable to find the cause of her symptoms. Ms O'Sullivan, who was pregnant with second child Lacey at the time, said: 'I took her to the doctor who said that she had a viral infection and put her on a course of antibiotics. 'But they didn’t do anything - if anything it got worse. 'Then she started limping and by the end of January this year it got to the point where she would not even put weight on her feet and would stay in bed crying. 'Then the pain spread to her neck. She would hobble around holding her neck in pain - it was awful to watch. 'She had gone from being a bundle of fun who was always laughing and running about to not even being able to walk.' Blaze's arthritis was only diagnosed in April after she underwent an MRI scan at Manchester Children's Hospital. Treatment: Blaze was referred to a hospital after visiting her GP five times as her condition got worse . Ms O'Sullivan said: 'She went to the Royal Bolton Hospital for about four weeks but despite lots of blood tests and IV antibiotics nothing really helped that much because they were still treating her for an infection. 'She was discharged at the beginning of March when she got a little better, but in hindsight she had been given ibuprofen and I think that helped her with the inflammation. 'After three days she was back to square one and then referred her to Manchester Children’s Hospital, where she stayed for six weeks. 'During all this time I was a mess. It was so frustrating...nobody knew what was wrong with her despite all the tests. 'It seemed like nobody knew what was going on with her and I was at my wits' end. She would just lie there and barely walked at all. 'She’d even stopped eating in that time and she became anaemic. She had a lot of muscle wastage because she wasn’t walking around and lost a lot of weight.' Ms O'Sullivan praised the doctors who finally discovered why Blaze was in so much pain. Mystery: Blaze, pictured in hospital with an intravenous drip, was not diagnosed with arthritis until April . Diagnosis: Blaze, pictured in hospital after undergoing lymph node tests, had an MRI scan at Manchester Children's Hospital and the nature of her condition became clear . 'I couldn’t believe it when the consultant diagnosed her with arthritis,' she said. 'That’s something that you associate with an old person - not a two-year-old child. 'They explained it to us by saying that it’s an autoimmune disease meaning that her immune system almost works too well and wraps proteins around her joints and that causes the pain. 'She was moved on to daily injections to kill the protein and then a weekly injection that lowers her immune system to stop it over-working. 'I had to go into hospital to learn how to inject her, which was really hard because it’s horrible to inject your own child and see them cry from it. 'She’s getting better now because she’s becoming used to it but once she sees me put the gloves on she goes quiet until it’s done. Problems: Doctors at the Royal Bolton Hospital were unable to find the cause of Blaze's symptoms . Family photograph: Blaze sits with her younger sister Lacey. Their mother, Kelly O'Sullivan, was pregnant with Lacey when Blaze was taken ill . 'As long as she stays on the injections and the oral steroids she will be okay. If she didn’t take them within a few days she wouldn’t be able to walk again, so for the time being this is what she has to go through. 'The doctors have said that they want to keep her on this for a year and see what happens but there’s no way of knowing whether she will grow out of it or if she will need to be on her medication forever. 'We’re trying not to think that far ahead because we’re just happy that she’s smiling and running around like a normal two-year-old.' Ms O'Sullivan is backing a new awareness campaign ran by Arthritis Research UK which will demonstrate that the illness can develop at any age. She said: 'I just hope that if there are other parents out there that have a child with similar symptoms reading this, then they can be diagnosed quicker than Blaze was so they don’t go through the upset we did.' Recovery: Blaze was given a range of medicines and needs daily injections to help her walk .","Blaze Duckworth, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, needs injections to walk .

"The discovery of a 'hidden network of caves and bunkers' occupied by the Islamic State in northern Iraq, by an Australian military plane, has led to an enormous airstrike and the death of over 100 terrorist fighters. Vice-Admiral David Johnston, the chief of joint operations at the Department of Defence, revealed details of the successful multi-national airstrike during an operational update in Canberra on Tuesday. He said that an Australian F-18 Super Hornet military plane, fitted with regular and heat-seeking night cameras, located the concealed bunkers and tunnels in a hillside at Kirkuk while monitoring movements on the mountain during the last week. Vice-Admiral David Johnston, the chief of joint operations at the Department of Defence, revealed details of the successful multi-national airstrike during an operational update in Canberra on Tuesday . He said that an Australian F-18 Super Hornet military plane, fitted with regular and heat-seeking night cameras, located the concealed bunkers and tunnels in a hillside at Kirkuk in northern Iraq . 'Within days a subsequent multi-national airstrike involving 20 aircraft attacked 44 targets, complimented by a large-scale ground operation that was led by the Kurdish security forces, that rapidly entered that area, cleared it of the remaining ISIL militants, and with some reporting indicating that over 100 ISIL fighters were killed in those clearance operations,' Vice-Admiral Johnston said. Another recent airstrike that was led by an Australian crew led to the 'severe damage' of a major improvised explosive device factory in Mosul. Australian forces have also had an important role in the Iraqi government recapturing control of an oil refinery in Baji that, according to Vice-Admiral Johnston, has allowed them to better fund their own defences through the daily $13 million worth of revenue it produces. Air strike operations and air-to-air refuelling operations were provided by Australian forces during this mission, which also destroyed at least seven targets after dropping more than 20 bombs. Within days, a targeted multi-national airstrike involving 20 aircraft attacking 44 targets as well as a large-scale ground operation led by Kurdish forces, led to the death of over 100 ISIL fighters.

Aside from the offensive operations, Australian Defence has dropped over 32 tonnes of food, water, tents, and blankets to Iraqi civilians in the Mount Sinjar region in the last week. Weapons have also been delivered in the last 20 days. During his address, Vice-Admiral Johnston said that generally, 'the advance of ISIL across Iraq has slowed' with locals starting to 'counter the influence of ISIL within their towns'. 'ISIL continues to reduce their profile to air attacks. Predictably, what we have seen is that ISIL is increasingly moving to conduct asymmetric attacks, specifically through the use of improvised explosive devices, and suicide bombers,' he said. However, he said that Islamic State fighter groups were still on the offensive and launching significant attacks in some areas of Iraq where they hope to gain territory, such as Ramadi, just west of Baghdad. Vice-Admiral Johnston said that generally, 'the advance of ISIL across Iraq has slowed' with locals starting to 'counter the influence of ISIL within their towns'. However, he said the Islamic State were still on the offensive and launching significant attacks in some areas of Iraq where they hope to gain territory . Islamic State fighter numbers in Iraq are estimated to currently be in the thousands and  while a number of the group's leaders have been successfully attacked, 'they are able to regenerate leadership' Vice-Admiral Johnston estimated that Islamic State fighter numbers are currently in the thousands and that while a number of the group's leaders have been successfully attacked, 'they are able to regenerate leadership'. 'But every time you lose a leader with experience, with knowledge of the area that they're operating in, that's been intimately involved in planning and preparing for operations. That has an impact on forces,' he said. No indication of civilian casualties in Iraq were given, however the director of general air operations, Air Commodore Vincent Iervasi said 'it was highly unlikely that there were non-ISIL individuals involved or in the vicinity' of the attacks mentioned.","The discovery was made in the last week by an Australian F-18 Super Hornet fitted with regular and heat-seeking night cameras .

"Fatal accident: Sarah Burke crashed on the same halfpipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce sustained a traumatic brain injury in 2009 . Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke, a gold medal favourite for the 2014 Olympics, died yesterday, nine days after crashing during a training run. She was 29. Burke, one of the top half-pipe athletes in the world, died at the Salt Lake City hospital where she was taken last week following the accident in Park City, Utah. She had sustained ‘irreversible damage to her brain due to lack of oxygen and blood after cardiac arrest’, according to a statement released by her publicist. Burke, who lived near Whistler in British Columbia, was a pioneer and ambassador for freestyle skiing who helped get her sport accepted for the Olympics. A four-time Winter X Games champion, she crashed on the same half-pipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce . sustained a traumatic brain injury during a training accident on . December 31, 2009. As a result of her fall, Burke tore her vertebral artery, which led to severe bleeding on the brain, causing her to go into cardiac arrest on the scene, according to publicist Nicole Wool. Miss Wool said Burke's organs and tissues were donated, as she had wanted. The statement said: 'The family expresses their heartfelt gratitude for the international outpouring of support they have received from all the people Sarah touched.' Burke was the best-known athlete in her sport and will be remembered for the legacy she left for women in freestyle skiing. She set the standard for skiing in the superpipe - the extended half-pipe used in extreme sports -  a sister sport to the snowboarding event that has turned Shaun White, Hannah Teter and others into stars. Scroll down for video . World at her feet: The ski and snowboard community was in mourning last night with some of the biggest names in the sport tweeting messages of condolence for Sarah Burke . Aware of the big role the Olympics played in pushing the Whites of the world from the fringes into the mainstream, Burke lobbied to add superpipe skiing to the Winter Games, pointing out that no new infrastructure would be needed. Her arguments won over Olympic officials and the sport will be included at the Sochi Games in 2014 for the first time. Burke, who was married to  freestyle skier Rory Bushfield, would have been a favourite for a gold medal. Peter Judge, the CEO of Canada's freestyle team, said Burke had fallen on the Eagle Superpipe after performing a trick known as a Flat Spin 540. He said  the injury was due to a 'freak accident' after a trick that was well within her capabilities. He said: 'Our hearts go out to Sarah's husband Rory and her entire family. It's difficult for us to imagine their pain and what they're going through.' Earlier, before her death Mr Judge said: 'Sarah, in many ways, defines the sport. 'She's been involved since the very, very early days as one of the first people to bring skis into the pipe. 'She's also been very dedicated in trying to define her sport but not define herself by winning. For her, it's been about making herself the best she can be rather than comparing herself to other people.' She was, Mr Judge said, as committed to the grass roots of the sport - giving clinics to youngsters and working with up-and-coming competitors - as performing at the top levels. David Mirota, the Canadian team's high performance director, said: 'She was a great, positive person for the whole team, the whole sport. She enlightens the room, and she's great.' True champion: Burke won many prizes but will be remembered as much for the legacy she left for women in superpipe skiing . Winning spirit: Burke celebrates on the podium after winning the women's halfpipe freestyle title at the World Cup finals in Valmalenco, Italy . Burke's death is sure to re-ignite the debate over safety on the half-pipe. Pearce's injury - he has since recovered - was a reminder of the dangers. The sport's leaders say mandatory helmets, air bags on the sides of pipes during practice and better pipe-building technology has made the sport safer, even though the walls of the pipes have risen significantly over the past decade. They now stand at 22 feet high. Some of the movement to the half-pipe decades ago came because racing down the mountain, the way they do in snowboardcross and skicross, was considered even more dangerous - the conditions more unpredictable and the athletes less concerned with each other's safety. But there are few consistent, hard-and-fast guidelines when it comes to limiting the difficulty of the tricks in the half-pipe, and as the money and fame available in the sport grew, so did the tricks. In 2010, snowboarding pioneer Jake Burton told The Associated Press that much of this was self-policed by athletes who knew where to draw the line. 'If the sport got to the point where half-pipe riding became really dangerous, I think riders would do something about it,'  Burton said. 'It wouldn't be cool anymore.' Tragic: Sarah Burke who helped get superpipe accepted into the Olympics, died nine days after crashing at a training run in Park City, Utah . True grit: Burke was considered one of the leading half-pipe athletes in the world, and was among the early favorites to win the Olympic gold medal in her sport at the 2014 Games in Sochi, Russia . His opinion is shared by many. 'There are inherent risks in everything,' Mr Judge said. 'Certainly, freestyle skiing has one of the greatest safety records of almost any sport. Freestyle is a very safe sport in large part because we had to build a safe sport in order to get into the Olympics.' The Canadian skier grew up in Ontario, but later lived near Whistler in British Columbia . She was a four-times X Games gold medalist in freestyle skiing . Burke had long campaigned for equal opportunity for women in freestyle skiing. The sport that she fought for was finally to be included in the 2014 Winter Olympics . She married fellow freeskier Rory Bushfield in 2010 . In 2009, Burke broke a vertebra in . her back after landing awkwardly while competing in slopestyle at the X . Games. It was her lobbying that helped get the X Games to include . women's slopestyle - where riders shoot down the mountain and over 'features' including bumps and rails. It . wasn't her best event, but she felt compelled to compete because she . pushed for it. She came to terms with her injury quickly. 'I've . been doing this for a long time, 11 years,' she said in a 2010 interview. 'I've been very lucky with the injuries I've had. It's part of the . game. Everybody gets hurt. Looking back on it, I'd probably do the exact . same thing again.' She returned a year after that injury . and kept going at the highest level, trying the toughest tricks and . winning the biggest prizes. A native of Midland, Ontario, she won the ESPY in 2007 as female action sports athlete of the year. In 2010, she married Bushfield, and they were stars in a documentary film project on the Ski Channel called 'Winter'. In her interview with AP two years ago, Burke reflected on the niche she'd carved out in the action-sports world. 'I think we're all doing this, first off, because we love it and want to be the best,' she said. 'But I also think it would've been a great opportunity, huge for myself and for skiing and for everyone, if we could've gotten into the (Vancouver) Olympics. It's sad. I mean, I'm super lucky to be where I am, but that would've been pretty awesome.' A little more than a year later, with Burke's prodding, her sport was voted into the Olympics for 2014.","Skier was injured on training run in Park City, Utah, nine days ago .

"Fugitive: Raymond Bowden has been jailed for five years for his part in a £4.5million VAT fraud . A corrupt company director, nicknamed 'Arthur Daley' after the wheeler-dealer character from television show Minder, has been jailed for five years for his part in a £4.5million VAT fraud. Raymond Bowden, 69, helped mastermind a criminal enterprise which imported duty-free platinum ingots into Britain from Italy and then sold them on at inflated prices. He went on the run after he was caught in the act by customs officials who secretly filmed him arranging shady deals. Bowden, of Altrincham, Cheshire, was found guilty of cheating the taxman in his absence last August and was about to be sentenced by a judge before he unexpectedly turned himself in at court to face justice. Judge Robert Warnock, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, described the conspiracy as a 'well-orchestrated and cynical VAT fraud motivated by greed'. Bowden had been a well-known trader in antiques and precious metal in the Lytham and Blackpool areas of Lancashire. But his gang's activities were unmasked in an undercover sting carried out by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) investigators. Footage showed him acting as a courier, picking up weekly shipments of 1kg ingots at UK airports and delivering them in luxury hire cars to other members of his gang. The gang bought the precious metal VAT-free from two firms in Italy and had it processed to reduce its purity. It was then brought to the UK, where it was sold via a string of firms to legitimate customers with their own 17.5 per cent 'VAT' added to the price. Surveillance: Raymond Bowden (right) arranges the collection of another shipment of platinum ingots, unaware that he is being filmed by customs officials . For two years the gang pocketed the difference before liquidating the businesses to hide any trace of wrongdoing. Customs officers said platinum was attractive to fraudsters as it was 'high value but easily transportable and generates a large amount of VAT'. Bowden, whose part in the scam generated about £1.4million of the total fraud value, absconded in the second week of an eight-week trial and a warrant had been issued for his arrest before he showed up at Liverpool Crown Court. Bowden was banned from being a company director for six years upon his release and was also handed a Serious Crime Prevention Order, which can restrict his future employment or business deals. Conspiracy: Raymond Bowden acted as the 'frontman' of a gang which imported duty-free platinum ingots into Britain from Italy and then sold them on at inflated prices . Comparison: Bowden, pictured arranging another deal (left), was nicknamed 'Arthur Daley' after the wheeler-dealer character played by George Cole (right) in the television show Minder . Ringleader: Shabir Karim, whose parents were killed in a bungled robbery in 1999, was the principal controller of the fraud . The principal controller of the fraud was Shabir Karim, 40, a director of Bullion Traders whose parents were stabbed to death in a bungled robbery at their jewellery shop in Blackburn, Lancashire, in 1999. Karim was sentenced to seven years in jail and upon his release is banned from being a company director for eight years. Kamran Bhatti, 40, and his bother Imran, 39, both of Blackburn were each jailed for five years and disqualified from running another company for four years. All were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the taxman. A fifth man, Raymond Mancini, 65, of Blackpool, was cleared of wrongdoing. Alan Lee, HMRC director of criminal investigation, said: 'The guilty men simply pocketed the cash for their own personal gain. 'Tax fraud and attempts to launder the proceeds of crime are treated extremely seriously by HMRC, and we will relentlessly pursue any individuals or crime gangs believed to be attacking the public revenue in this way.' Authorities will seek to seize the conspirators' ill-gotten gains at a confiscation hearing next year.","Raymond Bowden, 69, of Altrincham, Cheshire, gets five-year sentence .

"Being on the receiving end of a bird's droppings is meant to bring good luck, according to the superstitious. But Kerry Morrison hasn't had much joy for the last four months. Her bizarre plan to make music based on bird poo, partly funded by the taxpayer, has run into difficulties - because of a lack of muck. Since June, visitors to parks in Liverpool may have seen the self-proclaimed environmental artist laying huge, blank musical scores between trees and encouraging birds to do their business on them. Bizarre: Environmental artist Kerry Morrison is trying to make music based on droppings, but the taxpayer-funded project has been hampered because birds haven't produced enough . Disinterested? Since June, Miss Morrison has laid huge, blank musical scores between trees and encouraged birds to do their business on them . Her plan was that the positioning of . the splats on the stave would inspire a new musical work to be performed . in the city's Tate gallery. Unfortunately, . the birds have been rather less than co-operative, and the 47-year-old . is still waiting for sufficient offerings from the sky to create the . piece. The performance was initially . expected to be held this month, but Tate Liverpool stressed it had never . been scheduled for a specific date and denied the project was running . late. Miss Morrison, whose previous work has included an attempt to create art from dog mess, came up with the idea, entitled Bird Sheet Music, while sitting in a park with friends. Launching the project in June, she described how it would ‘harness some of their (the birds') fundamental doings’ to take ‘by chance nature’s calls and represent what comes naturally’. She went on: ‘I will be laying blank score - on a scale of great magnitude - underneath places where birds roost and feed. ‘As the birds go about their daily business, droppings will fall onto the score below. ‘Each splat on the score will form a musical note, a cache of poo, an embellished score: bird s*** music.’ The dropping marks were to be adapted by composer Jon Hering, but finding birds prepared to take part in the project has proved harder than expected. ‘I thought it would be very straightforward first of all - they sit in a tree, they eat, they poo, you get the bird music and there you go - Bob’s your uncle,’ Miss Morrison said. 'But it’s not like that at all.’ A film crew accompanied Miss Morrison for four hours last week, but the birds provided only one note - an E. The artist said: ‘I have had to learn . about bird behaviour and find out when and where they nest and perch, . so my bird-spotting skills have developed considerably.’ It's oh so quiet: The bird dropping splats on the sheets are to be used for a new musical work to be performed at the Tate Liverpool . Project: Artist Helmut Lemke, who has been helping Miss Morrison, records sounds of the wilderness next to an large piece of sheet music laid down to capture bird droppings . Perhaps Kerry Morrison should have followed the old adage 'Never work with children or animals'. But she is not the first musician to have tried to involve the animal kingdom in her work. The Beatles song A Day In The Life, from the 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, ends with an extremely high note which only dogs can hear. The high note is said to have been dubbed into the track by producer George Martin at the request of John Lennon, pictured. The Beach Boys' critically-acclaimed 1966 album Pet Sounds includes animal noises and even has a picture of the band visiting a zoo on the front cover. And the video to dance act Basement Jaxx's song Where's Your Head At? featured monkeys with superimposed human faces. Miss Morrison has been helped by artist Helmut Lemke, who is recording sounds of the woodland for a planned exhibition. Although sheets with a . combined length of more than 400ft have been suitably soiled, another . 160ft is needed before the composition can begin. Miss Morrison, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, is studying for a PhD at Salford University and incorporates elements from natural landscapes or wild animals in her work. Three years ago she invited walkers on a canal towpath to dodge dog mess, rewarding them with a sticker, a mug of tea and a biscuit if they succeeded. Bird Sheet Music is one of four projects she is working on as part of Tate Liverpool’s series of outdoor exhibitions, Our Liverpool Landscape: From Turner To Today. It is understood to be partially funded through a £50,000 grant made by the Arts Council towards the gallery’s major events programme. According to the exhibition’s website the projects are also supported by the U.S. Embassy in London. Tate Liverpool said no other public money funded Bird Sheet Music but declined to say how much of the Arts Council grant had gone towards it. It said the U.S. Embassy had supported the gallery’s exhibition Turner Monet Twombly: Later Paintings which inspired the Liverpool Landscape productions, rather than the projects themselves. A spokeswoman for Tate Liverpool said: ‘The project is ongoing because Kerry is still collecting the bird droppings for the music. ‘It is our intention to have the transcribed composition performed at Tate Liverpool by the composer Jon Hering in the near future.’ Prestigious: Bird Sheet Music is one of four projects Miss Morrison is working on as part of a series of outdoor exhibitions at Tate Liverpool .","Artist Kerry Morrison has spent four months trying to collect droppings .

"A former police chief from Pennsylvania who pleaded no contest to hindering a prosecution by having sex with the alleged victim may not learn his sentence for another seven years because of an unusual plea deal that was set in motion on Monday. Scott Township Police Chief James Romano's sentencing is now on hold because he is fighting to keep his pension and, if he is denied, will be able to withdraw his guilty plea, according to The Scranton Times-Tribune. Romano was arrested last year for allegedly having sex with a witness who was set to testify against a teacher accused of sleeping with a student. Romano pleaded no contest to one count of hindering prosecution, a misdemeanor, and also agreed to resign, ending his career as a police officer. All smiles: Former Scott Township Police Chief James Romano leaves the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton on Monday after hearing he may not be sentenced for seven years . James 'Jim' Romano may not start serving his sentence for hindering prosecution until 2021 after making a play for his pension. Romano, pictured here with his daughter, is believed to be divorced . However, he still wants to claim his pension. Romano will not be told whether he will get his pension from the state his 50th birthday, which is seven years from now. Since entering his plea, two judges have agreed to hold off sentencing until the pension situation is clear. Lackawanna County President Judge Thomas . Munley agreed on Monday to hold off on sentencing Romano until attorneys know for . sure that he will receive his state pension after his 50th birthday. Romano's case therefore remains open and he remains on bail. He will either be able to keep his pension or he can withdraw his no contest plea. 'We have not hidden the fact that (the pension) has been the primary issue.,' said Romano’s attorney Frank Ruggiero. 'We wanted to preserve that pension for him because he had significant time as a law enforcement officer up to that point, the point that he was charged. 'It's unique, I think it's unique but I think this case is unique because of Romano's facts and, of course, the pension.' James Romano, who was accused of having a sexual relationship with a witness in a case he was investigating in 2013, pleaded no contest in November to a charge of hindering prosecution . Romano first pleaded no contest in November to a charge of hindering prosecution. The same month, special presiding Judge Harold Kane accepted an agreement that allowed Mr. Romano to withdraw his plea if he does not receive his pension, The Time-Tribune reported. Monday marked the fifth meeting to determine if and when Mr. Romano would be sentenced, Mr. Ruggiero said. During those meetings, Mr. Ruggiero and several lawyers from the attorney general's office debated whether that agreement had been reached. Both sides agreed that allowing Mr. Romano the option to withdraw his guilty plea if there is a problem with his pension years later is unprecedented.","Former Scott Township Police Chief James Romano pleaded no contest for hindering prosecution in November .

"'Angelic': Karolina Golabek, five, was crushed to death by an automatic gate in the garden of her home in Bridgend, South Wales . A five-year-old girl was crushed to death by an automatic gate as she played in the garden at her home, an inquest has heard. Karolina Golabek died after she was trapped in the three-foot high sliding gate for 30 minutes. The hearing was told that the girl would often be seen playing alone in the garden of the gated development in Bridgend, South Wales, where she lived with her parents. On July 4, 2010, her father Jozef saw her playing there as normal at 4pm. But half an hour later, a neighbour found Karolina trapped across her waist by the heavy metal gate. The neighbour used his security key fob to open the gate and free Karolina but she had suffered massive internal injuries, the inquest in Aberdare, South Wales, was told. The girl, who was described as 'angelic', died later in hospital with her parents at her bedside. The inquest heard that construction company JB Leadbitter and Co Ltd had not included electric gates on its plans for the development. But the gates were fitted to make the property 'more marketable' and provide secure parking for residents, the hearing was told. Senior technical manager Geraint Sewell told the inquest: 'In the first two years there were problems with the gate breaking down. 'I heard talk in the office that the motor for the gate was breaking down and the gate wouldn’t open or work. 'From the documents I’ve seen this happened on a number of occasions. Scene: The de-activated automatic gates in Brook Court, Bridgend, where Karolina Golabek was crushed . Tributes: Flowers were left at the scene following the tragedy in Bridgend, South Wales, in July 2010 . 'I don’t know what we did about it as a company. From the documents I believe our aftercare department was asked to identify and remedy the problem. 'But this is something we would have delegated to a sub-contractor.' The inquest heard the problems started in 2006 and the gates were still faulty three years later. Karolina’s mother Barbara was present at the inquest on Monday, but Mr Golabek died nine months after his daughter. Bridgend Coroner Louise Hunt said: 'This is a tragic case concerning the death of a five-year old girl. 'The cause of death was compression of the trunk but the full circumstances of her death will be explored during the hearing.' The inquest, which is expected to last five days, continues.

Out for the count: A fighter faints after being kicked by an opponent during a no-holds-barred contest . Pencak Dor is a no-holds-barred competition staged by students at an Islamic boarding school in Kediri, East Java. Contenders punch and kick their opponents at will in the ring as spectators and judges watch. Some fighters leap into the air to launch an attack on their rival, often dealing painful blows to the head. At least one fighter fainted after competing today, and others required medical treatment for facial injuries.

The fighting is ferocious, but is arguably not as dangerous as other historic combat events - such as the pankration, a martial art introduced into the Ancient Olympics in Greece in 648 BC. Pankration was founded as a mix of boxing and wrestling but with almost no rules. Only biting and gouging of an opponent's eyes were disallowed. Events would sometimes end in a fighter's death.

"Stray black cats take 40 per cent longer than others to rehome because superstitious people associate them with witchcraft, an animal charity has claimed. Cats Protection, which has 29 adoption centres in the UK, rescues and rehomes 230,000 stray cats every year. But the charity finds it much harder to find new owners for black cats than for felines of other colours. Unlucky: Stray black cats take 40 per cent longer than others to rehome, the Cats Protection charity has claimed . Mark Campbell-Blake, treasurer of the charity's Crawley, Reigate and District branch, said: 'The problem is around superstition. 'Black cats are no less loving than any other cats we have here, but for some reason people always go for the patterned cat. 'Unfortunately people don't want to go for a black cat.' In the Middle Ages, people with black cats were thought to be witches, who used the cat - called a familiar - to help them cast spells. But in more recent times, black cats have been seen as unlucky if they cross your path from right to left. Superstition: Charity workers say black cats are no less loving than any other cat, but adopters tend to avoid them . If they cross in the other direction - from left to right - they are considered lucky. Mr Campbell-Blake told the Get Surrey website that, of the 402 cats rehomed by his branch last year, 190 were black. It took 40 per cent longer on average for a new owner to be found for a black cat, he added. He said: 'The longer they are with us in care, the more it costs us as a charity and the less money we have to spend on other cats.' A poll of 1,000 people for Cats Protection found that 60 per cent of those questioned said they did not want a black cat. The charity is to raise awareness of the problem next month when it holds Black Cat dinner dance and charity auction.","Cats Protection struggles to find new owners .

"Lily Marie Hartwell, 14, is facing arson and attempted murder charges after police say she admitted to setting fire to her mom's home . A 14-year-old girl has been accused of setting fire to her home in Port Richie, Florida, in the early hours of Thursday morning while her mom and brother were sleeping inside. The teenager, Lily Marie Hartwell, had argued with her mom on Wednesday evening over household chores and had been reading an ebook called Soul Eater about killing people, the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office reported. The teen’s mother and 9-year-old brother were able to escape the fire after being awoken by the smoke alarm at about 1.45 am. The mother realized the girl was not with them and went back inside to find her, but was driven back by the heat, said Sheriff Chris Nocco. Firefighters also went into the burning house three times to search for the girl before concluding she was not there, investigators said. Later, the girl sent her mother a text saying: 'Mom, I’m so sorry. I don’t know why I did it. Did any of [you] get hurt?' according to the police report. The girl has been taken into custody and charged with one count of arson and two counts of attempted murder, reports SuncoastNews. Investigators say she has admitted to starting the fire by soaking a towel and bedsheet with bleach and rum then setting them alight in the garage. The girl told investigators that she then walked to a nearby park bathroom and went to sleep, after packing a bag with clothes, bottled water, cookies, knives, lighters and flashlights. The 14-year-old girl has been accused of setting fire to her home in Port Richie, Florida, in the early hours of Thursday morning while her mom and brother were sleeping inside . The Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009 and police have revealed that the girl had written about him in her journal marked 'Keep Out' Before lighting the blaze, Nocco said, she changed out of her loose-fitting pajamas realizing they could have caught fire. 'She planned this whole thing out,' he said. In the journal marked 'Keep Out,' one written entry stated 'if this keeps up there will be no safety in this house.' The girl  had also written about her interest in Slender Man, a fictional character who is the subject of numerous online stories that involve murder, and other online sites with similar dark themes. The teen also told detectives she visited websites related to the character. The Slender Man stories reportedly influenced a case in Wisconsin in which two 12-year-old girls were accused of stabbing a classmate, and the Port Richey teen mentioned that case in her journal, Nocco said. Video footage shows firefighters battle the blaze in the early hours of Thursday morning in Port Richie, Florida . 'There's a clear direction,' Nocco said. 'She's involved in reading these things.' It took 17 firefighters from three stations to knock down the flames. Neighbors expressed shock, saying the girl was a typical teen who had never done anything to raise alarm, and the family members were good neighbors. 'It’s a tragedy,' Sandy Gilbert, who lives across the street, told Suncoast News. 'I hate to see something like this happen to such a nice family.'","Lily Marie Hartwell, 14, is accused of setting fire to her home in Port Richie, Florida, while her mom and brother were sleeping inside .

"Were they government propaganda or works of art? The 1930s saw an explosion of documentary photo and film work depicting impoverished Americans around the country, including poor African American day laborers in the Deep South. Many of these vivid images were captured by Farm Security Administration photographers - snappers hired by the government to 'put out positive propaganda' about President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 'New Deal' to generate public support. Roosevelt's bold package of reforms to lift America's economy out of the Great Depression made the government, for the first time, responsive to the needs of its suffering population. FSA photographers, such as Marion Post Wolcott whose vivid images are below, documented the poverty and deprivation in pockets of the U.S. to show why the New Deal was needed. 'As . an FSA documentary photographer, I was committed to changing the . attitudes of people by familiarizing America with the plight of the . underprivileged, especially in rural America,' she said, according to a University of Virginia biographical sketch. 'FSA . photographs shocked and aroused public opinion to increase support for . the New Deal policies and projects, and played an important part in the . social revolution of the 30s.'

Wolcott's moving images of the Deep South captured the . enduring legacy of slavery - the extreme poverty, the continued work on plantations and  malnourishment. According to the University of Virginia, the task of Wolcott and her colleagues was to 'record both the need for and success of' New Deal farming and social security programs around the country. The small team of photographers earned less than $3,000 a year, but managed to produce 270,000 pictures between 1935 and 1943 at a cost of $1 million. '[The] cadre of photographers hardly worked inside a cultural vacuum,' a University of Virginia historian wrote. 'Could the FSA photographs, allegedly unadulterated and objectively snapped, be art, or, rather, did they represent purely propagandistic material? 'The answer encompasses both views.' The .

"A grandfather poured beer over a crying toddler in a pub because the noise ruined his lunch plans, a court heard today. Danny Polak, 64, lost his temper when a 15-month-old child started making 'grizzling' sounds in the Ernehale pub in Arnold, Nottinghamshire. He soaked the toddler in ale and then kicked the boy's mother, Rachel Atkin, in the backside when she went to confront him. Assault: Danny Polak became so irritated by noises made by a toddler in this pub in Arnold, Nottinghamshire, that he poured his beer over the boy . Polak was fined £355 and ordered to pay £50 in compensation when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court and admitted two counts of assault. The hearing was told that Miss Atkin had gone to the pub with her son and sister-in-law, Rebecca White, on the afternoon of June 11 this year after a morning at a soft play centre. After they took seats at a table next to Polak and his wife, Miss Atkin went to order food at the bar, leaving Miss White to look after the child. Catherine Picardo, prosecuting, said that the child: 'started to whine as though he was missing his mother.' 'The defendant, with a half-full pint in his hand, approached the table and poured it over the baby’s head, which caused him to scream.' Ms Picardo told the court that, when confronted by Miss Atkin, Polak told the mother: 'You shouldn’t bring kids in a pub.' Miss Atkin responded by throwing her own drink at Polak and said: 'See how you like it.' The court heard that Miss Atkin then turned her back on Polak, who kicked her and fled. Guilty: Polak, 64, admitted two counts of assault when he appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court . Miss Picardo said: 'It is quite shocking behaviour as it involved a 15-month old child. 'It took place in a family pub where children are entitled to be.' Maria Bines, defending, said: 'He was having a quite drink with his wife. He thought rather than go to the bar, the mother should have stayed to attend her son. 'He threw the beer in the general direction of the table where the females were sitting. 'He accepts that beer went over the baby and that his actions were reckless. 'He accepts he kicked her in the bottom. It wasn’t done in malice, it was just so he could have the last word. 'He accepts that what he did was wrong. He is not proud of what he has done, and accepts that it will have to be punished.' Polak, of Sherwood, Nottingham, told police that he had been angry because the noisy child had forced him and his wife to abandon plans to have lunch at the pub, which they only did once a month. Speaking shortly after the incident, Miss Atkin said: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was so shocked. 'I just stood there for a second and then I ran up to his table and shouted at him. 'I could hear my son crying when I was at the bar and my friend said he’d been shouting about it before he poured the drink over my son. 'But it’s no excuse to pour a drink on him, it just made him cry even more.'It’s just scary to think someone would do that to a baby that is crying.'","Danny Polak, 64, lost temper in Nottinghamshire pub .

Neighbours include Kazakh property mogul Horelma Peramam, and members of the Saudi royal family, while the Sultan of Brunei also reportedly owns a property nearby. Former residents on the 66 house avenue have included industrialist Lakshmi Mittal, Sir Billy Butlin, Dame Gracie Fields, George Sainsbury, son of the supermarket founder, sugar mogul William Lyle, Katie Boyle, Moustrap producer Sir Peter Saunders, businessmen Asil Nadir and Emil Savundra, and Heather Mills once owned an apartment on the street. Lulu, Ringo Starr, Sting, George Michael, Salman Rushdie and Annie Lennox are also among those who once called the exclusive street home. However, earlier this year it was reported that many of the expensive properties on the road are lying empty, with an estimated 120 bedrooms in the street unused - as Britain faces a housing shortage growing by more than 100,000 homes a year. Among the empty buildings are a row of 10 mansions which are believed to be falling into disrepair after they were bought in the late 1980s and early 1990s but have never been lived in. They are believed to have recently been sold with the aim of turning them into flats. Many of the homes are owned by off-shore companies.

"Striking images of New York mobsters from the dirty thirties have been revealed as they come up for auction. Over 24 years, Eugene Canevari, a detective with the New York Police Department began working on cases involving some of the most well-know crime figures of the era: Lucky Luciano, Louis 'Lepke' Buchalter, Dutch Schultz and Vincent 'Mad Dog' Coll. After retiring in 1952, Canevari took with him a number of police documents and photographs that charted his long career. Revealed: The files of New York Detective Eugene S. Canevari will be auctioned next week . Now his files are up for auction and . they include some incredible artifacts such as original mugshots of . gangsters like Lucky Luciano and Johnny Torrio. The files also contain various other police documents. Canevari, who born in Greenwich Village, was on a first name basis with many of the mobsters he later prosecuted, having known several since childhood. Last rights: The collection includes pictures of deceased bodies in suspected homicides laying in coffins . With a career beginning in 1928 at . the age of 25, Canevari eventually rose to the rank of Detective 2nd . Grade, mainly through his work on organized crime. In . addition to organized crime, he also worked on the NYPD Bomb Squad and . Homicide Unit, not to mention his undercover work infiltrating Communist . organizations. Beyond the force, he also protected several celebrities including FDR, James Cagney, and Winston Churchill. After a long and successful career, Canevari retired in 1952, at the age of 49, having served nearly 25 years. Attempted train bombing: Fascinating collection related to an attempted train bombing, consisting of five original and seven typed witness statements, most dated February 15, 1930 . In one part of the collection, photos depict the scene of an attempted bombing with dynamite on train tracks. A witness statement reads: 'There was a box of dynamite with a bomb wired up ready to explode…I volunteered to go down and take it out of the way as quickly as possible…I collected the sticks of dynamite…The full sticks of dynamite I put back in the box.' Another states: 'I looked down and I saw it was dynamite and said get away it is dynamite…When I got down on the track I took a stick in my hand and I looked at it. Then I knew it was dynamite.' In the mafia assassination of Dutch Shultz a typed police report is up for sale. The incident is described in detail on now yellowing paper. 'A Tavern and Restaurant…was entered by three men and upon going to the rear of restaurant opened fire…four men received gun shot wounds of the body and were removed to Newark City Hospital…' The notes taken at the time by a member of the Newark Police Department, at the bedside of Dutch Schultz, while he was talking irrationally, in a semi-conscious condition are also noted. ‘Please leave me alone Bugs, I was never a bad guy in my life, I’m not a rat. Tough sweating. Augie, I always though you were a rat but I did not think you would do this.’ The report concludes with a description of three unidentified suspects in the shooting. Schultz’s rambling last words became famous, and have been referenced and parodied in many works since. Shooting report: In the shooting of Dutch Schultz, the gangsters famous last words are recounted.He was assassinated by the Mafia in 1935 . Papers: The collection of NYPD reports and documents related to mobsters and complaints, dated from throughout the 1930s . The collection has various mug shots of criminals. Johnny Torrio's is filled out with a physical description and personal details on the reverse, listing his crime as 'Forging In,' occupation as 'Real Estate,' and date of arrest as '4-28-36,' although the date on the identification card in the photo is April 22, 1936. Torrio was arrested on a forgery indictment for passing a bad promissory note; he subsequently plead guilty to income tax evasion and served two years in prison. His arrest made headlines throughout the nation, as bail was set at a whopping $100,000 — which Torrio’s wife quickly delivered to the courthouse in cash.

Charles 'Lucky' Luciano was instrumental in the development of organised crime across the United States. In this mugshot from February 1931, Luciano was indicted on two counts of assault in the first degree, both of which were dismissed. This mug shot is probably the most iconic image of Luciano, and clearly shows the droopy eye which he suffered as a result of an earlier stabbing. A major turning point came later in 1931, when Joe Masseria was assassinated at Luciano’s command, allowing him to take over as the first official boss of the Genovese crime family. Lucky Luciano: New York Mafia boss (1897¿1962) instrumental in the development of organized crime in the US; he was responsible for splitting the Mafia into five different crime families .

"The brother of one of Lee Rigby's murderers said today that the decision to give his sibling a whole life prison sentence was Islamophobic. Jeremiah Adebolajo believes Michael Adebolajo should not be forced to die behind bars and claims the judge in his Old Bailey trial caved in to 'pressure' after 'gave the public what they wanted'. Last month Adebolajo, 29, was given a . whole-life term, while Michael Adebowale, 22, was jailed for life with a . minimum of 45 years. Adebolajo was given the longest possible sentence because the judge believed he had no hope of rehabilitation, but his brother said today if released he would 'pose no danger to the public' and 'lead a very productive life were he to be released'. Defence: Michael Adebolajo described himself as a 'soldier of Allah' and attempted to decapitate . Drummer Rigby, but his brother Jeremiah, right, says his whole life sentence was Islamophobic . Brave life lost: Lee Rigby was walking innocently along a Woolwich road towards his barracks when he was run down and butchered . The . British-born extremists mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car before . hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near . Woolwich Barracks in south-east London in May last year. Accomplice: Michael Adebowale was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years - meaning he could be back on the streets by the age of 67 . They . both claimed that they were ‘soldiers of Allah’ and were motivated by . the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing, and have shown no . remorse. Today Jeremiah Adebolajo, who like his brother is a Muslim convert, told the BBC Radio 5 Live today that his sibling was unfairly treated. He pointed to the sentencing of Pavlo Lapshyn, who was jailed for 40 years for killing a man and planning to bomb three mosques to start a 'race war' in Britain. 'It . seems strange to me that a man can be sentence to (whole) life for the . death of one man and another can be sentenced to 40 years for the death . of one and the attempted murder of many others,' he told Victoria Derbyshire. 'I wonder what the difference is here, aside from the guilty plea, aside from that I see that someone has died in both cases. 'It . seems strange that Justice Sweeney can suggest there is no prospect of . rehabilitation for my brother but there is for the Ukrainian man who . openly stated he wanted to start a race war . 'Yes . (it is Islamophobic). Not only that I think it was trial by the public. There was a lot of public outrage, as could be understood. The death of . a soldier in any country would provoke that, but I would suggest that . Justice Sweeney was giving in to that pressure'. During their sentencing last month violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge . and fighting with prison guards. Anger: The BBC has received criticism for allowing his brother on the air in the first place . Fight: During Adebolajo and Adebowale's sentencing, violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards. Above, a court sketch of the violence . Taken away head first: Mr Justice Sweeney was forced to sentence the men in their absence after they were bundled out of the courtroom following their violent outburst . In extraordinary . scenes, the two Muslim extremists yelled 'Allahu Akbar' and 'You . (Britain) and America will never be safe' during their sentencing at the . court in Central London. Shocking: A blood-drenched Michael Adebolajo (pictured) told witnesses in a video his attack on Drummer Rigby was an act of revenge - 'an eye for an eye' Justice Sweeney was forced to jail them while they banged on the ceilings of their cells below the courtroom. The judge said the pair's behaviour was ‘sickening and pitiless’, and that Adebolajo had no hope of rehabilitation. ‘Your sickening and pitiless conduct was . in stark contrast to the compassion and bravery shown by the various . women at the scene who tended to Lee Rigby's body and challenged what . you had done and said.’ Jeremiah Adebolajo also said his brother should not have been tried for murder. 'Lee Rigby was performing a public service. It would have been more fitting, I think, that my brother, a British citizen, be charged with treason for killing a soldier. It is the first time that a man has killed another man and been sentenced to a whole life tariff,' he said. When asked if he should one day be released he said: 'I believe my brother would lead a very productive life were he to be released. Were he to be rehabilitated I think he would lead a productive life – I think it’s important not to forget that he has young children himself.' Victoria Derbyshire also asked him if he had sympathy for Lee Rigby's family, but would only be drawn on his son Jack. 'I . have a tremendous amount of sympathy towards the son of Lee Rigby who will . grow up without a father, and I think my brother does too'. The BBC defended the interview today. 'All interviews broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live are carefully considered,' a spokesman said. 'We decided this interview, which was robust and challenging throughout and let listeners hear for the first time the reaction of Michael Adebolajo’s family to his sentencing, was in the public interest'. Demand for justice: The bereft family of Lee Rigby wore t-shirts in his honour on the day his killers were sentence (Left to right) Stepfather Ian Rigby, his mother Lyn Rigby and sisters Sara McClure and Chelsea Rigby walked into the Old Bailey together . Moving: The only son of Lee Rigby, Jack, holds the hands of the loved-ones as he attended his father's funeral in July. His mother Rebecca told Justice Sweeney that he will grow up to see images of his father' horrific murder . Adebolajo is already appealing his conviction on technical legal grounds, using public funds to pay his legal fees. His QC told the court that sentencing his client to life without parole . would make him a 'martyr', while Adebowale's legal team said a . whole-life term would be 'inhuman' for a man that age. During their trial, Rigby's bereft . family were forced to watch footage and hear gruesome accounts of . the soldier being run down at 40mph and hacked to death in the street. The jury, who were all offered . counselling, took just 90 minutes to find the killers guilty of the fusilier’s . murder, but not guilty of the attempted murder of police. Before impact: This CCTV footage shows a Vauxhall Tigra about to crash into Lee Rigby as he crosses the road . Adebolajo and Adebowale mowed down Lee Rigby in this car before hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers. The streak of blood in front of the car shows how they dragged his body into the street . Jeremiah Adebolajo concentrated on the case of Ukrainian white supremacist Pavlo Lapshyn, 25, who murdered a Muslim pensioner and bombed three mosques as he waged a one-man race war in Britain. Just . five days after arriving in the country last year he killed . Mohammed Saleem by stabbing him three times from behind as the . 82-year-old made his way home from evening prayers. The . ‘evil and calculating’ PhD student – who once posed with the British . Ambassador when he was awarded the chance to work in Britain – also . ordered bomb-making materials online as he plotted mass murder in a . series of mosque attacks. Guilty: Ukrainian born Pavlo Lapshyn admitted the . murder of Mohammed Saleem, 82, who he stabbed as he walked home from a . mosque, and also planting a series of bombs outside mosques . Horrifying: Nails recovered from the scene of one of three bombings planned by murderer Pavlo Lapshyn . Crazed: Pavlo Lapshyn catches a bus from Birmingham to Walsall calmly carrying a home made bomb in this green bag - incredible nobody was killed in the three bombings he planned . Lapshyn also admitted causing an explosion on . July 12 near the Kanzal Iman mosque in Tipton, and engaging in conduct . in preparation of terrorist acts between April 24 and July 18 this year.

"America's leading small business association has slammed Barack Obama for showing 'an utter lack of understanding' of the country's entrepreneurs when he told them: 'If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.' In a hard-hitting statement to Mail Online, the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) president Dan Danne said: 'What a disappointment to hear President Obama's revealing comments challenging the significance of America's entrepreneurs. Mr Danne added: 'His unfortunate remarks over the weekend show an utter lack of understanding and appreciation for the people who take a huge personal risk and work endless hours to start a business and create jobs.' Scroll down for video . Under fire: President Obama, pictured today speaking at a town hall rally in Cincinnati, has been blasted by business leaders who say he has a lack of understanding of American entrepreneurs . President Obama said in a speech at the weekend that governments and not individuals create jobs, telling entrepreneurs: 'If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.' He added: 'You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.' The inflammatory campaign speech . comments underline the extent to which Obama believes that the state . rather than ordinary citizens create jobs and wealth. They highlight a key contrast . with Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, who is preaching a . message of wealth creation by individuals and reinvigorating the . private sector. Andrea Saul, spokeswoman for Romney, told Fox News that the remarks 'reflect just how unqualified he is to lead us to a real economic recovery' and were ' insulting to the hardworking entrepreneurs, small-business owners, and job creators who are the backbone of our economy.' Attack: Barack Obama said in a speech in Virginia on Saturday that small business owners could not claim credit for their own success . An NFIB spokesman added: 'I'm sure every small-business owner who took a second mortgage on their home, maxed out their credit cards or borrowed money from their own retirement savings to start their business disagrees strongly with President Obama's claim. They know that hard work does matter. 'Every small business is not indebted to the government or some other benefactor. If anything, small businesses are historically an economic and job-creating powerhouse in spite of the government.' The NFIB was founded in 1943 and has . some 350,000 members. It is officially a non-partisan organisation but . tends to contribute heavily to Republican candidates. In 2010, 25 of its . members, all republicans, were elected to Congress. David Chavern, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that the basic idea behind Obama’s comments, and other similar sentiments expressed by allies, 'is really objectionable and offensive.' Reaching out: Obama said in a speech at the weekend that governments - not individuals - create jobs . 'The problem with the Obama administration’s view, he wrote in a blog post, was that ‘it only looks at the good outcomes’ rather than what went before. Mr Chavern wrote: ‘Success is apparently a collective effort - but where was that ""collective"" during the periods of risk-taking and failure? The vast majority of businesses fail. Period. He added: 'Every day millions of people put their lives, savings, houses and families on the line and work 20 hours a day just to grab their small slice of the American dream. Where is the collective when all of this is going on?  And if the collective is really responsible for success, how come everyone isn’t successful? Meanwhile, on his daily radio show, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said that Obama’s Roanoke remarks were proof positive that the president 'hates' America. 'I'll tell you what,' he said. 'I think it can now be said, without equivocation - without equivocation - that this man hates this country. He is trying -- Barack Obama is trying - to dismantle, brick by brick, the American dream.' Speaking at a campaign rally in . Roanoke, Virginia on Friday night, Obama made the case that those who . created businesses should be taxed at higher rates because they are . fortunate and were helped to achieve success by the government and other . people. 'There are a lot . of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me - because they want . to give something back,' he said. 'They know they didn't - look, if . you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own. Plans: Obama recently unveiled a new proposal to raise taxes on all those who earn more than $250,000, a measure that Romney contends will hit small businesses. 'You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. 'There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else.  Let me tell you something - there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.' Obama recently unveiled a new proposal to raise taxes on all those who earn more than $250,000, a measure that Romney contends will hit small businesses. He continued: 'If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Rival: Mitt Romney has stressed his business experience in his campaign . 'Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that.  Somebody else made that happen. 'The . internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created . the internet so that all the companies could make money off the . internet.' He made the argument that all this showed that 'there are some things we do better together' and was how the American middle class was built. As President Obama comes under scrutiny for remarks that he made about entrepreneurs over the weekend, it's not surprising to many that the president has never served in a leadership level at any private sector job. The president has held a number of jobs since the late 1980s, including editor, writer and professor before getting into politics. But questions have been raised about Obama's lack of business experience as the U.S. struggles with a high joblessness rate and a frail economy. It was a point that Obama's political foes were quick to exploit in their attacks on Monday. Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal, appearing alongside Mitt Romney today, said: 'We have a president who hadn't run anything before he was in the White House.' He added: '[Obama is the] most liberal and incompetent president since Jimmy Carter. No offense to Jimmy Carter.' 'That's how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that's the . reason I'm running for president - because I still believe in that . idea.  You're not on your own, we're in this together.' Obama, who was speaking in a fire station, tried to equate the economy with state-run emergency services. 'There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don't do on our own.  I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service.  That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires.' Obama's comments strongly echo controversial remarks made by Elizabeth Warren, a liberal darling and candidate for the US Senate in Massachusetts, in August 2011 when she said: 'There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.' She then made the case that the wealthy . only got wealthy because of others. 'You built a factory out there? Good . for you. But I want to be clear: you moved your goods to market on the . roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to . educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire . forces that the rest of us paid for. 'You didn't have to worry that . marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and . hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us . did.' She linked this with a demand for the rich to be taxed at a higher rate. 'Now . look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a . great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying . social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next . kid who comes along.'

"A man who beheaded his teenage girlfriend with a kitchen knife before stabbing himself has been jailed for life. Aras Hussein, 21, attacked Reema Ramzan, 18, with the blade while she was still alive before plunging it into his own chest in his flat in Sheffield. Sentencing him to life, with a minimum of 20 years in jail, Justice Laura Cox said his motive for the attack was 'unclear and may never be known'. After the attack, he was seen on the street by a neighbour, naked, holding a wad of money and a passport, and covered in blood. The body of Miss Ramzan, left, was found in the kitchen of Iraqi-born Hussein's, right, flat on June 4 last year . The killer admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denied murder. However, he was found guilty of murder at Sheffield Crown Court. The body . of Miss Ramzan was found in the kitchen of Iraqi-born Hussein's flat on . June 4 last year. Mrs Justice Cox said Hussein had used 'severe and sustained' force to decapitate Reema in a 'chilling and brutal' attack. Reema Ramzan was described as 'not just a beautiful girl to look at, she was a beautiful girl inside' She said: 'The pathological evidence indicated that she was likely to be alive while decapitation was taking place although at some stage, mercifully, she would have lost consciousness. 'The pain, terror, anguish and desperation she would therefore have suffered, as you inflicted these appalling injuries upon her and ended her life, is truly horrifying to contemplate. 'Why you did this to a young woman who was your girlfriend is unclear and may never be known.' The court previously heard that Miss Ramzan had arrived at Hussein’s flat in Sheffield at approximately 2.30pm and had brought with her around £5,000 in cash, as well as her passport and a substantial amount of Iraqi currency. The jury was told Miss Ramzan did not tell her family she was going to meet Hussein and it was not clear what her intentions had been prior to her death. Mrs Justice Cox: 'While you were both in the flat you stabbed [Reema] in the chest and decapitated her, in what was clearly a chilling and brutal attack.' After the attack, Hussein took off his clothes, stabbed himself and wandered into the street. The court how he approached a member of the public - who was waiting for a friend near Hussein’s block of flats - and asked him to take him to hospital. The man refused, but alerted emergency services who arrived minutes later. The court heard that when the defendant got back to the flat he also called the police and was still naked when they arrived. Prosecutor Graham Reeds QC said a neighbour of Hussein's heard a woman 'screaming for dear life' that afternoon, and that the defendant told emergency workers who came . to his aid: 'I don't know why I did it.' He said Hussein told the paramedics: 'She liked me but I raped her. What I did was wrong. I need punishing for it.' And he told them: 'Why are you helping me? I've murdered someone.' Miss . Ramzan was studying health and social care at Sheffield City College . and lived in Darnall, Sheffield with her family who, the court was told, . disapproved of the couple's relationship. During . the trial, the jury heard how on one occasion Hussein had threatened to . show the victim's family sexual pictures he had taken of her if she . broke up with him. Mr .

"Sir James Munby said family courts must be exposed to the 'glare of publicity' The country’s most senior family judge yesterday launched a furious attack on social workers who failed to tell parents why their children were being adopted – and suggested that in future the same offence could carry a jail term. Local authority workers in Bristol ignored a court order requiring them to explain why the couple’s two children were being taken for adoption. They only released the information to the parents 45 minutes before the decision was due to be finalised, giving the family no real hope of mounting a challenge in court. Sir James Munby, who is President of the Family Division, said their behaviour was ‘deplorable’ and ‘symptomatic of a deeply rooted culture in family courts’. In his judgment, he accused the social workers of having a ‘slapdash’ and ‘lackadaisical’ attitude to court orders. He said the couple, who were facing the ‘permanent loss of two children’ had been denied ‘vitally important’ information. He also warned that in future, there would be ‘consequences’ for social workers, suggesting that they could be jailed for contempt if they fail to comply with court orders – an offence that carries a sentence of up to two years. Until now, local authority workers have largely been protected by family courts, which also routinely tolerate delays and inefficiencies in their work. By contrast, members of the public who have failed to comply with court orders have been dealt with severely. The most notorious case of this was the prison sentence for contempt handed down to Wanda Maddocks, who wanted to get her father out of a care home where she thought he was being ill-treated. Miss Maddocks was jailed without representation and in secret until her case was revealed by the Daily Mail. But Sir James’s warning suggests council staff will now face the same punishment as ordinary members of the public if they fail – either through incompetence or unwillingness – to hand over the required information on time. He told the court: ‘That the parents should have been put in this position is quite deplorable. ‘It is, unhappily, symptomatic of a deeply rooted culture in the family courts which, however long established, will no longer be tolerated. 'The court is entitled to expect – and from now on family courts will demand – strict compliance with all such orders. Notorious case: Wanda Maddocks, pictured, was jailed in secret for failing to comply with a court order . ‘Non-compliance with orders should be expected to have and will usually have a consequence.’ He added: ‘There is simply no excuse for this. Orders must be obeyed and complied with to the letter and on time. Non-compliance with an order, any order, by anyone is bad enough. ‘It is a particularly serious matter if the defaulter is a public body such as a local authority. ‘It is also a particularly serious matter if the order goes to something as vitally important as the right of a parent who is facing the permanent loss of their child to know what case is being mounted against them by a public authority.’ Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who has campaigned for openness in the family courts, said: ‘At least anybody who is sent down for contempt by Sir James will not be locked up in secret. ‘He has put the boot on to the other foot. The next time courts are let down by the incompetence or bloody-mindedness of social workers, it will be a director of children’s services facing jail rather than a parent.’","Sir James Munby attacked workers in Bristol who didn't explain themselves .

"Tony Blair has warned of the political, economic and emotional dangers of Scotland voting for independence . Tony Blair has warned against 'ripping up the alliance' between Scotland and England in a rare intervention in the referendum debate. The former Prime Minister, who was born in Edinburgh, said: 'Obviously I hope that Scotland votes to stay part of the United Kingdom.' Mr Blair has avoided campaigning for a No vote as he knows he remains a divisive character north of the Border in the wake of the Iraq War. In his autobiography, the former Labour leader claimed he was to blame for the party's humiliating defeat by the SNP in 2007, and the Nationalists have repeatedly described him as 'toxic'. But supporters insist he made one of the greatest all-time speeches in favour of the Union in 2006, when he warned Scotland against turning in on itself with the nationalist 'politics of grievance'. Speaking at a security conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev at the weekend, he said: 'To rip up the alliance between our countries would not be sensible, politically, economically or even emotionally.' Born in Edinburgh, Mr Blair went to school in Durham before returning to Scotland to attend Edinburgh's Fettes College. His father was born in Yorkshire but grew up in Glasgow. In his final speech to a Scottish Labour conference in Oban in 2006, he famously said: 'I detest this narrow nationalism not because it engenders fear but because it squanders hope.' Ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of Better Together, has previously called for his former boss to play his part in a 'call to arms' to keep the UK together. But Mr Blair has been reluctant to speak out, in stark contrast with his successor, Gordon Brown, who has returned to frontline politics to fight for the Union. Meanwhile, the journalist who first claimed Mr Blair's government had 'sexed up' a dossier on Saddam Hussein has described the SNP's proposals for independence as 'every bit as dodgy'. In May 2003, then-BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan said a claim that Hussein could fire weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes had been included in a dossier even though the UK Government knew it was probably 'wrong'. He said that originally the dossier had contained little that was new, but in the week before publication Downing Street had ordered it to be 'sexed up' and new facts 'discovered' to make it more exciting. Scroll down for video . Mr Blair said a Yes vote  would 'not be sensible, politically, economically or even emotionally' Mr Blair added: 'Obviously, I hope that Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom . In yesterday's Sunday Telegraph, Mr Gilligan wrote: 'As the BBC reporter who first exposed those lies, I believe that Scotland is being led over a cliff by a dossier every bit as dodgy as the one that took us into Iraq. 'Like the whole of Britain in 2003, Scotland in 2014 is being asked to fix a problem that does not exist. Back then, it was an imaginary threat from Iraq. Now, it is an imaginary threat to the NHS, 45 minutes from destruction if you vote No. 'Back then, it was the supposed 'clash of civilisations' between Islam and the West. Now, it is a supposed 'fundamental conflict of social values' between two nations, England and Scotland – whose social values, all surveys show, are extremely similar. 'And just as in 2003, Scotland is also being asked to tackle another problem that is real and does exist – but in a way that will only make that problem worse, for itself, and for all of us. Back then, we were told that invading Iraq would protect us from international terrorism. In fact, of course, it gave international terrorism a boost beyond al-Qaeda's wildest hopes and dreams. 'Now, Scots are told that independence will protect them from global capitalism. They are told that a new international border at Gretna will form a magic shield against the City, the Tories, and the cuts.'","Former Prime Minister made comments at security conference in Ukraine .
