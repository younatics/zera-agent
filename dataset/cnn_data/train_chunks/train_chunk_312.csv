"Washington (CNN) -- The year 2012 was supposed to herald Hillary Clinton's swan song, a golden departure amid speculation that she might consider another run at the presidency in 2016. Instead, the outgoing Secretary of State has found herself and her agency at the center of a scathing report about bloody attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. On Wednesday, four State Department officials, including two who oversaw security decisions at the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, were disciplined after a review of security failures there, senior State Department officials told CNN. One resigned, while three others have been placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. An independent review released Tuesday cited ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" at the agency Clinton heads. The review board completed its investigation this week. Clinton received a copy of the report on Monday and said in letters to the heads of those committees that she accepted every one of its recommendations, including strengthening security, adding fire safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas. Benghazi siege: The ambassador's last minutes . Citing health reasons, Clinton delays testimony . Clinton, who had been recovering from stomach flu last week and a concussion following a fainting spell, informed the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees over the weekend that, at the advice of her doctors, she would be unable to testify at upcoming hearings about the deadly events in Benghazi. In her place, deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns testified on Thursday. Read more about the Benghazi hearing . Initially, that did not sit well with some members of Congress, especially Republicans, who have been highly critical of the Obama administration's handling of the Libya attack. CNN Poll: Majority dissatisfied but don't think administration misled on Benghazi attack . ""I know that Secretary Clinton was unable to be able to testify tomorrow in an open setting,"" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, told reporters Wednesday. ""I do think it's imperative for all concerned that she testify in an open session prior to any changing of the regime. I think that that's very important for her, I think it's very important for our country, and I think it's very important to really understand sort of the inner workings of the State Department itself."" Clinton to testify before House panel in January . However late Wednesday, House Foreign Affairs Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, indicated that Clinton will indeed testify in front of the committee sometime in mid-January. Ros-Lehtinen issued a statement saying, ""We still don't have information from the Obama administration on what went so tragically wrong in Benghazi that resulted in the deaths of four patriotic Americans. We have been combing through classified and unclassified documents and have tough questions about State Department threat assessments and decision-making on Benghazi. This requires a public appearance by the Secretary of State herself. Other Cabinet secretaries involved should also be held publicly accountable."" Lawmakers are right to demand answers of Clinton, said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. ""Hillary Clinton must take her fair share of responsibility for the mismanagement that led to the Benghazi disaster. And I believe she has. Her response to it, the appointment of a serious review effort led by (Ambassador Thomas) Pickering and (Adm. Mike) Mullen, its swift, thorough and unflinching completion of its duties and her acceptance of all its recommendations has been a textbook case of how to handle a crisis responsibly,"" Rothkopf said. Sizing up Kerry as secretary of State . It is a crisis that has left an indelible mark on the careers of several high profile Obama administration officials. Rice attacked for Benghazi comments . U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice withdrew her name from consideration to become the top U.S. diplomat after drawing heavy criticism from Arizona Sen. John McCain and other Republicans over her public statements about the Benghazi attacks. In a letter to Obama, Rice said the Senate ""confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive, and costly â€” to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities. That trade off is simply not worth it to our country."" Clinton praised Rice as a capable leader and insisted ""she made very clear in her appearances that the information was subject to change, as more facts were gathered and analyzed by the intelligence community"" in a press conference at the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) conference in Dublin earlier this month. Disciplinary actions at State . Eric Boswell, assistant secretary of diplomatic security, has resigned his post. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb is among the other three officials placed on administrative leave pending further action, a source told CNN. Boswell and Lamb oversaw security for the Benghazi mission. Lamb testified before Congress about the security precautions. Documents show Lamb denied repeated requests for additional security in Libya. State Department resignations follow Benghazi report . But there is no reason to think Clinton's presidential prospects are dimmed, political experts say. Positive public support . Before the report came out, Clinton had enjoyed wildly popular approval ratings in nationwide polls. A Bloomberg National Poll released this month showed 70% of Americans have a mostly or very favorable view of Clinton, with 24% holding a mostly or very unfavorable opinion of the nation's top diplomat. Similar polls from Politico/George Washington University, ABC News/Washington Post and the Siena College Research Institute showed consistent high marks. ""The report certainly isn't the 'hail and farewell' Hillary Clinton hoped for, and it isn't pretty. But two points: Clinton has been in the national public eye for 20 years, so any new piece of information is put into a much larger context. That will help her,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Though the Benghazi attacks will likely come up should Clinton venture a presidential run, the impact will have lessened, Sabato said. ""Think about 2012 when Benghazi was a fresh issue. How much did it help the GOP in the end? Somewhere between nada and zilch. Only a small portion of the electorate seemed interested, and overwhelmingly, they were already voting Republican,"" Sabato said. ""I have a hard time believing that Benghazi will make much difference after the passage of four more years."" Rothkopf agrees. ""I do not believe the Benghazi case will have any impact on her presidential prospects. No one in public life for as long as she has been has an absolutely blemish-free record, and hers is vastly more distinguished and blemish-free than most,"" Rothkopf said. ""Further, truth be told, the misfires prior to Benghazi really occurred much farther down the food chain within the State Department,"" he said. ""Suggesting errors in judgment regarding a particular post in a particular country fall within the direct purview of the Secretary of State is a gross misreading of the nature and demands of her job.""

"(CNN) -- In the wake of revelations about the National Security Agency's monitoring of traffic on the private international fiber links connecting the data centers of Google and Yahoo, Google stepped up its efforts to encrypt internal server traffic and block such monitoring. Now, Yahoo has announced its own plans to encrypt all information that travels between data centers by early next year. In a blog post, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer reiterated that ""Yahoo has never given access to our data centers to the NSA or any other government agency. Ever."" Yahoo previously announced that it would protect Yahoo Mail sessions by default with Secure Socket Layer encryption by January 8, using a 2048-bit encryption key. Google moved to encrypt all its searches earlier this fall, and the company has enabled SSL encryption by default for users logged into its services since 2011. In addition to encrypting traffic between its data centers by March of 2014, Yahoo is also moving to apply SSL encryption across all its websites within the same time frame. And Mayer said that Yahoo will ""work closely with our international Mail partners to ensure that Yahoo co-branded Mail accounts are HTTPS-enabled."" The move will increase the privacy of Yahoo users, but it also comes after Yahoo's Web sessions and internal data center traffic were revealed to at one point be the largest single source of data collected by the NSA, according to documents shared by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Friday outlined steps to reform U.S. intelligence gathering measures after they came under scrutiny following their revelation by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, saying the classified leaks created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard Americans. Since Snowden leaked secret documents to the media, critics have called the NSA's domestic surveillance -- including a program that monitors the metadata of domestic phone calls -- a government overreach. Many of those same critics have asked the Obama administration and Congress to rein in the programs. ""Given the history of abuse by governments, it's right to ask questions about surveillance, particularly as technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives,"" Obama said during a news conference in the East Room of the White House. Documents shed light on U.S. surveillance programs . But the president slammed the release of the information that has ""come out in dribs and drabs,"" saying a general impression has taken hold ""that we are somehow out there willy-nilly sucking information from everybody."" At the same time, Obama sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place, while acknowledging the need for transparency. Among the steps being taken, according to the president: Working with Congress to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public, including the legal rationale for government collection activities; and appointing a high-level, independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies. ""There's no doubt Mr. Snowden's leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than if I had simply appointed this review board,"" the president said. Snowden's e-mail provider shuts down amid court battle . 'Take a pause' But Obama refused any characterization of Snowden as a ""whistle-blower"" or ""patriot,"" saying there were ""other avenues"" the former NSA contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information. Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, has been charged with three felony counts related to the leaks, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. If Snowden believes his actions were right, ""he can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case,"" the president said. Snowden was granted temporary asylum in Russia, a move that further strained already tense relations between Washington and Moscow. Obama said that his decision to not go to Moscow next month for a summit was not solely related to Russia's decision to grant asylum to Snowden. He said the United States must ""take a pause"" and ""calibrate the relationship"" with Russia to assess where things stand, while ""recognizing there are going to be some differences and we are not always going to agree."" Obama cancels talks with Putin ahead of G-20 summit . Relations between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin have foundered over a number of issues, including their sharp differences over Syria, missile defense and, most recently, a new anti-gay law signed by Putin that could put gay and lesbian athletes at risk of arrest in next year's winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Since Putin's election as president, Obama believes there has been a return to some Cold War attitudes with ""more rhetoric on the Russia side that was anti-American."" ""I've encouraged Mr. Putin to think forward as opposed to backwards on those issues with mixed success,"" the president said. 'No Olympic boycott' Obama rejected calls to boycott the 2014 Winter Olympics unless the law is repealed, saying it would hurt American athletes who have trained and sacrificed to make it to the Olympics. ""One of the things I'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we're seeing there,"" Obama said. ""If Russia doesn't have gay or lesbian athletes, then that would probably make their team weaker."" It had been more than three month since the president took questions from reporters in the White House briefing room, and much has transpired since then, including the recent closing embassies in Africa, the Middle East and Asia because of a heightened terror threat. If he headed out to his Martha's Vineyard vacation this weekend without addressing the issues, ""it would be seen as a mistake,"" said Candy Crowley, CNN's chief political correspondent. ""The most immediate topic, I think, on his plate, has got to be what's going on in terms of terrorism and the closing of the embassies."" Last week, officials shuttered 22 U.S. embassies and consulates for the day on Sunday amid fears of an al Qaeda attack. On Sunday afternoon, the State Department said it had extended embassy and consulate closures in 15 of the locations until Friday and later added four other posts to the list. The decision was seen as unprecedented from many in the diplomacy and intelligence communities. A senior state department official said Friday that the majority of those posts will reopen on Sunday. Al Qaeda threat . On Friday, Obama declined to answer questions about reported U.S. drone strikes against militants in Yemen in recent weeks that have left at least 34 people dead, saying he would not discuss operations. The core leadership of al Qaeda has been decimated, but the terror group's offshoots -- such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula operating in Yemen -- still possess the ability to threaten U.S. embassies and businesses. ""We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is weaken it and strengthen our partnerships"" so it cannot pose the type of threat seen on 9/11, he said. Obama's administration has been under fire in recent months over its response to the attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that left U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. Asked why Obama has not made good on a promise to get those responsible for the September 2012 attack, he said: ""I also said we would get bin Laden, and I didn't get him in 11 months."" A sealed federal indictment has been issued in the Benghazi case, and ""it's sealed for a reason,"" Obama said. Immigration, health care . Among the other issues Obama discussed during the news conference: . -- Immigration: Obama believes there are enough votes in the House to pass a Senate immigration reform bill, which would allow undocumented immigrants an opportunity to become U.S. citizens. The bill also increases border security and penalties for employers who knowingly hire people not authorized to work in the United States. ""I'm absolutely confident that if the bill was on the floor of the House, it would pass,"" he said. House leaders have refused to take up the bill, saying it will not solve the immigration problem. Instead, they have proposed a series of issue-oriented bills, such as border security. ""I don't know a law that solves a problem 100%,"" Obama said. Opinion: Crunch time for immigration, budget fights . -- Health care: Obama warned against a Republican threats to shut down the government if it can't defund the president's health care law, saying it was a bad idea. ""The idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea,"" Obama said. Meanwhile, Obama said the decision to delay for a year a portion of the health care law known as the ""shared responsibility payment,"" which requires businesses of a certain size to pay a fine if they fail provide health insurance, was drawing criticism because of the politicization of the issue. ""In implementing the Affordable Healthcare Act, there are going to be some glitches,"" Obama said, adding the were the same kind of obstacles that the government ran into when the country was adopting Social Security and Medicare. ""...That's true of a car company rolling out a new car. That's true of Apple rolling out a new iPad."" -- Federal Reserve chair: The president said Lawrence Summers and Janet Yellen were both highly qualified to be the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, but said there were ""a range"" of candiates for the job. The term for Ben Bernanke, the current Federal Reserve chair, ends in 2014, and Obama said he will make a decision about who will replace Bernanke in the fall.

"(CNN) -- Efforts to remove cats from Macquarie Island, a sub-Antarctic island and World Heritage Site, have indirectly led to environmental devastation, according to a report published in the Journal of Applied Ecology. Finch Creek on Macquarie Island in 2007 shows lack of vegetation on the island compared to 2001... The removal of cats has led to a boom in the island's rabbit population -- another species introduced by humans -- causing widespread devastation to the island's vegetation. According to the study's lead author, Dr. Dana Bergstrom of the Australian Antarctic Division: ""Satellite images show substantial island-wide rabbit-induced vegetation change. By 2007, impacts on some protected valleys and slopes had become acute. We estimate that nearly 40 percent of the whole island area had changed, with almost 20 percent having moderate to severe change."" The removal of the invasive species from Macquarie Island, situated halfway between Australia and Antarctica, also serves as a wider warning about human interference in ecosystems and how good intentions can go awry. It is a case from which important lessons must be learned, according to the report's authors. The scientists behind the study claim that the Macquarie Island is a rare example of so-called ""trophic cascades"" -- the knock-on effects of changes in one species' abundance across several links in the food chain. As well as species extinction, in extreme cases it can even lead to an ecosystem ""meltdown"". ""This study is one of only a handful which demonstrate that theoretically plausible trophic cascades associated with invasive species removal not only do take place, but can also result in rapid and detrimental changes to ecosystems, so negating the direct benefits of the removal of the target species,"" says Bergstrom. Macquarie Island was discovered in 1810 with the remote island's seal and penguin population targeted for the fur trade. Cats were introduced to the island soon after to eat rats and mice that threatened to eat the sailors' grain stores. It was sealing gangs who then brought rabbits to the island in 1878 to give sailors something to eat. The rabbits provided easy prey for the island's cats, helping their number to grow, but the rabbit population was also causing catastrophic damage to the island's vegetation. Myxomatosis, a disease fatal to rabbits was introduced to the island in 1968 to try and curb their number. It worked at first as rabbit numbers fell from a peak of 130,000 in 1978 to less than 20,000 ten years later and vegetation recovered. However, with fewer rabbits as food, the cats began to eat the island's native burrowing birds, so a cat eradication program began in 1985. The last cat on the island was killed in 2000, and Myxomatosis had failed to keep rabbit numbers in check; their numbers bounced back and in little over six years rabbits substantially altered large areas of the island. According to Bergstrom: ""Increased rabbit herbivory has caused substantial damage at both local and landscape scales including changes from complex vegetation communities, to short, grazed lawns or bare ground."" Bergstrom hopes that the problems facing Macquarie Island are a cautionary tale for conservation agencies: ""Interventions should be comprehensive, and include risk assessments to explicitly consider and plan for indirect effects, or face substantial subsequent cost,"" says Bergstrom. The cost to remedy the problems of Macquarie Island is estimated at $16 million.","Absence of cats left rabbit population to devastate Macquarie Island's vegetation .

"Editor's note: Ron Paul is a Republican congressman from Texas who ran for his party's nomination for president this year. He is a doctor who specializes in obstetrics/gynecology and says he has delivered more than 4,000 babies. He served in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was elected again to Congress in 1996. Rep. Paul serves on the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Ron Paul says the government's solution to the crisis is the same as the cause of it -- too much government. (CNN) -- Many Americans today are asking themselves how the economy got to be in such a bad spot. For years they thought the economy was booming, growth was up, job numbers and productivity were increasing. Yet now we find ourselves in what is shaping up to be one of the most severe economic downturns since the Great Depression. Unfortunately, the government's preferred solution to the crisis is the very thing that got us into this mess in the first place: government intervention. Ever since the 1930s, the federal government has involved itself deeply in housing policy and developed numerous programs to encourage homebuilding and homeownership. Government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were able to obtain a monopoly position in the mortgage market, especially the mortgage-backed securities market, because of the advantages bestowed upon them by the federal government.   Laws passed by Congress such as the Community Reinvestment Act required banks to make loans to previously underserved segments of their communities, thus forcing banks to lend to people who normally would be rejected as bad credit risks. These governmental measures, combined with the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy, led to an unsustainable housing boom. The key measure by which the Fed caused this boom was through the manipulation of interest rates, and the open market operations that accompany this lowering. When interest rates are lowered to below what the market rate would normally be, as the Federal Reserve has done numerous times throughout this decade, it becomes much cheaper to borrow money. Longer-term and more capital-intensive projects, projects that would be unprofitable at a high interest rate, suddenly become profitable. Because the boom comes about from an increase in the supply of money and not from demand from consumers, the result is malinvestment, a misallocation of resources into sectors in which there is insufficient demand. In this case, this manifested itself in overbuilding in real estate. When builders realize they have overbuilt and have too many houses to sell, too many apartments to rent, or too much commercial real estate to lease, they seek to recoup as much of their money as possible, even if it means lowering prices drastically. This lowering of prices brings the economy back into balance, equalizing supply and demand. This economic adjustment means, however that there are some winners -- in this case, those who can again find affordable housing without the need for creative mortgage products, and some losers -- builders and other sectors connected to real estate that suffer setbacks. The government doesn't like this, however, and undertakes measures to keep prices artificially inflated. This was why the Great Depression was as long and drawn out in this country as it was. I am afraid that policymakers today have not learned the lesson that prices must adjust to economic reality. The bailout of Fannie and Freddie, the purchase of AIG, and the latest multi-hundred billion dollar Treasury scheme all have one thing in common: They seek to prevent the liquidation of bad debt and worthless assets at market prices, and instead try to prop up those markets and keep those assets trading at prices far in excess of what any buyer would be willing to pay. Additionally, the government's actions encourage moral hazard of the worst sort. Now that the precedent has been set, the likelihood of financial institutions to engage in riskier investment schemes is increased, because they now know that an investment position so overextended as to threaten the stability of the financial system will result in a government bailout and purchase of worthless, illiquid assets. Using trillions of dollars of taxpayer money to purchase illusory short-term security, the government is actually ensuring even greater instability in the financial system in the long term. The solution to the problem is to end government meddling in the market. Government intervention leads to distortions in the market, and government reacts to each distortion by enacting new laws and regulations, which create their own distortions, and so on ad infinitum. It is time this process is put to an end. But the government cannot just sit back idly and let the bust occur. It must actively roll back stifling laws and regulations that allowed the boom to form in the first place. The government must divorce itself of the albatross of Fannie and Freddie, balance and drastically decrease the size of the federal budget, and reduce onerous regulations on banks and credit unions that lead to structural rigidity in the financial sector. Until the big-government apologists realize the error of their ways, and until vocal free-market advocates act in a manner which buttresses their rhetoric, I am afraid we are headed for a rough ride. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Ron Paul: Too much government meddling in economy caused crisis .

The government isn't letting the market adjust prices to lower levels, Paul says .

"(CNN) -- It's not every day you get a chance to kiteboard across the Atlantic evading sharks after winning a social media competition. Eric Little's day job in insurance and retirement planning had hardly prepared him for the ""scary experience"" of coming up close and personal with a shark during a daredevil crossing of the Atlantic in a six-strong team of kiteboarders. Little, nicknamed 'Pequeno' -- Spanish for small -- was cruising the waves on the second day out of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands when he spotted the unmistakable fins ""about 24 feet away"" from his rig. The 30-year-old from West Bloomfield in Michigan was the final team member to be selected after winning a Facebook competition and had to put up with constant ribbing from his fellow team members about the incident during the remainder of the 27-day landmark crossing of the ocean. Kiteboarding harnesses the power of the wind using a large kite suspended on four lines and Little learned the ropes of the sport on the Great Lakes, but conditions in the Atlantic were altogether more challenging. Apart from the odd encounter with sharks, he also rode through schools of flying fish and had the unusual experience of surfing the waves through the night. The team, consisting of Little, four Dutchman and one woman -- 30-year-old Camilla Ringvold -- were assigned two shifts of two hours each per day -- one in the daylight and one at night -- so constant progress was made on the 4,000 mile (6,000km) plus crossing to their destination in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Support crew . A support boat -- a Lagoon 500 catamaran -- was a constant companion, with five crew members including the Dutch professional sailor Erik van Vuuren as team captain. Van Vuuren is a three-time world champion -- competing against the likes of Britain's sailing great Ben Ainslee -- but for the 43-year-old Dutchman this was an altogether different challenge. Constant vigilance was required in case the kiteboarders were dumped into the waters at high speeds, particularly in the dark and the crew had to develop rigorous safety procedures. Only at the finish after nearly a month at sea did Van Vuuren understand the physical and mental demands. ""When we came into the harbor I suddenly realized how tired I was,"" he told CNN. With his sailing expertise, Van Vuuren was one of the first people recruited to the challenge, which was the brainchild of Filippo van Hellenberg Hubar, who set up the Enable Passion Foundation with the express aim of completing inspiring and original challenges. Ground breaking feat . ""We have done something groundbreaking,"" said the 30-year-old Dutchman, but admitted he was in a ""state of shock"" at the finish on December 17. Van Hellenberg Hubar, found the night sessions the most exhilarating, ""the only thing you could see was the rope and the kite in front of you."" He added: ""Kitesurfing really went places with this challenge."" Kiteboarding or kitesurfing may indeed be going places, with another crew member, Max Blom, 28, from Amsterdam confident it will eventually be included in the Summer Olympics. Only a late volte face by the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) saw a decision to replace windsurfing with kitesurfing for the 2016 Games in Rio reversed. Blom makes his living in the sport's industry and believes its growing popularity lies in its wide appeal with all ages able to participate. ""You can just cruise around, but for me kitesurfing is a physical sport and very competitive."" During the Atlantic crossing, Blom lived up to his ethos, determined to clock up the most distance for a two-hour stint. ""74 kilometers,"" he said proudly. But he also acknowledged that it had been very much a team affair, with the only female team member playing her full part. ""Camilla was the lightest and took on the most squalls."" Girl power . Indeed Ringvold, from Norway, proved her worth on many occasions, particularly in lighter winds as they became becalmed. ""I would definitely do it again. I did not want to get off the boat,"" she reflected. The other female to actively participate -- a woman producer from a Dutch TV channel was on board to film the action -- was medic Sophie Cohen - a 28-year-old doctor from Amsterdam, who specializes in paediatrics. She was selected for her professional abilities and is also a trained sailor. But despite that experience, she admitted to a degree of trepidation throughout the challenge, in case of a major injury. ""A shark bite, or high impact trauma, that would have been a real problem,"" she said. ""We were really alone in the middle of the ocean."" Little's brush with a shark aside, the closest Cohen came to that nightmare scenario was an accident which befell Dennis Gijsbers, who ""got it a bit wrong"" at the start of a new stint. Gijsbers was forced under a support dinghy moving at five knots for about five seconds -- ""it felt like 15 seconds"" -- and only narrowly escaped serious injury, other than a few cuts and bruises. ""She (Cohen) was checking my lungs and I threw up a lot of salt water,"" he said. Danger guy . It underlined the inherent risks in the challenge, ""I was the danger guy,"" joked Gijsbers, but each team member was hand picked for their abilities. Ike Frans was the oldest kiteboarder at 40 years of age, but is the Dutch champion in the sport of Stand Up Paddle, where competitors propel themselves on a flat surfboard using only a single paddle. ""It was 11 people on the boat all working together, real teamwork,"" he said. Frans was grateful to Van Vuuren and his skill when he went down during a night stint and was picked up within minutes. In pitch darkness it proved a surreal experience, ""the water is nice and clear, an island of light around you,"" Frans recalled, but he was grateful for the prompt rescue. Glorious arrival . The team eventually arrived to ""red carpet"" treatment at a luxury resort complex in the Turks and Caicos, and a glowing tribute from the governor of the British overseas dependency. ""The feat of the Enable Passion organization in completing this marathon across one of the world's wildest oceans is awe inspiring,"" said Peter Beckingham. It remains to be seen whether other relay teams attempt to beat their new record but for now Van Hellenberg Hubar is content to live with the memories. ""We crossed the Atlantic ocean sailing and kiting and it was perfect,"" he said with pride. Meanwhile Little will go back to his desk in the U.S. and dream of getting the call for the next challenge. ""Time will tell. We shall see, we shall see,"" he said.","Six-strong team of kiteboarders set record for relay crossing of Atlantic .

"(CNN) -- Two new Pokémon games, ""Pokémon X"" and ""Pokémon Y,"" have taken the gaming world by storm, selling more than 4 million units globally in their first two days of availability, and tracking to become the fastest-selling games of all time for the handheld Nintendo 3DS. Not bad for a franchise that got its start in 1996 on the Nintendo Game Boy handheld console. But the president of the Pokémon Company said the new games stay true to their roots of bringing people together to play while offering a new blueprint for the universe of pocket monsters. ""From the beginning, communication between players has been the primary goal for the Pokémon brand,"" Tsunekazu Ishihara told CNN. ""Today, the ability to connect millions of people around the world via Wi-Fi is why launching 'Pokémon X' and 'Pokémon Y' simultaneously worldwide was an ambitious yet important goal."" Since debuting in video and card games, Pokemon has become a cultural phenomenon across the globe. There have been cartoons, cereals and a feature-length film, not to mention the national and global tournaments that draw thousands of players. ""Gotta catch 'em all"" is the franchise's catch phrase, referring to the player's goal of catching and training the tiny monsters to compete against other players. That's gotten significantly harder, though, with the expansion to more than 700 different known creatures in the universe. Unlike previous titles that were named after colors, ""Pokémon X"" and ""Pokémon Y"" represent a more analytical way of developing the games for The Pokémon Company and Nintendo. Ishihara said it required designers to understand that not all Pokémon gamers play for the same reasons. ""X and Y represent the X-axis and the Y-axis, but not in a scientific sense,"" he said. ""Each person's thought process, though different, tends to intersect somewhere. I'd like to think this commonality or intersection occurs when people of diverse backgrounds play 'Pokémon X' and 'Pokémon Y' together."" Developers also included a new transformation ability called Mega Evolution. As Pokémon battle and gain experience, they evolve into stronger forms of themselves with improved skills and stats. Mega Evolution allows the creature to temporarily become stronger in battle. Here's the catch: not all Pokémon can Mega Evolve. ""(This) requires players to use new strategies while they play, taking the brand to a new dimension,"" Ishihara said. ""This is yet another reason we chose titles that were theoretical instead of names based on colors or precious stones."" Keeping the franchise fresh for fans while making it accessible to a new audience is important to Ishihara. Pokémon is the second-best-selling gaming franchise in the world, trailing only the ""Mario"" series. Recognizing that its place in video game history is assured, Ishihara said new technology allows designers to do things with Pokemon they couldn't do in previous titles. ""Maintaining a balance of familiarity and innovation is important,"" he said. ""Ever-evolving technology helps maintain that balance, because we can progress aspects of the game that people enjoy already and add things like new communication features that could only be imagined five, ten years ago."" ""We feel this balance is key to the franchise's success and longevity. In 'Pokémon X' and 'Pokémon Y,' I think we do an excellent job of introducing the basics of the game to the player in a natural way, building their understanding step after step, all while ensuring the pacing allows the longtime fan to jump in and progress quickly to the more challenging portions of the gameplay."" The two new titles represent the franchise's first foray onto the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The visual enhancements give players the opportunity to see their favorites move and interact in ways they never could before. The technical abilities of the 3DS let players see their favorite moves and interactions in new ways, as well as play with other gamers around the world. Ishihara said in late December that a new cloud service called Pokémon Bank would let players move their creatures back and forth between games -- a service fans have been asking for for many years. ""We have to stick to the core of the franchise -- the collecting, battling and trading -- while at the same time we have to take advantage of the new technology and the evolution of the hardware to expand on the aspect of communication,"" he said. ""We also need to make sure that it's fun and rewarding to do each of these things. It's not an easy task."" Despite the advancements in technology, improvements to the look and intense level of fan interest, Ishihara believes that the franchise's simple, original goal -- to bring people together -- works as well today as it did 17 years ago. ""The Pokémon universe is incredibly fun and diverse, and like the world we all live in, continues to surprise and excite us,"" he said. ""I'm really excited to continue working to connect people in ways we only dreamed about when we first started. There is still so much to discover, so many Pokémon to find."" Gotta catch 'em all indeed.","""Pokemon X"" and ""Pokemon Y"" are the franchise's first games for the Nintendo 3DS .

"Washington (CNN) -- Julia Pierson became the first female director of the U.S. Secret Service in March 2013, tapped to change the culture of an agency that was then marred by a Colombian prostitution scandal. Eighteen months later, she's been ousted as the agency faces a harsh new round of criticism. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Wednesday that he had accepted Pierson's resignation -- and that he is appointing an independent panel to investigate a Sept. 19 incident that saw Omar Gonzalez run deep inside the White House, carrying a knife, before Secret Service agents tackled him. Related: Secret Service Julia Pierson resigns . ""I think it's in the best interest of the Secret Service and the American public if I step down,"" Pierson told Bloomberg News after resigning Wednesday. ""Congress has lost confidence in my ability to run the agency. The media has made it clear that this is what they expected."" ""I can be pretty stoic about it, but not really,"" she reportedly said. ""It's painful to leave as the agency is reeling from a significant security breach."" Pierson's resignation marks the end of a 30-year career with the Secret Service that included stints on the protective details of presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Pierson became the Secret Service's chief of staff in 2008, according to her official bio. She had been the assistant director of the Office of Human Resources and Training, and held the title of deputy assistant director in the Office of Protective Operations and the Office of Administration. Pierson started her career in law enforcement as a police officer in Orlando. She joined the Secret Service in 1983, working in the Miami and Orlando field offices. Her appointment came after the resignation of Mark Sullivan, who retired the year after 13 Secret Service employees were caught in a scandal over prostitutes who were brought to a Colombian hotel where they were staying as they prepared for an Obama trip to the area. ""I'm disappointed that I didn't have an opportunity to implement structural and operational changes in the agency,"" Pierson told Bloomberg News. ""I had a vision for the future. It's 31 years of service and a firm understanding of the organization."" Obama called Pierson on Wednesday to ""express his appreciation for her service to the agency and to the country,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. ""She dedicated more than 30 years of her life to the United States Secret Services and to the important work that they do over there,"" Earnest said, commending Pierson for spending ""several hours in front of the cameras"" in Tuesday's House hearing. ""In the context of that interaction, she took responsibility for the shortcomings of the agency that she led and she took responsibility for fixing them,"" he said. ""That quite simply is a testament to her professionalism and her character."" Lawmakers who had criticized the Secret Service's performance in a hearing Tuesday said her departure was the right move. ""As I told Ms. Pierson in our phone call earlier today, we appreciate her thirty years of service to our nation, to the Secret Service, and to multiple presidents,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, who had called for Pierson's ouster earlier Wednesday. ""I absolutely respect her decision, and now we have to ensure that we focus on the difficult work of fully restoring the Secret Service to its rightful status as the most elite protective service in the world,"" he said. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) told CNN that Pierson's performance in Tuesday's hearing ""didn't inspire any confidence."" ""Those of us that were sitting in that room in a bipartisan way I think left with less confidence in her rather than more,"" he said. ""It was not a good showing."" House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said his panel will continue to investigate the agency. ""Problems at the Secret Service pre-date Ms. Pierson's tenure as director, and her resignation certainly does not resolve them,"" he said.","Julia Pierson was the first female director of the U.S. Secret Service.
She was appointed in 2013 after a prostitution scandal marred the agency.
Her resignation ends a 30-year career with the Secret Service."
"(CNN) -- ""People think that education lasts until you graduate from school. But I think that people should continue to learn even after graduation."" -- Yasuaki Sakyo . Yasuaki Sakyo believes that education should be lifelong and open to everyone. Tokyo's bustling, youthful Shibuya district, the backdrop for much of the indie film ""Lost In Translation,"" is a hip, neon-lit hub for Japan's cutting-edge set. Its crammed streets, flashy fashions and hectic pace make it an exhilarating experience that's often intimidating for the faint hearted. But behind this flamboyant exterior, Shibuya is also home to an organization with a deeper passion -- for learning. Founded in 2006, Shibuya University is a new system of education that's firmly rooted in its local community. There are no entrance examinations; classes take place in the city's surroundings; and teachers come from all walks of life. Shibuya University is led by Yasuaki Sakyo, a 28-year-old ex-accountant. Sakyo believes passionately that education is for life, that we can all learn from each other and that teaching shouldn't be confined to the classroom. Sakyo was working for trading company Sumitomo when he read about Shibuya Ward assembly member Hasabe Ken's idea of a university based within the Shibuya community that focused on lifelong education. Sakyo was intrigued. He was seeking a new mission: one that would bring benefits to his community. The two men discussed their visions of a university that was open to all; then Sakyo quit his job to run the Shibuya project. In November 2005, a group of interested parties discussed what sort of organization it should be. For a year, they planned Shibuya University; the first classes began in September 2006. ""Shibuya, where people usually come to enjoy themselves, is full of wonderful things"" Sakyo told CNN. ""My idea was to bring together the most interesting elements of education and the attractive parts of Shibuya."" This free-flowing approach to learning contrasts markedly with the stiff, conformist image of traditional Japanese education. Shibuya acts as a catalyst, breathing knowledge and life through the community. Its classes, which range from traditional Japanese culture to environmental issues, are enormously popular, with many oversubscribed. Its ""classrooms"" have included shopping complexes, museums and the gardens of Meiji Shrine. There's no clear distinction between students and teachers and no graduation from classes. Teachers have ranged from janitors to best-selling sports writers. Students are mainly in their 20s and 30s, although Sakyo hopes that the university's appeal will broaden to wider age groups. In the future, Sakyo hopes Shibuya will grow. ""I want [it] to help Shibuya become a better place,"" he says. The university may act as a model for similar projects: Sakyo's vision of a symbiosis between learning and the community has sparked interest from London, the U.S. and Taiwan. But Sakyo says his own future is to continue on his mission to serve his community. ""For me personally, my goal has no end,"" he told CNN. ""I think maybe I will continue thinking about improving society in the way that I imagine. I'd like to play a part in making these things happen. So my goal is just to keep going."" ........................ Read an interview with Yasuaki Sakyo and explore his vision for learning that's rooted in the community of Shibuya.

"(CNN) -- It was 1993 when David Wood got his first look at the World Wide Web. Working as a consultant for the city of Palo Alto, California, in the epicenter of the dotcom universe, some researchers pulled up a Web page created by the Vatican, showcasing some of its artwork. ""The Web pages back then had that gray and black text and embedded images. There was no fancy layout; it was very simplistic,"" he said. ""But it was powerful. I said, 'My God, this is it. This is what's going to define the next phase of my life.' It was a quite powerful, transformative concept."" It's hard for some of us to imagine now. But before broadband and YouTube, before instant streaming and overnight deliveries from Amazon, the early Web was a slow, simple and sparsely populated place. As the Web turns 25 this week, folks who remember those early days have been reminiscing about life online in the early to mid-1990s. One word that comes up over and over again? ""Slow."" A 1995 survey by the Pew Research Center found that just 14% of U.S. adults had Internet access, and among them, only 2% had access via a top-of-the-line 28.8k modem. ""That was screaming (fast),"" said Lee Rainey, the director of Pew's Internet Project. ""Now, that would make people riot in the streets, it's so slow."" Wood, now chief technology officer with linked-data company 3 Round Stones, would go on to a career on the Web and to author several books about it. But in the early to mid-'90s, it wasn't always an easy sell. ""When I would show people the Web on dial-up, you'd whip out a laptop and dial up with a 14.4k modem,"" he said. ""The page might take a minute or two or three or five to come down. You could see the hasher lines coming across from left to right as the page would slowly load. ""People would look at this and say, 'Why is this interesting?' "" Invented by Tim Berners-Lee, the Web made accessing the Internet (no, they're not the same thing) easier for millions. ""The really early users were total geeks,"" Rainey said. ""They had to know coding. They had to know sophisticated prompts to get information from different places. They had to tell their computers so they would know exactly where to go."" That started changing as folks started opening their mailboxes and finding discs from Web-portal services like AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy. But even that more-accessible Internet was a far cry from what we know today. ""It was mostly a text experience that was dominated, to some degree, by websites of major publishers who were just trying to use this new platform to essentially replicate what they already had,"" Rainey said. ""CNN.com was basically what was on television. The New York Times was basically what was in the paper."" Take a look at early versions of some of today's most popular websites, and the contrast is stark. Now, the homepage for the White House features an elegant design that incorporates hundreds of links to videos, photo galleries, podcasts and other media. In 1996, the same URL took you to a stretched-out glob of black text on a plain white background, topped by the oh-so-catchy headline ""Search White House Press Releases, Radio Addresses, Photos and Web Pages."" Go to Yahoo today, and you can scroll through a 95-image gallery of links to news stories, choose from a list of links to trending topics, check on your stocks or jump straight to Yahoo-owned services like Tumblr and Flickr. Time warp to 1996, and there's not a photo to be seen. Yahoo's homepage featured little more than a pile of hyperlinks that left half the page blank. Oh, and that movie you streamed last night? Or the song it took you 20 seconds to download from iTunes or Google Play? Few Web users were even dreaming about them. ""If you had a music player or other streaming device, it was very scratchy,"" Rainey said. ""Words were interrupted. There were lots of hiccups in the server. But people lived with that because it was kind of exciting to have it happening in the first place."" Wood concurs. For Web pioneers, and those who followed soon behind, experimenting with its emerging capabilities was, in part, its own reward. ""It's like coffee culture versus tea culture,"" he said. ""With coffee, you're gulping it down, trying to get your caffeine. Tea culture is more sipping and experiencing the taste. ""We had a sipping culture back then, and now we have a gulping culture. That's the big change. It was a small number of geeks who were tasting this concept for the first time. We were getting little bits. We were tasting them, and we were saying, 'How could this change the world?' ""","Early Web adopters recall the slower, simpler online life of the '90s .

"(CNN) -- Yahoo's purchase of hot blogging platform Tumblr, which it announced Monday, was big news for the hundreds of millions of folks who already post to the site or check in to follow those who do. But the $1.1 billion buyout will also no doubt introduce Tumblr to lots of folks not yet wholly familiar with it, even if their Web searches for viral memes and cute kittens have already landed them there unawares. So, here are some facts you need to know about Tumblr (which, in the grand tradition of Web startups everywhere, shed its ""e"" early on). It's big and getting bigger . Founded in 2007, Tumblr has stayed hot on a Web that can be unforgiving once it decides you're yesterday's news. While its numbers aren't comparable to social-networking giants like Facebook, they're certainly enough to put hundreds of millions more eyeballs on the ads Yahoo serves up as its bread and butter. Let's face it -- when the White House signs up for an account, you know you're onto something. To wit (according to the company): . Number of Tumblr blogs: 105 million . Monthly visitors: 300 million . Posts per second: 900 . New signups every day: 120,000 . It loves an animated GIF . If there was a ground zero for the rebirth of the Web's beloved video loops, it was Tumblr. Once relegated to the scrap heap of Web culture (we miss you, Peanut Butter Jelly Time), the past couple of years have reminded us of an enduring truth: It's fun to watch a cute duck, a bouncy Olympian or ""bros"" watching basketball over and over and over again. Tumblr's quick, visual-friendly publishing platform is perfect for GIFs. Nobody expects a 10,000-word essay. Make us laugh and all is well. Oh, and how did Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer choose to make the big announcement? On her own Tumblr. With an animated GIF. They've figured out mobile . Our society is becoming a mobile one and increasingly, phones and tablets are the preferred portals for people to access the Web. For example, more people now access Facebook via mobile than on the traditional Web (a fact the site has had to aggressively address to stay relevant and make stockholders happy). 5 questions answered about Facebook Home . But while some desktop titans are having to adjust, Tumblr is already living comfortably in that mobile world. More than half of Tumblr's 300 million users access it with its mobile app, and that crowd does so an average of seven times a day. There's kind of a lot of porn . Shocker -- there's porn on the Internet. But while most any corner of the Web that allows user posts is bound to have its share of naughty bits, Tumblr has become a go-to spot for adult-entertainment industry types and amateur smut-lovers alike. (The company, of course, doesn't say what percentage of its site is adult content, but a recent analysis puts it at over 11 percent.) And the site doesn't really shy away from that fact, acknowledging as much in its community guidelines. ""Tumblr is home to millions of readers and bloggers from a variety of locations, cultures, and backgrounds with different points of view concerning adult-oriented content,"" the entry reads, asking users only to make sure to identify such pages as NSFW (""not safe for work"") and, of course, not to post anything illegal. That's all well and good for an edgy startup, but could be an issue that needs to be tackled as Yahoo aims to appeal to as many advertisers as possible. In the meantime, just make sure you look for those four letters when searching the site. It's cool . For a few years, nobody's really been sure what Yahoo is, other than a place where an aging user base gets its e-mail and looks at a few news stories. Tumblr is Mayer's bid to get young and hip -- and it's not a bad bet. From ""Sh*t My Dad Says"" to ""Reasons My Son Is Crying,"" the most buzzed-about blogs of the past few years have tended to originate at Tumblr. Whether its ""Kim Jong Il Looking at Things"" or ""White Men Wearing Google Glass,"" fun and a little bit edgy isn't hard to find on the site.","Yahoo buying Tumblr is a bid to make its own base younger, cooler .
Founded in 2007, the site hosts 150 million blogs .
Animated GIFs saw a comeback on Tumblr .
There's lots of porn -- an issue Yahoo may have to address ."
"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Imagine a future in which icons flash on your car windshield, hologram style, as your car approaches restaurants, stores, historic landmarks or the homes of friends. Simply point your hand at them, and the icons open to show real-time information: when that bridge over there was built, what band is playing at that nightclub on the left, whether that new cafÃ© up the street has any tables available. Wave your hand again, and you've made a restaurant reservation. Mercedes-Benz showed off this vision of the future of driving -- complete with augmented-reality and gesture-controlled features -- this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show. CES is the world's biggest technology trade show, and carmakers are becoming a bigger presence here. Visitors climbed into a little cockpit at the Mercedes booth and took a brief, interactive and virtual ride through nighttime San Francisco -- with the high-tech windshield as a guide. ""Gesture is very intuitive. It's very natural,"" said Vera Schmidt, a user-interface designer with Mercedes who led demonstrations of the technology. ""You point at something, and you want to know more about it."" The technology is still crude, and at least several years away from finding its way into Mercedes vehicles. But it illustrates how automakers, while embracing current computer innovation such as dashboard touchscreens and voice-control interfaces, also are keeping an eye further down the road as well. As digital tech -- and our expectations for it -- becomes more mobile, carmakers are taking notice. Many automotive designers here seem to have taken inspiration from smartphones, with their promise of being always connected and their vast menu of apps for every purpose. ""Cars are becoming platforms to participate in the digital world in a fully networked sense, just like your tablets can and your phones can,"" said Venkatesh Prasad, a senior technical leader with Ford Motor Co.'s innovation division. ""It's our job to take those computing services people are used to at 0 mph and make them available at 70 mph."" Yes, that sounds a little scary. And with escalating concerns about the hazards of distracted driving, automakers must walk a fine line between convenience and safety. Automotive engineers are continually trying to simplify their interfaces to cut down on the precious seconds that a driver's attentions are diverted from the road ahead. ""All of our technology is voice-powered,"" Ford product manager Julius Marchwicki told CNN's sister network HLN. ""So instead of fumbling with your phone ... you keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road."" Sascha Simon, head of advance product planning for Mercedes-Benz USA, agreed: ""We determine which apps should be in the car and which shouldn't. We have these apps integrated in such a way that they're actually relevant to you."" For example, say you're running late to a meeting and can't call or text while driving. Mercedes' messaging app will create a menu of logical missives based on your location and your car's speed -- ""I'm stuck in traffic,"" or ""I'm just north of Bakersfield"" -- and display them on the screen. You scroll through them and push a button to post the one that fits, instead of having to manually type the words. Ford this week introduced five new apps for its pioneering Sync hands-free entertainment system, including Roximity, a daily-deals application that provides real-time discounts relevant to a driver's location. Ford is so committed to morphing its vehicles into digital platforms that the company is recruiting developers to create apps for Sync and plans to open a research lab in Silicon Valley this year. Meanwhile, Mercedes launched the second generation of its mbrace system, which connects drivers with the Web via customized apps that can be controlled by voice commands or on a dashboard touchscreen. Mbrace is now cloud-based, meaning it's always connected and its software can automatically update itself. Not to be outdone, Audi and Kia also have big presences at CES, and both announced updated versions of their Web-based dashboard entertainment systems. The boldest advancements in automotive tech, however, may be a few years away. All the major car companies are working on systems that would allow vehicles to talk to each other about road conditions, weather and traffic snarls. For example, a car swerving to avoid a tire in the road could send an instant message alerting surrounding vehicles to the hazard. Ford also is developing technology that takes a more holistic approach to driver safety and welfare. Instead of focusing on preventing collisions, for example, a car could help diabetic drivers by employing wireless sensors to monitor their glucose levels, said Gary Strumolo, Ford manager of vehicle design and infotronics. Or a car could help allergy sufferers by monitoring for high-pollen areas, then recirculating air within the vehicle instead of pulling it in from the outside, he said. Kia is testing something called the ""user-centered driving concept,"" which would emphasize safety by employing an infra-red LED and camera to monitor the driver's face for alertness. The system would recognize whether the driver's eyes are opened or closed, safeguarding against an accident caused by the driver falling asleep. All these advancements may make driving more interesting. Or they may spoil one of modern society's last refuges from the hyper-connected digital world. Either way, they are coming soon. ""We're working on a new generation of vehicles that truly serve as digital companions,"" said Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, in a keynote speech at CES. ""They learn your habits, adapt to your choices, predict you moves and interact with your social network.""","Many automotive designers seem to take inspiration from smartphones .

"(CNN) -- While recent nationalist gestures from Japan's political rulers continue to rile neighbors South Korea and China, a former prime minister is aiming to make some amends in his own way. Tomiichi Murayama, who served as the nation's premier from 1994 to 1996, visited South Korea this week for a three-day visit, during which he met with former comfort women in Seoul. On Tuesday, the first day of the 89-year-old's trip, he attended an exhibition of art made by women who had endured sexual slavery at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army. He was presented with an artwork entitled ""Flower destroyed unbloomed"" and shook the hands of the three former comfort women in attendance. Murayama told them to ""stay healthy."" One of the three, Kang Ul-Chul, told him that the Japanese government should fully apologize and offer compensation. Murayama said Japan's wartime policy of providing comfort women to its troops meant that it had committed ""indescribable wrongdoings,"" the Japan Times reported. The number of women who were enslaved by the Japanese from around 1932 during the colonization of the Korean peninsula up to and during the World War II, is dwindling. Hwang Keum-ja, an 89-year-old who was lured into sexual slavery in Japan's ""comfort stations"" during World War II, died earlier this month. READ MORE: Another voice lost, Korean 'comfort woman dies . Only 55 of the approximately 200,000 women subjected to the ordeal from around 1932 remain living. The issue of comfort women, and the Japanese acknowledgement of them, is controversial and consistently topical in South Korea. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs states: ""Japan has extended its sincere apologies and remorse to all those women on various occasions such as an apology statement by the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono in 1993."" The country has helped establish the Asian Women's Fund in 1995, which is supported by government funds and provides assistance to former comfort women. But it has resisted direct payments to the victims, prompting activists and former comfort women to say leaders are avoiding officially acknowledging what happened. Japan maintains that a 1965 treaty between the two nations have settled wartime compensation claims. The South Korean government however does not believe this is enough. Along with the surviving comfort women, it is calling for an official government apology, acknowledging legal responsibility for the crimes. Seoul wants Tokyo to provide direct compensation to the victims. Murayama is perhaps best-known for his 1995 address, known as the Murayama Statement, in which he apologized to the victims of Japanese aggression during World War II. It was hailed as a significant step and a catalyst for improving relations between Japan and its neighbors. Murayama also spoke at Korea's National Assembly this week, as part of a trip organized by Korea's minor opposition Justice Party, as well as meeting members of both the ruling party and the opposition. The country's president, Park Geun-hye, declined to meet Murayama, citing her schedule. She has previously refused to engage with the Japanese government until it fully acknowledges South Korea's historical grievances. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has ruffled his East Asian neighbors' feathers recently through high-profile nationalistic gestures, including a visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines the souls of some of Japan's war dead -- including several war criminals, and by suggesting that the Murayama statement be revised. Kyodo news reported that Murayama told Korean lawmakers on Wednesday that that Abe has said he will ""ultimately uphold"" the Murayama statement, but stopped short of elaborating on when Abe made the pledge. Territorial disputes -- most notably the claim of both countries on the islands known as Dokdo by South Koreans and Takeshima by the Japanese -- have added to the tension.","Ex-Japanese P.M. met former comfort women during three-day visit to South Korea .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's National Defense Commission has penned a letter to South Koreans saying it is determined ""to create an atmosphere of reconciliation and unity,"" the isolated nation's state news agency reported. But South Korea says it wants to see action not words from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime. In the letter, the North's defense commission vowed to work to ""completely halt hostile military acts, realize the reunion of separated families and relatives, ... and re-energize multi-faceted north-south cooperation and exchanges."" There was, however, a catch. The North Korean officials' peace proposals come with a request to halt upcoming U.S.-South Korean military drills and a reiteration of Pyongyang's claim to its own ""precious nuclear force for self-defense."" A call last week by North Korea about the annual joint military exercises next month was swiftly dismissed by Seoul and Washington. The open missive this week was carried by KCNA, which for years has featured reports deriding South Korea and its longtime ally, the United States. It touts the proposal by North Korean authorities last week that signals ""the steadfast will of its army and people to improve the North-South relations by concerted efforts of the two sides, not asking about all inglorious happenings in the past."" ""The North-South relations will be improved on a solid basis only when both sides take realistic measures to prevent impending nuclear disasters with concerted efforts of the Korean nation,"" the commission wrote in a letter reportedly written Thursday and put out the next day. But South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Eui-do said later Friday that if the North is sincere about improving ties, it ""must show action"" that South Korean citizens and the international community can accept. That notably includes North Korea showing how it will take steps to dismantle its controversial nuclear program and making efforts to resolve humanitarian issues, like the reunions of families separated by the Korean War. Hard to read . Many in Seoul and elsewhere have long been wary of Pyongyang's motives and intentions. South Korean President Park Geun-hye told CNN's Paula Hancocks earlier this month that she feels it is now especially hard to make sense of what's happening or will happen next inside North Korea. She referenced the recent unforeseen execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle and perceived protector, Jang Song Thaek, as proof. ""North Korea has always been very unpredictable, but the level of unpredictability has, in fact, (been) exacerbated,"" Park said. ""I'm concerned about deepening volatility."" North Korea's latest letter touches on many of the same points, and highlights similar proposals, to a statement addressed to South Korean authorities last week. The two statements are among the more conciliatory and less combative communications from Pyongyang in recent years. In his New Year's address earlier this month, Kim Jong Un called for better relations with the South. Tensions last year . The relationship between Seoul and Pyongyang became particularly strained last year as North Korea hurled dramatic threats against South Korea and the United States. Pyongyang has continued to develop its nuclear and long-range missile programs despite widespread international opposition. Early last year, tensions simmered near the boiling point: North Korea's army declared the armistice ending the 1950 to 1953 armed conflict to be invalid on March 11, and a few weeks later, state news reported that Pyongyang had entered a ""state of war"" and threatened to ""dissolve"" the U.S. mainland. ""Any issues regarding North and South will be treated in accordance to the state of war,"" North Korea's government said in a special statement carried by KCNA. The tensions have since eased somewhat and Pyongyang and Seoul have resumed dialogue on a certain number of issues, including their joint industrial zone that sits on the North's side of the border. Dispute over drills . In last week's statement, a North Korean government spokesman conveyed Kim Jong Un's ""sincere stand to ease tension and ensure peace"" while also slamming ""ill-boding, provocative remarks ... from South Korea"" as well as ""powder-reeking war exercises"" involving the United States. ""The recent announcement of the huge DPRK-targeted war drills by the U.S. and puppet warmongers is a total denial of the improvement of the North-South ties and dialogue and is little short of the declaration of a total nuclear stand-off,"" said the spokesman. North Korea has in previous years called for the cancellation of the annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, but without success. The drills appeared to be a key cause of Pyongyang's threatening rhetoric last year. The United States reiterated Thursday that it won't call off the drills with South Korea, which start next month. ""We don't plan to stop the exercises,"" Adm. Samuel Locklear III, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, told reporters. ""The exercises are ... a cornerstone of how we train and maintain the alliance... It's not a change. We do these every year."" Notably, North Korea's latest message jabbed directly -- as it has in the past -- at South Korea's international allies. And the commission didn't entirely spare Seoul either, chiding leaders there for not embracing its ""important"" initiative. ""Regretfully, ... the South Korean authorities still remain unchanged in its improper attitude and negative stand towards the proposal,"" the letter states. ""What is most important for mending the inter-Korean ties is to have a proper attitude and stance towards this issue."" Journalist Soo Bin Park contributed to this report.","NEW: South Korea says the North needs to show its sincere through action .

"(CNN) -- Thirty years ago, 909 Americans were led to their death by the Rev. Jim Jones in a mass murder-suicide pact in a South American jungle, shortly after Jones' gunmen killed a visiting U.S. congressman and four others at a nearby airstrip. One-third of the victims were children. Many were killed by Jones' aides, who squirted cyanide down their throats. Of the nearly 1,000 church members who began the day in Jonestown, a cult commune, only 33 survived to see the next day. The following is a thumbnail history of the Jonestown tragedy on Nov. 18, 1978:  What happened? More than 900 Americans died in a South American jungle upon the orders of Rev. Jim Jones, who had tried to create a socialist paradise that survivors called a slave camp. What led up to this? When California Rep. Leo Ryan arrived on a one-man investigative mission, bringing along a TV camera crew and various reporters, 15 church members asked to leave with him. Jones sent gunmen to a nearby airstrip, where they killed Ryan, an NBC correspondent and his cameraman, a newspaper photographer and one of the departing family members. Who was Jim Jones? He was a self-appointed minister from a small town in the Midwest, who first led his flock to California, where he hoped to avoid fallout from a possible nuclear war. He then moved his people to Guyana when he came under criticism for church beatings and financial abuses. Where did the money come from? Jones was a phony faith healer, and much of his money came in mail-order donations from the desperate. Elderly members handed over their Social Security checks, working adults gave 25 percent of their wages to the church and some signed over all their property. Government investigators would later find at least $10 million in Swiss banks, mainly in Panama. Another $1 million in cash was recovered in Jonestown. Did anyone survive? Thirty-three people who began that day in Jonestown escaped with their lives. There were two main groups of survivors. Eleven people, four of them small children, walked almost 30 miles through the jungle to another town. Fourteen departing church members lived through the airport ambush -- five of them youngsters who were lost for three days when they ran into the jungle to hide. See list of survivors  What happened to the killers? All but one of the airport gunmen died in the mass suicide. Larry Layton, who posed as a defector, was captured after badly wounding two people inside a plane trying to take off. He was not paroled from an American prison until 2002. How did Jones die? He did not drink the cyanide. He was shot in the head, probably by a trusted aide, at the very end. His body was among the first to be identified -- through fingerprints that had been taken after a vice squad arrest five years earlier in the men's room of a Los Angeles movie theater. What is left of Jonestown today? Nothing. The settlement has disappeared, the buildings dismantled and carried away by native Indians. Jungle weeds and trees have overgrown the area again. The only notable relic left to be found are the remains of one small rusting garden tractor. What persists is simply silence.","In 1978, 909 Americans were led to mass murder-suicide by Rev.

"(CNN) -- Months after apologizing for overeager users fingering innocent people as potential suspects in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, Reddit on Monday shut down a section devoted to chasing down the Washington Navy Yard shooter. Clicking on the page, or ""subreddit"" as specialized communities are called on the site, ""FindNavyYardShooters"" now leads to an image of a closed door wrapped in yellow ""Caution"" tape and a message saying it has been banned. ""We banned it because it violated site rules by encouraging the posting of personal information,"" Reddit general manager Erik Martin said in a prepared statement. ""We don't allow the posting of personal information under any circumstances."" The subreddit was created when authorities were still searching for suspects and it was unclear whether there was one shooter or multiple shooters. But Reddit shut it down almost immediately. Police have since named Aaron Alexis, 34, as the lone gunman. He was killed Monday in a shootout with security at the naval yard. In separate subreddit about Washington D.C., a related post, ""Active Shooter Washington Navy Yard,"" continued with Reddit's blessing. Users posted links to news sources, information from law enforcement and other official information in an effort to keep people informed in the shooting's aftermath. On Tuesday, some were speculating that the Navy Yard subreddit may have been a joke. The user who created it uses the name ""uglyredditors"" and may have just been trolling -- doing something stupid or cruel just to get a reaction out of others. Brian Merchant at Vice captured a screen shot of early conversation in the subreddit, which was mostly jokes, profanity and people saying the subreddit was a bad idea in light of Boston. ""Yes, nothing bad is going to come of this, surely"" one user wrote. ""Are they really going to let this s*** happen twice?"" In April, redditors banded together to try to piece together what happened in the Boston bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others. What resulted was the sharing of photos of ""suspects"" that had been taken near the marathon's finish line. Among other theories, users speculated that Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student who had been missing since March, could be a possible suspect in the bombings. Tripathi's family temporarily took down a Facebook page asking for help finding him after they were bombarded by ugly comments. Tripathi's body was found later that month in Rhode Island's Providence River. No foul play was suspected, police said, although an official cause of death has still not been reported. Amid the confusion over the Boston bombings, other Reddit users focused on two young men with heavy-looking bags, one of whom wore a blue track suit. The New York Post even splashed a photo of the two marathon spectators on its front page with the headline, ""Bag Men: Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon."" The guy in the track suit turned out to be a 17-year-old suburban Boston track star who told The Associated Press he was afraid to leave his house because of the scrutiny. ""We hoped that the crowdsourced search for new information would not spark exactly this type of witch hunt,"" Reddit's Martin said at the time. ""We were wrong."" Founded in 2005, Reddit has become a hugely popular site divided into more than 5,400 communities that have essentially revamped the early Web's bulletin boards, with users posting information, links and thoughts rapidly in real time. It has almost 70 million monthly users.","Reddit shuts down community created to seek Navy Yard shooters .

"(CNN)  -- Like shifting weight on a seesaw, the Pentagon moved the lion's share of U.S. war troops in Iraq to Afghanistan in 2010, to reflect the nation's changing war strategy. Just months after Obama promised to reduce U.S. forces in Iraq, he faced a much-debated decision last year on whether to increase troops in Afghanistan.   Supporters of the buildup said the strategy would bring a swifter end to the war, by allowing the United States to more quickly hand over security responsibility to Afghan forces. Opponents complained that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai was corrupt and had proven to be an unreliable partner. The nine-year U.S.-led war against the Taliban and al Qaeda has claimed the lives of more than 1,070 American troops in both hostile and non-hostile deaths. Following the fiery Capitol Hill debate, Obama ordered an additional 30,000 forces to deploy to Afghanistan. Leadership of the Afghan war became a political bombshell in June, when Rolling Stone reported that the war's U.S. commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, had made politically explosive remarks about key administration officials. Among the reported comments, McChrystal and his staff imagined ways of dismissing Vice President Joe Biden.  Obama said McChrystal's conduct ""does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general"" and undermined both civilian authority and trust. Obama accepted McChrystal's resignation and asked Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, to take over McChrystal's role. Under Obama's plan for the Afghanistan war, the United States will begin reducing troops in Afghanistan beginning in July 2011. In July, top House Democrats struggled to maintain support among more liberal lawmakers to pay for the Afghan war. Although the House gave final approval for almost $33 billion to fund U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, 102 Democrats joined 12 Republicans in voting against it. Rep. David Obey, D-Wisconsin, retiring chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, and a reluctant supporter of Obama's Afghan buildup in 2009, said he opposed the emergency funding bill because of questions over the prospects for U.S. success in Afghanistan. ""The Afghan government has not demonstrated the focused determination, reliability and judgment necessary to bring this effort to a rational and successful conclusion,"" said Obey. The federal government has ""appropriated over $1 trillion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to date, more than $700 billion to Iraq and $300 billion for Afghanistan,"" Obey noted. ""To those who say we must pay it because we're going after al Qaeda, I would note that Afghanistan is where al Qaeda used to be,"" he said. ""Today, there are fewer than 100 al Qaeda in Afghanistan, which was publicly confirmed last month by CIA chief (Leon) Panetta. Al Qaeda has relocated to other countries and regions."" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, called the Afghanistan war policy ""deeply flawed."" ""Occupying Afghanistan in support of a corrupt and incompetent government will continue to claim the lives of our soldiers,"" McGovern said. ""It will continue to bankrupt us, and it will not enhance our national security. ... It is a mistake to give this administration yet another blank check for this war."" The House also voted against a non-binding resolution that called for the withdrawal of all U.S. military personnel from Pakistan, which borders Afghanistan. Currently, the United States has more than 200 armed service members in Pakistan. Fueling liberal discontent with the war effort was the release by the whistle-blower website WikiLeaks of roughly 76,000 U.S. military and diplomatic reports about Afghanistan filed from 2004 to January 2010. McGovern is one of a bipartisan trio of lawmakers who has called on the commander in chief to announce an exact timetable for complete withdrawal from Afghanistan. ""United States military strategy in Afghanistan is not in our best national security interest and makes us dependent upon an unreliable partner in the Afghan government,"" said a letter to Obama signed by McGovern, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin and Rep. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina. Some political analysts wonder if Obama's war strategy might diminish voter turnout by anti-war liberals -- and help Republicans on Election Day. ""I think the Democratic base -- the danger is it becomes a no-show in 2010,"" Rep. Tom Andrews, an anti-war activist and Maine Democrat, told CNN. Washington has pressed Karzai to clean up alleged corruption in the government. Karzai's re-election victory was tainted by accusations of voter fraud. During his inauguration speech, Karzai promised to do more to fight corruption. He has said that by the end of 2010, Afghan forces will be able to take over some security responsibilities from international troops. Karzai has said he would like the Afghan government to have full responsibility for security by 2014. Iraq: U.S. combat role ending but issues remain . In Iraq, where U.S. troops have been deployed for seven years, Obama has pledged that U.S. forces will be pared down to between 35,000 and 50,000 troops by August 31, two months before U.S. voters head to the polls. War casualties have plummeted. In the past four years, attacks on coalition forces in Iraq have dwindled to about 100 per week from nearly 2,000 per week in 2006, according to the Brookings Institute, a Washington think-tank. Brookings' Iraq index estimates that there were 34,500 Iraqi civilian casualties in 2006. In 2009, 2,800 Iraqi civilians died violently. Obama has promised to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. Until then, the U.S. will ""retain a transitional force to carry out three distinct functions: Training, equipping and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non-sectarian; conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq."" After that, as Obama said when he announced the drawdown, Iraq's future is its own responsibility and the end of the war will ""enable a new era of American leadership and engagement in the Middle East."" But many U.S. veterans of the war will bear the wounds of their service for years to come. Doctors are diagnosing hundreds of thousands of cases of post-traumatic stress disorder among returning war vets. Some soldiers report difficulty getting treatment. For that, Obama has pledged to invest in new ways of identifying and treating combat injuries including PTSD and traumatic brain injury -- now known as the ""signature"" wounds of the war. Several 2010 House and Senate candidates served in the Iraq war and are including Iraq or veteran-related issues as part of their agenda. The government is reporting higher rates of homeless women veterans -- many of whom have children in their care. Congress is considering several bills aimed at helping veterans with housing and child care issues. The reduction of U.S. forces in Iraq is also prompting questions about the Pentagon bidding process for private military support contracts. Bipartisan heads of the Senate Homeland Security committee complained in May about what appeared to be decreased competition for a $568 million contract for support work in Iraq that was awarded to KBR, which had held the previous contract for services. The contract work, for everything from cleaning laundry to preparing food and providing fuel for troops and contractors in Iraq, covers the period between September 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011.","NEW: House Democrats struggle to maintain liberal support for Afghan war .

"(CNN) -- It may not be as gripping as a spy novel, but things are heating up after the latest reports of espionage by the U.S. National Security Agency. International leaders say they're outraged and the Obama administration says it's investigating. Here are five key questions to keep in mind: . 1. Are President Barack Obama's hands clean in this? It's not really clear. The Wall Street Journal reported an internal review of U.S. surveillance programs that started this summer revealed the NSA had tapped the phones of about 35 world leaders and that the White House ordered a halt to some of it. That would suggest the President did not know about the programs for the nearly five years he has been in office. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein says neither Obama nor her panel knew the United States was collecting communications of allied leaders, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel. A senior administration official separately confirms to CNN some details of the Journal report, saying the White House did not know about the program until an until an internal review over the summer, after which some of it was stopped. Targeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone, however, did not end until quite recently, the senior official said. 2. Was Obama kept in the dark? Another U.S. official says, however, that Obama was briefed and given detailed documents describing what's known as the framework for the surveillance programs. One targets leaders in specific countries, which he would have been briefed about. It's not known if the description mentioned Merkel, but countries targeted would have been included. It's not reasonable to expect that the President would have been involved in or necessarily briefed on decisions about individual intelligence targets, argued another senior administration official. Rather, the president approves a set of intelligence priorities and then it's the responsibility of his administration to determine how to carry those out. The explanation was backed by a former senior administration official who worked on national security for the Obama White House. ""I really doubt he had to sign off on something like that or get into the details,"" the former official said. 3. What has Obama done about it? That's a key question. In a USA Today op-ed published last week, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco conceded that recent ""disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships."" To address them, the President has ordered a ""review (of) our surveillance capabilities, including with our foreign partners,"" she wrote. A report on that effort is due by the end of the year. As accusations mount and the issue becomes increasingly thorny diplomatically, it's unclear what Obama has said and done behind closed doors. 4. Who's upset about this? The latest spying claims have roiled leaders in Europe and Latin America, who have accused the U.S. government of breaking the law, summoned U.S. diplomats for answers and said their confidence in the United States is shaken. In Germany, some leaders have suggested tabling discussions of a European Union free trade deal with the United States in response. In the United States, some have dismissed the foreign leaders' criticism as political bluster, arguing that spying is a common practice in international relations, even for allies. 5. What would the United States hope to learn? The United States says its surveillance programs are for the purpose of foiling terrorist plots, but there are many political reasons for interest in communications of world leaders. For example, some media reports suggest the tapping of Merkel's phone increased in 2010, around the time of the financial crisis in the Eurozone, in which Merkel was a major player. The U.S also wants as much information as possible about the actions of other states to make its own decisions about important foreign policy issues, such as Syria and Iran. At the end of the day, allies cannot automatically count on each other's loyalty. Former Vice President Dick Cheney suggested in an interview with CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that there is an interest in conducting surveillance on a country or a leader, even a clear ally. ""We do have a fantastic intelligence capability, worldwide against all kinds of potential issues and concerns. We are vulnerable, as was shown on 9/11, and you never know what you're going to need when you need it,"" said Cheney.","Media reports say the NSA tapped the phones of about 35 world leaders .

"(CNN) -- You don't have to be gay or even Russian to feel the wrath of the Russian government's homophobia. You could go to jail if you are ""pro-gay,"" whatever that means. And that's under just one of a growing number of hate-infused bills becoming law at a time when, as it happens, Russia is preparing to host the world in the next Winter Olympics. The perverse anti-gay legislation is inflaming an atmosphere of persistent intimidation and at times deadly violence against Russian gays and lesbians. The question now is: What should the rest of the world do? With the 2014 Winter Olympic Games coming to the Russian town of Sochi on the Black Sea coast, President Vladimir Putin and his country are about to receive a massive influx of publicity and cash. But exactly what kind of publicity -- and how much cash? The world has an opportunity to let Putin -- who signed all the laws -- and the politicians he dominates know just how repulsive their actions are. There is a chance of helping Russia LGBT activists persuade the government to reverse the most offensive legislation. Ideas are already in play. Human rights activists in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia are pushing for a boycott of the Olympics or of Russian products such as vodka. An Olympic boycott might not be the best way to go. Instead, let's turn the Winter Games into the gayest games in history. Let the Russian police, if they want, arrest every athlete, every coach from Europe, North American, Australia and other forward-looking countries -- that includes you, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. The teams should march during the opening ceremonies brandishing rainbow flags, holding hands, proclaiming that every one of them supports equal rights for gay and lesbians -- in Russia and everywhere else. Make it an ""I am Spartacus"" moment for the world. Let Putin arrest them all. And as for going as a tourist to the Sochi Olympics: Forget it. Russian lawmakers are making that boycott a no-brainer. Olympic sponsors NBC, Visa, Coca-Cola, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble and others also have a responsibility to push against these blatant violations of human rights. Keep in mind that Russian laws are encouraging vigilante ""justice"" against gays and lesbians. Police have assaulted Pride marchers and looked the other way when thugs attacked peaceful demonstrators protesting discrimination. There have been gruesome killings that authorities acknowledge were motivated by homophobia. The talk of launching an Olympic boycott is something the International Olympic Committee dreads. The IOC has naively -- or disingenuously -- claimed it received ""assurances from the highest level"" that Russians police won't start rounding up suspected homosexuals and their suspected sympathizers during the Games. Just imagine the sweeps of athletes, trainers and tourists, rounded up and sent to Russian prisons because they believe gays and lesbians should be treated like everyone else. And police could do just that: The country's sports minister and a close ally of Putin, the legislator Vitaly Milonov, said the law will definitely be enforced and no exception will be made. Violation of the propaganda law, which applies to Russians and foreigners, means a punishment of $3,000 in fines and up to 15 days in jail, followed by deportation, for anyone who even speaks about homosexuality. The legislation is already having an effect. Russian publications reporting on the laws already carry cringe-worthy disclaimers saying, ""This article contains information not suitable for readers younger than 18 years of age, according to Russian legislation."" It's easy to think the legislation is just symbolic, that it couldn't possibly be serious, certainly not regarding foreigners. But last week, police arrested four Dutch activists who had traveled to Russia to make a documentary on gay rights. And the anti-gay laws keep coming. There's the law that allows police to arrest ""pro-gay"" tourists; a law that labels as pornography and banned propaganda any writing or statement calling for tolerance or equality, and another law banning the adoption of Russian children by anyone in a country where there is marriage equality. There's a rumor that the next law will remove children from same-sex couples. Terrified parents have started sending their children away. Some think the witch hunt against gays shows Putin is trying to deflect attention as the economy slows down and perhaps playing defense against opposition accusations that his friends have stolen as much as $30 billion in money earmarked for the Olympics. Putin has always understood the power of propaganda and has never shied from showing himself as relentlessly macho, able to take on tigers, ride horses bare-chested or catch the biggest fish while displaying his youthful musculature. The Russian president understands the power of images. For those who want to stop, or at least slow the vicious crackdown against gays, lesbians and anyone who supports equality, that provides an opportunity to push back. The only unacceptable course of action is doing nothing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Anti-gay laws in Russia outlaw supporting gays or calling for equality .

"(CNN) -- East versus West, capitalism versus communism: the Cold War lasted from the end of World War II until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Yet this war was at its height in the 1960s. That's the decade the Cuban missile crisis played out, the United States entered the Vietnam War to fight communist forces there, and President John F. Kennedy sent a team of Cuban exiles into Cuba's Bay of Pigs to try to overthrow leader Fidel Castro. Here are five other momentous events of the 1960s Cold War that you might not know: . 1. The Soviets shot down an American plane and captured the pilot . The United States had been flying U2 spy planes over the Soviet Union for some time to see if the Soviets were aiming missiles at America and to snap photos of local newspaper headlines. The CIA told President Dwight D. Eisenhower that its sophisticated aircraft, which reached altitudes of up to 70,000 feet, could not be shot down. But on May 1, 1960, U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers disappeared on a flight over Russia. Powers had been shot down and captured, and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev made the wreckage a public exhibition. A humiliated Eisenhower was forced to admit the United States had, in fact, committed espionage. 2. Nikita Khrushchev threatened to ""bury"" America . Three days after meeting Fidel Castro for the first time, Khrushchev visited the United Nations on September 23, 1960. The Soviet leader believed communism was the future and that America needed to be contained. In his address to the U.N. General Assembly, the Soviet leader threatened to ""bury"" America. 3. JFK didn't mention a single domestic issue in his inaugural speech . Newly elected John F. Kennedy felt his job was to run the Cold War and defeat the Russians, which he made clear in his January 20, 1961, inaugural speech, stating: . ""Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, uphold any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty."" 4. The space race made Americans fear for their lives . When Soviet pilot Yuri Gagarin became the first person to enter outer space on April 12, 1961, orbiting the Earth in one hour and 48 minutes, Americans worried the United States could no longer protect its people. Some thought if you could put a man into space, you could put a nuclear warhead into space. Khrushchev reacted by saying, ""Now let the capitalist countries try to catch up."" Opinion: Putin's empire building is not a new Cold War . 5. Panic over a soccer field led to the Cuban Missile Crisis . When a CIA consultant spotted soccer fields along the coast in Cuba in September 1962, he became concerned because, as he put it, ""Cubans play baseball, Russians play soccer."" The CIA analyst had deduced that the field indicated the presence of a Soviet military camp nearby. Kennedy approved U2 flights over Cuba but didn't want to get sucked into another Bay of Pigs, the failed invasion to overthrow Castro in April 1961. He wanted hard evidence. Photographs convinced Kennedy that the Russians were putting missiles in Cuba. After U.S. intelligence indicated which U.S. regions were vulnerable to a possible nuclear attack from Cuban soil, Kennedy feared that 30 million American lives were in danger. Was it really a simpler time? Your '60s family photos, revealed . Kennedy did not want to attack Cuba, but he was worried about the survival of the human race. He imposed a blockade, and on October 22, 1962, he announced to the world that large, long-range weapons of sudden destruction posed a threat to America. When Russia sent 25 ships toward Cuba, the White House thought it was the early stages of World War III. At the last minute Soviet ships turned around. For the first time, Khrushchev acknowledged the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba, but argued they were merely defensive, and promised to remove them if JFK promised not to invade Cuba. BONUS: Kennedy planned to get out of Vietnam . It's impossible to know where we'd be today had Kennedy not gone to Dallas in 1963. Until that year, the President had treated Vietnam as a second-tier issue. He was dealing with Cuba, Berlin and domestic matters. He also felt the people of Vietnam ought to defeat the communists themselves. While the Soviets supported North Vietnam, the United States supported the South. And fears cropped up that if South Vietnam fell, the rest of Southeast Asia was vulnerable, as well as New Zealand and Australia. When the South Vietnam government was overthrown just weeks before Kennedy's fateful trip to Dallas, he told an aide he would begin to discuss getting out of Vietnam in 1964, after his re-election. Most historians agree that Kennedy would never have done what Lyndon B. Johnson did, which was trust the military implicitly. Kennedy was skeptical of military advice. In his December 17, 1963, address to the U.N. General Assembly, President Johnson told a nation in mourning: . ""The United States of America wants to see the Cold War end. We want sanity and security and peace for all. And above all President Kennedy I am sure would regard as his best memorial the fact that in his three years as President the world became a little safer, and the way ahead became a little brighter.""","The early 1960s were the most intense years of the Cold War .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Three suicide bombings Tuesday night in Grozny killed nine people and wounded 20, Russian officials said Wednesday. The Russian Investigative Committee said the bodies of two of the attackers have been identified.  They were both Chechens, born in 1989 and 1990, the committee said. In an emergency video conference with the country's top police officers Wednesday, Russian Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev gave the casualty figures for what he called the ""cruel terrorist act."" President Dmitry Medvedev instructed Nurgaliyev to conduct a thorough investigation and render all possible assistance to the families of the dead and the injured, the Kremlin reported on its website. The first blast occurred when police tried to arrest a suspect, who then triggered a bomb, Chechen police said.  Two more blasts occurred shortly thereafter, almost simultaneously, when police and onlookers had gathered at the scene of the first blast, police said. Among the dead were seven policemen, one person from the Emergencies Ministry and a civilian, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported.  The wounded included 16 police, one person from the Investigative Committee and three civilians. Rebels in Chechnya started out fighting for independence in the 1990s, but in recent years the fight has been aimed more at imposing Islamist rule and asserting their authority in the area. The standard of living in the southwestern republic is poor compared with the rest of Russia.  Unemployment is rampant and infant mortality is high. In addition, the Chechen population of about 1 million is mostly made up of Sunni Muslims, who maintain a distinctly separate cultural and linguistic identity from Russian Orthodox Christians. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Two blasts took place almost simultaneously shortly after the first, Chechen police say .

"(Mashable) -- If you're one of the millions who purchased an iPod between Sept. 12, 2006, and March 31, 2009, you might be in for a surprising email. It states that you're being enlisted in a class-action lawsuit against Apple — though you do have the right to recuse yourself. The class-action lawsuit was originally filed by a customer in January 2005 and was ignited by the creation of the music service Harmony. Back in 2004, the company RealNetworks created Harmony as a digital rights management (DRM) translation service. It allowed users to play songs downloaded from the RealPlayer music store on Apple's iPod. But as any iPod user knows, songs must be loaded onto iTunes to be played on Apple's devices. That's because Apple created an iPod firmware update not too long after the announcement of Harmony, which blocked it and other music services from uploading songs to the iPod. The customer filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of unfairly blocking competition. Now, years later, it's gaining steam. Though RealNetworks has nothing to do with this case, the . District Court for the Northern District of California gave the lawsuit class-action status in November 2011. The website ipodlawsuit.com, which details the entire case, explains: . ""The lawsuit claims that Apple violated federal and state laws by issuing software updates in 2006 for its iPod that prevented iPods from playing songs not purchases on iTunes. The lawsuit claims that the software updates caused iPod prices to be higher than they otherwise would have been.""

"(CNN) -- A Florida father who beat his 11-year-old son's alleged molester unconscious before calling 911 told a CNN affiliate that his son is a hero and that the youngster is the only reason the man is alive. ""My immediate feeling was to kill him, so he will never hurt anyone again,"" the father told CNN affiliate WESH. The father, who CNN is not identifying, told Volusia County emergency dispatch Friday that 18-year-old Raymond Frolander was close to the family and was in the apartment while the father was out. When he got home, the father said, he saw Frolander with the boy. Frolander's pants fell down to his ankles ""and nothing else needed to be said"" when he saw exposed genitals, the dad said. Frolander, who is being held in Volusia County Jail without bond, faces a charge of sexual battery of a child. The father told WESH that Frolander is lucky that's all he is facing. ""My son saved Raymond. Raymond was motionless on our floor. I went to the kitchen to grab a butcher knife, and my son stopped me. My son came in front of me and saved his attacker's life,"" said the father. According to the charging affidavit, the 11-year-old victim told authorities that Frolander had performed oral sex on him and instructed the boy to fondle him. The document says the boy told authorities that Frolander began abusing him a few years ago. It also says Frolander told police, ""I'm guilty."" An official in the criminal division of the Volusia County Clerk's Office told CNN this is a confidential case because of the age of the victim, so no public record of the suspect's plea or attorney's name is available. On the 911 call, the father explained that Frolander was breathing, but not speaking, ""in a puddle of blood"" on the floor. He added, ""I loved him up until 15 minutes ago."" At times, the dad is heard talking to the suspect, at one point saying, ""You are damn lucky, boy, that I love my God."" The father has not been charged, and when CNN affiliate CFN 13 asked Daytona Beach Police Chief Michael Chitwood whether he had any issue with the father's reaction, he responded Friday, ""Not as a police chief and not as a father."" Chitwood had a starkly different reaction this week to news that the father had published his son's photo on the Internet with a plea for cash. After the boy's assault and his attacker's beating became national news, the father reportedly posted the photo on Facebook saying he needed $1 million to pay for the boy's care after the assault. He also set up a GoFundMe page, which Chitwood derided as a ""disaster."" As of Tuesday morning, the GoFundMe link on the Facebook page directed visitors to a page asking for help saving a mother of four from being evicted. GoFundMe said in a statement that its privacy policy prevented it from divulging whether a user's page had gone live, but Chitwood confirmed he had seen it. ""My detectives and I went and looked at it. It was requesting 1 million dollars,"" he said. ""It's out of control. Somebody's thinking 'We're going to cash in on this.' I didn't get it."" Chitwood also expressed concern that the victim could suffer additional psychological stress as a result of his dad's actions. ""He's a parent. He has to do what he thinks is right, but from a law enforcement perspective, we go through great lengths to protect identity of sex assault victims. There are psychological problems that come from being a victim. To put the kid out there is a disaster,"" he said. ""I've been doing this 27 years. I've never seen anything like this.""","Father says that his son stopped him from killing alleged molester with knife .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Muifa killed at least 10 people and damaged an estimated 2,400 acres of of farmland when it made landfall in North Korea, state-run news agency KCNA reported Tuesday. The agency estimated more than 100 homes were damaged in the South Hwanghae province, in the country's southwest. Power poles collapsed throughout the province, causing blackouts in some areas, the agency said. In neighboring China, officials estimated the storm caused about 3 billion yuan ($466 million) in damage, the state news agency Xinhua said. The Chinese flood control and drought relief headquarters estimated the torrential rains affected the 1.74 million local residents living in Shanghai and surrounding provinces, Xinhua said. Muifa made landfall in North Korea as a typhoon on Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and gusty winds, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm, which was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall, came ashore about 7 p.m. Monday (6 a.m. Monday ET). Four people died and two others were reported missing in Seoul, South Korea, where the storm passed Monday evening, the semi-official Yonhap news agency reported. At least 490,000 people were evacuated from Shandong and Liaoning provinces in eastern China, Xinhua reported. No deaths or injuries were reported. In the city of Dalian, in Liaoning, authorities were able to avert the spill of toxic chemicals from an industrial plant after 65-foot (20-meter) waves broke through a dike protecting the area and threatened to flood the plant, according to Xinhua. Workers dumped concrete and rocks to fill in the hole. The plant contains carcinogenic chemicals used to make polyester film and fabrics, Xinhua said.","NEW: Tropical Storm Mufia kills 10 in North Korea, a state-run news agency said .

"(CNN) -- Immigration reform returned to the U.S. political arena in 2010, three years after it was knocked down by a much-debated Senate vote. The issue drew national outrage and support after Arizona enacted a state law that allows police to ask for proof of legal U.S. residency. The law initially allowed police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency, based solely on a police officer's suspicion that the person might be in the country illegally. Arizona lawmakers soon amended the law so that officers could check a person's status only if the person had been stopped or arrested for another reason. Critics say the law will lead to racial profiling, while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants.  Some Hispanic Americans support law . Arizona's Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, who's locked in a competitive re-election campaign, signed the bill into law and revived an intense national debate on what to do about illegal Mexican immigrants and undocumented workers in the United States. Brewer: Most Americans agree with me . The law has become an issue in a competitive primary race for U.S. Senate as Republican Sen. John McCain fights to continue representing Arizona on Capitol Hill. McCain co-sponsored the 2007 Senate immigration reform bill, which called for tightening border security and creating a path to citizenship for some of the nation's 12 million illegal immigrants.  But faced with a tough challenge by former Rep. J.D. Hayworth, McCain has reversed his position on offering citizenship to illegal immigrants. The 2007 bill failed partly because many conservatives rallied against it, saying it offered ""amnesty"" to illegal immigrants. Observers have called the nation's failure to address immigration reform a travesty. In July, President Obama pushed Congress to pass immigration reform legislation before the end of the year.  The president has described as ""promising"" an immigration reform plan outlined by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. In a statement, the lawmakers said their plan includes ""biometric Social Security cards to ensure that illegal workers cannot get jobs; fulfilling and strengthening our commitments on border security and interior enforcement; creating a process for admitting temporary workers; and implementing a tough but fair path to legalization"" for illegal immigrants in the United States.  Calls for reform; troops to deploy along border . Reaction to the Arizona law prompted Obama to enter the fray, calling on Congress to begin work on a new immigration reform bill. The president, who called the law misguided, has also ordered 1,200 U.S. troops to deploy along the Mexican border.  The National Guard forces will help with drug enforcement and intelligence efforts until Customs and Border Protection can recruit and train additional officers and agents to serve on the border, an administration official said. McCain said the number fell short and called for 3,000 troops. Reflecting their outrage about Arizona's new law, nearly 30 organizations have agreed to join an economic boycott of the state's $18.6 billion travel industry, including the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, People for the American Way, the Japanese American Citizens League and the Service Employees International Union.  Arizona students speak out on immigration law . Lawmakers from four other states have contacted the Immigration Reform Law Institute asking for help to draft language for bills like the Arizona bill. The group has declined to identify which states. The speaker of the Rhode Island House has said an Arizona copycat bill sponsored by a Democratic lawmaker will not be considered this session. Elsewhere, prominent Senate and gubernatorial candidates who've weighed in on the Arizona law include Florida GOP Senate candidate Marco Rubio, who supports the measure, and California Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina, who said she supports Arizona's ""need to protect their citizens."" Rubio has been accused of flip-flopping on his stance over the Arizona law. Meg Whitman, a California GOP candidate for governor, has come out against the law, as has Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry.","Anger about Arizona ID law puts talk of reform back in political spotlight .

"(CNN) -- Leaked classified documents show the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart are among the ""worst offenders"" of mass surveillance without oversight, according to an open letter purportedly written by Edward Snowden and published Sunday by the German magazine Der Spiegel. The publication of the letter, titled ""A Manifesto for the Truth,"" comes as leaks by the former NSA contract analyst have roiled U.S.-European relations amid allegations that the NSA and the UK's Government Communications Headquarters monitored the communication data of some world leaders. ""The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls,"" Snowden wrote, according to the news magazine. ""While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders -- at least according to the documents that are currently public -- we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution."" The letter, published in German by Der Spiegel, was written on Friday in Moscow and provided to Der Spiegel through a ""locked channel,"" the news magazine said. It was published in German and has been translated by CNN. Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges. A recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens. The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs. Opinion: Don't underestimate risks of government spying . 'Witch hunt' The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance ""with a never before seen witch hunt"" that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs. In the letter, Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change. ""The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world,"" the letter said. ""And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws."" Snowden has been in Moscow since June after fleeing from Hong Kong. In August, Russia granted him asylum for one year. Snowden gets website job in Russia . The release of the open letter is the second in a matter of days from Snowden, who released a letter to German authorities through an intermediary. Last week, Hans-Christian Stroebele, a member of Germany's parliament, met with Snowden in Russia. Stroebele returned from the meeting with a letter from Snowden to German authorities, which was distributed to the media. In it, Snowden said he is confident that with international support, the United States would abandon its efforts to ""treat dissent as defection"" and ""criminalize political speech with felony charges."" ""I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact regarding reports in the media, particularly in regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law,"" he wrote. Report: Snowden's Russia asylum not breached by NSA spying reports . 'Face justice' The White House did not immediately respond to Snowden's claims in the letter. But earlier Sunday, White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC's ""This Week"" that there has been no discussion of granting Snowden clemency. ""Mr. Snowden violated U.S. law,"" Pfeiffer said. ""And our belief has always been that he should return to the U.S. and face justice."" It was a sentiment echoed by the heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees. ""He had an opportunity -- if what he was, was a whistle-blower -- to pick up the phone and call the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and say, 'I have some information,'"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said Snowden has to ""own up with what he's done."" ""If he wants to come back and open up to the responsibility of the fact that he took and stole information, he violated his oath, he disclosed classified information -- that by the way has allowed three different terrorist organizations, affiliates of al Qaeda to change the way they communicate -- I'd be happy to have that discussion with him,"" Rogers said on ""Face the Nation.""

"(CNN) -- For Yahoo users who prefer old-school e-mailing, your grace period is over. Monday is the first day that users will be required to upgrade to the latest version of of Yahoo's e-mail service, which according to various assessments is either the second or third most popular on the Web. This change has been in the works since December, when Yahoo, under the guidance of new CEO Marissa Mayer, announced a major and long-awaited overhaul of e-mail. ""You've told us loud and clear that you want fewer distractions when it comes to e-mail,"" Mayer said at the time. ""You want to quickly login, communicate, and get on with your day. And we've listened."" The upgrades were made available for Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android. But as is always the case when faced with change, some folks were more comfortable with older versions, including ""Yahoo Classic,"" and were given until Monday to switch. In a Yahoo Help post the company noted that upgrading requires users to agree to terms including ""automated content scanning."" That's technology similar to that used by Google with Gmail, which uses search algorithms, not real people, to read through the content of people's messages in order to target relevant advertising -- as well as other features -- to them. Users may opt out of that feature by changing their settings. The changes to the latest version of Yahoo Mail include removing some of the boxes that filled the page in the Web version and offering thumbnail images of attachments, presumably to help avoid clicking on scams, spam and other unwanted content. On Mail for iPhone, users can select multiple messages and swipe to delete, highlight or file them away. The Android app was upgraded to, among other things, put less drain on battery life. Still don't like the latest version? The Yahoo help post offers options for disgruntled users, including how to download your content and access it through another client and how to delete your account.","Yahoo e-mail users must upgrade to the company's new version .

"(CNN) -- Bodies were strewn in the streets amid a backdrop of burned cars and charred buildings in the small Kenyan coastal town of Mpeketoni on Monday. This quaint town, nestled in the well-known tourist resort of Lamu Island on the Indian Ocean, has been the latest target for attackers thought to be members of the Al- Shabaab terrorist group. A World Cup viewing party turned into a bloodbath, eyewitnesses told CNN on Sunday. Armed men stormed the city center, shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area, where they went from door to door, the witnesses said. Mpeketoni sits to the west of the Kenya-Somalia border, where the Kenyan army is fighting troops loyal to the al Qaeda-linked militant group. There were no claims of responsibility for the attacks, but the Kenyan Disaster Operation Centre blamed them on Al-Shabaab. The heavily armed gunmen, many in military uniforms, attacked hotels, a restaurant, gas station, bank, police station and a government office, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. Video from the scene shows burned-out vehicles and walls pockmarked by bullets. ""As of now, we have not been able to identify the real number of the casualties who might be in the other hotels which have already been burnt out,"" said Eric Mugo, deputy governor of Lamu. The Kenya Red Cross put the death toll from the incidents at 48. Last month, at least 10 people were killed in two explosions in central Nairobi. As many as 76 people were wounded in the blasts at the Gikomba market and on a public minibus, the disaster agency said. Ambulances evacuated 43 injured males and 33 injured females, the Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre said. Two suspects were arrested in connection with the explosions, which were caused by grenades, Nairobi Police Commandant Benson Kibuye said. The Kenyan military crossed into Somalia in 2011 to battle Al-Shabaab, which it blamed for kidnapping tourists in the coastal region. In retaliation, the terrorist group has launched a spate of attacks, including targeting bustling bus stations with grenades. Last year, Al-Shabaab militants stormed the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and held shoppers for days. At least 67 people were killed. Residents of Mpeketoni are now left to piece together what remains of their small town. One body at a time, names are put to faces lost to the recent wave of brutal attacks. CNN's Joyce Joseph and Lillian Leposo contributed to this report. Journalist Dihoff Mokotu reported from Mpeketoni, Kenya.","NEW: A World Cup viewing party turned into a bloodbath, eyewitnesses say .

"(EW.com) -- Three years ago, director Luc Besson tried to do prestige, directing an Oscar-bait biopic about Burmese political dissident Aung San Suu Kyi titled ""The Lady."" It didn't work out for anyone, but at least Besson is back where he clearly feels more at home: stylized violence punctuated by surreal chaos. In ""Lucy,"" Scarlett Johansson plays an American party girl studying in Taiwan who is kidnapped and forced to be a drug mule for an Asian gangster (Choi Min-Sik). But when the pouch of mysterious blue crystals ruptures in her gut—following a savage beating—the wonder drug begins to expand her human potential at an alarming rate. First, she's transformed into a sexy Jason Bourne, out for revenge. Then she becomes Neo, a superhero with near omnipotence. And her ultimate destiny, before the high can wear off, might be complete transcendence. On paper, ""Lucy"" is nothing more than a standard Milla Jovovich action movie, but Besson amps it up by going way past the recommended dosage of cinematic insanity. The whiplash imagery and frenetic editing give the audience a contact high of sorts—was that a freakin' dinosaur?—transforming what should be ridiculous into genuine bizarro excitement. He has successfully crossbred the superhero film with the Asian-gangster genre, and the film's car chase through the streets of Paris might be one fetishists celebrate from now on. Lucy is a thinly drawn character, just someone who needs to survive, but Johansson vividly conveys the initial terror of her dire circumstances before shifting into the calculating, almost robotic mode of an alien being flicking away mere mortals. By the time the film exhausts itself—in a brisk 89 minutes—it feels like there's literally nowhere that Lucy and Besson can't go, no boundaries, no laws, no logic. Just go with it. EW Grade: B .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani military has waded into the political turmoil that has beset the civilian government in recent weeks, prompting concerns the country's fragile democracy could be undermined. Demonstrations against the embattled government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif have been taking place in the capital, Islamabad, for the past two weeks. The protests have brought together two opposition leaders who are calling for changes in government, but in different ways. Imran Khan, the former cricket star who now leads one of Pakistan's largest political parties, has demanded the resignation of Sharif and new elections amid allegations of vote-rigging during last year's voting. His supporters have joined with those of outspoken cleric Tahir ul Qadri, who says he wants an overhaul of Pakistan's political system. Qadri led demonstrations last year against the previous government, paralyzing the center of Islamabad. After failing to negotiate a solution with the protest movements, Sharif on Thursday asked the country's powerful military for help brokering an end to the crisis. 'Deeper into the quicksand' The decision is significant in a country ruled for long stretches by military dictators and where the Pakistani army has repeatedly intervened in the political process. Bringing in the military ""pushes democracy a little deeper into the quicksand where it had been trapped for many days,"" wrote The News International, a Pakistani newspaper, in an editorial Friday. ""Whether it can pull itself out remains an open question."" Sharif clashed with the military when he served as prime minister during the 1990s, resulting in a lengthy period of exile before his return to power last year. Both Khan and Qadri met late Thursday with the army chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif, who is not related to the prime minister. The two leaders have separately threatened to let their protesters storm parliament if their demands are not. The demonstrators have been camped out in an area of the capital where many key state institutions are based. Anger over shooting . The Qadri-led protests have been fueled by anger over the fatal shooting of at least 10 of his supporters by police in the city of Lahore in June. Qadri has alleged that Shahbaz Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab province and the brother of the prime minister, was ultimately responsible for the shooting. Lahore police registered a report Thursday that listed the two Sharif brothers, as well as other top officials, as suspects in the shooting case. The move doesn't amount to formal charges against the suspects. It was widely seen as an effort to placate Qadri and his supporters, but the cleric said it didn't go far enough. He called for the resignation of Shahbaz Sharif and the registering of a new report based on his movement's allegations. The turbulence has put pressure on Pakistan's political system, which last year carried out a transition from one democratically elected government to another for the first time in its history. Sharif's government has been in power for less than 15 months. Commenting on the current crisis Thursday, U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""We continue to urge all sides to refrain from violence, exercise restraint, respect the rule of law."" CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","The prime minister has asked the military chief to help end the crisis .

"(CNN) -- The latest statement from Joan Rivers' daughter gave no new information about the comedian's condition three days after she was rushed to a New York hospital. ""Thank you for your continued love and support,"" Melissa Rivers said Sunday.Â ""We are keeping our fingers crossed."" Rivers, 81, stopped breathing during throat surgery at a Manhattan medical clinic Thursday morning, according to the New York Fire Department. She apparently suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest during a procedure. She was listed in critical condition in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where paramedics took her by ambulance. Her daughter's initial statement, made public late Thursday when she arrived at the hospital after a flight from Los Angeles, said her mother was ""resting comfortably."" Her next statement Friday also gave little indication of Rivers' prognosis. ""Her condition remains serious, but she is receiving the best treatment and care possible. We ask that you continue to keep her in your thoughts as we pray for her recovery."" Rivers' was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic, which is about a mile away from the hospital where she was taken. She had been scheduled to perform her comedy act at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, the next night. Michael Lucas, who was in the audience for Rivers' show at New York's Laurie Beechman Theatre on Wednesday night, told CNN that she joked about death. ""She said, 'You know I'm 81 years old, and I could drop dead at any moment and you would be so lucky because you will have a story to tell your friends for the rest of your life,'"" Lucas said. ""Then she mimicked people talking about what it was like to see her drop dead on stage."" Rivers was in fine form, he said. ""There was no sign (Wednesday) night that she was declining. Her show was over an hour long and she never stumbled or even paused to catch her breath."" In 2013, Rivers allowed cameras to record a health scare for her and her daughter's reality show, ""Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?"" Rivers said on the show that doctors found a spot on an X-ray after she had a persistent cough. ""We're just not going to be sad about this,"" Joan Rivers said during the episode. ""We're gonna do jokes and be up until we know. That's how I deal with things. I'm not just gonna sit around the next couple of days and go crazy."" Rivers has been open about her health issues. She was diagnosed with osteoporosis in 2002 after a fall down some stairs left her with broken bones, and she became an advocate for screenings for women. She also admitted to not being as healthy as she could be. ""I try not to be, but I'm a terrible eater,"" she said. ""I wish I could say I eat super-healthy, but I don't. I love junk food -- it should be its own food group -- so I help my bones with supplements and medicine."" Joan Rivers 'stands behind' Gaza quotes .

"(CNN) -- Israel came under fire Monday for claiming close to 1,000 acres of land in the Palestinian West Bank. Israel announced Sunday that the land in and around the Wadi Fukin valley, would become ""state land,"" clearing the way for the development of a new Israeli settlement. The affected land lies near Bethlehem and close to Bitar Ilit -- one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Farmers in the area have 45 days to appeal Israel's decision to claim the land. ""The seizure of such a large swathe of land risks paving the way for further settlement activity, which -- as the United Nations has reiterated on many occasions -- is illegal under international law and runs totally counter to the pursuit of a two-state solution,"" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement Monday. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond issued a similar statement, criticizing the move. ""This is a particularly ill-judged decision that comes at a time when the priority must be to build on the cease-fire in Gaza. It will do serious damage to Israel's standing in the international community,"" he said. ""Our position on settlements is clear: they are illegal under international law, present an obstacle to peace and take us further away from a two state solution at a time when negotiations to achieve this objective urgently need to be resumed."" Hammond said efforts should be focused on securing a durable cease-fire in Gaza and lasting peace. ""We strongly urge the government of Israel to reverse this decision,"" he said. Teens' abduction . Israeli officials told CNN the expropriation was linked to the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers who disappeared from the West Bank settlement of Gush Etzion in June. Tensions between Israel and Hamas ratcheted up after the teens' bodies were found June 30. Both sides last week agreed to an open-ended cease-fire following more than seven weeks of heavy fighting. Hamas has said the teens were abducted by Hamas militants who did not inform the group's leadership about their operation. The Israeli Civil Administration, which rules over Palestinians in Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank, has posted ""no trespassing"" signs in the valley. Farmer Mahmoud Mifrah, 66, told CNN he had grown vegetables and olives in Wadi Fukin for 42 years and did not see why he should suffer the consequences of others' crimes. ""We are the neighbors of the Israeli people,"" Mifrah said. ""We share water and air and everything. We have to find a way to live together."" The Palestine Liberation Organization said the expropriation was the ""the largest Israeli land grab in the Occupied State of Palestine in three decades."" ""This move is further proof of Israel's relentless policy of destroying the prospects for a negotiated peace and an independent Palestinian state, living side by side the State of Israel in peace and security,"" the PLO said in a statement. The Israeli group Peace Now expressed bafflement at the move. ""It's a crazy idea. In my view it's collective punishment not only to Palestinians but also to Israelis that it's actually killing our chances to get to peace some day, and a two state solution,"" spokeswoman Hagit Ofran said.","PLO says ""land grab"" destroys prospect for peace .

"(CNN) -- Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's new gig on Wall Street will line his pockets, to the tune of more than $1 million per year. And for those who played an instrumental role in his defeat in Virginia's primaries, the justification of their concerns about the former congressman is quite fulfilling. Kevin Broughton, communications director of the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, said, ""many analysts accused Eric Cantor of paying more attention to Wall Street than to the people of Virginia's 7th District. He certainly didn't waste any time validating that theory."" Cantor, who was the No. 2 Republican in the House, lost his primary this year to unknown college professor David Brat. Part of the reason was voters thought he was disconnected from his Richmond, Virginia, district by focusing instead on his duties as a fundraiser and national leader for the Republican Party. He left Congress early, resigning his seat last month. Since 1999, the seven-term congressman had raised more than $3 million from the investment industry. And in his last campaign, the industry was his largest contributor, donating $785,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. For disaffected conservatives, especially among the tea party, which came to life early in the Obama administration and took on a populist message, Cantor's move to a boutique investment bank, Moelis & Co., as a vice chairman and board member is proof that their concerns were spot on. In a statement, Cantor said, ""When I considered options for the next chapter of my career, I knew I wanted to join a firm with a great entrepreneurial spirit that focused on its clients."" Some took to Twitter to express their satisfaction: . . CNNMoney's Charles Riley contributed to this report.","The ex-House majority leader will join Moelis & Co., making more than $1 million per year .

"(CNN) -- From the continuing rise of tablet devices to the daily-deals craze and the return of the Internet IPO, 2011 has been a transformative year for technology. The pace of change has become blisteringly fast, with traditional industries -- bookstores, video-rental chains, newspapers -- crumbling more quickly than we could have imagined. Predicting what will happen in 2012, therefore, is a shot in the dark: A year is virtually a lifetime in the digital era. And yet we can at least make a guess at what will happen in the early part of next year simply by looking at the trends that are shaping the latter half of this year. Here's my best estimate of some of the innovation we'll see in 2012: . 1. Touch computing . New input methods will be the dominant trend of 2012. Tablet computers such as the iPad might seem like a nice alternative to desktop and laptop computers, but I believe they're more than that: They're replacements. Just as the command line (remember that?) gave way to graphical user interfaces, so the mouse will be superseded by touchscreens. The signs are obvious: Windows 8 and Mac OS X Lion, the latest desktop operating systems, borrow heavy from their mobile counterparts. These new interfaces essentially impose a touchscreen-inspired interface over the traditional desktop environment. Over time, this half-step will become a whole one, and mobile operating systems will dominate. The transition won't be complete by the end of 2012, but we'll be much further down the path, and using computer mice much less often. 2. Social gestures . In the social media realm, social gestures appear to be the leading trend of 2012. Launched by Facebook in September, this so-called ""frictionless sharing"" functionality removes the need to click a button to share media with your friends. Instead, everything you listen to, read or watch is automatically posted to your profile once you approve the relevant app. If you've seen apps such as Spotify or Social Reader in your Facebook news feed, you're already aware of these features. The trend makes sense for social networks: With 800 million people already on Facebook, its growth is bound to slow. But if sharing becomes automatic, the volume of content on Facebook will grow at an accelerated pace. There's a big problem, however: Users may be ""creeped out"" by all this automated sharing of their Web activity and grow suspicious of the apps using it. 3. NFC and mobile payments . Next year is likely to be the year when mobile payments blossom. While we've seen a great deal of innovation in mobile payments technology this year -- including the success of Square's iPhone dongle, allowing anyone to accept credit card payments -- 2012 is the year of NFC. What's that, you ask? Near Field Communication essentially lets you replace your credit cards with your phone: Wave an NFC-enabled phone near the credit card reader in a store (or taxi cab), and the money is deducted from your account. By 2013, 1 in 5 cellphones are expected to be NFC-equipped. Early contenders include Google Wallet, Visa Wallet, Serve (by American Express) and ISIS. 4. Beyond the iPad . If touch computing is the future, then the iPad is surely king. And yet the iPad came up against serious competition in the latter part of 2011: As I wrote previously, I expect the new Amazon Kindle Fire to outsell the iPad in 2012. Why? Simply put, the iPad costs $499 while the Fire costs $199. Amazon's advantages don't stop at the price point, however: The company owns an entire content store of movies, e-books, TV shows and other media. With tablet devices, the hardware is somewhat important but the content available for the device is absolutely critical: With plenty of media available for the Fire right away, it's an appealing proposition. Why does one device constitute an entire trend? Well, as a true competitor to the iPad emerges, content producers, distributors and even app developers may have an entirely new platform on which to push their wares. (And yes, the Kindle Fire does indeed run Google's Android operating system, but Amazon's version is so unlike other Android tablets that neither users nor app developers will perceive it as ""yet another Android device"" -- it's a whole new platform.) 5. TV Everywhere . So you thought you'd be able to watch all your favorite shows online and get rid of your cable subscription for good? Not so fast! The cable companies have a cunning plan: They'll let you watch live TV, plus on-demand movies and TV shows, on your connected devices if you keep your cable subscription. Dish Network, Time Warner and Comcast are among those offering the service. TV Everywhere has been buzzed about since 2010, of course, and could be a dud -- but the rise of tablet devices would seem to create increased demand for a ""TV in your hands."" 6. Voice control . Here's another trend that's got a moderate chance of taking off in 2012: Voice control. The novelty of Siri on the iPhone 4S -- which allows you to send texts, create reminders, search the Web and much more using just your voice -- may be the start of a new trend in voice controlled devices. Surely voice control has been around for years? Yes, but it wasn't very accurate. Siri and its ilk define a new era in which we talk, and our devices understand -- often on the first attempt. Other device makers will likely follow suit. What's more, Apple may use voice control to replace the TV remote. 7. Spatial gestures . Other input methods are gaining traction too: Microsoft's Kinect, for instance, has given rise to interfaces that use spatial gestures. Just like in ""Minority Report,"" your devices can be controlled simply by waving your hands in the air. Thanks to the many innovators who have hacked Kinect to work with other platforms, we may see more devices using this input method next year. 8. Second-screen experiences . ""Second-screen experiences"" is a buzz-phase among TV and movie execs these days. It refers to apps (mainly on the iPad) that listen to the audio output of your TV and display content related to the show or movie you're watching. The chances are that you already use your tablet computer or phone while watching TV, so there's ample opportunity to make the viewing experience a more interactive one. Disney already has second-screen apps for movies such as ""The Lion King"" and ""Bambi,"" while multiple TV networks have similar offerings: We can expect many, many more to be released in 2012. 9. Flexible screens . Personally, I just can't wait for flexible screens: These awesome new bendable interfaces will let you zoom in, zoom out and scroll around a page simply by twisting your phone or tablet. Nokia and Samsung have both hinted they may release phones with bendable displays in 2012. The really exciting stuff, however -- like paper-thin devices that roll up to fit in your pocket -- is still years away. 10. HTML5 . Can I squeeze in one more trend? It's HTML5 -- the fifth iteration of the HTML standard -- and it lets developers create richer, more interactive applications than ever. Why does this matter? As developers tire of building applications for every operating system out there -- from Android to iOS to Windows Phone and beyond -- HTML5 offers the opportunity to build an app once and have it work everywhere. The rise of HTML5 is bound to be accelerated by a recent revelation: Adobe is killing off Flash for mobile devices, meaning one of the primary methods of serving videos and rich applications on mobile phones is about to disappear. HTML5 will fill that gap. For us as consumers, that means richer applications and experiences on all our devices. In short, 2012 is all about new ways to interact with our devices through touch and voice control, new lightweight ways to share content, a revolution in mobile payments and a plethora of rich Web applications -- not to mention the hundreds of new innovations that we've yet to dream up. I can't wait.","Mashable founder Pete Cashmore predicts which trends we'll see more of next year .
Led by Facebook, more social networks will offer automated sharing of users' Web activity .
Companies such as Apple may use Siri-like voice control to replace the TV remote .

"(CNN) -- Belgium set a date with the U.S. in the last 16 of the World Cup as the curtain fell on the gripping group stages in Brazil, while Algeria celebrated a historic first. Thursday's 1-0 victory over South Korea was more than enough for the unbeaten Belgians to advance from Group H as winners, despite having a man sent off. As their red and yellow clad fans celebrated in Sao Paulo, there were similar scenes of jubilation in Curitiba. Algeria made history in Brazil, reaching the knockout stages of the global tournament for the first time at the expense of Russia. ""Les Fennecs"" -- the Desert Foxes -- will need all their wiles as they face the might of Germany next. Germany had consigned the U.S. to a 1-0 defeat in Thursday's earlier matches but Team USA escaped from a grueling Group G -- which also featured Ghana and Portugal -- on goal difference. Belgium might think themselves lucky to march into the knockout stages with their unbeaten record intact after being forced to play more than half the match with 10 men. Steven Defour was sent off for a rash studs-up challenge on the cusp of halftime and South Korea sniffed blood, pressing forward after the break. But if the statistics tell us anything about Belgium, it is never count them out. Breaking upfield, defender Jan Vertonghen picked up the rebound of Divock Origi's fizzing effort to break the deadlock after 77 minutes. Belgium's last six World Cup goals have been scored in the last 20 minutes of the match. Team USA better be prepared for a lively finish when the two sides meet next Tuesday in Salvador. Algeria had arrived in Sao Paulo buoyant from a 4-2 victory over South Korea -- the North African country's first World Cup win in 32 years. When Russia took an early lead in the must-win showdown, a fairytale ending for Vahid Halilhodzic's side had seemed a remote possibility. Aleksandr Kokorin, who is nicknamed ""Bieber"" because of his youthful similarity to the Canadian pop star, was soon on song. He rose brilliantly to power home Dmitry Kombarov's cross after just six minutes and from there Russia looked intent on protecting the lead. But Algeria, cheered on by the undiminished enthusiasm of their fans, were not done yet. When a free-kick was swung into the box, the Russian defense rocked and Islam Slimani headed into an open goal with 60 minutes on the clock -- his second goal in as many games. The draw was enough for Algeria to join Nigeria as the second African side in the last 16. Meanwhile, Russia will be hoping to find answers before hosting the next World Cup in 2018. After failing to qualify for the 2006 and 2010 editions of the global football fiesta, the Russians have now fallen at the first hurdle in 1994, 2002 and 2014. The remaining 16 nations in the World Cup will enjoy a rest day Friday before the footballing fever gets even hotter on Saturday. Hosts Brazil face a tricky Chile side for a place in the quarterfinals while Colombia take on Uruguay, now rendered rather toothless by the ban for biting striker Luis Suarez. The controversial Liverpool player is not the only star name to take an early flight from Brazil. Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo, Spain's defending champions and 2006 winners Italy were among the big guns saying adeus from Brazil.","Belgium set up last 16 date with the U.S. at 2014 World Cup in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Anti-establishment candidates are capitalizing on widespread anti-incumbent fervor and proposing term limits as a way to bring the power back to the people. As political hopefuls try to persuade voters to send them to Congress, they're also promising they won't be there long. Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul said that if elected, he can't see himself serving more than two terms. In Rhode Island, Democratic congressional hopeful Bill Lynch has proposed a 12-year cap in the House and Senate. And in Maryland, Republican Andy Harris has assured voters that, should he go to the U.S. House, he'll be out of there by 2023. It's a message that polls well and gets applause at campaign rallies, but David King, director of Harvard's program for Newly Elected Members of the U.S. Congress, said term limits do more harm than good. ""It's political junk food. It tastes good but hurts the body politic in the long run,"" he said. Advocates and opponents of term limits are after the same thing: keeping the power out of the hands of lobbyists and special interests. King says term limits do the opposite by taking the business of lawmaking away from elected representatives and giving it to professional staff and lobbyists. Instead, the elections process needs better campaign finance laws and a more engaged electorate, he said. ""That leads to a situation in which we reward politicians or statesmen or stateswoman who have been around for a long time and are terrific, while at the same time being able to get rid of the low-quality legislators at all levels,"" King said. But Philip Blumel, president of U.S. Term Limits, points to the high re-election rates as evidence of the need for term limits. Re-election rates have hovered around 96 percent in the House and 85 percent in the Senate over the past 10 years, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The average length of service for lawmakers in the current session of Congress is 5.5 terms in the House and 2.2 terms in the Senate, according to the Congressional Research Service. ""You have a situation where you have a long-standing relationship between special interests and an incumbent who can't lose, and that is a toxic combination, and that's most of the Congress,"" Blumel said. ""Term limits ensure regular, competitive elections. They permit change."" It's a debate as old as the Constitution that term-limit supporters hope to amend. Alexander Hamilton spoke against limits, writing in Federalist Paper No. 72 that, ""Nothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill-founded upon close inspection."" Thomas Jefferson, however, said term limitation, at least of the president, was necessary ""to prevent every danger which might arise to American freedom from continuing too long in office."" After the Constitution was drafted, Jefferson said one aspect he disliked was ""the abandonment in every instance of the necessity of rotation in office, and most particularly in the case of the President."" ""If you value rotation in office, like the founders did, we need some kind of codified term limits,"" Blumel said. Fifteen states have term limits for state lawmakers. Another six states have agreed to term limits in the past, but the limits were repealed by the legislature or overturned by the courts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most of the states with term limits got them through a ballot initiative, a process that only 24 states have. Jennie Bowser, who tracks term limits for the NCSL, said that while voters are generally supportive of term limits, some studies have shown negative effects that aren't obvious to the average voter, such as a loss of influence in the legislature to the executive branch and a loss of policy champions who spend years building expertise in certain subjects. ""They're sort of inside the legislature, under-the-dome kind of things that people who are close to the legislature notice ... but no legislature has had to go out of business because term limits wrecked them, so it's not stuff that is visible to voters,"" she said. The new wave of calls for term limits is reminiscent of the lead-up to the 1994 elections. Armed with a legislative agenda called the ""Contract with America,"" Republicans put forth a message with an emphasis on term limits. The GOP took back control of the House and Senate for the first time in nearly 50 years, and, for the first time ever, the House voted on legislation that would limit representatives to six two-year terms and senators to two six-year terms. The vote was 227--204 -- a simple majority, but not the two-thirds required for a constitutional amendment. At the time, 23 states had passed laws imposing term limits on their federal lawmakers, but in May of 1995, two months after the House vote, the Supreme Court ruled that doing so was unconstitutional. ""Allowing individual States to adopt their own qualifications for congressional service would be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform National Legislature representing the people of the United States. If the qualifications set forth in the text of the Constitution are to be changed, that text must be amended,"" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. In order to pass a constitutional amendment on term limits, the House and Senate would have to pass legislation with a two-thirds majority, and then three-fourths of the state legislatures would have to ratify it. South Carolina Republican Sen. Jim DeMint introduced a bill to limit lawmakers to six years in the House and 12 years in the Senate. DeMint's bill has yet to come up for a vote, but for Blumel, the outlook is good. ""There are periods in history where term limits are at the fore, and if the people of the country want them and demand them now, we have as good a chance as any that we ever had to have them. So it's an exciting time,"" he said. But King says that even if the idea had the support of the president and Congress, he is confident that the American public would reject it. ""The evidence after 20 years of this in state legislatures is crystal clear: term limits empower special interests, lobbyists and long-time staffers and they work against the interests of the American people,"" he said. The reason the issue polls well, King said, is because there hasn't been a vigorous dialogue about it. ""People are reacting by their instinct and anger, which is understandable. But sometimes instinct and anger take us in the wrong direction,"" he said.","Some candidates making term limits a key part of their platforms .
It would require a constitutional amendment to enact limits on federal lawmakers .
Opponent says term limits hand power to special interests, long-time staffers .
Advocate says high re-election rates are proof Congress needs term limits ."
"(CNN) -- Have you looked at the Middle East lately? It's a giant mess, with civil wars, massive popular protests, cross-border fighting, armed insurgencies, exploding car bombs and on and on. And that's just in the past few days. The Middle East refuses to acknowledge that the United States has decided to pivot toward Asia. It refuses to step out of the spotlight. What we see today is proof that long-standing notions about the region -- the old conspiracy theories, the oversimplifications -- were just not true. Claims that the world paid attention to the area only because it had oil or that the key to every single problem in the Middle East involved Israel have been proved wrong. The Middle East still monopolizes the attention of diplomats, forces military experts urgently back to their drawing boards, keeps world leaders awake at night and would do so even if it did not hold a drop of oil or if the Arab-Israeli conflict did not exist. Why? The Middle East stands, as it has for centuries, at the center of historical currents and conflicting ideologies. What goes on there reverberates across national borders and leaps over oceans. When (most of) you attend religious services on the weekend or when you take off your shoes before boarding an airplane, you do it because of an idea that was born in the Middle East. The region is in crisis because it suffers from endemic corruption, poor governance, discrimination against women and serious economic problems. Rival philosophies are battling for the future -- Shiites competing with Sunnis, advocates of democracy challenging dictators, Islamists trying to overpower pluralists and Christians concerned over their future. Those are just a few of the ingredients fueling the conflicts. Democracy supporters may have become more muscular, but other determined fighters aspire to create profoundly anti-woman, anti-liberal and anti-American states. The implications of those beliefs will become evident as history unfolds. For America, the full pivot will have to wait. Consider the recent fighting in Gaza, dramatic developments in Egypt, slaughter in Syria, multiple bombings in Iraq, or the Palestinian bid at the United Nations. On the front burner: . Egypt . The streets of Cairo are boiling with rage against President Mohamed Morsy, who stunned the country -- and the White House -- when he announced he was taking powers in what many view as a return to dictatorship. Protesters worry about a creeping power grab by the Muslim Brotherhood. One respected Arab observer compared Morsy to Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Morsy insists his move is necessary and only temporary. Eventually we will find out who is right. The answer will help set the future of democracy in the Arab world, where Egypt leads in ideological, political and cultural trends. That's why when Egyptians picked up the flame from a popular uprising in Tunisia two years ago, every dictator in the region trembled. Every Western capital had to review its strategic alliances. Iran . The United States might want to focus on Asia, but it cannot stop worrying about Iran. Some will insist the concern is about oil, but the U.S. could still buy oil from a nuclear-armed Iran. Obama, and the world, fears Iran's nuclear program will trigger a nuclear arms race in the most politically unstable part of the planet. On Wednesday, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization vowed that Iran will accelerate enriching uranium, despite harsh international sanctions. Separately, U.S. officials told CNN that Tehran is already finding ways to ship weapons to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza, just days after the U.S. helped broker a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel. Israelis and Palestinians . This conflict remains a neuralgic point in the region and a challenge to American influence. Hamas vows to destroy Israel, while the Palestinian Authority refuses to sit down for talks, laying the blame at Israel's feet. Defying Washington's wishes, the authority took its case to the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, where an automatic majority of Arab, Muslim and Non-Aligned Movement countries guaranteed a positive response to its upgraded status request. The move unhelpfully delinks the process of gaining statehood from the need to reach a negotiated peace. Syria . In Syria, some 40,000 men women and children have died in the country's civil war. The rebels are making gains in their very worthy cause of overthrowing the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad. But the West, including the United States, worries about what might come after al-Assad's fall. The opposition includes progressive advocates of democracy, but it also counts all manner of other ideologies, from mild Islamists to extremists who would like to see Syria as part of a supranational Islamic caliphate. Washington looks confused about what to do, but it cannot afford to ignore what is happening. It would be nice if the American president could decide which regions will command his attention. But this is the Middle East, and like it or not, it promises to remain at or near the top of the agenda. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Obama trying to pivot to Asia, but Middle East chaos stays center stage .
Why? She says region long at the center of historical currents and conflicting ideologies .
There's a battle for the future in Egypt, Iran, Syria, Israel and with the Palestinians, she says .

"(CNN) -- Former Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) president Max Mosley is championing the introduction of added safety measures in motorsport following the death of IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon in a multi-car crash on Sunday. Mosley, 71, supported the idea of using a canopy to cover the open cockpits of IndyCar and Formula One vehicles, in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of the fatal collision at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The FIA Institute tested the possible use of jet fighter canopies in motorsport earlier this year, by using a high-power cannon to fire at the polycarbonate shield at 225 kilometers-per-hour to see if it could withstand loose debris on a race track. Mosley said a canopy could help stop accidents like the one experienced by F1 driver Felipe Massa in 2009, when a spring fell from the Brawn GP car of Rubens Barrichello and struck the Ferrari driver in the head leaving him in a coma. Can Wheldon's death be a watershed moment? ""I think it could work,"" Mosley told CNN. ""We get occasional incidents like the spring which hit Massa and the wheel which came off in Formula Two and killed John Surtees son Henry. ""You're always in danger, in an open cockpit, of objects striking the driver ... It might also help, if it's reinforced with another roll bar, in things like the Dan Wheldon accident. But that's something that needs careful investigation."" On the canopy test, Mosley said it was an example of the FIA's continued commitment to improving driver safety. ""It's an example of constantly trying to find things that will reduce the probability of an accident, or an injury rather. Accidents are always going to happen; it's the injuries we want to avoid."" Former champion Stewart calls for change . Despite backing the potential use of a canopy, Mosley warned such a device could benefit the car aerodynamically and potentially cause further accidents. ""One of the troubles is that it would probably make the car quicker, which is just what we don't want. But there are other means of slowing them down. ""There are a lot of objections to canopies, how do you keep them clean? How do you get somebody out in an emergency? But all of that will be looked at by a technical working group if it turns out the thing would protect the driver better."" Mosley went on to back the FIA, expressing his confidence the organization will continue researching how to further protect racing drivers. ""What I do know is we've got some very clever people, looking full-time at these problems. All aspects, everything from the driver's helmet, to his clothes, cockpit protection, all the different things that can save them in an accident.""","Max Mosley has backed the use of canopies in motorsport .

"(RS.com) -- Neil Young has filed for divorce from Pegi Young, his wife of 36 years and frequent musical collaborator. A petition for dissolution of marriage was filed by Young in their hometown of San Mateo, California, on July 29. A hearing is scheduled for December 12. A rep for Neil Young had no comment. Pegi is the inspiration for some of Young's most enduring love songs, including ""Such a Woman,"" ""Unknown Legend"" and ""Once an Angel."" She began serving as his background singer in the 1990s, sharing the stage with him at the 1994 Academy Awards and numerous tours over the past 20 years.

Neil first met Pegi when she was working as a waitress at a diner near his California ranch, a story he tells in the 1992 song ""Unknown Legend."" ""I used to order just to watch her float across the floor,"" he sang. ""She grew up in a small town/Never put her roots down."" 20 insanely great Neil Young songs only hardcore fans know . Pegi has released three solo albums since 2007 and she's toured extensively on her own, occasionally with Neil on guitar. Inspired by the lack of educational opportunities for their son Ben, who suffers from cerebral palsy, they co-founded the Bridge School in 1986, which educates children with severe physical impairments. They raise funds for it every year with an all-star concert in Mountain View, California. Neil recently wrapped up a European Crazy Horse tour and is slated to play American solo acoustic dates in October. Pegi just concluded a brief U.S. club tour.

"(CNN) -- A 34-year-old man has been charged in the kidnapping of Abigail Hernandez, a New Hampshire teen who was returned to her home last week, more than nine months after she went missing on the way home from school. New Hampshire resident Nathaniel E. Kibby was arrested Monday and charged with one count of felony kidnapping for ""knowingly confining Abigail Hernandez on October 9, 2013, in Conway, New Hampshire, with a purpose to commit an offense against her,"" according to New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph A. Foster. Kibby was arrested at his home in Gorham, New Hampshire, investigators said. Hernandez's case drew national attention when the then 14-year-old girl went missing last fall. But the mystery surrounding her disappearance only deepened when authorities and her family revealed few details upon her return last Sunday. ""Over the course of the past week, law enforcement officers have worked around the clock to ascertain the facts and circumstances surrounding Abigail's disappearance and return,"" according to Foster's statement. Investigators said Hernandez provided police with details of her kidnapping that were ""sufficient to warrant today's arrest."" Kibby's arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday in Conway District Court. In a statement released Monday, Hernandez, who is now 15, thanked those who searched for her while she was missing. ""My gratitude is beyond words. It's an incredible feeling to be home and I believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release,"" Hernandez said. Last week, investigators released a sketch of a man they said drove the teen away in a navy blue pickup truck on October 9. Investigators also released photographs last week of black pants, a gray striped sweater and a camouflage-colored National Guard bag, asking for information from anyone who ""saw Abigail Hernandez or a female wearing the clothing and drawstring bag.""

"London (CNN) -- The European Aviation Safety Agency has ordered checks for cracks in the wings of the Airbus A380, though it has stopped short of grounding the fleet. CNN examines some key questions about the aircraft and what it means for the passengers, the airlines and the manufacturers. What is the Airbus A380? The jet liner is a double-deck, wide-bodied aircraft made by Airbus -- a subsidiary of the EADS group -- and capable of carrying more than 800 passengers, though it routinely carries far fewer. It made its maiden flight in 2005 and first entered service with Singapore Airlines in 2007. As of January 31, 2012, the company said it had delivered 68 aircraft to customers and had orders for a further 185. Which airlines fly it? The Airbus A380 is currently in service with Air France, China Southern Airlines, Emirates, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qantas and Singapore Airlines. Airbus says within the first three years of service, about 15 million passengers had flown in the jet. Is there anything distinctive about the airliner? Its potential capacity makes it the largest passenger carrier in the world -- although the Boeing 747-8 is a longer aircraft. David Kaminksi-Morrow, air transport editor of Flight International magazine, says it was developed to compete with the Boeing 747 which had dominated the jumbo airliner market for decades. ""Apart from its size, the A380 is notable for its quietness,"" he said. ""It's quiet both inside and out, and that's quite an achievement, and spacious. It's also an efficient aircraft -- it has a low fuel bill per passenger which keeps the airlines and the environmental lobby happy."" Boeing says on its website that the 747-8 will be quieter, produce lower emissions and achieve better fuel economy than any competing jet liner. So what's the problem with the A380? The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) last month required checks for cracks in the 20 oldest aircraft after faults were found in the wing rib feet -- the bracket that joins the ribs to the wing surface. It has now expanded the request that carriers carry out inspection and repair on the Airbus A380 before reaching 1300 flight cycles. For aircraft already very close to 1300 flights, a six-week window is being provided so they can plan ahead for their inspection to minimize disruption to their operations. A spokesman for the aviation agency said the planes could still fly, but had to be checked within the time frame, and a long-term fix was being worked on with Airbus. The original cracks were found as a result of investigations into a separate incident in which a Qantas A380 suffered an engine failure in November 2010. If cracks are found, the airline must contact Airbus for instruction, the safety agency said. Should passengers be worried? Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders told CNN's Richard Quest last month that the cracks in the wing rib feet were ""minor"" and that safety was an ""absolute priority."" Kaminski-Morrow also said he didn't believe safety was an issue, adding: ""It's a structural issue and structural issues have to be investigated but the wing isn't going to fall off as a result of the problem. EASA could ground the aircraft if it wanted to -- but hasn't. It's not categorized as an emergency."" In response to last month's checks, Enders said: ""What we have developed already is a repair solution, and this is what we will apply on the various aircraft if and where it is necessary."" He also said the fault was confined to the A380 and confirmed that it was not a wider problem on the Airbus range. What does it mean for Airbus? Enders admitted the fault was embarrassing for Airbus but Kaminski-Morrow described it as more of a ""teething problem."" He told CNN Wednesday: ""I don't think this will harm its reputation in the long term. The plane is very reliable and proving to be very popular. I think the airlines will stick with it. It's selling. The A380 is here to stay."" What about the competition? The rivalry between Airbus and American competitor Boeing is intense. Both companies have accused each other of receiving illegal subsidies and in 2005 both filed complaints with the World Trade Organization. The wide-bodied Boeing 747-8 was made in response to the A380 to battle for the custom of airlines running long-haul routes, and for freight trade -- and the manufacturers continue to upgrade their designs and improve efficiency. When the two models were compared by Flight International in 2006, the magazine concluded: ""It will be another five years at least until it becomes clear who has got it right, but one thing is certain -- the airlines at last have what they always wanted and that is a choice of supplier at the top end of the size spectrum.""","The European air safety agency has ordered safety checks for all Airbus A380s after cracks were found in the wings .
The A380 can potentially carry more than 800 passengers and is said by an industry expert to be a very quiet aircraft .
Its main rival is the Boeing 747-8 which is also claimed to be quiet and efficient .

"(CNN) -- Even though urinary incontinence affects about 25 million Americans and there are many treatment options to improve symptoms, talking about the often unexpected and always urgent need ""to go"" is still taboo, even with your doctor. In my own practice, I see patients who have been living in a constant state of anxiety about their urinary incontinence, mapping out restroom locations for every trip outside their home. It is not uncommon for my patients to avoid wearing light-colored clothing or to carry an extra set of clothes in their car. Many times, patients don't realize that the issue could have been treated in its earliest stage, before it controls their life. There are five common misconceptions that keep patients from speaking with their doctors about their loss of bladder control. It's time we dispel these myths. Myth: I'm the only person with incontinence. The 24.999999 million other Americans with incontinence would disagree with you. Most individuals with incontinence fall into one of two categories: . â€¢ Stress urinary incontinence: leakage of urine when you laugh, cough, exercise, etc. It usually results from weakened pelvic floor muscles. â€¢ Urgency urinary incontinence/overactive bladder: loss of urine associated with a sudden and uncontrollable urge to urinate. It can be ""idiopathic,"" meaning there's no underlying cause, or it could result from a neurologic disorder. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Occasionally, loss of bladder control is the first noticeable symptom of a larger problem like multiple sclerosis or pelvic organ prolapse. Myth: It's irreversible. The goal of speaking with your doctor is to regain the bladder control you once had and restore your quality of life. In many cases, this is a reasonable objective. When preparing for this appointment, be sure to describe in detail any other conditions you have as well as all of the medications you take. This can affect the treatment plan your doctor develops for you. You may even want to keep a log or a diary as to when, how much and under what conditions you leak. This will help your physician get a good snapshot of your daily life. Myth: It's a 'normal' part of aging. Although loss of bladder control is commonly associated with aging, it is not an inevitable part of the aging process. Although it is more common in women older than 40, incontinence can happen to anyone -- men or women, young or old. Too often, I have had patients who thought that treatment wasn't an option because of their age. This is not the case. If you happen to lose urine every time you sneeze, or if you suddenly have an uncontrollable urge ""to go"" when you turn the faucet on to wash the dishes, consider talking to your doctor about your symptoms. This is not ""normal,"" regardless of your age, and a doctor can help you manage this condition before it gets worse. Myth: Medications are your only option. This is not the case at all. In fact, treatment options can range from the most basic lifestyle and behavioral changes, medications, interventional therapies such as Onabotulinumtoxin A, medical devices like neuromodulation or surgery. No two patients are the same; some may need instructions on behavioral changes to improve their control while others may need a combination of therapies. Myth: It's annoying but not serious. Incontinence is an inconvenience. However, the seriousness of this condition is measured by the level of undue stress it causes a patient -- and the negative impact it has on your quality of life and those in close contact with you. Talk to your doctor in the early stages, before you become a prisoner to your bladder.","Urinary incontinence, the uncontrollable urge to ""go,"" is still taboo for many people .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Air Force One lands in Estonia's capital Wednesday, the U.S. message to Vladimir Putin -- only 500 miles away in Moscow -- will be clear: Stay put. President Barack Obama's trip to the former Soviet state, ahead of this week's NATO summit in Wales, is meant to reassure nervous Eastern Europe that Putin's support for separatists in Ukraine doesn't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere. The warning to Russia was summed up by a top Obama foreign policy adviser last week: ""Don't even think about messing around in Estonia or in any of the Baltic areas in the same way that you have been messing around in Ukraine."" Added to the schedule only last month, the stop in Estonia will supplement the message coming from NATO leaders gathering in Cardiff, Wales, who are set to announce the positioning of troops and equipment closer to Russia in Eastern Europe. NATO needs to create 'high-readiness force,' secretary general says . Those leaders also must confront the separate threat of militant Islamists making gains in Syria and Iraq, prompting more worries for NATO states on the eastern edge of the military alliance. That's not to mention the very reason for the summit -- to determine how NATO's mission will proceed in Afghanistan when combat troops depart at the end of the year. The global unrest, causing political strife for Obama in the United States, could provide a new purpose for the 65-year-old NATO alliance, which is suffering an ""identity crisis,"" according to one analyst. Russian official: Russia is emotionally in Ukraine, its troops are not . Putin's actions in Russia have ""required NATO to really adapt and change fairly dramatically,"" said Heather Conley, who directs the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""In some ways, NATO should thank Vladimir Putin because it was really searching for its purpose,"" Conley said. Warning Putin . NATO members that border Russia, watching the once-unthinkable breach of Ukraine's borders, are looking to the military alliance to affirm its commitment to Article 5, which provides for collective defense of states under attack. Ukraine isn't a NATO member, though leaders did invite the country's new president Petro Poroshenko to Wales this week. Other former Soviet states, like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, joined NATO in the last decade, hoping to bolster ties to the West while increasing their own security frameworks. As reassurance to those countries, NATO leaders plan to approve the creation of a ""high-readiness"" force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in Eastern Europe. Ukraine warns of return to 'full-scale war' White House officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for Russia, though initial reaction from the Kremlin -- which called the move an ""external threat"" -- foreshadowed a potential escalation in the crisis. NATO and Russia have agreed since 1997 that no permanent NATO troops will be positioned in Eastern Europe, meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to Russia. Charles Kupchan, Obama's top adviser for European affairs, said leaders will describe the new effort as a ""persistent"" force in the easternmost countries, rather than ""permanent."" ""We will see persistent rotation, persistent exercises to ensure that Estonia and that other countries in Central and Eastern Europe are provided the reassurance from NATO and the presence of NATO needed to meet their security needs,"" he said. Opinion: What is Russia doing in Ukraine and what can the West do? Battling ISIS . Not on the official agenda in Wales, the ongoing spread of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria will nonetheless play a major role in Obama's discussions in Wales. The President has said he wants to form a coalition of governments willing to take on the group, which has taken over huge swaths of territory and terrorized ethnic minorities. Officials say that could include a role for NATO, though in what capacity is so far unclear -- after all, Obama himself hasn't yet decided whether to undertake airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. Western European leaders must also confront the growing threat of ""homegrown terrorism"" -- citizens leaving to fight with militant groups in Syria and Iraq, and potentially returning to stage a terror attack at home. The host of the NATO summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron, already announced new measures to combat that threat after a London-accented militant was filmed beheading journalist James Foley. ISIS video shows beheading of second journalist . ""There will have to be an acknowledgment that individual European countries, and certainly the United States, are taking action, actively working militarily on issues relating to Iraq and then potentially Syria,"" said Kathleen Hicks, the director of the international security program at CSIS. Cameron lays out plans to counter U.K. jihadi threat . Afghanistan's future . Just as the United States is watching anxiously the final outcome of Afghanistan's recent election, NATO member states are wondering what their role will be there after this year ends. Both candidates in the contested vote have said they'll sign an agreement allowing U.S. troops to remain there past 2014. But without a winner, the Bilateral Security Agreement remains unsigned. Hanging over the decision is the security situation in Iraq, which has completely unraveled following U.S. troops' withdrawal. Neither Obama nor his NATO counterparts want the same thing to happen in Afghanistan. Gunmen target spy agency in Afghanistan . ""We're moving into a world in which NATO will be less salient in Afghanistan, but in which we want to capitalize on the lessons that we've learned, the partnerships that we've built,"" Kupchan said. No expansion . NATO last admitted new members in 2009, but leaders are quick to note this year's summit isn't about expansion. The appetite for letting countries like Bosnia and Macedonia -- labeled ""aspirant countries"" -- into the club has waned. It's hard enough to get the 28 current members to agree on things, officials say. Case in point: NATO is having a tough time convincing its members to spend more on their militaries, a requirement for membership. The United States spends about 4.4% of its gross domestic produce on defense, according to NATO figures; the European average is 1.6%. NATO's guidelines encourage countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. ""Part of the reason I think this NATO meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that NATO plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our Article 5 assurances,"" Obama said at a news conference last week. But analysts say as long as economic conditions in Europe remain bleak, countries will remain hesitant to ramp up their military spending, even as external threats grow. ""The Ukraine crisis has been a wake-up call,"" Conley of CSIS said. ""Now, whether the Europeans will hit the snooze button or not, again, I don't know, but it has certainly shaken them, that they have allowed their military defense spending to atrophy to a point where they are now vulnerable.""","Obama's trip is meant to reassure Eastern Europe that Putin doesn't have free pass .
Militant Islamists' gains in Iraq and Syria also cause for concern for NATO members .

"(CNN) -- World champion Marc Marquez clinched his 11th victory of the season Sunday after returning to winning ways at the British MotoGP at Silverstone. The 21-year-old has had a stunning season so far, clinching 10 pole positions and winning all but one of twelve races. His only blip was a fourth-place finish in the last MotoGP in the Czech Republic. But the Spanish Honda rider didn't have it all his own way at Silverstone and enjoyed a pulsating fight with two-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo, whose Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was third. ""Honestly Jorge was much stronger than I expected,"" Marquez said after extending his championship lead to 89 points over Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa, who was fourth. ""When I passed him the first time I made a small mistake and he got the lead back ... However, I recalled what happened last year and I didn't want a repeat of that so I ensured once I got back in front again I wouldn't let it slip."" In an engrossing race last year's winner Lorenzo initially took the lead from Marquez at the start. Marquez stayed on Lorenzo's shoulder throughout and managed to pass him, only for Lorenzo to take the lead again with five laps to go.

"(CNN)  -- A central Colombian farm worker has been accused of raping his daughter for decades and fathering eight children with her. The daughter, 35-year-old Alba Nidia, told CNN that her biological father has sexually abused her since she was about 5, shortly after her mother's death, resulting in 14 pregnancies. Eight children -- five girls and three boys -- survived. Her father, Arcedio Alvarez Quintero, is being held in jail to face charges of sexual abuse, incest and aggravated sexual assault. Alvarez and his family live near the town of Mariquita in the western province of Tolima, and the local media have dubbed him a ""monster."" The case has been likened to that of Josef Fritzl, the 73-year-old Austrian who was sentenced this month to life in prison for imprisoning and raping his daughter in his basement over 24 years, during which time she gave birth to seven children. Alvarez's lawyer, Ricardo Correa, told CNN affiliate Caracol that his client appeared Saturday before a judge, who read the three charges. The judge ruled that the case against Alvarez was strong enough for him to be jailed with special protection as he awaits trial. No trial date has been scheduled. Caracol reported that Alvarez entered ""innocent"" pleas to the charges. Correa did not respond to CNN requests for an interview. According to Caracol, the 59-year old Alavarez told the court he is innocent. Correa told Caracol that his client's defense ""will be that Alba Nidia is not his biological daughter,"" but his adopted child. Nidia insists that she is his daughter. Authorities plan to conduct blood tests to determine the two's genetic relationship, local officials said. ""I feel confused -- knowing that he has been arrested, he is still my father,"" Nidia told CNN in a phone interview. ""But I think it's the right thing to do."" She added that, ""The children don't talk about this situation. They are silent much of the time."" Gilma Jimenez, a local councilwoman who has had close contact with Nidia, has offered her financial assistance and has been speaking out against child abuse. ""One of the tragedies of this whole story, is that it seems that many different people in the community knew about this situation, but no one said anything,"" Jimenez told CNN. ""This is the indifference, the silence that encourages more child abuse."" Nidia said that ""problems in the house"" forced her to run away from the home she shared with her father nine months ago, taking her five daughters -- the youngest of whom was less than a year old -- and her 5-year-old son. She moved to a nearby town and worked 15 hours a day at a restaurant. ""For this job, for all of those hours, she earns a miserable wage of under $3 a day,"" said Hugo Parra, an investigator with Jimenez's office. ""We've been sending her money, just so she can survive."" If Alvarez is convicted, he could receive as little as eight years, Jimenez said. ""This is not enough. ... We have failed our children in Colombia,"" she said. Jimenez added that Alvarez is receiving special protection in the jail, saying, ""Criminals will tolerate any crime, except child abuse. I'm sure all the other prisoners are waiting to try to get to him."" This case comes as Colombia is weighing whether to change the constitution to punish convicted child abusers with up to life imprisonment. A campaign calling for a referendum on the issue says it has collected more than 2 million signatures.","Daughter of Colombian farm worker says she had eight children by her father .

"(CNN) -- Philip Chism, a 15-year-old Massachusetts boy accused of raping and killing his math teacher in a high school bathroom, was arraigned Wednesday on attempted murder charges stemming from a separate attack on a female youth services clinician. Prosecutors laid out a narrative of what they said was ""the defendant's intent to murder"" a female employee last month at the Dorchester Department of Youth Services facility where Chism is being held pending trial, the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office said. A judge set bail at $250,000 and ordered Chism to not have contact with witnesses, including the victim. He is to appear in court September 19 and an automatic ""not a youthful offender"" plea was entered on his behalf. Prosecutor: Chism planned attack on youth counselor . Assistant District Attorney Mark Zanini said that on June 2, Chism was in the facility's main room, which is bordered by a low wall. A staff member was seated at a station behind the wall, able to look down into the room. Behind the staffer was a hallway used by staff. Zanini said Chism had refused to attend classes while in custody. Instead, Chism was instructed to sit and study at a table in the open room. Despite a rule that he sit at the table closest to his room, Chism allegedly sat at a table that provided him a view of the hallway behind the staffer, the statement said. At some point, the 29-year-old female victim, whom Chism had known for several months, walked down the hallway and entered a bathroom inside a staff locker room, according to the statement. Chism was ""confident the other staffer was distracted"" and kicked off his sandals, which would have made noise on the floor, before moving toward the hallway in a crouch that kept him out of the staffer's view, Zanini said at the arraignment. Chism had a pencil in his hand and opened the door to the locker room, according to the statement. When the female clinician came out of the bathroom, Chism stared at her from about a foot away. He placed both his hands around her neck and began to choke her while pushing her back against the cinder block wall in the bathroom, according to the statement. The victim was unable to scream because Chism's hands tightly gripped her throat, Zanini said. When she managed to get his right hand away from her neck, Chism punched her in the face, head and jaw, prosecutors said. She screamed as other staffers rushed to help her and restrain him, Zanini told the court. The victim suffered bruises to her face, jaw and head, along with a scratch on her back consistent with a tear in her shirt that appeared to be from the pencil Chism carried, according to the statement. Chism was charged with attempted murder by strangulation, assault with intent to murder, kidnapping and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon: a pencil and the cinder block wall. Chism's attorney, Denise Regan, declined to comment. Chism is also accused of killing his algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer. Chism, 14 at the time, used a box cutter he had taken to school to kill Ritzer, 24, in October 2013 in a girls' bathroom at Danvers High School, police and prosecutors said. Massachusetts teen admitted killing popular teacher, affidavit says . Chism pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder charges in January. He is being tried as an adult. After Chism was reported missing by his mother on the evening of October 22, police had his cellular phone company ""ping"" the location of his phone. The phone was found to be near the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left. A court affidavit said that when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife; a search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" Police said he was carrying credit cards and a driver's license belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of women's underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, court papers said. Her throat was slit. Chism's case for the alleged assault on the youth services worker is scheduled for a pretrial conference on September 19, but his presence for that event has been waived, according to the statement.

"(CNN) -- Historian David W. Blight has written that the first Memorial Day took place in Charleston, South Carolina. On May 1, 1865, a crowd of African-Americans -- recently freed from slavery -- honored the Union soldiers entombed in the rocky ground of the Charleston Race Course. Twenty-nine days later, William Tecumseh Sherman concluded his farewell order from the United States Army with the words, ""Your general now bids you farewell, with the full belief that, as in war you have been good soldiers, so in peace you will make good citizens."" On this Memorial Day 2014, we must acknowledge, not as a member of Congress, a veteran of the Vietnam War and a journalist-filmmaker, but as one nation indivisible, that Sherman's hope for American soldiers is not being realized today. According to current Veterans Administration estimates, 22 American veterans take their lives every single day. High rates of unemployment, homelessness, alcoholism, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress are decimating our community of veterans. With the wars of the past 13 years in Iraq and Afghanistan coming to a close, we are seeing too many casualties among American soldiers in this transition to peace. In light of this crisis, we need a new kind of Memorial Day. Many veterans are desperate to talk about their experiences with fellow Americans who accept shared responsibility for what is done in war, particularly the killing. Yet these conversations rarely happen today. How can a veteran truly come home unless we acknowledge that our nation's wars are something we all chose and paid for? Returning Vietnam veterans were treated shamefully. That, thankfully, is behind America. We've moved from outright hostility to awkward, if well-meant, expressions of ""thank you for your service"" and the creation of a number of new veterans services organizations. However, there remains an abiding sense of national indifference, or worse, a sense that somehow veterans are victims. This must change. There are more than 2 million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in America. That they are all proud volunteers doesn't excuse us from helping them come home. Yes, the VA and other government services that cater to veterans need to work better, but there is an additional, crucial step that America must take: The entire nation must accept responsibility for the wounds, psychological and physical, that they bring home from war. Opposing the recent wars does not exempt one from this responsibility any more than opposing national health care exempts one from having to take care of America's sick and injured. Many veterans didn't see combat, but all were separated from their families for long periods and subjected to the enormous stresses of life in a war zone. Ironically, a consequence is that veterans often feel excluded from the very society they helped defend. Other cultures understood this obligation to help rebuild the bond between a returning warrior and his community. In early Native American cultures, a warrior back from battle participated in purification ceremonies intended to reaffirm his identity. These rituals also empowered the community to welcome the warrior home: To listen to his battle tales, to appreciate his sacrifice, and to assert his value in society. In our modern society, tribal rituals should give way to a concerted, national effort to share in the stories of our fighting men and women. Pomp and circumstance are fine, but what our veterans really need is a solemn commemoration that the wars of the past 13 years -- wars waged by all of us -- are over. Our veterans also need public forums in which to tell their stories. Our soldiers' stories are visceral, and sometimes repugnant, and their telling can close the widening gap that exists between our military and the rest of American society. We are either one nation or we're not. We can't have it both ways. This is what future Memorial Days in America could mean to us all. Whether through community forums, statewide listening tours or action at the federal level, a national embrace of our veterans' experiences is a profound way to combat today's veterans' crisis. Each and every American must make a commitment to help return our soldiers to society: cleansed, rehabilitated, welcomed, and empowered. Our soldiers deserve a Memorial Day 2.0. And, as we help our veterans navigate their paths of reconciliation and reintegration, we may become better citizens ourselves. We may also find that the answers to many of America's most pressing challenges are found in the pain and pride, the tragedies and triumphs, of American soldiers.","Writers: America is not fulfilling promise to soldiers to help them on their return to society .

"(CNN) -- In 1937, Amelia Mary Earhart disappeared over the Pacific Ocean attempting to circumnavigate the globe. Later this month, Amelia Rose Earhart will try to do what her namesake could not. Despite recently discovering she's not related to the more famous Amelia Earhart (for years she'd believed she was), the 31-year-old pilot will attempt to become the youngest woman to navigate around the world in a single-engine aircraft. CNN spoke with Earhart about her forthcoming record attempt. CNN: Did your name spark your interest in aviation? Amelia Rose Earhart: Getting asked questions day in and day out about my name has always been a part of my life. People would say to me, ""Are you a pilot? Do you think you can ever fly around the world?"" And for a long time, I said, ""No, I'm not a pilot but I always thought about flying around the world."" It was always in the back of my mind just as an ultimate goal. So I took my very first discovery flight, which is basically the first flight that every pilot goes through. After that first discovery flight, I was totally hooked. CNN: What was your reaction when you discovered that you weren't related to Amelia Earhart? Earhart: It was a blow because, for 30 years, I thought that I was related to Amelia in some distant way. But it really wasn't why I started flying, I wanted to fly because it's a lot of fun. So at this point, I'm almost glad that the distant relationship isn't there because it shows that you don't have to be named after somebody famous to do something great. CNN: Why recreate her flight? Earhart: As pilots, whenever we fly, we have a flight plan. We open that flight plan, and then when we return safely, we close that flight plan. Unfortunately, when Amelia disappeared in 1937, she never got a chance to close her flight plan and that's what we all, as pilots, hope to do. I started thinking, ""What if I could symbolically close Amelia's flight plan for her?"" CNN: When is the takeoff date and where will you start and end the flight? Earhart: We start and stop the flight in Oakland, California. When you look at the departure date, we've got a three-day window from June 23 to 26. The reason for that is we're doing installations on the plane: additional fuel tanks and also a satellite communications system that will allow us to livestream from the cockpit. CNN: How long will the entire trip take and how much will it cost? Earhart: The whole trip will take two and a half weeks. We've got 17 stops in 14 countries. Over the past year and a half, I would say close to $2 million is probably the total value of the trip. CNN: Are you nervous about embarking on such a major endeavor? Earhart: My biggest fear is that the trip will just fly by and the two and a half weeks will be over before I know it. I've spent years planning this and it is my passion project. I don't have a lot fear around what if something goes wrong with the aircraft. That's not a concern of mine at all. I do have realistic expectations if something happens weather-wise. Flying around the inter-tropical convergent zone is particularly tough for pilots so I'm paying close attention to the weather patterns there. CNN: Does the legend of your namesake worry you at all? Earhart: Not at all. Amelia's disappearance unfortunately came at a time when the technology just wasn't there to track her. But when you think about how far that's come in the last 77 years, we're looking at whole different world. I'm flying the Pilatus PC12 which is a single-engine turboprop and it's one of most technologically advanced planes out there. We've got dual GPS systems on the aircraft. We've got navigation that shows us exactly where we are and exactly what point in space. We want to show people that ... even small planes can be very manageable over long trips like this.

"(CNN) -- LeVar Burton's campaign to revive ""Reading Rainbow"" just got a big boost. Actor and ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane has pledged to match donations to the effort, Burton announced on his Kickstarter page. In a video posted there, Burton calls it a ""stupendous offer."" ""Over the next five remaining days of the campaign, Seth has agreed to match dollar for dollar every pledge made up to $1 million,"" Burton says in the the video. ""It's going to give us the ability to give the Reading Rainbow product away to many more classrooms in need. This is huge!"" The ""Reading Rainbow"" television series aired on PBS from 1983 to 2006. In a recent interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Burton explained that two years ago the ""Reading Rainbow"" app was released to keep the tradition of increasing literacy among children alive. His Kickstarter campaign, Burton said, is aimed at helping that program expand. ""This additional money will help us really have universal access,"" Burton said.

"(CNN) -- Shoppers from as far as Japan descend on Springfield, Ohio, for its twice-yearly market of 19th-century antiques. But the event isn't stuck in the past. In 2012, it introduced live music, beer and wine stands, and trend-driven clothing and housewares. The effort is paying off in Springfield, where the May 2012 market drew a record-breaking weekend crowd of 21,000 shoppers, and flea markets across America are seeing a similar surge of interest. Some credit goes to the popularity of reality TV series like Oddities, American Pickers, and Market Warriors, which have picked up the Roadshow mantle and are mining the world of secondhand buying, selling, and collecting. Read more: Savvy shoppers seek American-made products . As a result, a whole new group of travelers is discovering that braving the crowds at America's liveliest flea markets delivers more than just deals; it's a chance to get immersed in a local community, to be an archaeologist of the present. Who needs potshards when you can pick up a piece of North Carolina Pisgah Forest Pottery circa 1940—just a few hours' drive from where it was made? Fortunately, secondhand markets have never been more varied—or more vibrant. A new wave of urban fleas has taken off in Seattle, Chicago, Brooklyn, and beyond, bringing together old-fashioned junk-shoppers and a slew of budding entrepreneurs, artists, and chefs, who benefit from the real-time, in-the-flesh market research (small-batch raspberry-and-green-peppercorn soda, anyone?).Read on for our favorites, along with tips to get the most out of your market day. T+L Insider Video: Outdoor markets . Rose Bowl Flea Market, Pasadena, California . All you need to know about visiting this iconic celebrity magnet east of L.A. can be summed up in seven words: Arrive at eight. (It's only $2 more than the general admission that begins at 9 a.m.) Wear sunblock. (This is southern California, after all.) Turn left. That's where you'll find the market's antiques booths and, beyond them, just over the two small footbridges, lower-priced odds and ends and 600 vendors of vintage clothing; denim and dresses are a particular strength. If we may suggest six more words for your consideration: Make-your-own-Bloody-Mary bar (in the food court). Tip: Skip the areas within the stadium and to the north and east—unless you're in the market for as-seen-on-TV gizmos and other new merchandise. Brimfield Antique Shows, Massachusetts . The three annual Brimfield Antique Shows have grown to encompass more than 20 individual shows (known as fields), each with hundreds of vendors lined up along a one-mile stretch of Route 20 (get a field-by-field breakdown at brimfieldshow.com). Many take the same spots season after season, and repeat visits make the experience less overwhelming. For a taste of the original, browse the old wooden trunks, braided rugs, and Depression glass at J&J Promotions, run by the daughters of Brimfield founder Gordon Reid and held on the same field where Reid staged the first event back in 1959. Tip: The Tatnuck Postal & Business Center at Brimfield Acres North (413-427-0311) offers UPS and FedEx shipping services for purchases you can't fit into your suitcase. Canton First Monday Trade Days, Texas . Few American flea markets can measure up to Canton in terms of history: residents of this small town an hour east of Dallas have been hauling their goods here to trade since 1850, when everything from hunting dogs to hand tools was bartered outside the courthouse during the circuit judge's monthly visit. Today, the market covers more than 100 acres of land a few blocks from the original courthouse square location. The merchandise is more varied than ever, with vintage cowboy boots, handcrafted leather saddles, antique silver, 19th-century flow blue pottery, and homemade hot sauce among the 6,000-plus regular stalls. Tip: Target the Civic Center building for antiques and collectibles at least 20 years old, plus air-conditioning and restrooms. T+L: The world's coolest bazaars . Springfield Antique Show & Flea Market, Ohio . Even a gold standard like Springfield—which draws more than 20,000 shoppers, including designers and collectors from as far away as Japan—sees fit to up the ante once in a while. In 2012, it has rounded out its dealers of 19th-century midwestern antiques and 45 food vendors (Crazy Uncle Larry's one-pound pork chops!) with live music, beer and wine stands, and a tented Vintage Marketplace dedicated to more trend-driven clothing, accessories, and housewares. The same exit of Interstate 70 leads to two more outstanding places to shop: AAA I-70 Antique Mall and Springfield Antique Center. Tip: Pick up a program at the main gates to help navigate the booths of this 130-acre fairground arranged like a wagon wheel, with spokes radiating out from a central point. Scott Antique Markets, Atlanta, Georgia . An interior decorator's dream, and a regular resource for the likes of Top Design alum Eddie Ross, Atlanta's monthly 3,300-booth Scott Antique Markets provides consistent conditions (two climate-controlled exhibition centers with shuttle bus transportation), and predictable pricing (not quite garage-sale cheap, but less expensive than some more-famous markets). You're almost guaranteed to find heirloom-quality oil paintings, French armoires, and upholstered furniture in the mix. Note: this is not the place to come for makeover projects; most everything for sale is already rehabbed and ready to go. Tip: Print a coupon from the sale's website for $1 off your admission. T+L: World's coolest museum gift shops . Chicago Antique Market, Illinois . Industrial artifacts, funky lighting, Midcentury Modern furniture, and artwork by alums of Chicago's School of the Art Institute (Koons, O'Keeffe) are standouts at this highly curated monthly event. Themed weekends might highlight a season (July's sunglass shop and manicure station) or a holiday (February's love-letter-writing desk and displays of couture and jewelry). On-site services include antique appraisals, lamp repair, and furniture restoration, as well as crystal and porcelain refurbishing. Delivery of furniture more than $200 in value is free in the downtown area. Tip: Your $10 admission comes with a $5 refund voucher for use toward a purchase of an item worth at least $25 at most vendor booths. Just ask. Alameda Point Antiques Faire, California . With its unmatched user-friendliness (free shuttles from the rear parking lot, shopping carts, an all-marble bathroom in the new Auction Annex), it's no wonder this 800-vendor sale has been a northern California favorite for 15 years. But even stripped of those creature comforts, the 13,000 regular shoppers would still turn out for the impeccably art-directed displays of antique French furniture, Bakelite serving trays, and metal sign letters—plus views of the San Francisco skyline just across the bay. Tip: Head to the back of the market for better deals. That's where the newbies and latecomers, who tend to have lower prices than the pros, are assigned to set up. T+L: America's best fall color drives . Brooklyn Flea, New York . Consider it the moveable flea. In high season (April through Thanksgiving), 150 vintage/antique/artisan booths set up outdoors in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Fort Greene (Saturdays) and Williamsburg (Sundays). Come winter, they head inside the former Williamsburgh Savings Bank, a 1929 wonder with vaulted ceilings, gold-leaf mosaics, and marble floors. Expect vintage maps, retooled bicycles, and retired classroom furniture, along with handmade geometric jewelry, architectural salvage, and troves of used designer handbags. It's a scene, to be sure, but also a great place to get inspiration for your next apartment (or wardrobe) makeover—and perhaps discover an untapped appreciation for kimchi-topped hot dogs. The related market Smorgasburg focuses entirely on such creative street food. Tip: Buyers here tend to be savvy—and have overlapping tastes—so don't walk away from an item you have your eye on; it likely won't be there when you return. Raleigh Flea Market, North Carolina . An anything-goes state fair spirit runs through Raleigh's weekly flea market, held on, yes, the fairgrounds every Saturday and Sunday—except in October, when the actual state fair is in full swing. A thousand vendors spread out between six buildings and several acres of fields and lots, hawking used books, bluegrass albums, North Carolina pottery, batteries, and barbecued pork. Throw in family-friendly extras (face-painting booths) and access to other events (a handbell festival, say, or a model train expo), and you've got plenty of diversions for the 2.4 million shoppers the event draws annually. Tip: Weather in Raleigh is fairly mild year-round, and since much of the market is indoors anyway, there's no reason not to dig for deals in, say, January. Portland Expo Antique and Collectible Show, Oregon . Although all the items at Portland's thrice-annual antiquing event must be at least 30 years old, this 1,100-vendor bazaar is anything but stuck in the past. Proof: while it's always been a mother lode for old-school toys, nostalgic knickknacks, and Americana of all kinds, over the last few years, the event's savvy organizers have begun catering to a new, younger audience, adding in more of what's selling now (Victoriana, vintage hats, '40s and '50s kitchenware). Tip: Take advantage of Portland's public transportation. The light rail's Yellow Line will get you from downtown to the Expo Center MAX Station in about half an hour. See more at Travel+Leisure .

"(CNN) -- In the time it takes you to skim this piece, you could travel 95 stories into the clouds on the world's new fastest elevator. The elevator will operate in a new supertall skyscraper being built in Guangzhou, China. With a top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), this lift will fling you nearly half a kilometer in just 43 seconds. That's like riding a speeding commuter train -- into the sky. The elevator incorporates high-tech wizardry to give you a comfortable ride even as you're shooting vertically toward the heavens. According to manufacturer Hitachi, special technology will regulate air pressure within the car to keep your ears from getting blocked as you fly skywards. ""Rollers"" will keep the car from swinging wildly from side to side. And in case something goes wrong on the way down? Newly developed brakes are high able to resist extreme heat -- up to 300 degrees Celsius, says Hitachi. Can't wait to ride it? Too bad -- the Guangzhou CTF Financial Centre skyscraper doesn't officially open until 2016. At 1,739 feet (530 meters) tall, the building will be one of the world's tallest -- though not as tall as the current record-holder Burj Khalifa, which stands at 2,717 feet (828 meters). And even that building will be dwarfed by the upcoming Kingdom Tower in Saudi Arabia, expected to pierce the skies at 3,281 feet (1 kilometer) high.","Hitachi's new lift climbs 95 floors in 43 seconds .

"Washington (CNN) -- CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on ""Inside Politics"" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Fallout from Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation, an intriguing new GOP 2016 trial balloon and two key 2014 crunch-time calculations made for a lively trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table Sunday. 1. Election day is 37 days away, unless it was yesterday . If you live in a 2014 battleground state and are getting inundated with campaign calls and door knocks, there may be a solution: Vote early. Early balloting began this past week in Iowa and Minnesota, two states with Senate races being closely watched this year, and it's coming soon in other states with key contests. When it is all said and done, some strategists keeping track of things this year suggest as much as 30% of the vote could come from early and absentee balloting. Democrats in recent cycles have bragged they have a more sophisticated -- and successful -- system to identify voters who might not show up on Election Day and to push them to vote early. And some Democrats have suggested their technological and organizational prowess will again prove decisive in some key places this year. But Republicans insist 2014 will be different, and with so many key Senate races so close, the performance in the early voting arena could be a big battleground within the battlegrounds. And remember -- campaigns see the lists of those who vote early, and in most cases you will be crossed off the phone bank list! 2. Crunch time means tough $$ decisions . Some candidates and campaigns are about to realize they have fewer friends than they thought. With so many close races, and the battle for control of the Senate so tight, the political parties and their super PAC supporters are beginning to make some tough calls on spending priorities. Politico's Manu Raju, for example, reports Republicans are starting to hold back spending in Michigan's Senate race because the Democrat is leading and the GOP has urgent needs elsewhere. (Kansas, for example.) And as Democrats look to hone their final-weeks spending, Raju reports that Kentucky is getting a skeptical look -- even though Democrats would LOVE to knock off the GOP incumbent, Sen. Mitch McConnell. ""These are key decisions that are being made, not just for the race for the Senate, but also as we mentioned before, the runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana,"" said Raju. ""Republicans are already setting aside millions of dollars to spend in Louisiana and Democrats are going to have to make that decision too, soon."" 3. The next attorney general -- an LGBT trailblazer? As President Obama searches for a new attorney general, gay rights organizations are suggesting it is time for a bold, historic stroke. Julie Pace of The Associated Press says a former U.S. attorney, Jenny Durkan, is being pushed by some liberals. She is a lesbian, and if nominated and confirmed would be the first openly gay Cabinet member. ""The president's LGBT supporters feel like nominating an openly gay Cabinet secretary would really round out his record on gay rights,"" said Pace. ""There's also politics involved, if you have Republicans in a position where they may have to weigh how tough they go after a gay woman in the lead-up to a presidential year where they're trying to look more inclusive -- that could be all kinds of headaches for the GOP."" 4. Holder's post-administration plans . The Washington Post's Nia Malika Henderson told us back in August that Holder was plotting his exit strategy and had shared his early thinking with Obama. Now, Henderson has some insights into Holder's next chapter. ""Once he's gone, I hear he's interested in writing a book, perhaps teaching, but also maybe some sort of foundation work to really give back to his roots and his legacy, which is around civil rights,"" said Henderson. 5. Is Fiorina the GOP's answer to Clinton? Carly Fiorina's 2010 California Senate campaign didn't turn out so well. But the former Hewlett-Packard CEO is apparently dipping her toes into the 2016 presidential waters anyway. Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times tells us there is plenty of skepticism, but also notes that Fiorina recently made some political rounds in New Hampshire and made it clear she was thinking about it. ""It's just going to be really fascinating to watch just how much the Republicans want a strong female face in that mix,"" said Reston.","As much as 30% of the vote could come from early balloting .

"(CNN) -- Attention all who drool over head-turning, rubber-burning cars: Here's your candy store. This weekend the world famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway hosts two days of races between hundreds of vintage vehicles spanning the past 100 years. They're billing the Brickyard Vintage Racing Invitational as the ""largest gathering of race cars in the United States."" Al Unser Jr., Buddy Lazier, Parnelli Jones and Bobby Unser. Ever heard of these guys? They're Indy 500 winners. They'll be there -- on the track and behind the wheel. The whole weekend threatens to be a 100-mph-plus parade of eye-popping race cars that would quite literally blow your hair back. But let's be frank: This is a celebration of a time when race cars were, well, a helluva lot more interesting to look at. Right? If you've never seen the lines of Johnny Rutherford's 1980 Indy-winning ""Yellow Submarine"" Chaparral, do yourself a favor. Enjoy some eye candy. Same with Jones' 1963 winning car ""Ol' Calhoun,"" which took the checkered flag as it crossed Indy's brick start/finish line. Respect Calhoun's awesome side-pipe and its snazzy front-end air scoops. Both cars are expected to come out to play this weekend. Related: Hunter-Reay wins Indy 500 . The 1960s, '70s and '80s offered a smorgasbord of car designs born from mechanical grit. Unser Jr., a two-time Indy 500 winner, plans to get behind the wheel of a 1969 Corvette Sting Ray this weekend and ""open it up all I can,"" he said. ""I'm gonna drive it as fast as it'll go."" These are cars that were truly unique. Some cars were shaped like wedges, some like tubes. Wings in the front. Wings in the back. Compare them to today's designs -- both Indy and NASCAR. Nowadays there's a lot of what Mark Dill calls, ""sameness."" ""There's not just a hunger -- there's almost a starvation for design now among auto racing fans,"" says Dill, of the Sportscar Vintage Racing Association. ""They loved looking at the variety of cars, and this event is going to provide that in spades."" The weekend is sponsored by the association -- a race car restoration and preservation group dedicated to ""rolling art."" ""Some people collect art,"" their website says. ""We race it."" In addition to the open-wheel Indy racers, the event plans to showcase Corvettes, Mustangs and Camaros from the '60s and '70s. Also invited: cars made by Ferrari, Porsche, Jaguar and MG. Related: Art museum features dream concept cars . Related: Kurt Busch drives in two races on same day . While car designs have remained much the same, other aspects of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway have been shifting gears during the past 20 years. The hallowed facility has embraced new ideas like no other time in its history. ""It's changed a lot,"" says Indianapolis Motor Speedway historian Donald Davidson, who's been a part of the Indy 500 since the mid-1960s. Take for example, the Snake Pit -- known during the 1970s as a scandalous den of race-fan debauchery located in the infield. It made headlines in 1974 when dozens of naked race fans climbed the fence and ""streaked"" down Turn One. After that, officials ""very subtly phased the Snake Pit out,"" Davidson recalls. Five years ago, the speedway opened a safer, sanctioned, ""new-school"" Snake Pit inside Turn Three, complete with international DJs, dancing, food trucks and volleyball. This weekend, overnight camping in the infield will be available for the first time, according to the speedway's video. Related: Cuba races its classic cars . Privately owned by Indiana's Hulman family for nearly 70 years, the track executed an ambitious plan in the '90s to embrace other forms of auto racing, including Grand Prix and NASCAR. Indy's Brickyard 400 NASCAR event sparked a new tradition at the century-old track. In 1996, winner Dale Jarrett and crew chief Todd Parrott spontaneously got down on their knees and kissed Indy's brick start-finish line. Within a year or two, everybody was kissing the bricks. It transformed into a major photo op for both the NASCAR and the Indianapolis 500. Related: IndyCar technology can protect toddlers . Some people who find themselves bored with race car design blame the rules. The IndyCar league requires teams to use the same chassis and engines. Critics say that limits car designs, and the sport suffers. Unser Jr. remembered the car he drove to his first Indy victory in 1992, when teams were allowed to choose their own chassis. ""It was a Galmer car,"" Unser said, referring to the car maker. ""We were the only ones with that kind of chassis in the race."" If the IndyCar league allowed teams to develop their own chassis once again, Unser Jr. said, ""It would help the innovation of the sport, but the cost would go through the roof."" Unser Jr. said new so-called ""aero kits"" might help spice things up a bit. Beginning in 2015, Chevrolet and Honda will offer IndyCar teams special body kits that include ""distinct aerodynamic configurations"" designed to boost speed and ""improve the diversity of the fan experience,"" according to IndyCar. Will any of today's race cars earn their way into the museums and vintage shows of tomorrow? A Facebook friend of Dill's predicted that museums will largely remain the ""same as they are today because there isn't anything new to show,"" Dill says. Some fear that the enthusiasm to ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" over the same car painted 25 different ways just won't be there. ""That may be a little hyperbolic, but it's not far off, "" says Dill. ""After all, it's variety that stimulates the imagination."" See more CNN content about motorized vehicles at Cool Cars: Hot wheels and deals . What do you think? Are today's race cars boring?

"(CNN) -- I'd already run about half the marathon when the next refreshment table came into view. Thirsty and needing to stay charged for the next 13 miles, I elbowed my way through the crowds of runners and grabbed my drink of choice. A nice glass of full-bodied red wine. This is how it rolls at the Marathon du Medoc, an annual festival of wine and running near Bordeaux, France, in which competitors strive to complete 26 miles and almost as many glasses of the local vin. Now in its 30th edition, the race is something of a legend for marathon runners. Last year I was among 3,300 runners from 53 different nations -- Japan, Canada, Australia -- joining 5,200 competitors from across France. Sure, there are prestige races in London, New York, and Chicago, but the gustatory element is lacking. Even the Paris marathon fails to offer much more than bananas and water. Instead, this marathon weaves through scenic vineyards in the Medoc region, starting in the town of Paulliac, where some of the best Bordeaux wines are produced. The run has a time limit of six hours and 30 minutes and is nicknamed ""the longest marathon in the world"" with little exaggeration. In 2013, only about 1,100 runners finished under four hours and thirty minutes -- the other 7,400 were in no rush, if they finished at all. Hairy body suits . To compare, the 2013 Paris marathon had an average speed of four hours and 10 minutes. As if it's not enough that we're all drinking, the marathon is themed each year, with nearly every participant dressed in costumes. Last year's theme, ""sci-fi,"" saw runners dressed as aliens, ""Avatar"" characters and a few daring Chewbaccas in full hairy body suits. For this year's race on September 13, 2014, 10,000 competitors are expected to dress to the theme of ""Carnival around the world."" Increasingly popular, places are hard to come by and many entrants race it competitively to win prizes of -- yep -- wine. While the Medoc hasn't resorted to operating the lottery entry systems recently adopted by the Chicago and Paris marathons, competitors now face an online scramble to sign up during several registration waves scheduled by organizers. With more runners than ever expected, locals in Paulliac are getting ready for the 2014 event. Organizers, too, are bracing themselves, preparing more medical care and water stops than typical marathon events to help runners through the stresses and strains of long-distance drinking. Competitors, meanwhile, are likely putting in last-minute training -- early morning runs and extended evenings at their local bars. Polish national Hanna Gierzynska-Zalewska, a Medoc Marathon connoisseur, will run it for the third time this year. ""There are people from all over the globe running this marathon but somehow at that race we all speak the same language,"" she says, ""and it's not only the wine talking."" Marathoner Tarun Kumar, 42 years old from Mumbai, is hoping the race will bring the fun back to running, but is hesitant about the unique refreshments. ""Wine, food along the course would be hard to resist and I have no idea how my body will react,"" he says. Dance break . Back on the road during my attempt, jogging from chateau to chateau through the vineyards, most of the other marathoners were staying hydrated as I was, tastings each property's wares. It's not every day the Rothschild family opens up its chateau to thousands of sweaty runners, but there we were, stretching our calves, glasses in hand. The runner's high mixed with slight inebriation and at about the 22-mile mark there was what seemed to be an obligatory dance break as we neared the home stretch. In a bit of pain but eager to complete the last few miles, we guzzled bits of steak, ice cream and oysters with white wine (never red with oysters -- we're not animals). My belly full and my mind slightly adrift, I crossed the finish line with the rest of the pack, ready for a good stretch and nap. My time of six hours and nine minutes wasn't going to break any records, but I thoroughly enjoyed every glass of wine offered along the way. I wasn't the only one. Amy Carlson traveled from Minnesota to do the marathon in 2013 -- her first ever despite a distaste for running. She donned a space cowboy suit, complete with antenna sticking out of a cowboy hat and silver body paint for the race. ""I've watch other marathons where friends have run and everyone looks so miserable, checking their watches,"" Carlson said. ""This event was a joyous 26.2 mile block party.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is receiving bids to build a five-story complex for the Israeli Air Force, or IAF, near Tel Aviv. The facility, mysteriously dubbed ""site 911,"" will be built under the auspices of the Foreign Military Sales program and is expected to cost the U.S. between $25 million and $100 million, according to a solicitation for bids posted on a U.S. government website. Only U.S. construction firms are able to bid on this contract, and the deadline for proposals is December 3, according to the notice. The notice, first reported on by The Washington Post, includes structural plans that show the first three underground floors are roughly 41,000 square feet and will include classrooms on Level 1, an auditorium on Level 3 and shock-resistant doors throughout. The architectural plans, drawn up by prominent Israeli firm Ada Karmi-Melamede Architects, pays close attention to the aesthetics of the design as well as the functional parameters outlined in the solicitation. For example, three picnic tables are planned for the exterior. Atypical to most Corps of Engineers contracts, the contractor hired will be required to supply mezuzahs, which it describes as parchment inscribed with Torah verses, ""for each door or opening exclusive of toilets or shower rooms."" Generally, mezuzahs are placed in a case and attached to a door frame as a sign of the Jewish faith. The construction site, on an established Israeli Air Force base, will be guarded by ""an Israeli citizen who served in the IAF"" and will be separated from military installations with a solid 6-foot fence. Despite the precautions taken around the base, construction workers will be subject to stringent security regulations. Non-Israeli employees are required to arrive on and exit from the site ""in a group only""; ""the fenced area shall have one gate only for both entering and exiting the site""; and during work hours, employees are prohibited from leaving the base. The notice also states that the employment of non-Israeli citizens is forbidden, except those from ""the U.S., Canada, Western Europe countries, Poland, Moldavia, Thailand, Philippines, Venezuela, Romania and China."" It specifies that the employment of Palestinians is strictly prohibited. In addition, it says, ""the Contracting Officer retains all rights to refuse or inhibit employment of any employee."" Site 911 appears to be one of the largest facilities built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains three offices in Israel and has been credited with building a variety of facilities for the Israel Defense Forces over the last few years, including underground hangars for Israeli fighter-bombers and command centers. The purpose of Site 911 remains unclear.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Talk of ""bloodcurdling screams"" and shots in the night took center stage Monday in the first day of testimony in the murder trial of South African amputee track star Oscar Pistorius, who killed his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, last year. ""Something terrible was happening at that house,"" Michelle Burger testified. ""Her shouts, her screams were petrifying,"" she said later. Burger was the only witness Monday in a trial that is expected to last a few weeks. Testimony was scheduled to resume Tuesday morning. Under questioning by prosecutors, Burger told the court that she heard a woman's screams and a man yelling for help. ""Just after 3, I woke up from a woman's terrible screams,"" she said. ""Then I also heard a man screaming for help. Three times he yelled for help."" Burger said her husband called authorities. She later told her husband that she feared the woman had witnessed her husband being shot ""because after he screamed, we didn't hear him."" Language issues caused problems after the lunch break, as defense attorney Barry Roux pressed Burger on her account during cross-examination. She frequently had to help her Afrikaans interpreter translate her words into English, and eventually dropped speaking in her native tongue altogether. Roux questioned Burger's timeline of events and what she heard, asking if the ""bang"" sounds she heard might not have been gunshots, but rather a cricket bat bashing at a bathroom door. She answered that she had clearly heard gunshots, testily answering Roux's questions about timing, saying she ""didn't sit there with a stopwatch and take down the timing of each shot."" Roux also suggested that the screams she had interpreted as being a woman's might have been the high-pitched screams of a terrified Pistorius. ""I'm 100% certain I heard two different people that evening,"" she responded. He also faces weapons charges . As the trial began, Pistorius pleaded not guilty to murdering Steenkamp inside his house a year ago. He also pleaded not guilty to several weapons-related charges. It's expected to take about three weeks for Judge Thokozile Matilda Masipa to hear the case and decide whether Pistorius mistook Steenkamp for a burglar, as he says, or killed her in cold blood. South Africa abolished jury trials in 1969. Pistorius faces one charge of premeditated murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing, as well as two separate gun indictments from 2012. In one incident, he is accused of shooting a 9 mm handgun out of the sunroof of his car. In the other, authorities say he illegally fired a Glock 27 in an outdoor cafe in 2012. A friend of the sprinter told CNN that Pistorius was showing the gun to a friend when it accidentally went off. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of 25 years. He also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for the firearms charge. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of ""culpable homicide,"" a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to 15 years on that charge, experts say. LIVE UPDATES: Pistorius on trial for murder . Parts of Pistorius' trial are being televised live -- a first in South Africa -- after a judge's decision last week allowing cameras in the courtroom. But witnesses have the option of not having their images televised. Burger took that option, and only her voice was broadcast. June Steenkamp, Reeva Steenkamp's mother, was in the courtroom for Monday's testimony, marking the first time she had laid eyes on Pistorius in person. The two had never met before. Steenkamp's parents have avoided previous court appearances because they wanted privacy. Pistorius' brother and sister were also present for Monday's proceedings. Dream couple . Pistorius, now 27, and Steenkamp, 29, were a young, attractive, high-profile couple popular in South Africa's social circles. Pistorius, nicknamed the ""Blade Runner"" because of the special prostheses he uses while running, won six Paralympic gold medals and became the first double amputee runner to compete in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Personal essay: What my son taught me about Oscar Pistorius . Cover girl Steenkamp, who was soon to star in a TV reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right. Everything changed before dawn on Valentine's Day 2013, as Steenkamp lay lifeless in a pool of blood on the floor of her boyfriend's house in an upscale gated community in Pretoria. Moments before, Pistorius says, he had pointed his 9 mm pistol toward an upstairs toilet room and fired four bullets through the locked door. INTERACTIVE: Explore each side's argument . Murder, or tragic mistake? The sprinter's lawyers will argue he was a man deeply in love with his girlfriend who made a terrible mistake. In court documents, Pistorius has said he heard a noise from the bathroom in the middle of the night and -- feeling vulnerable without his prosthetic legs on -- charged toward the bathroom on his stumps. He has said he shot through the toilet door in order to protect himself and Steenkamp. ""I felt a sense of terror rushing over me,"" he said in his court affidavit. ""There are no burglar bars across the bathroom window and I knew that contractors who worked at my house had left the ladders outside."" ""It filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet. I thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window. As I did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, I knew I had to protect Reeva and myself."" Prosecutors are painting a different picture. They say the pair had an argument and that Steenkamp locked herself in the toilet. At last year's bail hearing, the state said Pistorius put on his prosthetic legs, collected his gun from under the bed and walked down the hall leading from the bedroom to the bathroom before unloading a flurry of shots through the door. Pistorius is not claiming self-defense; he is claiming to have been mistaken about his need for self-defense. He is denying that he intentionally, unlawfully killed Steenkamp. He has never denied killing her. The case has put the spotlight on South Africa's rampant gun violence and high crime rates. Roughly 45 people are murdered every day, according to police statistics, and the number of home burglaries is up 70% in the last decade. In 2012, more than half of South Africans told the country's police force that they were afraid of having their homes broken into. In his affidavit, Pistorius said he had been the victim of violence and burglaries before, including death threats. The trial has also divided opinion in South Africa. Many of his fans find it difficult to believe a national hero could be capable of the crime he's been charged with. Others find his version of events that night implausible, and point to troubling details that the case has dredged up about Pistorius' past. Since the shooting . Pistorius has shied away from the spotlight since the shooting and his release from jail after a highly publicized hearing. He lives at his uncle Arnold Pistorius' house in Pretoria, and although video surfaced last year of him training, he has not officially returned to the track. Support from his family has been unwavering. ""We have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the state's own case, including its own forensic evidence, strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all,"" Arnold Pistorius said. Steenkamp's family, meanwhile, has tried to focus on Reeva's memory -- not on the media and legal circus unfolding in Pretoria. Her parents are seeking ""closure, and to know that our daughter did not suffer on that tragic Valentine's Day,"" June and Barry Steenkamp said last month. ""It's not about the court case,"" her uncle, Mike Steenkamp, told CNN. ""It's about Reeva, and Reeva can never be part of it."" At the same time, Mike Steenkamp said seeing Pistorius at the trial may bring at least some closure to what has been a harrowing year for the family. ""I would like to be face to face with him and forgive him, forgive him for what he's done. That way I can then probably find more peace."" CNN's Richard A. Greene reported from Pretoria, South Africa, and Nick Thompson reported and wrote from London. CNN's Robyn Curnow, Ashley Fantz and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.","First day of trial ends with defense lawyer hammering at witness testimony .

"(CNN) -- A forensic consultant for the defense of a former Kansas police officer accused of killing his wife testified on Thursday that evidence showing the man had gasoline on his pants could have been contaminated. Brett Seacat is on trial for the first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Vashti. Prosecutors say he shot his wife in April 2011 and set their home on fire, but the defense says Vashti was depressed and committed suicide after torching the house. Pants collected from Brett Seacat the morning of the incident weren't placed in the appropriate bag, according to Gene Gietzen, the forensic consultant. Investigators on the scene placed the pants in a paper bag and transferred them to a plastic bag about an hour later. Gietzen says an unlined paint can or a nylon bag is the appropriate transport method for any evidence that may contain an accelerant -- in this case, gasoline. Paper and plastic bags allow the accelerant to escape and can even let accelerant present in the air cross-contaminate evidence, according to Gietzen. Gietzen showed the court notes written by Chris Riddle, the forensic scientist from the Kansas Bureau of Investigations who worked on the case. Riddle appeared to have concerns about the packaging of the pants, writing, ""Not sealed properly for fire debris analysis!"" Monte Weldon, a neighbor of the Seacats, also testified on Thursday that he was shocked to learn the couple was splitting up. He approached them in their driveway the day before the incident, wanting to know what he could bring to a barbecue that was originally scheduled for the day Vashti died. Before Weldon could even ask the question, he said, Brett Seacat told him the party was off because the couple was divorcing. Weldon said that Seacat didn't seem to be angry or enraged and that he wasn't making any secret of the couple's separation. Weldon also testified that Brett Seacat had plans to fix up the home, so he was surprised to hear that Seacat was being accused of burning it down. Weldon said he sold sand and dirt to Seacat to build a sandbox and to fill in a hole in his yard. Seacat was also planning to change out all of the light switches in the home, Weldon said. ""It was such a beautiful house, you couldn't help but talk to him about it,"" said Weldon. ""He loved the house."" Seacat has said he was sleeping downstairs on the night of the fire, HLN affiliate KWCH reported. He heard a noise, and moments later, his wife called him on his cell phone, saying he should get their two boys out of the house before they got hurt. He then purportedly heard two pops. Brett Seacat went upstairs and saw flames. He reportedly said he found his wife in their bedroom and tried to save her. Prosecutors say Brett Seacat's story doesn't make sense. For one, he had no soot or blood on him, they say, according to KWCH, and only a small burn on his foot. He and the couple's sons escaped from the blaze unharmed. The Seacats' home in Kingman, Kansas, sits not far from the courthouse where Brett Seacat is standing trial. Despite extensive fire damage, the house still stands; a brick chimney pokes out of the charred remains. ""I'm smart enough that if I wanted to kill my wife ... I could've come up with something better than this,"" Seacat told investigators about the shooting and the fire. ""This is what a crazy person does.""","Brett Seacat of Kingman, Kansas, is accused of killing his wife, Vashti, in 2011 .

"Below is a commentary from Glenn Beck, who anchors ""Glenn Beck"" on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET. Glenn Beck says politicians don't have the answers to the housing crisis. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Longtime viewers of my television program know that I've been banging the recession drum for a while now, but the truth is that an economy as large and complex as ours doesn't just collapse overnight. It happens slowly and methodically, with plenty of warning signs along the way. Think about it as a series of waves heading toward the beach, with each one representing a different area of trouble. There's one for slowing consumer spending (American Express said that spending among its affluent clients slowed for the first time since 2001); one for inflation (wholesale and consumer prices recently posted their largest increases in 26 and 17 years, respectively); and one for the continuing credit crunch (Citigroup recently announced its fourth-quarter loss was the largest in its 196-year history). But while those waves are the latest to form, we need to pay more attention to the wave that started it all: housing. In theory, looking closely at the housing market in some parts of the country could help predict what's in store for the rest of us. And if that's true, then buckle up. If you look beyond the headlines, you'll find a couple of unnerving trends. The first began back in the housing collapse that followed the savings and loan crisis of the late '80s and early '90s. People with homes worth less than their mortgages simply stopped paying, put their keys into an envelope, mailed them back to the bank and just walked away. It's called ""jingle mail,"" because when the banks receive the envelopes, all they hear are the jingling keys. But trust me, lenders would much rather have an empty house than a trashed one. Unfortunately, they're starting to get both. Some homeowners, distraught over an imminent foreclosure, are destroying their homes before abandoning them. One Oregon man went so far as to lock three live pigs inside his house last year, making it unlivable, let alone sellable. You can think of it as a ""reverse housewarming gift"" to his bank. Unfortunately, such behavior is leaving banks across the country stuck with empty, trashed homes, along with mortgages that will never be repaid. The result of it all -- the next wave to crash, if you will -- is that many lenders and banks will not be able to survive. We're already seeing the start of that with the fire-sale acquisition of Countrywide, the nation's largest lender, along with the historic loss just posted by the nation's largest bank, Citigroup. So, the question that most people are now asking is: How do we stop things from getting worse? It's obvious: We should just listen to the politicians! After all, combining an impending recession with an impending election means that every candidate is also suddenly an award-winning economist. Unfortunately, these ""economists"" all seem to believe that government intervention is the answer. From tax rebates to rescue funds to extra state aid, it seems that every politician believes that handouts will trigger prosperity. While there are plenty of ludicrous ideas to highlight, one of my favorites was pitched by Hillary Clinton during the recent Democratic debate in Nevada: . ""I want to see money in the pockets of people who are having trouble paying their energy bills. That stimulates the economy. ... And then, if we need additional stimulation, we should look at tax rebates for middle-class and working families, not for the wealthy who have already done very well under George Bush."" Now, I'm not a former first lady, but I am a thinker, so let me ask the obvious question: Exactly how does helping a low-income family stay warm stimulate the economy? Are they going to suddenly run out and buy an exotic vacation where they'll spend their days brainstorming ways to employ hundreds of people? Of course not. But whenever politicians see an opportunity to promote government handouts, they jump at it. If you want to talk about heating assistance for low-income families, fine. I'm actually not a black-hearted monster, I want everyone to have heat. But that's an energy issue, not an economic stimulus one. And instead of tax rebates, which are like economic crack because they result in a temporary high followed by an even lower low, how about we put some lasting trust back into the system by slashing government spending and finally sending the signal to businesses that taxes won't be going through the roof next year? After all, no business owner -- including small-business owners like me -- are going to start expanding if they believe that our tax rates are about to skyrocket. That's why we've got to take away that uncertainty, cut corporate tax rates -- which are the second-highest in the developed world -- and watch as American businesses once again bail us out by creating thousands of jobs that pump billions of tax dollars back into Washington. Or, of course, we could just give heating oil subsidies to the poor. That would probably work just as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

"(CNN) -- He's used to making waves in the pool, but Ryan Lochte has caused a few ripples of excitement on social media after tweeting out a photo of himself in front of what he claims was 10,000 calories worth of food, including piles of chicken and asparagus. It's not clear whether the five-time Olympic gold medalist was about to tuck into the food in one sitting, but eating what amounts to around four times the recommended daily calorie intake for an adult male would not be unusual for someone like Lochte, says a leading sports nutritionist. ""It's quite a lot of food!"" Lewis James, a lecturer in nutrition at the UK's Loughborough University, told CNN. ""I would expect someone like Ryan Lochte to have 10,000 calories in a day but in one meal it sounds like quite a lot."" Lochte, who turns 30 at the beginning of August, isn't the first swimmer to reveal a gargantuan appetite. His former U.S. swimming teammate Michael Phelps once famously claimed to consume 12,000 calories a day, before later saying it was a myth. Swimmers' grueling training schedules, combined with their larger bodies, mean they require many more calories than most other top athletes, James says. ""Generally, if you look at athletes, most of the guys that are larger don't do so much exercise,"" he explains. ""The guys that tend to do a lot of exercise and have a lot of hours of training tend to be smaller. Look at the typical Tour (de France) cyclist -- they are somewhere between 60-75 kilos, most of those guys. ""So they are doing an awful lot of activity but their body weight is a lot lower, so they have less weight to sustain essentially,"" he adds. ""During a day on the Tour de France, you'd perhaps expect total energy expenditure to be between 6,000-7,000 calories for most of the cyclists."" Unlike Tour riders, who can top up their energy reserves with energy bars and fluids en route, swimmers can't do the same, explains James. ""People like Ryan would be training for very long periods at a time, (meaning) they have long periods of their days when they don't get any food in at all."" ""You've got someone who has a higher requirement (for calories) but technically has less hours to consume that requirement because he's in a pool for three to four hours a day."" You are what you eat, so the saying goes, and it seems athletes are only going to be as good as their last meal. ""Everyone should be working hard to make sure they have got the appropriate diet for their sport or their event, making sure they are well fed and have consumed the right nutrients at the right times so that we can really maximize performance,"" James says. ""Messing your diet up or not eating properly in a lot of events can really impair your performance.""

"(CNN) -- The guns of August 1914 unleashed a debate that is still with us: Can the laws of war actually impose limits on how war is carried out? Germany invaded Belgium, violating that nation's neutrality -- which was guaranteed by treaties stretching back to the 19th century. This act horrified the world -- as would the civilian occupation policies that marked German rule in Belgium, Northern France, and elsewhere during the long years of trench warfare. The question of how much international law should be respected during wartime has resurfaced repeatedly through the 20th century -- in America, it has come up frequently since 9/11, especially surrounding the ""torture debate."" Indeed the revelations that American soldiers in Iraq brutalized detainees at Abu Ghraib prison marked a turning point in how Americans regarded the morality of ""our"" war, and on one level this was nothing new: atrocity has repeatedly stunned Americans throughout their history, and they have sometimes mobilized against it. Opinion: How a century-old war affects you . Yet on another level, the years since Abu Ghraib have marked a radical new stage, because of how central law has been to our debates about war: The American government tried to deny that treaties prohibiting torture (from the 1949 Geneva Conventions onward) applied to the global war on terror, but it failed. In fact, over the 20th century, the world took real strides towards the goal of ""humanizing war,"" though perhaps only because the century also made war itself so much worse. But there is another story about World War I and the legal consequences it set off that is less familiar and more disquieting. It is about a legacy we have lost, rather than one we have realized: that of aiming, through the laws of war, to bring war itself to an end. Opinion: Should nations pay the price for their leaders' misdeeds? World War I, as Paul Fussell famously argued, discredited what Wilfred Owen in a classic poem called ""the old lie"": that it is sweet and honorable to die for one's country. But what it has meant to shift allegiances from nation to ""humanity"" has changed drastically over the 20th century among those flirting with wider and cosmopolitan sensibilities. Namely, the highest goal shifted from the abolition to the humanization of war. When World War I ended, the German Kaiser was very nearly criminally tried. It was only his flight to the Netherlands that made him inaccessible to justice. But it was his aggression, rather than his army's atrocity, that mattered most. There is even evidence that after World War I the phrase ""crimes against humanity"" -- which now refers to abuses against civilians -- often meant warmongering itself. Opinion: The mighty women of World War I . In other words, the law would criminalize war, rather than merely make it cleaner. The Nuremberg trials after World War II maintained this focus, attending most to the Nazis' aggressive crimes against peace -- bringing war to the world like the Kaiser had before them -- than atrocities in general or crimes against humanity in particular. By contrast, our post-9/11 debates around the laws of war have rarely centered on the moral validity or legal propriety of war itself . Rather, from the torture revealed at Abu Ghraib, to drones, and now surveillance, the concern of the mainstream of the American public has centered on how far the executive may go in the pursuit of victory. If law matters, it is to keep the war ""humane,"" rather than to keep it from happening in the first place. Opinion: How World War I gave us 'cooties' Many survivors of World War I would have viewed this as a drastic constriction of their aspirations and a failure of their aims. Even if it is justifiable, the narrowing of our concerns must be explained. For Americans, it may have been Vietnam that caused the transformation. That era saw a massive spike in antiwar consciousness, and Americans joined the world in worrying that the country was now forsaking the very legacy of the laws of war it had helped build. But after that generation's Abu Ghraib -- the My Lai massacre, whose revelation in army photographer Ron Haeberle's images was once equally famous -- a consensus slowly built. What people arguing about war could agree on was that it was immoral and illegal to fight it so brutally. The goal of criminalizing aggression lost traction, and focus on atrocity took its place. Opinion: The 'bionic men' of World War I . In the years after Vietnam, more and more people signed on to this view. Barbara Keys shows it was after and in response to Vietnam that Americans joined the international human rights movement, which sponsored a Campaign against Torture, which in turn led to a treaty outlawing the practice, setting up the possibility for our torture debate. Many of the statutes that most constrain the executive in the way it fights, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, were passed in this atmosphere. (Congress also passed laws trying to keep presidents from unilateral military action, especially the War Powers Resolution, but recent history shows it to be a dead letter.) I find the Vietnam-era debate to be an illuminating point of comparison with our time. If we are honest, we will see that atrocities after America's 1965 escalation in Vietnam then dwarfed atrocities now. It hardly makes whatever violations we have committed excusable, of course, to say so. How WWI gave us drones . The other day, President Barack Obama acknowledged that ""the CIA tortured some folks"" after 9/11, but the full documentation has remained a political football and neither Democrats nor Republicans want accountability for crimes. But we should not let our justified outrage over these facts distract from the truth that America's post-9/11 military has fought some of the cleanest wars ever. In particular, compared with the crimes of prisoner detention and aerial targeting in Vietnam (and torture too), America's recent misdeeds have been minor. One big reason is the U.S. military's own response to Vietnam: After decades of benign neglect or outright disregard, it started to treat the laws of war as real constraints on how it fights. Opinion: When chemical weapons killed 90,000 . Consider the decision to target enemies to make sure only combatants rather than civilians are in our crosshairs: Vietnam was more like World War I, with lawyers nowhere to be found, and civilians dying in massive numbers. Today military and other government lawyers play a central role, as the recent controversy over the legal authorization of the drone strike on Anwar al-Awlaki attests. The long trajectory from World War I has produced a paradoxical situation: We now have real, though insufficient, constraints on war's brutality, and more public discourse than ever about it. But we lack much concern about the goal of eliminating war itself. One legacy of the horrified response to modern war remains alive and well, but the other is forgotten. The ""war to end all wars,"" as World War I has long been known, doesn't deserve that name yet.

"(CNN) -- Even the most jaded and cosmopolitan travel writers tend to rave when it comes to canal barging cruises in France. It's no wonder, given the beautiful scenery, gourmet feasts and faultless service. A completely different beast from a river cruise, which can cover several rivers and countries in one sailing with more than 100 passengers, the canal barge cruise is slower, smaller and more expensive ($350-$1,000 per day). World's most extravagant cruise ships . Approximately eight to 12 guests and six English-speaking crew are the usual number of passengers on a French canal barge, which navigates through centuries-old waterways through the French countryside. Stops range from castles and cathedrals to villages and vineyards, where passengers can step off on guided tours. Although canal barge cruises are possible in a number of European countries, these are the reasons why France is by far the most popular destination. 1. The wine . The average varieties of wines offered on board a week-long French barge cruise? More than two dozen -- all French and all selected after judicious testing and tastings by the staff. A variety of canal routes wind through vineyards where passengers can step off and try Sancerre from the Loire Valley, Reislings from the Alsace-Lorraine in the north-east and Bordeaux wines, as well as those from the warm climates of Languedoc-Rousillon and Provence. Some of Burgundy's best vintages can be sampled at the Grand Cru vineyard of Chambertin-Clos de Bèze in the northern part of the Côte de Nuits in Burgundy, Clos de Vougeot, the headquarters of the esteemed Chevaliers du Tastevin and the Château-Hotel André Ziltener. World wine-buying guide . 2. Elaborate cuisine . Several barge cruises offer the option to dine ashore, to eat in the restored Abbaye de la Bussiere in La Bussière-sur-Ouche, for example. What was once a pilgrimage retreat in 1131 is now a Relais & Chateaux hotel and Michelin-starred restaurant. Onboard the barge, thematic regional French fine dining is the standard. The chefs create their inspired from tiny galley quarters. One divine sample menu dreamed up by Selbey, the chef on the European Waterways' L'Impressionniste barge: French onion soup, lamb with minted peas, and poached pear with mascarpone ice cream paired with a white Pernand Vergelles and red Meursault, Ecrevisse salad, Coq au Vin and fresh fruits paired with a white Ladoix and red Moulin -- a vent and escargot, tender scallops and mousse au chocolat paired with Rose Marsannay. A stop at the gastronomic markets in the culinary towns of Dijon and Beaune is also a must. Passengers can shadow barge chefs as they go scouring for rich foie gras, briney crevettes, baguettes with a crunch like no other and hundreds of fresh cheeses. 10 best wine destinations for 2013 . 3. Quaint lock keepers . Many old locks on the waterways are tended by lock keepers, and passing through them on the barge cruise becomes a fun experience in itself. When barges pull up, beefy men race out to turn the wheels, raising the rushing water level high enough to let the barge cruise through. At midday there may be a bit of a wait, as the cruise captains won't even consider disturbing a lock keeper's lunch. 10 best French restaurants in Paris . 4. Interesting history . Dating back to the 16th century, barging had a different meaning from the luxury travel experience that it's become today. The French countryside's elaborate canal system was developed as a means to transport coal and other goods that were difficult to move on land. History buffs will love the fact that their airy, luxurious barges were once working ships carrying cargo along the same winding waterways. 5. Leisurely day excursions . The canals in France are surrounded by historical towns and in addition to vineyard visits, day excursions include stopping by the old towns and meeting the locals. Guided tours of old architecture are some of the top highlights of a barge trip. Recommended: a visit to the Hospice de Beaune in the town of Beaune, which was built in 1443 and is one of the finest examples of French 15th-century architecture. But for those who prefer to just relax instead of embarking on busy historical excursions, it's wonderful to just sit on the deck and watch the scenery pass by, too.

"Washington (CNN) -- A custody battle involving the ""best interests"" of a 3-year-old Cherokee girl will be taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court, an issue spanning the rights of adoptive parents and the desire to preserve Native American families within tribes. The justices announced they will hear an appeal from Matt and Melanie Capobianco, who legally adopted little Veronica in 2009, shortly after the birth mother agreed to give up the child. Oral arguments in the case will likely be heard in April with a ruling by late June. The South Carolina Supreme Court in July ruled for the biological father, who had sought custody shortly after the child's birth. He is a registered member of the Cherokee Nation and is raising the child in Oklahoma. Dusten Brown had earlier signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption, but his attorneys say the father did not understand the extent of the waiver, and that the birth mother misrepresented the child's American Indian heritage to social service workers when the adoption was finalized. At issue is whether Brown, as the onetime non-custodial father, can gain parental custody, after the non-Indian mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe. A special congressional law governs such interstate adoptions, since the current 556 federally recognized tribes all fall under Interior Department oversight, giving those tribes certain unique benefits and rights. Lawyers for the Capobiancos say federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a ""parent."" The adoptive couple was excited that the high court will hear their case. ""We weren't sure what to expect,"" Melanie Capobianco told CNN's Randi Kaye. ""It was a low chance and we just feel really extremely happy that they decided to hear it."" Her husband, Matt, added, ""It restored some hope and a little faith in the judicial system."" The federal law in question is the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978, a response to decades of often abusive social service practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of native youngsters from their families, in many cases to non-Indian homes. Who's a Native American? It's complicated . The legislation was designed to ""promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings."" Brown's relationship within the ""federally recognized government"" of the Cherokee Nation means Veronica -- named in court papers as ""Baby Girl"" -- is a member of the tribe and subject to their jurisdiction. ""It's not anyone's intent ever to rip a child away from a loving home,"" said Todd Hembree, the Tahlequah, Oklahoma-based tribe's attorney general. ""But we want to make sure those loving homes have the opportunity to be Indian homes first."" Still, the Capobiancos argue that the little girl's real home is with them. ""Veronica was always a part of our home from birth and we just felt like she was in a happy place and that those kinds of needs could have been met through us,"" Melanie Capobianco said. ""I just don't think that was what Congress was thinking about when that act was passed."" As with many custody fights, there is wide factual disagreement over the circumstances of both the couple's breakup and subsequent adoption of the child. Opposing sides even disagree on what legal issues the high court should address. The Capobiancos think the issue should be about whether the ICWA law can improperly block adoption proceedings voluntarily initiated by a non-Indian mother who had sole custody of her child, due to what the adoptive parents say is the Indian father's failure to establish a legal parent-child relationship under state law. But Brown argues he successfully established paternity under state law, and qualifies as a ""parent"" under the ICWA, thereby giving him proper control and custody of his daughter. Opinion: Should race be a factor in adoption? He said in legal papers that the child was conceived when the couple was engaged, and ""excited"" he would be a father. But Brown claims the biological mother broke off the now-strained relationship by text message. He agreed to relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support, but said the mother never indicated she intended unilaterally to give the child up for adoption. And Brown claims the biological mother tried to ""conceal"" his Indian heritage during the adoption process with the Capobiancos, who live in Charleston, South Carolina. Establishing such heritage would normally make it very difficult for the Cherokee Nation and state social services to agree to any non-Indian adoption and removal from the state. By this time, Brown was deployed to Iraq on a one-year deployment in the U.S. Army, making it hard to press his custody claims. Veronica lived with the Capobiancos for two years before the high court in South Carolina ruled for the father. Brown took his daughter back to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, on New Year's Eve 2011. The state's top court that ruled in his favor said Brown had ""a deeply embedded relationship"" with his American Indian heritage, in which Veronica will be raised. But the Capobiancos point to another part of the state court's conclusion: that despite a ruling against them, they were ""ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment."" That court said its hands were tied, and that federal law trumped state law. ""Courts in seven states have held that ICWA does not bar courts from terminating the parental rights of a non-custodial father under state law when the father abandoned his child to the sole custody of a non-Indian mother,"" said Lisa Blatt, attorney for the couple. She says the father's initial agreement to give up his parental rights meant he forfeited any subsequent efforts to establish custody, when the child was already in a happy, stable home environment. The Capobiancos argue Brown had refused to offer any financial assistance to the biological mother until they were married and ""wanted nothing to do"" with the pregnancy. As a single mother with two other young children, the biological mother felt she had no choice but to give her daughter up for adoption, said a legal brief filed by her lawyers. They say she complied with the adoption laws in both states and with the tribe. The couple also says they long wanted to be parents and had seven unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilization. She is a child developmental psychologist and he is an automotive body technician. They were in the room when Veronica was born, and had an ""open"" adoption, meaning the biological mother could and did maintain a relationship with Veronica. The case is Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, a Minor Child Under the Age of Fourteen Years (12-399).","NEW: S.C. couple says it is happy that the high court will hear their appeal .

"(CNN) -- A relaxing day at Southern California's famed Venice Beach took a deadly turn Sunday afternoon when a powerful lightning bolt struck the water, killing one person and injuring at least 13, emergency officials said. The sudden lightning strike at Venice Beach caused panic as people tried to get out of the water and off the beach. The Los Angeles County coroner's office confirmed one man in his 20s died at a local hospital after he was rescued from the beach. But it's too soon to say whether he died from ""a lightning strike, drowning or being trampled by the crowd,"" according to John Kades with the coroner's office. ""The day started out clear, but there were storms in the forecast for the region on Sunday,"" CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said of the isolated thunderstorms that swept through the Los Angeles area. The lightning hit the water and the beach at 2:51 p.m. PT (5:51 p.m. ET), according to spokeswoman Katherine Main of the Los Angeles Fire Department. Emergency responders assessed the condition of at least 13 victims -- all of whom were either in or near the water -- at the scene. Of those, seven adults and one teenager were transported to local hospitals. One was listed in serious conditions and six were listed in fair condition by late Sunday afternoon . The National Weather Service in Los Angeles tweeted around the time of the strike that ""cloud to ground lightning"" had been reported in nearby Marina del Rey and at the Los Angeles International Airport. Witnesses tweeted they saw a huge bolt of lightning strike the area, with one Twitter user describing an explosion that blew off nearby roof tiles. Lightning also struck Catalina Island on Sunday. Los Angeles County Sheriff Sgt. Robert Berardi said a man was hit by a lightning strike near a golf course. He was taken to a local hospital, treated and later released. Lightning fatalities are pretty rare in California. Between 1959 and 2012, 31 people died after they were struck by lightning, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In comparison, there were 468 deaths from lightning strikes in Florida during the same time period, followed by 215 in Texas. The National Weather Service has compiled a list of lightning safety tips on its website. There is no safe place outside during a thunderstorm or when lightning strikes, the agency said. To reduce the risk of injury or even death during severe weather, people planning outdoor activities of any kind should have a safety plan. At the first clap of thunder, the weather service said anybody outdoors should run for shelter or for their vehicles and they should remain sheltered for at least 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder is heard. When visiting the beach, where there is limited shelter available for taking cover during a thunderstorm, the weather service advises people to run for their cars at the first sign of thunder or lightning in the distance. The agency also warns against taking cover under the beach picnic shelters. It says water, wet items, like ropes and metal objects, including fences and poles, are big dangers during lightning storms because water and metal are both great conductors of electrical currents. The weather service also offers these tips for minimizing the risk of getting struck by lightning: Avoid open fields and hilltops, stay away from tall, isolated trees or other tall objects, set up camps in lower lying areas and remember tents do not offer protection from lightning. There is also professional lightning detection equipment available that issues alerts when lightning is approaching an area. The weather service said it's a good investment for outdoors sports groups or other outside events. Lightning strikes in Colorado park kill 2 people in 2 days .

"(CNN) -- A makeup artist, writer and model who loves monkeys and struggles with demons. That's how Alix Catherine Tichelman, 26, describes herself on various social media sites. A Facebook profile shows modeling shots of Tichelman in varying states of undress and examples of her poetry. It gives a glimpse into the life of the woman, an alleged prostitute who is accused in the death of a Google executive. Tichelman appeared in court Wednesday in Santa Cruz, California, where she faces a series of charges in the death of Forrest Timothy Hayes, 51. The married father of five was found dead in November on his 50-foot yacht. Authorities say Tichelman gave him an injection of heroin and then, as he began to die, she sipped her wine, gathered her belongings and walked away. She has not entered a plea. Not much is known about Tichelman, but her presence on social media offers some clues. For example, she went to high school in Duluth, just north of Atlanta, and studied journalism at Georgia State University. Another one of her Facebook profiles says she worked at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club and as an exotic dancer in San Francisco. ""life is great. i am seriously blessed as a motherf*****. a great boyfriend, nice house, monkeys, loving family...doesn't get any better than this i don't think,"" Tichelman posted in January 2013. She strikes a more somber note in her poetry, which is posted to one of her Facebook profiles. Tichelman talked about drugs in one piece, dated November 2012, entitled ""heroin."" It reads: . ""this private downward spiral-this suffocating blackhole . makes you feel so warm inside, . yet makes your heart so cold. each day takes it's toll, . your thoughts become emotionless, . your soul feels too old. the demons whispers to me ever so lightly, . he never let's go of his hold, . taking everything from me, . I'll end up dying alone."" 'My beloved Dean!' On Facebook and Twitter, Tichelman posted photographs and messages about a former boyfriend, Dean Riopelle, a club owner in Atlanta. Riopelle died at his home in Milton, Georgia, just two months before Hayes, the Google executive. The medical examiner ruled Riopelle's death an accidental overdose from heroin and alcohol. ""At the time, we never thought anything different,"" Capt. Shawn McCarty of Milton police told CNN on Thursday. Now authorities are taking a new look at that death ""to make sure there's nothing (else) to it,"" he said. Tichelman also was arrested last year in Atlanta and charged with battery and false report of a crime. The details of that incident were unclear. ""I don't have to forgive, but that doesn't mean I can't let it go. Knowing that my life is better than theirs, i have an amazing boyfriend who takes care of me, and a sound and clear conscience when I go to sleep at night. Priceless,"" Tichelman wrote on Facebook in June 2012. The same month, she posted a smiling photograph of her and Riopelle, as well as a photograph of a ring. ""thank you to my beloved Dean! ** black & white diamond promise ring ** always and forever,"" she wrote in a post to accompany the image. Monkeys and Marilyn Manson . Her boyfriend wasn't the only thing Tichelman loved. On Facebook and Twitter, she talked about her love for the TV show ""Dexter,"" her mom, Marilyn Manson and monkeys. Several photographs show her cuddling and playing with the tiny creatures. ""Dexter is so frealin' (sic) good! Can't believe I haven't watched it earlier. #lovableserialkiller,"" Tichelman tweeted in November 2012. Many of her posts are fun and light-hearted. She wrote about working on a novel, modeling projects, setting up a makeup tutorial and her preference for steak and potatoes over turkey and stuffing for Thanksgiving. In the tutorial, posted to YouTube, Tichelman stares straight at the camera as she applies eye makeup. She wears lingerie, which shows off tattoos across her chest and arms. Candles, flowers and stuffed animals can be seen in the background. ""I will be thin and pure like a glass cup. Empty. Pure as light. Music. I move my hands over my body - my shoulders, my collarbone, my rib cage, my hip bones like part of an animal skull, my small thighs. In the mirror my face is pale and my eyes look bruised. ""My hair is pale and thin and the light comes through. I could be a lot younger than twenty four. I could be a child still, untouched,"" Tichelman wrote on Facebook in April 2012, quoting, with a slight tweak, ""The Hanged Man,"" a book by Francesca Lia Block. In other posts, she sounds angry and unforgiving, as she does in this note, posted to Facebook in May 2012. It reads, in part: . ""Sick of the lies and all the pain you have given me, . Wrapped up in a bow like I thought it was supposed to be . But now you're laying in a box, waiting to suffocate, . Saving your last breath as you scratch at your coffin case. I know I'm crazy, but vengeance is mine, . The dirt that pours in your mouth into your eyes, . Never thought I would see you so surprised . Cause im watching up above as you choke on the dirt .

"(CNN) -- There's a famous scene in the movie ""Titanic"" where Rose turns to Jack and says, ""I want you to draw me like one of your French girls."" Then she poses for him naked, and things start looking up for ol' Jack. Of course, later, the ship sinks and he dies a cold, suffering death in the middle of the North Atlantic. Still, it was totally worth it. At the end, most people think Jack's final words to Rose were, ""Never let go."" But I'm pretty sure I heard him say, ""Huh, huh. Boobs."" Almost 20 years later, that stupid ""French girls"" line has become a bit of a catchphrase, and if you Google it you'll find countless images of people unintentionally, yet seductively, sprawled out like Kate Winslet. And some sprawled animals, too. ""Huh huh. Cat boobs."" Taking it a step further, now there's even a portrait-sketching mobile app called French Girls that has also clearly borrowed from ""Titanic."" And everyone's talking about it. French Girls co-founder, 29-year-old Adam Ceresko, told me, ""The day-over-day growth in just the past few days has been astonishing, and it's not slowing down."" His creation just passed one million downloads. The app actually came out in mid-2013. But then, last week, it had a massive uptick in popularity when, for several hours, a collection of French Girls images somehow managed to climb to the very top of the front page of Reddit. It's an honorable feat for which, generally speaking, there's no apparent rhyme or reason. (For instance, as I write this, the current most popular post on Reddit is a video of a girl dangerously falling off a diving board. It looks painful and unfortunate, but this is why we have the Internet, and somehow it makes my life more complete.) Now, the basic idea of French Girls is that users anonymously post selfies and then other users draw them from within the app. It's fun. And it's surprisingly creative. But mostly, it's easy. The app's slogan simply reads: Take selfies. Get drawings. Maybe. When I first learned of French Girls and downloaded it, I immediately served up a selfie and eagerly awaited someone turning me into art. Perhaps a tasteful nude. But, so far, nobody has shown any interest in drawing my portrait. Bastards. So, I added another selfie - one where it looks like I'm grasping at the air -- and somebody actually did turn me into a nude. However, it's far from tasteful. The ""artist"" extended my body into the next frame, naked, where I appear to be violating myself. This is why we can't have nice things. And it's obvious that he put literally seconds into his effort. (Yes, despite the app's anonymity, I assure you it was definitely a HE. Because of course it was.) Alas, not everything turns out a masterpiece in French Girls. But, hey, at least he chose ME! Because here's how the app works: When you want to start drawing, you are given a choice of nine different images. If nothing inspires you, the refresh button gives you nine more. And you can keep searching until you find someone (or someone's dog) that does tickle your artistic fancy. For me it was a girl with blue hair and a nose ring. So, I drew her. And it was terrible. My only real talent is napping. That, and mouth breathing. You can read all about it on my eHarmony profile. Anyway, despite a severe lack of artistic ability, drawing my blue girl was a creative way to kill some time when I could've dangerously been interacting with other actual humans. Which, for safety, I prefer to avoid. Because next thing you know a friend invites you to get outside and go to the pool. And then you find yourself on a diving board.

"Washington (CNN) -- The scene is intense: A man is ferociously knocking on a door while a woman inside the house calls 911, saying that her ex is trying to break in. A child sits on the couch. The man bursts in and grabs the child, and the woman yells not to take the toddler. The man pulls out a gun. A shot rings out, and the screen goes black. A child cries out. The violent domestic scenario is only a television ad from a gun control group, but it attempts to portray what some women face. It also depicts the next front in the gun control debate. The ad, by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's group Everytown for Gun Safety, is airing in the District of Columbia and three states. It targets three Republican senators: Dean Heller of Nevada, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, lawmakers who have shown a willingness to back some sort of gun control or whose communities have faced a tragic mass shooting. The focus on women and domestic violence comes after gun-control advocates gained little traction on efforts to tighten restrictions on gun ownership. Public opinion on the issue is divided. A CNN poll from December found that 50% of people are opposed to tighter gun-control laws, but 49% support them. After the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 elementary school students and six staff members were killed, public opinion tipped to the side of gun control. But under pressure from the National Rifle Association, Congress did not pass reforms that would have strengthened background checks for gun purchases. The new advertisement was released Tuesday and is part of a campaign to link the potentially deadly combination of guns and domestic abuse. The NRA, which opposes most efforts to restrict gun ownership, did not respond to a request for comment on the new campaign. The Senate Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on the issue Wednesday and heard from Elvin Daniel, an NRA member and gun owner whose sister was killed by a domestic abuser. ""It has been nearly two years since Zina was murdered and it is heartbreaking to know that our weak gun laws continue to allow dangerous abusers to buy guns without background checks,"" he said, choking back tears. Gabrielle Giffords, a former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head during a mass shooting, did not speak at the hearing, but she wrote an opinion piece on the issue for CNN. ""We urgently need stronger gun laws that protect women,"" she wrote. ""We can't wait any longer. Women's lives are at stake."" Giffords also announced the Protect all Women Leadership Network, which brings together leading women working in both policy and advocacy to push for reforms at the state and federal level to protect women from gun-toting abusers. Kids and gun safety . Advocates point to statistics that show that 46 women are shot and killed by a current or former domestic partner each month and that more than half of women murdered are killed by their current or former partners. Giffords wrote that more women were shot to death by an intimate partner between 2001 and 2012 than the number of soldiers killed in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Advocates also point to a recent incident in Texas in which police accused a man with a history of domestic violence of shooting and killing many of his estranged wife's family members during a violent rampage. ""This is an area where we can really make progress and keep guns out of dangerous hands,"" said Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety. They have gotten behind a bill by Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota that would expand gun restrictions for abusive dating partners. It currently applies only to married partners. The proposal would restrict guns from people who have been issued restraining orders. George Mason University law professor Joyce Lee Malcolm told the hearing that ""taking these guns without due process violates that fundamental right."" In a statement, Ayotte pointed to her co-sponsorship of the Violence Against Women Act, which passed in the Senate last year, but did not indicate whether she'd back Klobuchar's bill. CNN's Kevin Bohn and Sean Kennedy contributed to this report.","Advocates are pushing for gun control legislation through the issue of domestic violence .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Human Rights Council said Monday that it will send a special mission to Iraq to investigate human rights abuses and war crimes allegedly committed by ISIS. Iraqis have faced violence and unrest for more than a decade, but the situation has gotten worse in recent months as fighters for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, seized sections of the country, said Flavia Pansieri, the U.N. deputy high commissioner for human rights. ""The effect of the ongoing conflict on the children of Iraq has been catastrophic,"" Pansieri said during an emergency session in Geneva, Switzerland. ""Many have become direct victims of the conflict, while others have been subjected to physical and sexual abuse, whose scars may remain with them throughout their lives."" Mosques, shrines and other religious sites have been destroyed, and members of different ethnic and religious groups have been persecuted, she said. ""The international community must intensify its efforts to protect all Iraqis, including ethnic and religious communities and those who are particularly vulnerable,"" Pansieri said. In new violence Monday evening, at least 13 people were killed and 45 others were wounded in a double car bombing in Baghdad, police told CNN. The car bombs that struck in quick succession targeted two commercial streets in al-Bayaa district, a predominantly Shiite area in southwestern Baghdad. At least 1,420 Iraqis were killed and another 1,370 wounded in ""acts of terrorism and violence"" in August, the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said Monday, with most of those casualties civilians. The figures do not include Anbar province due to lack of ability to verify casualties since ISIS took over Falluja and other towns in January. Meanwhile, U.S. Central Command reported U.S. forces conducted three airstrikes Sunday and Monday in Iraq near a key dam near Mosul.

"(CNN) -- Two Israeli bands, one Jewish and one Arab, are joining together in ""metal brotherhood"" to spread a message of peace through rock 'n roll. Arab group Khalas (Arabic for ""Enough"") and Jewish band Orphaned Land are heading out on an 18-day European tour that they hope will foster tolerance between the two sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict. ""We want to share the stage together, we want to show co-existence,"" said Kobi Farhi, Orphaned Land's vocalist. The bands will also share a tour bus for three weeks. What more perfect example of co-existence, asks Farhi. ""We will snore at each other, we will do laundry together, we will make coffee for each other,"" he said. Among those on the tour bus will be Abed Hathout, Khalas' guitarist and band manager. ""If we can do this co-existence on a bus, why can't we do it all over this country,"" he said. One in five Israelis is of Arab descent, according to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics. Sometimes called Israeli-Arabs, many consider themselves Palestinians. Apart from handful of cities that the government designates ""mixed,"" where a minority of Arabs lives alongside a majority of Jews, the two groups live in separate communities. Read more: The mystery of the Egyptian sphinx in Israel . Farhi admits that music might not be able to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict, but he argues that ""you can always show a way for people to take inspiration."" The bands have already played two gigs together in Tel Aviv. Hathout says that Khalas' favorite place to perform is Ramallah in the West Bank but that the ""good energy"" at these two gigs was ""amazing."" This is not the first time music has been used to cross the divide between Israelis and Arabs. In 1999, conductor Daniel Barenboim and the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said founded The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra. Based in the Spanish city of Seville, the orchestra is composed of an equal number of Israeli and Arab musicians, together with a group of Spanish musicians. The orchestra has performed all over the world, working on the philosophy that music can break down barriers and encourage people to listen to each other. Some Palestinians have criticized the orchestra for promoting ""normalization,"" which masks the realities of their situation. Last year an East Jerusalem concert was cancelled after complaints from Palestinians. Read more: New city offers vision of better life in West Bank . Farhi recounts a similar incident when Orphaned Land played with a Tunisian band on their last tour. The Tunisian band's manager received emails asking them to boycott the tour. ""If you want to interpret (touring with an Israeli band) as legitimizing, that's your interpretation ... we simply have a message that we love each other and we want to live together."" Khalas and Orphaned Land's tour was sparked by Farhi and Hathout's friendship. ""You might say (going on tour together) is a PR cliche or a gimmick... but it's simply a translation of me and Abed's brotherhood,"" said Farhi. The pair met almost a decade ago at a radio station and bonded over their mutual love of heavy metal with a Middle Eastern twist. Both bands blend classic heavy metal elements with Arabic rhythms and instruments like violins and flutes. They call it Oriental Metal. ""We take the rock 'n roll of the West, put it through our Middle Eastern filters, and throw it back,"" said Hathout. Orphaned Land's lyrics are often political, observing the Middle East's governments and religion. Khalas' latest album features metal covers of '80s Arab wedding songs. ""Khalas doesn't deal with politics ... it's not because we are not connected to our people or we don't care, but there are so many people talking about the occupation. ""I have the right to write about having fun and love and drinking beer."" In spite of the complexities, Ben Brinner author of ""Playing across a Divide: Israeli-Palestinian Musical Encounters"" and a professor of music at University of California, Berkeley, says something very interesting can happen when musicians from both sides come together. ""They create different kinds of musical styles; it's giving a vision of a rich kind of working together (that in) the best cases creates something new, something that they couldn't create on their own, that can speak to the hearts of diverse audiences."" For Farhi, it's straightforward enough: ""The only conflict we have is who is going to pay the bill.""","Two Israeli bands -- one Jewish the other Arab -- touring Europe together .

"(CNN) -- ""My mama always said you've got to put the past behind you before you can move on."" Wiser words were never spoken, Mr. Gump. But this summer, we've been ignoring Mama Gump's sage advice and looking back at summers past in search of a little nostalgic kick. First, we revisited the ""Freedom summer"" of '64, then the ""Me"" summer of '74 and finally the totally tubular summer of '84. Now, as the end of the season draws near, let's revisit some of the most notable moments from 20 years ago, the summer of 1994. Inspirational movies reigned supreme, electro-pop and boy bands ruled the radio, and the ""crime of the century"" was the talk of the country. Here's more on the summer that was: . Blockbusters and summer 1994 were like peas and carrots . ""The Lion King"" taught moviegoers young and old about the circle of life via the coming-of-age adventure of a young lion cub named Simba. With a little musical help from his friends, a warthog, a meerkat and Elton John, the movie became a roaring multiplatform success: After its June 15 release, the animated musical earned multiple Golden Globe, Oscar and Grammy nominations and was the highest-grossing film worldwide that year. Meanwhile, the domestic box office was dominated by a simple man. His name? Forrest, Forrest Gump. That summer, we also met ""The Flintstones"" in a live-action film that was received poorly by critics but ran the box office for several weekends after its May 27 release date. Thirty-two writers famously worked on the script, but one key line still remained: yabba-dabba-doo! ""The Mask"" was another sssssmokin' late-summer hit: The slapstick comedy starring Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz made more than $23 million on its opening weekend of July 29. And no summer movie season is complete without an action film -- or three: ""True Lies,"" ""Speed"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" all screeched onto the big screen in the summer of '94. Soulful and Swedish tunes . Swedish pop group Ace of Base showed no signs of stopping with two hits that summer: ""The Sign"" and ""Don't Turn Around."" Listeners swore by the soulful harmonies of All-4-One's ""I Swear,"" which dominated the Billboard Hot 100 charts for 11 straight weeks. During the week of August 6, the top spot went to ""Stay (I Missed You)"" by the bespectacled Lisa Loeb after the song's appearance in the post-grad film ""Reality Bites."" Loeb was usurped after three weeks by another all-male vocal group, Boyz II Men, and their single ""I'll Make Love to You."" Meanwhile, MTV viewers were going ""Crazy"" for Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler, who played two schoolgirls cutting class in Aerosmith's music video. Baseball players cry foul, and World Cup fever . Hockey's New York Rangers ended their 54-year wait for the Stanley Cup with a defeat of the Vancouver Canucks in game seven of the finals on June 14, 1994. Three days later, on June 17, legendary golfer Arnold Palmer made his final appearance in the U.S. Open. World Cup fever was at an all-time high in a notoriously soccer-averse nation: Not only did the United States play host nation with a cumulative attendance of 3,587,538, but the home team advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1930 with the help of popular players like Alexi Lalas and Tony Meola. As soccer fever cooled, Major League Baseball frustrations heated up. Players went on strike August 12 over a proposed salary cap. They would strike for 232 days; it was the first year without a World Series since 1904. Summer of scandals -- and O.J. Speaking of the World Cup, Argentine player Diego Maradona was sent home early after he tested positive for the drug ephedrine. This was not the first time Maradona faced drug trouble: The famed soccer player was suspended for 15 months by FIFA in 1991 over alleged cocaine use. In a more tragic turn of events, Colombian player Andres Escobar was gunned down in the streets on July 2 after accidentally scoring a goal for the United States and ultimately eliminating his nation's team. Cartel bodyguard Humberto Castro Munoz confessed to the murder, but it is widely speculated that he did not act alone and was employed by a cartel that lost significant money betting on Colombia. In England, the tabloids were aflutter after the Prince of Wales admitted in a televised documentary to committing adultery with Camilla Parker Bowles. The documentary was supposed to paint Charles in a sympathetic light after his very public separation from Princess Diana after 11 years of marriage. And then, of course, there's O.J. Simpson. On June 17, 1994, the Heisman trophy winner and NFL Hall of Famer led police on a low-speed chase on Los Angeles freeways after the killings of his ex-wife Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The now-legendary white Ford Bronco has been burned into the brains of the collective American audience, as the events unfolded on live television before 95 million viewers. Simpson would be charged and found not guilty of murder. And that's all we have to say about that.","Twenty years ago, the United States played host to soccer's World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Standing on the podium at London 2012, Joanna Rowsell achieved her greatest dream -- and gave hope to millions around the world who suffer from a condition that can have devastating effects on self-confidence. Together with teammates Laura Trott and Dani King, Rowsell pedaled to glory in the women's team pursuit at the Olympic velodrome, smashing the world record three times along the way in the qualifiers, semis and final.

""I think it's good to show people if you have a condition like this you don't need to hide away and not follow your dreams. You can still do whatever you want to."" Rowsell has endured alopecia areata (a condition that causes partial or total hair loss) for most of her life and sports a wig when she's not on the track. ""For as long as I can remember I've always had small bald patches but I was able to cover them up with the rest of my hair,"" she explains. ""But when I was 10 I got more and more patches, more and more kept falling out until it had all completely gone. ""I'd had nice long hair. I used to love doing plaits and hair braids and I didn't understand why it was happening. Obviously, I was quite upset."" Doctors think alopecia is an autoimmune disease which causes the body to attack the hair follicles. Genes may also play a role in the onset of the condition, which affects around 2% of the general population. While the underlying causes remain a mystery, the psychological toll is well known. Many sufferers experience bouts of depression, anxiety and social phobias. ""As a teenage girl it was difficult because everyone cares about their looks. It was difficult. I can't deny that it wasn't,"" Rowsell admits. ""But I was always quite determined to prove myself. I never wanted to shy away and say, 'Oh well, I'm just going to stay indoors and never go out.' I always thought I want to make the most of things, so I think it's probably helped me."" It was an attitude that served her well when talent scouts from British Cycling turned up at her secondary school in Cheam, Surrey. The village, located a few miles southwest of London, is better known for its commuters than its pedalers. But Rowsell changed all that. ""I wasn't into cycling at all. It was just purely by chance they came to the school and I was like, 'That sounds like a fun way to spend an afternoon. I'll have a go.' "" She won her race and was invited back for more testing, which revealed the 15-year-old possessed a good power-to-weight ratio for her age. From there it was on to a talent development squad before starting racing in 2005, when she quickly made her mark by winning the 2 km Pursuit at the Junior British National Track Championships. While Rowsell races professionally on the road and in time trials, it is on the track in both team pursuit and latterly individual pursuit races that she has risen to the very top of the sport. ""Individual pursuit is quite simple. It's a 12-lap race -- which is 3 km -- and there's somebody on the opposite side of the track who you are chasing,"" she explains. The winner is the rider who catches the other rider or, as is more frequent, the one who sets the fastest time. Team pursuit, meanwhile, is run over 4 km with four riders (previously three) on each team. ""The idea is to cover the 4 km as quickly as you can,"" Rowsell says. ""The best way to do this is to take it in turns at the front -- you save so much energy when you are behind on the wheel."" Things haven't go too badly for Rowsell since joining the senior ranks. At the 2008 world championships in Manchester (which is also her training base), she won a gold medal in the women's team pursuit alongside Rebecca Romero and Wendy Houvenaghel. She's repeated the feat three times since, most recently at this year's world championships in Colombia in February. Cali's VelÃ³dromo Alcides Nieto PatiÃ±o was also the scene of Rowsell's first gold medal in the individual pursuit, where she beat defending champion Sarah Hammer of the U.S. in the final in a personal best time. Rowsell will be going for more individual pursuit glory at the Commonwealth Games in Scotland later this month. She will be the hot favorite when she lines up at Glasgow's Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome -- named after the six-time Olympic champion cyclist and the man who helped foster Rowsell's interest in the sport when she watched him race on TV at the 2004 Athens Games. Now it is the 25-year-old Rowsell who is inspiring the next generation with her feats of bravery on and off the track. ""I never set out to be a role model but a lot of people have told me I am, which is always nice to hear,"" she says. ""As a cyclist you are out there to win your race, but when people say that sort of thing I do feel a bit of responsibility to act in a certain way and be a good role model to younger girls."" But the biggest reward, perhaps, is the gift that cycling has given back to her. ""I'm definitely a lot more accepting of (alopecia) now and it's not something I think about every day to be honest. I am thinking about winning the Olympics or winning the Commonwealth Games or the World Championships. ""At the end of the day, I can't change it, I can only get on with what I've got so I may as well carry on.""

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- Late one night, after dark, we met up with Don Brewster -- head of Agape International Missions, an NGO fighting child prostitution -- to go behind the scenes at Cambodia's KTVs: karaoke clubs that are fronts for brothels. I threw on some jeans and tried to look like a tourist who was up for a kinky kind of tour, with my ersatz ""boyfriend""-- our cameraman, Scott. Don drove us first to an out of the way small side street, where there were tiny KTVs operating out in the open like cheap brothels. Girls sat on plastic chairs lining the entrance, all painted up and wearing short skirts, high heels and fake smiles. We walked past a few, stopping to talk for a little while. The girls would stand up, becoming energized and engaged. We crossed the street and approached another one, as if we were sampling the wares at each one. We walk into a KTV; Scott and Don lead the way into the karaoke rooms. I become less nervous as we walk to the back where an overweight young woman frantically sweeps the kitchen floor, and we are pointed up some cement and metal stairs. We pass hallways full of closed doors, in which I can only imagine the sex acts occur. We are brought into a low ceilinged, dank room with some disgusting couches and a video screen on one wall. I am overwhelmed with the saturated smell of air freshener that apparently has gone off like an insect fogger in this room -- to cover what odor, who knows. I nearly gag and we beat a quick path out of there. We hop back into the car and head off. Next stop: a famous 5-storied fortress of a KTV with armed guards outside. Don says if we take the elevator up from the basement, we can skip the bar and go straight to the ""massage"" floor. On the fifth floor we are immediately led to a giant windowed ""fishbowl"" where at least 20 girls sit on bleacher to be observed and picked. Scott walks in front of the pane; they respond to his macho energy, rising and preening. I have my iPhone in hand and itching to take a picture when suddenly things go horribly sideways: A white-clad girl in the bowl suddenly jumps up and starts screaming ""She take a picture!!"" She runs into the lobby and a grim-faced Mama-san bustles up to us. The girl crowds us and accuses me; more people start to gather. My friends advise me to erase the picture -- but I haven't taken any! I try and stand my ground and keep saying, ""I didn't take a picture."" But I am becoming very nervous and the situation is getting ugly. We hustle back onto the elevator. We were lucky to get out of there without running into the security guys, because there could have been real trouble. But their behavior absolutely cemented the fact that something illegal, beyond legal-aged prostitution is going on there. They were acting like they had far too much to lose. We head to another KTV, this one still upscale but less fortress-like than the last. Paintings of the cosmos line the ceiling in the lobby. We were ushered in and led us upstairs to karaoke room where hostesses in satin, beaded formal dresses greet us. The large and comfortable room had a giant screen on one wall and couches lining the other three walls. Colored lights pulse and change on the walls. An older woman walked in five girls dressed in fairly classy though sexy business suits, for us to take our pick of whom we would like to stay with us. Scott, fully playing the part, roars out in his New Zealand accent, ""You have anything younger, fresher?!"" The girls scurry out in a hurry. Then more girls enter. These definitely seem younger. They are also more provocatively dressed; they are wearing very short little black dresses. Don picks one, and so does Scott and the two join us; the karaoke starts in earnest. I must sing with gusto to justify my presence, otherwise what is this white lady doing here? We sit there and begin to get their life stories. The young girl sitting next to me, the one Scott chose, is extremely pretty. It is impossible to tell how old she is -- she claims to be 21, I would believe it if she was 14. She says she doesn't come from Phnom Penh, and she is working here because her family is very poor and needs the money. Her family doesn't know what kind of work she is doing, she said. If they find out, they will be angry with her. She has a very pretty smile, but there are moments when I watch her where the smile disappears, and she looks very sad. She chooses to sing a song from the Karaoke catalog, a popular dance hit in Khmer, which has a video of a singer performing in front of what looks to be an American style high school dance, again like a prom. I am told the song is called ""Only One Virginity"" (!) and it talks about how a girl is like a flower, and only has the one time where she has most value. Our young acquaintance sings her heart out, very intently performing if not always tunefully. Afterwards she tells me that she very specifically picked this one out, and that she wishes that she will meet a man that will go to her parents and ask for her hand, respect her. I try to get her to talk about what men expect from her here, but it doesn't go very far. I see that Don has been very busy with the girl he invited to stay, showing her a video on his iPhone in which a girl from his center talks about how she was able to leave a KTV and now has a job that she is excited about and is much happier. She was very intrigued by the video and she gave him her cellphone number so the girl from the video could call her and follow up. I passed his iPhone to our young companion. Thankfully, the hostesses did not seem to mind or care that we were doing this; the whole room was on security cameras poised in the corners but no one came in and stopped us. She watched and listened to the video very intently. Afterwards she said she liked it. ""I know it is hard to trust us, strangers,"" I told her. ""But I am a mom (and I showed her pictures of my four happy children and me hugging my two daughters) and I wouldn't want my kids in a situation like this."" She didn't give her number, but we told her it was okay, Don's outreach person would call her friend and we gave her Don's card. I impressed on her that this was opportunity knocking on her door, and she should answer it: this was her chance for a happier life. We hugged goodbye, and went back to the cars. I had no idea that I was going to be involved in trying to recruit girls to leave the KTV life and receive the services of Don's NGO. What a night.","Mira Sorvino takes a behind the scenes look at Cambodia's child sex trade .

"(CNN) -- Throughout high school, Tevante Clark felt ashamed about being overweight. It wasn't just his hefty size that depressed him, but the distance he felt growing between him and some of his closest friends. Over four years, he watched as his friends steadily left him out of conversations, gave him the cold shoulder at school, and then started excluding him altogether from their Friday night outings around Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He was crushed, spending many evenings alone, feeling rejected. Standing at 5 feet 7 inches, Clark hit his peak weight at 405 pounds when he was 19. ""I would go home and ask my mom why this was happening to me, but I knew it was because of my weight,"" he said. ""When I would go out with my mom to pick up groceries or shopping, I would wait in the car because I was so embarrassed."" When he started Vance-Granville Community College, he continued to struggle with those feelings. ""I was having suicidal thoughts because of my weight. I even wrote a letter about it that my mom found, and she broke down crying,"" he said. ""I was tired of everything, tired of people laughing at me, tired of being overweight, tired of being treated differently,"" he said. ""I thought about committing suicide, but I didn't want to leave my mother by herself."" After discovering the letter in his bedroom, his mom said she knew something had to change. ""I saw how depressed he was getting, and that's what hurt me the most,"" said his mother, Beverly Clark. But she was not going to let him struggle on his own. She had recently lost more than 100 pounds after a scare from her cardiologist who said she was on the verge of having a heart attack because of her weight. That experience made her believe her son could lose the weight, too. ""He was a junk-aholic, as I was. He had a sweet tooth. He was a snacker -- cakes, cookies, soda, chips,"" she said. She was convinced that all her son needed was some guidance about moderation. But Tevante Clark just wanted the weight off. He came to her after many tearful nights and asked if he could get gastric bypass surgery. Clark was desperate. ""I needed a change,"" he said. As an employee at Duke University's call center, his mother knew about the school's wellness program Live for Life, which offers a 12-month weight-loss program for employees and their family members. She wanted her son to lose weight, but she also wanted him to try natural methods before committing to surgery. So she made him a proposition: Enroll in the program and try to lose weight naturally for the first few months. If that method failed, they would consider surgery. When he started in the program in July 2011, his goal was to lose 40 pounds to qualify for gastric bypass surgery. At the start of the program, he was paired with a coach and a dietitian. Sally Neve, a registered nurse and dietitian, helped him devise a plan to meet his weight-loss goals, which included cutting back on sweetened beverages, eating more fruits and vegetables, and being mindful of portion sizes. He regimented his diet, eating three meals a day and two healthy snacks in between his meals. Neve also encouraged Clark to get a gym membership. Clark had never worked out. He had played a few pickup games of basketball in middle school, but it was never strenuous. He was nervous and excited for the new experience, but a part of him was sure it wasn't going to work. He held on to the hope that if he lost just a few pounds, it would be enough to convince his mom that he could do the gastric bypass surgery. As Clark started working out on the elliptical machine, walking on the treadmill and eating smaller portions, he saw big changes quickly. In the first week, he lost seven pounds. After a few weeks, he started walking 45 to 50 minutes every day on the treadmill with the incline set to high, at a speed that was almost a jog. After three months, he had dropped 40 pounds, and the urge to have surgery also dissipated. He was now spending two hours a day at the gym. ""He became a changed person,"" Neve said. ""He became confident. He was like, 'I can do this.' I think that is so important for people, to have that confidence that they can succeed."" The salty and sweet snacks were traded in for healthy meals such as grilled chicken and brown rice for lunch and mostly grilled vegetables for dinner. Clark re-evaluated the way he approached food, choosing items such as whole grains and lean proteins to sustain his workouts, not high-calorie sweets to satisfy his cravings. ""He just had to go to someone who could say, 'You can eat what you want, but in moderation,' "" his mother said. After completing the program in December 2012, Clark was down to 280 pounds -- a loss of 125 pounds. But he wanted to be leaner. He started lifting weights on his own. Whenever he came across a piece of gym equipment he was unsure about, he asked a gym staff member to show him how to use it. He discovered he liked lifting weights. ""I liked the leg press. I never tried it, and I learned it works out your hamstrings and quads. When I starting incorporating it into my workouts, I saw improvements in my thighs,"" he said. The added resistance helped him drop another 100 pounds within a year. In two years, he had managed to bring his weight down to 180 pounds, exceeding all his weight-loss expectations. Now, happy with his weight, he continues to work out every day. He focuses on building muscle, not losing weight. He does cardio for 15 to 20 minutes and then puts energy toward sculpting his muscles by lifting weights and changing his fitness routine. The 23-year-old even has a job that requires him to be fit. He works at a UPS warehouse and is on his feet lifting heavy boxes several hours a day. ""If I didn't lose weight, I wouldn't be able to do this job,"" he said. ""There are people who work with me who look like they are fit, but they can't lift like I can. It really makes me want to keep staying in shape."" And his social life? It took a dramatic turn for the better. He has new friends, and a few old ones who stuck by him while he was struggling with his weight. They get together weekly as a group and hang out. Sometimes, he even runs into old classmates who shunned him when he was overweight. ""Now they (say) they are proud of me for losing weight, and that I am an inspiration,"" he said. After losing 225 pounds, he said the biggest lesson he learned was not to lose sight of who he was under all that weight. ""Your life will change, but you don't have to change,"" he said. ""You can look at things differently, but don't change who you are just because you changed physically. ... Remember who was there for you and who stayed with you.""","At 405 pounds, Tevante Clark says he was extremely lonely .

"(CNN) -- Elvis Presley's last two jets, the ""Lisa Marie"" and ""Hound Dog II,"" are for sale. The four-engine ""Lisa Marie"" features a queen-size bed, gold bathroom fixtures, a videotape system with four TVs and a stereo system with 52 speakers, according to an ad posted on an aviation sales website this week. The tail section on the 1960 Convair 880 features Presley's trademark ""TCB"" -- for ""Taking Care of Business"" -- and a color scheme personally chosen by Elvis, the Controller.com ad said. The smaller ""Hound Dog II"" JetStar was Presley's back-up plane, flown while ""Lisa Marie"" was remodeled to suit Elvis' tastes, the ad said. These planes represent the epitome of 1975 rock star luxury, but if you buy them don't expect to fly them. ""They're both museum pieces,"" said K.G. Coker, the Memphis man who bought them after Presley's 1977 death. They've not been flown since they were parked at the tourist entrance to Presley's Graceland mansion in 1984. Coker's ad doesn't set a price, but it he is looking for ""serious offers."" Elvis' ex-wife tells fans to 'calm down' over jets . Millions of Elvis fans have peered into the planes as part of the Graceland tour, with Coker getting a cut of the ticket proceeds, but his agreement with Elvis Presley Enterprises has expired. He's looking for a buyer because his agreement with and negotiations to keep them at Graceland have failed, leaving the jets' future up in the air. Fans erupted in protest when a news report in July said Elvis Presley Enterprises sent a letter to Coker asking him to move the planes from Graceland Plaza, across Elvis Presley Boulevard from the singer's famous home by next year. Priscilla Presley, the singer's former wife and mother of his daughter Lisa Marie, tried to ease fan fears in a tweet on July 2: ""Please calm down, we're in the midst of negotiations. It's as simple as that."" A spokesman for Elvis Presley Enterprises told CNN last week that negotiations were still going on, but Coker declined to comment on the process. Another online message from Priscilla Presley to fans blamed Coker for stirring up the controversy to put pressure on the estate in the talks: . ""I'm reading what you are saying, but listen, the people who own the plane put the release out to intentionally upset everyone. We're on top of it. Thank you for your trust in us. We will soon be putting out a release about some new and exciting things happening at Graceland. If you want to even hear more about it ... come to Graceland in August. That way you will hear it and experience it first hand. I can't imagine you'll be disappointed."" Lodging will be part of the Graceland experience . The ""new and exciting things"" announced in August was the groundbreaking of a 450-room hotel -- ""The Guesthouse at Graceland"" -- at the complex set to open next year. Lisa Marie Presley, the sole heir to the Elvis estate, sold a majority interest of Elvis Presley Enterprises to investors in 2005. She owns a minority share. Authentic Brands, the company that also owns the rights to Mohammad Ali and Marilyn Monroe images, bought the rights to Elvis' brand last year and is also a minority partner in managing Graceland. Elvis bought the ""Lisa Marie"" from Delta Airlines for $250,000 in April 1975, and he spent another $350,000 upgrading it, according to the sale ad. The ""Lisa Marie's"" last flight for Elvis was when it carried Priscilla Presley and actor George Hamilton from California to Memphis for Presley's funeral in August 1977. Presley's father sold the planes in 1978, but his estate later negotiated with the owners to park them at Graceland after it was opened to the public.

"(CNN) -- In the tangled aftermath of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster, two narratives have emerged -- one that most of the world subscribes to, and another that Russia and the rebels are pushing. In the first, MH17 was shot down by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, using a sophisticated Russian-built missile system. In the second, Russia and the rebels suggest several different scenarios for what brought the jetliner down, some of them bordering on the bizarre. Propaganda is nothing new in world politics. Since the beginning of time, everyone has put their spin on the events of the day. But the word from Washington about Russia's take? Take any information coming out of Moscow ""with a very large grain of salt."" ""I would also say that these aren't competing narratives from two equally credible sources here,"" said Marie Harf, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman. ""The Russian government has repeatedly put out misinformation and propaganda throughout this conflict in Ukraine, so I would caution you from saying that these are two equally credible sources, although you're happy to report it that way, but I would take issue with it."" The Russian mindset, says CNN's former Moscow bureau chief, loves a good story. And the Russian narrative is meant to sway public opinion on who's responsible for the jet's downing. ""Don't forget, the mentality of Russians is to think of conspiracy theories,"" said Jill Dougherty. ""So when they hear something that is outrageous, they might believe it."" Here are some of the stories circulating in the Russian media. THE RUSSIAN TAKE: The passengers were already dead . Rebel commander Igor Girkin suggested that many of MH17's passengers were corpses -- already dead -- and put aboard the 11-plus-hour flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Those claims were made on Russia's Russkaya Vessna website. ""A significant number of the bodies weren't fresh,"" Girkin said he'd learned, adding, their blood had been drained. He also reportedly claimed a vast amount of blood serum and medications were discovered in the wreckage. THE WORLD'S TAKE: The information contradicts the Malaysia Airlines passenger manifest for Flight 17 that lists the 298 people who were alive when they boarded the regularly scheduled flight. For instance, Dutch passenger Pim de Kuijer was on his way to an International AIDS Conference in Australia -- a trip that was to be followed by a backpacking excursion there. The day of the crash, de Kuijer posted to his Facebook page a picture of him posing beneath aviator sunglasses and sporting a large travelers' backpack. --- . THE RUSSIAN TAKE: A Ukrainian fighter jet shot it down . On the day of the crash, Russia's radar system spotted a Ukrainian Air Force jet approaching the Boeing, said Russian Army Lt. Gen. Andrey Kartopolov. ""Its standard armament includes R60 air-to-air missiles, which are capable of locking and hitting targets from 12 kilometers (7 miles) and which are guaranteed to hit the target from the distance of 5 kilometers (3 miles),"" he said. THE WORLD'S TAKE: That's a claim that Ukraine has denied. And the United States and others have said the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile. ""The Russian government has a propaganda machine second to none, as these latest conspiracy theories demonstrate,"" a U.S. official told CNN. --- . THE RUSSIAN TAKE: Putin's plane was the target . According to some accounts in the Russian media, MH17 was traveling along almost the same route as President Vladimir Putin's presidential plane, which was returning to Moscow from a summit in Brazil. Both planes have red, white and blue markings. ""The contours of the airplanes are in general similar, the linear dimensions are also very similar and regarding the coloring, from a sufficiently long distance, they are practically identical,"" an aviation source was quoted as telling the news outlet, RT. THE WORLD'S TAKE: Another Russian media, the online news portal Gazeta.ru, reported that Putin's plane has not flown over Ukrainian airspace for quite some time because of the conflict between the government and rebel forces. --- . THE RUSSIAN TAKE: Don't believe what you read on the Internet . Rebel leader Alexander Borodai has maintained for days that MH17 was shot down, just not by his forces. He said they don't have that capability. Asked about the trail of evidence that contradicted him, Borodai just rolled his eyes. ""It's very easy to refute it,"" Borodai told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""Almost all information that comes over the internet is practically all lies."" THE WORLD'S TAKE: Western and Ukrainian intelligence say the rebels did have the means to bring down a jetliner. They were in control of a Russian missile system that once belonged to the Ukrainian military. A video reportedly showed the weapons system being carted out of eastern Ukraine into Russia. Intercepted conversations brag of an aircraft being shot down before the debris showed it was a civilian aircraft. A tweet from a rebel defense minister also bragged of the accomplishment -- before it was deleted. --- . THE RUSSIAN TAKE: Did we mention it was the Ukrainians? With the stakes so high even basic information online was being changed to shape facts. The Twitter site @RuGovEdits automatically tracks changes made by Russian government sites to Wikipedia. It has tracked dozens of edits from Moscow to Wikipedia entries about MH17. In one case, one edit that said the plane was shot down by the pro-Russian rebels was changed less than an hour later by someone inside the Russian government to say: ""The plane was shot down by Ukrainian soldiers."" THE WORLD'S TAKE: The Wikipedia entry now says the two sides are accusing each other. --- . THE RUSSIAN TAKE: At first, the story didn't require such heavy media coverage. Russian newspapers downplayed the story just after the crash. THE WORLD'S TAKE: The downing of the Malaysia Airlines made headlines instantly around the world. ""The Kremlin or the people that control the information, networks in Russia, decide how they are going to explain something, what the general narrative will be, and that is given to radio, TV, newspapers to a certain extent, etc.,"" said Dougherty. ""They essentially are told, this is what you should say."" It proved too much for one reporter, RT's Sarah Firth, who quit the network last week. ""I've had many times over the five years I've been at RT where I had a similar struggle and you've watched the story handled in that way. And you felt very strongly that right away the narrative is being pitched -- a very specific narrative to the detriment to the facts and accuracy in reporting."" CNN's Randi Kaye, Miguel Marquez and Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","A rebel commander says many of those on MH17 were dead before it was shot down .

"(CNN) -- In what could prove to be a precedent-setting case, the National Labor Relations Board has issued a complaint against a Connecticut company for firing an employee after she posted critical, derogatory comments about her supervisor on Facebook. The company, ambulance service American Medical Response, says emergency medical technician Dawnmarie Souza was fired because of ""multiple, serious complaints about her behavior,"" not because she took to a social networking site to describe her supervisor in various unflattering terms, among the mildest of which was comparing the supervisor to a psychiatric patient. The labor board, a federal agency that oversees union elections and investigates claims of unfair labor practices, accuses the company of illegally terminating Souza and denying her access to union representation during an investigatory review. The labor relations board argues that workers' criticism of their bosses on social networking sites like Facebook is generally ""a protected concerted activity."" ""You are permitted to talk about terms and conditions with employees or anyone else, it's public because you are protected under the National Labor Act,"" says Jonathan Kreisberg, the board's regional director in Hartford, Connecticut. Kreisberg says that in addition to describing her supervisor in unflattering and sometimes vulgar terms on her Facebook page, Souza also wrote about ""how the company allows a 17 to be a supervisor."" The 17 reference is the company's jargon for a psychiatric patient, Kreisberg says. The National Labor Act gives workers the right to form unions and it prohibits employers from taking action against employees -- union or non-union -- for discussing working conditions, says Kreisberg. He adds that the case could be ""ground-breaking"" because it is in the uncharted legal territory of social networking sites on the internet. ""It was Souza's ... own page; she did this on her own time in her own home. This case is different because in this situation it happened online and the company's rules were unlawfully broad,"" says Kreisberg. In a statement to CNN, American Medical Response says it believes that the offensive statements made against the co-worker were not activities protected under federal law. The company ""denies the allegations made by the NLRB and believes the facts will show that they are without merit. The employee in question was discharged based on multiple, serious complaints about her behavior,"" the statement says. An attorney representing the ambulance company adds, ""This is not about Facebook."" ""This employee was terminated after the company received complaints on two separate incidents in 2009. All pointed to Souza's rude and discourteous behavior with patients,"" says attorney Jackson Lewis. Souza, who was fired last December and who is seeking reinstatement to her job, declined comment to CNN, saying only that granting an interview would ""jeopardize her case at this point."" On the issue of assistance from a union representative, the labor board says Souza wanted help from the union representing the company's workers when she wrote up a response to the company. The company's lawyer says she was not denied union representation. ""Before submitting her response, she checked in with her union representative,"" says Lewis. A labor board hearing for the case is scheduled for January 25.","An EMT in Connecticut complained about her supervisor on her Facebook page .
She was fired, with the company saying it was for her work, not her Facebook writings .
The National Labor Relations board has issued a complaint against the company ."
"(CNN) -- A man boards a plane in Liberia with a slight fever. As the jet nears an airport in New York, his temperature rises; his throat grows sore. It's the flu, he thinks after he lands, but he's wrong. He's caught the deadly Ebola virus. He soon dies of hemorrhagic fever while surrounded by family. Some of them catch it, and it's like a flame hitting a fuse. The United States erupts in its first Ebola pandemic as health care workers fight an uphill battle to contain it. Could what sounds like the plot of a Hollywood pestilence thriller really happen here? Well, yes and no. Yes, Ebola can come to the United States. But no, there's no reason to panic. ""This is not an epidemic; it's not the kind of disease that can sweep through New York,"" said Dr. Alexander van Tulleken of Fordham University. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? The 'yes' part: . Given that international air travel is commonplace, it's realistic that an infected passenger could land in the country. One nearly did. Patrick Sawyer, a U.S. citizen working in Liberia, fell violently ill while on a plane to Nigeria this month. He was planning on returning to his family in Minnesota but died before he could. ""It's going to happen at some point,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. A person can be infected and not show symptoms for up to three weeks. So it's possible for someone to fly to the United States who has the virus but is feeling fine. ""Just observing the whole process, it's almost impossible to prevent from happening,"" Gupta said. Then, the person could develop symptoms of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which would make the patient capable of passing the virus. To catch it, one has to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids: sweat, saliva, blood or excrement. The 'no' part: . Experts agree that the disease would not spread far like it has in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, where health officials believe it has killed more than 700 people in the largest Ebola outbreak in recorded history. There are two reasons for this: . â€¢ Though Ebola is aggressively infectious, which means that those infected are highly likely to get sick, it's not very contagious, meaning that it doesn't spread easily. â€¢ Public health educators and medical professionals in the United States and other highly industrialized countries would deal with it swiftly. It's an advantage the poor affected countries in West Africa don't have. ""It certainly is feasible that someone could come to the United States who is infected and gets sick here. No one's denying that,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. But the health care system in the United States gives it the ability ""to do the kind of isolation that apparently is very difficult to do within the health care infrastructure in the African countries that we are talking about."" The 'why not' part: . To answer that, consider the following: . 1. Knowledge is key. That's one of the big advantages that industrialized nations, such as the United States, have in fighting Ebola's spread. First, teach health care workers to recognize Ebola cases. Then quarantine them. Then keep people out of contact with their bodily fluids while it runs its course. The CDC has alerted health workers in the United States to keep an eye out for symptomatic patients who have recently traveled to West Africa. If a case does turn up, public health officials will work to rapidly track down other people the patient has come into contact with and screen them for the virus. They are currently looking for anyone who may have come into contact with Sawyer. 2. There's little superstition surrounding Ebola here. ""Epidemics of disease are often followed by epidemics of fear and epidemics of stigma,"" said Dr. Marty Cetron of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""All these kinds of things occur in a social context that can make containment very, very challenging."" In many parts of West Africa, rumors have spread that eating raw onions will protect from the disease while mangoes may promote it, the World Health Organization has said. Villagers carry out their usual burial of the dead, coming into contact with bodily fluids and infecting themselves. With too few people to mount a tough battle against the spread of the disease itself, aid workers have said they are putting a lot of emphasis on education. They are teaching local residents to stay out of contact with the virus while they treat the sick. But locals often view them with suspicion, some accusing them of bringing the disease to the country. 3. There's ready access to basic care. ""We don't have a vaccine, and we don't have any drugs that work on it at the moment,"" van Tulleken said. ""The treatment is entirely what we call supportive care."" Much of the treatment involves simple nursing, things such as proper hydration and nutrition. In places where aid workers in West Africa have done so, they have been able to save about 45% of those infected. Without treatment, the death rate can run as high as 90%, Medecins sans Frontieres has said. A pretty good way not to catch the virus is not to come into unprotected contact with sick patients. That's why Ebola caregivers dress in head-to-toe protective gear with masks and patients are isolated in tent-like structures, making it look like the scene of a chemical spill. How the United States and the West can help is to devote money and staff to contain the virus in West Africa. ""We're not doing a brilliant job of containing the epidemic in terms of the resources we've devoted to it so far,"" van Tulleken said. Ebola outbreak cripples West Africa, threatens beyond .

"(CNN) -- Australian pizza is now officially the best in the world. Well, sort of. Judges at last weekend's Campionato Mondiale Della Pizza (Pizza World Championship) held in Parma, Italy, awarded the world's top margherita pizza title to Australian chef Johnny Di Francesco, owner of the 400 Gradi restaurant in Brunswick, a Melbourne suburb. Di Francesco, 36, beat more than 600 competitors from 35 countries to take home the Specialita Traditionale Garantita pizza prize in the annual competition. The win and subsequent publicity has made the small restaurant he owns in his hometown an overnight sensation. ""It's been an amazing reaction,"" Di Francesco tells CNN. ""Honestly, I just went to Naples to do what I love. I didn't think it was going to make such a stir."" ""A lot of people think it is easy to produce a margherita but it is one of the hardest (pizzas) to produce,"" Di Francesco told Australian website Good Food. ""With a lot of other pizzas it's easy to mask the flavor with toppings so you don't really get the flavor out of the dough. With a margherita there is no hiding anything that isn't right."" Competition rules are strict on what ingredients can top the dough on the margherita: only peeled tomatoes, certain types of mozzarella, garlic, olive oil, salt and fresh basil leaves are used. Pizza the traditional way . Di Francesco, who says he's been making pizza since was 12 years old and studied pizza-making at the highly regarded Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana in Naples, Italy, calls himself a traditionalist when it comes to making pizza. ""It's an honor to be part of what (Verace Pizza Napoletana) does, striving to preserve a traditional way of making pizza the way they've done it in Naples for hundreds of years."" Although he's claimed the world title, Di Francesco has no plans to raise the A$20.50 ($19.30) price on the margherita pizza made daily at 400 Gradi. ""No, not at all,"" he says with a laugh. Italian chefs weren't entirely shut out of the winner's circle at the competition. As reported by Good Food, Italian chef Julius Scialpi took home the ""classic pizza"" prize for a pizza made with mozzarella, eggplant, nostrana, breadcrumbs and anchovies with burrata. 400 Gradi, 99 Lygon St., Brunswick East, Victoria, Australia; +61 (0)3 9380 2320; daily, midday-11 p.m.","An Australian chef has taken home top honors at the World Pizza Championship in Italy .

"(CNN) -- In the 100 years since British army officer T.E. Lawrence traversed Jordan's desert and the half century since David Lean set out to capture it for his cinematic epic ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" the blood red landscape that entranced both men has scarcely changed. Still ""vast, echoing and God-like"" -- as Lawrence wrote in his account of his war experiences ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" -- the desert's hidden gems are now accessible to all. Today, Jordan is one of the Middle East's safest tourist destinations and plays host to an endlessly varied landscape. Fifty years since the film crews left, following in Lawrence, and later Lean's, footsteps can still reveal some of Jordan's finest desert jewels. Wadi Rum . When Lawrence, as a junior officer, was first sent out into the desert to locate the Hashemite rebels who he would join in revolt against the Ottoman Empire, he found himself in a vast gorge, where red rock monoliths rose more than 800m into the air around thin sand corridors. He was inspired to write of the granite and sandstone cliffs ""sheering in like a thousand-foot wave towards the middle of the valley."" In the south of modern day Jordan, 300km from capital city, Amman, near the border with Saudi Arabia, the landscape appears unchanged from the scenes described by Lawrence -- the same landscape which Lean used as the backdrop for the Englishman's first encounter with Alec Guinness' Prince Faisal -- in what is now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site. Click on the pindrops above to trace Lawrence of Arabia's Jordan. All photos courtesy Jordan Tourism Board . The natural wonder remains awe-inspiring, says travel writer Matthew Teller who authored the Rough Guide to Jordan: ""It's a very evocative place, the sound is echoing off the walls around you, you're looking up and down this broad desert canyon with sun coming down and the blue sky above."" The desert dunes . Lawrence's masterplan of leading an army across the arid brick-red sand of the desert to launch an attack on the coastal town of Aqaba -- an idea considered so perilous that the Ottomans had not bothered to defend against it -- became his defining act. Those wishing to follow in Lawrence's footsteps can take camel treks from Wadi Rum, says tourism expert Yousef Zureqat, who has worked with Jordan's Dakkak Tours to develop their Lawrence of Arabia adventure trails. More leisurely tourists can explore the wild terrain from the comfort of 4x4s with air conditioning. The real treat, agree Zureqat and Teller, is connecting with the culture of the Zalabia Bedouin, the descendants of those tribesmen who joined Lawrence in revolt and participated in the filming of Lean's movie. Eating lamb cooked slowly in a Zarb (sand oven) in the company of the Bedouin, camping out under the stars in black goat hair tents and seeing the sunset ""make the desert come alive,"" says Teller. Aqaba . At the other edge of the desert lies in the far south of the country, lies Jordan's tiny Red Sea coast and the coastal fortress which would make Lawrence famous. In 1917, this was where Lawrence claimed credit for uniting Bedouin tribes to mount a surprise attack, emerging from the desert to defeat Ottoman forces whose artillery pointed out to sea. In David Lean's film, Lawrence lures Anthony Quinn's mercenary tribal leader Auda Abu Tayi to join the attack with the promise of a ""great box"" of gold in Aqaba. Since then the fortune of the country's only sea port has only grown: Aqaba now boasts 5* luxury seaside resorts, beach hotels and a marine park. Amid this modern day opulence, the historic 14th century fortress is still there, though damaged by Lawrence's attack and an earthquake a decade later, and is open to visitors. Azraq . In ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom,"" Lawrence described the harsh winter of 1917 when -- as he and Faisal prepared to lead their troops north to capture Damascus -- they stopped to rest at the oasis and ancient fort of Azraq. Far from the path of most tourists, says Teller, the fortress -- including Lawrence's room above the gateway -- are now guarded by the direct descendants of those who provided refuge to Lawrence and Faisal's army. Visitors willing to travel out to ""The Blue Fort"" -- one of a string of desert castles built by the Umayyad Dynasty in the 7th and 8th century -- can experience the ""unfathomable silence"" Lawrence recounts in his book. While there, visitors can also enjoy the Azraq Wetlands Reserve, established by the Jordanian Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature. Dawn bird watching is popular, says Teller, with migratory birds stopping in the area to drink at the only oasis in 12,000 square kilometers of desert. Amman . When Lawrence arrived in Jordan in 1916, Amman was a village, home to the ruins of Roman, Byzantine and Islamic civilizations and a new train station on the Ottoman Hejaz Railway. By the time he sat down to write his account in ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom,"" the railway was in tatters and Amman was capital of the new Emirate of Transjordan -- both thanks, chiefly, to Faisal and Lawrence's revolt. Today, Amman's sprawling business, technology and financial districts dwarf the old town. But relics of Lawrence's stay can still be found. The original railway carriages dating from 1908 still make chartered journeys from Qatrana, 90km to the south, on one of the last surviving stretches of the Hejaz Railway, says Zureqat. Teller describes an old Ottoman-style building of ""creamy limestone, with tiled floors, a semicircular veranda in a wooded garden on the slope of a hill overlooking downtown Amman."" It is now a gallery for contemporary Jordanian and Arab art called Darat al-Funun. But, Teller says: ""This very beautiful old building was (British Arab Legion Commander) Frederick Peake's house, and the story goes that when Lawrence was a guest of Peake in the early twenties, this house was where he wrote some, or all, of 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom.'"" The 50th Anniversary 4K Restoration of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" opens in cinemas across the UK on 23 November.","Many of the key scenes in David Lean's epic 1962 film ""Lawrence of Arabia"" were filmed in Jordan .

"(CNN) -- The next time your child refuses to make his or her bed, don't despair. You may have an artist on your hands. A 16-year-old unmade bed, turned into an art installation, sold for $4,351,969 dollars at a Christie's art auction in London on Tuesday, according to Christie's. Artist Tracey Emin calls it ""My Bed,"" because it was the bed where she spent four days in 1998 ""heartbroken and feeling terrible"" she tells CNN. Once Emin got out of the bed she recalls looking at the mess left behind and decided to make it art. ""Suddenly I had this vision of taking it out of the bedroom space and putting it into a white gallery space,"" she said. ""It suddenly made sense,"" she said. ""Wow this is fantastic artwork."" A year later, in 1999, ""My Bed"" was shortlisted for the Turner Prize. It's not just the messy linens and blankets that bring the art installation to life. The objects surrounding it tell the story of a broken heart. There's the ashtray overflowing with cigarettes, empty liquor bottles, dirty panties, bits of food, contraceptives and what appears to be a 16-year-old condom. ""It's like a piece of history, a time capsule,"" Emin said. Art lovers agreed, and her unconventional sculpture sold for more than $1.7 million over the expected auction price, which was set between $1.3 million to $2 million.

"(CNN) -- A 6.3-magnitude earthquake ripped through Christchurch, New Zealand, on Tuesday afternoon, causing multiple fatalities as it toppled buildings onto buses, buckled streets and damaged cathedrals, authorities said. New Zealand Police announced on the agency's website that a large-scale evacuation of the central city was under way. According to the news release, the earthquake killed an undetermined number of people at various locations around the city, including passengers on two buses crushed by buildings that had fallen on them. TVNZ reported that the 147-year-old Christchurch Cathedral's spire had toppled, Christchurch Hospital was being evacuated and the airport was closed. Laura Campbell told CNN she was at work at the bottom of a six-story building when the earthquake struck. She described seeing ""windows blowing out, bricks falling down, people screaming, the whole nine yards."" ""It was bloody serious,"" said Campbell, who was trying to walk home. ""I'm worried about what I'm going to find down the road."" The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake struck just before 1 p.m. Tuesday (7 p.m. Monday ET), and a 5.6-magnitude aftershock struck about 15 minutes later. The U.S.G.S. recorded a second 5.5-magnitude aftershock shortly before 3 p.m. local time. The New Zealand Herald reported that phone lines in the area were out, including the city's emergency 111 service, roads were cracked -- in some cases lifted as much as a meter (1 yard) -- and water mains had burst, flooding several streets. Witness Philip Gregan said he was attending a joint U.S.- New Zealand conference when the earthquake struck. ""I'm seeing a lot of damage in buildings, there are glass and bricks in the road. I've seen one collapsed bridge and there's a lot of water from broken water mains,"" he told CNN. ""I saw one (injured) person in the back of a police car and one of our colleagues saw a person crushed by falling debris, so there are definitely dead."" New Zealand's transit authority told TVNZ that it had been unable to reach its staff in Christchurch and at the Lyttleton Tunnel, which is near the epicenter. Christchurch police told TVNZ that the city's 106-year-old Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament was badly damaged, and a Herald reporter said that half the building had collapsed. Camera footage aired by the station showed piles of stone lying atop crushed chairs on the floor of the cathedral with light shining through the collapsed tower above the sanctuary. Witness Gavin Blowman told CNN how he ran into the street when the earthquake struck. ""It felt like I was running on jelly,"" he said. ""We saw a giant rock tumble to the ground from a cliff -- a rock that had been there for millennia. It fell on the RSA (Returned Services Association, a veterans' association) building -- it was terrifying."" He said there were now fears that a tsunami could hit in the wake of the quake and that he and 20 other people were trying to get to higher ground. Flying out of the city currently was not an option in the hours immediately after the quake. ""The airport is currently closed until further notice,"" an airport employee told CNN some two hours after the quake. All planes inbound for the airport were being diverted, and no planes were allowed to take off. No one was injured at the airport, he said. The employee did not give his name and wanted to clear the phone line to continue emergency work. The quake caused significant damage to several older buildings, a Herald reporter said. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he would attend an emergency Cabinet meeting in Wellington and then fly to Christchurch if conditions allow. Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker told Radio New Zealand that the rumbling tossed him across the room, that he knew of injuries in the city council building and has heard unconfirmed reports of serious injuries. ""That was, in the city central anyway, as violent as the one that happened on the 4th of September,"" he said. Parker added that streets were jammed as people tried to get out of the city, and he urged people to avoid the water supply. ""We've been through this before this once, we now need to think what we did at that time,"" he said. Southern New Zealand has been plagued by a series of quakes since September, when the area was shaken by a 7.1-magnitude temblor that New Zealand authorities said was the most damaging quake to hit the region since 1931. The earthquake struck in the predawn hours of September 4. Authorities said the deserted streets at that time likely kept injuries to a minimum. There were no deaths from that earthquake. Both the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament and the Anglican Christchurch Cathedral were undergoing repairs after being badly damaged by the September quake. The quake struck in the ""worst possible location,"" Kevin Fenaughty, data center manager for GNS Science, told the Herald. ""It's a nightmare,"" he said. ""A lot of people were just getting back on their feet after the original quake."" TVNZ also reported that its newsroom in Christchurch was badly damaged.","NEW: Police say the 6.3-magnitude earthquake caused ""multiple fatalities""

"(CNN) -- As police in Georgia investigated the death of a 22-month-old boy left seven hours in a sweltering SUV, they seized computers from the father's office, a source with knowledge of the investigation told HLN's Nancy Grace. The officers found something startling: an Internet search for ""how long does it take for an animal to die in a hot car,"" the source said. It's unknown when the Internet search was conducted and whether the father did the searching. Police have declined comment when asked about the computer search. The father, Justin Ross Harris, was charged with murder and second-degree child cruelty. Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said if what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris. 'What have I done?' Initially, police seemed sympathetic, describing the death of Cooper Harris on June 18 as the result of tragic absentmindedness. They said the dad had apparently forgotten the boy was in the back seat of his Hyundai Tucson; he didn't remember until he was done with his work day, drove a couple of miles, and pulled into a shopping center parking lot. But police became suspicious as they investigated. ""The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation,"" said Cobb County Police Chief John House. A criminal warrant released Wednesday described the events that led to Cooper's death. A timeline of events . On the day Cooper died, June 18, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's backseat, police said. He drove to his workplace, a Home Depot corporate office, about a half-mile away. He works as a Web designer there. Normally, he would take his son to an on-site day care. But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat. During his lunch break, he returned to his car, opening the driver's side door to put something inside, police said. After work, around 4:16 p.m., the 33-year-old father got in his car and drove away. A few miles away, he stopped the car at a shopping center and called for help. When it became clear Cooper was dead, Harris was so inconsolable police had to restrain him. ""What have I done?"" he wailed as he tried to resuscitate the little boy. Harris has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty. He sits in jail without bond, with an appearance before a judge scheduled for July 3. A wave of sympathy . Each year, dozens of children die from heat strokes in cars, according to KidsandCars.org. More than 40 died last year. The organization believes its tally is incomplete and much lower than the real toll. When police charged Harris, it triggered a wave of sympathy and a vigorous debate over whether the heartbroken father should be punished. A change.org petition that was started urging authorities to release Harris was withdrawn Thursday, with this note explaning: ""I think that based on the recent developments this petition is no longer relevant. I still pray that this was truly an accident. If that is the case, the DA now knows that the community does not want Justin prosecuted on murder charges."" Atlanta area resident Erin Krans started a second change.org petition asking prosecutors to drop the charges. It has garnered hundreds of signatures and was still operational as of 8:30 p.m. Thursday. Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family. ""Please don't listen to the media. It just upsets me to watch it,"" wrote Heather McCullar, who set it up. ""Please don't listen to the media. The family will speak when they can."" Contacted by CNN via e-mail, she wrote back, ""No one is allowed to comment right now."" His wife's not talking . As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media. Harris' attorney has not returned repeated calls from CNN. The child's cause of death was ""consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide,"" the Cobb County Medical Examiner's Office said, according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety release issued Wednesday. Temperatures hit 92 degrees Fahrenheit on the day of his death. The medical examiner's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler's death. Cooper's funeral, meanwhile, will be held Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Read the criminal warrant (PDF) CNN's Victor Blackwell, Devon M.

"(CNN) -- O Roamio, Roamio, wherefore art thou Roamio? The answer, hopes TiVo, is next to your TV. TiVo, which pioneered the digital-video recorder in the late 1990s and early 2000s, is back with Roamio, its first new line of DVRs in three years. The devices were announced Tuesday by the company, which hopes Roamio rekindles a classic romance with customers. ""While so many people love TV, they have no idea what TiVo can do for their love of TV,"" Tom Rogers, TiVo's president and CEO, said in a written release. ""TiVo Roamio is so much more than just the best DVR, it's for people who are all about loving their TV -- that's why we call our latest offering Roamio."" The new set-top boxes range in price from $199-$599 and hit the market at a time when Web-streaming products like Roku, Slingbox and Google's new Chromecast have captured the imaginations of tech-savvy TV viewers. Not surprisingly, Roamio incorporates features from some of those devices into the TiVo box that became almost synonymous with DVRs after hitting the U.S. market in 1999. Roamio DVRs will soon offer the ability to watch any of your recorded shows on mobile devices from anywhere, a la Slingbox. Like Chromecast and Roku, they offer popular streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. ""It's like Roku, Apple TV, Slingbox, Google TV, your cable DVR -- rolled into one,"" reads the company's news release. This mobile streaming feature, available on the top-end and mid-range boxes, is expected to roll out in the next few months. There's also more of what made TiVo popular in the first place. The top-of-the-line set can record up to six shows at the same time and, with a full 3 TB of storage space, can hold up to 450 hours of high-definition content. The new devices also can stream content to multiple TVs, as well as to tablets and smartphones. The three devices in the new line are the TiVo Roamio ($199.99), TiVo Roamio Plus ($399.99) and TiVo Roamio Pro ($599.99). A review of the Roamio Pro on tech site The Verge sums up the device's upside and downside in its headline: ""This is the ultimate cable box ... but, oh, the price."" The review calls the Roamio DVRs a big upgrade over the current TiVo Premiere line with a ""huge"" advantage over cable company offerings. ""The TiVo Roamio Pro is very much the ultimate DVR -- short of building a media center PC, there isn't another product on the market that can do as much with as much flexibility as the Roamio,"" reads the review by Nilay Patel. ""Installing it can be a huge pain, and it's outrageously expensive ... but if you're spending loads of money on cable service with premium channels, it's worth it."" The TiVo Premiere debuted in 2010 for $299, and an upgraded Premiere XL was $499. The Roamio line is currently available for order from TiVo's website, Amazon.com and BestBuy.com. The boxes also will go on sale at Best Buy stores sometime in the next few weeks.","Roamio is TiVo's first new line of DVRs in three years .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than half the public says Obamacare has helped either their families or others across the country, although less than one in five Americans say they have personally benefited from the health care law, according to a new national poll. A CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that a majority of Americans oppose the Affordable Care Act, but some of that opposition is from people who don't think the law goes far enough. The poll, conducted this past weekend, was released on Wednesday, one day after a federal appeals court upheld Obamacare tax subsidies. That ruling came just a couple of hours after a separate appeals court struck down such subsidies for the millions of Americans enrolled in the federal government's HealthCare.gov exchange. According to the poll, only 18% of the public say they or their families are better off now that the major provisions of the health care law have been implemented. Another 35% report that, while their lives have not improved, the Affordable Care Act has benefited other people in the United States. Add those two numbers together and that means 53% say that Obamacare has helped either their families or others across the country. Forty-four percent tell us that the health care law has not helped anyone in the country. According to the poll, 40% of Americans say they support the health care law, basically unchanged from March but up from 35% in December, which was a record low in CNN polling. Fifty-nine percent of those questioned say they oppose the measure, down five points from December. ""Not all of the opposition to the health care law comes from the right,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Thirty-eight percent say they oppose the law because it's too liberal, but 17% say they oppose it because it's not liberal enough. That means more than half the public either favors Obamacare, or opposes it because it doesn't go far enough."" As expected, the poll indicates a continued wide partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans over the law and whether it's working. Political battle over Obamacare . The measure was passed into law in 2010, when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. The law, considered President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement, was a major issue in 2010 and 2012, and is again in 2014, as many Republicans continue to call for Obamacare to be repealed and replaced. While the Obamacare website suffered a disastrous rollout last autumn, things have improved. Major flaws with HealthCare.gov were addressed and major gains in enrollment were made. But Republicans continue to keep their midterm campaign focus on the health care law. Earlier this month House Speaker John Boehner made Obamacare the focus of his lawsuit against the President. The GOP obsession with the health care law may be smart politics: Midterm electorates are smaller than those of presidential elections, and the contests are often all about getting out base voters -- and the GOP base continues to hate Obamacare. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from July 18-20, with 1,012 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points. CNN Political Editor Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Poll: More than half of public says Obamacare has helped their families or others .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese authorities on Wednesday formally charged a prominent Uyghur scholar with ""separatism"" months after his detention, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, was detained by police in January and taken to his native Xinjiang, China's restive northwestern region where a spate of recent violent incidents have been blamed by the government on Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. Just a day earlier, Xinhua cited local police as saying that a gang wielding knives and axes attacked civilians, a police station, government offices and smashed vehicles on Monday in southern Xinjiang, killing and injuring dozens. The government called the incident an ""organized and premeditated"" terrorist attack and said police officers at the scene shot dead dozens of people in the mob, according to Xinhua. In a statement posted online in January, Xinjiang police said they had gathered firm evidence of Tohti colluding with overseas forces to ""spread separatist ideas, incite ethnic hatred and advocate Xinjiang independence."" The police statement also said Tohti had taught students about ""violent Uyghur resistance"" in his class and encouraged them to overthrow the Chinese government. Tohti's lawyer told CNN last month that the scholar emphasized his innocence during a meeting between the two in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. ""He reiterated that he has advocated to improve the rule of law, democracy and ethnic harmony in Xinjiang,"" said Li Fangping, the lawyer, shortly after being allowed to visit his client for the first time in months. Hunger strike in January . Li also complained about the treatment of Tohti in jail, saying he was put in shackles for three weeks upon arrival. ""He went on a hunger strike for some 10 days in January after they refused to provide him with Muslim food,"" Li said. ""They also denied him food for about 10 days in March after the Kunming incident,"" he said, referring to the stabbings at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming that left 29 people dead. Uyghur separatists were blamed in the attack. The lawyer added that Tohti ""looked OK but said he lost 16 kilograms and complained about ailments throughout the body, including in the liver, heart and eyes,"" Li added. CNN's phone calls Wednesday to the Xinjiang government for comment went unanswered. Vocal critic . Tohti is known for his research on Uyghur-Han relations and has been a vocal critic of the government's ethnic policies in Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han, China's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and loss of economic opportunities to Han people in Xinjiang. Amnesty International has said that Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. In the region's deadliest single violent incident in recent history, a suicide bombing in May killed 39 people at a street market in Urumqi. Another apparent suicide bombing left three dead in April at an Urumqi train station. The Chinese government has responded by launching a massive anti-terrorism campaign as well as pouring more economic resources into Xinjiang. Executions . Last month, China executed 13 people convicted of terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in Xinjiang in recent months, state media reported. Also in June, a court in Urumqi sentenced three people to death for their roles in a deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last October. Defendant names revealed by state media all sounded Uyghur. ""Repression plus economic incentives -- that has continued to be the government response,"" said Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""Economic development and job opportunities are important to the Uyghurs, but these things must be done in a way that respects their culture and freedom of expression. ""Unfortunately, the government is more interested in projecting what it wishes to do in Xinjiang rather than looking at what the real problems and ethnic grievances are in the region.""","Formal charge against Ilham Tohti comes a day after violence in southern Xinjiang .

"(CNN) -- ""And now it's time for one last bow, like all your other selves. Eleven's hour is over now, the clock is striking Twelve's."" With those poetic words, Jenna Coleman's Clara Oswald summed up the stakes of Wednesday night's Christmas episode of ""Doctor Who."" Following a hugely successful, well-received 50th anniversary episode last month, it seemed fitting that the show would bid goodbye to Matt Smith for an encore. The episode certainly ran the gamut, at various times showing the Doctor bald, naked and growing very old. It was a bittersweet night for ""Who"" fans (or ""Whovians""), to say the least. Of course, we've known for several months that this was coming, but the reactions on social media made clear that many in the audience weren't ready to say goodbye to Smith's Eleventh Doctor. ""Oh gosh. I'm emotionally wrecked,"" tweeted Kyle Williams. ""MY FEELINGS ARE NOT OK,"" is how Vera Raposo put it. So without further ado, here are five moments from the episode that had us feeling all of our feelings: . 1. The Doctor leaves Clara (twice) Things started off smoothly enough, with the Doctor pretending to be Clara's boyfriend at Christmas dinner. A few sitcom-ish moments (and Daleks, weeping angels and Cybermen -- including one disembodied) later, and soon the Doctor learned that Gallifrey and the other Time Lords could soon return, using a crack in the wall, in a small town called Christmas -- a time field seen in the Eleventh Doctor's first episode. The Daleks, Cybermen and more were ready to take on the Time Lords, however, and the Doctor was prepared to literally save Christmas (not to mention the entire planet, Trenzalore). But he didn't think he could protect Clara and sent her back home without her knowledge. As centuries went by on Trenzalore, the Doctor started to show his age and finally, Clara returned with the TARDIS and the ""feels"" came along with her. Seeing the Doctor and his companion -- who had earlier unwittingly declared her feelings for him -- reunited was a hugely uplifting moment, though soon the Doctor sent her away again, after saying he wouldn't. (Sorry, Clara, the Doctor lies.) But she returned one last time... Looking back on 50 years of 'Doctor Who' 2. The last Doctor? Those who've followed ""Doctor Who"" for a while will remember there's a limit to the number of regenerations he gets, exactly 12. After Clara returned the first time, the aging Doctor told Clara that he had used them all up, counting John Hurt's War Doctor from the previous episode, and a time when the Tenth Doctor regenerated into himself. Could this be the end of the Doctor for good? After her second return, having read the aforementioned poem from a Christmas cracker, and as the Doctor began to die of old age, she pleaded with the time field to save him. As the Daleks prepared to attack, the time field appeared, granting the Doctor more regenerative energy, which he used to lay waste to all of the invading armies (""Love from Gallifrey, boys!"") -- but it also meant that his time was up. 3. Goodbye, Eleven . Clara returned to the TARDIS, finding the Doctor back to his old self again. But despite his reset youthful appearance, he was still dying. He had a lot to think about in his final moments in this body. ""We all change. When you think about it, we're all different people all through our lives,"" he said. ""And that's OK, that's good, as long as you keep moving, as long as you remember all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this, not one day, I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me."" Lump in the throat, anyone? Is the Pope a Time Lord? 4. 'Raggedy man' Then the Doctor remembered his first companion, the first face he saw in this body: Amy Pond. In a surprise appearance, Karen Gillan returned for a cameo as Amy, to say, ""Raggedy man, good night."" Is it any wonder that ""Raggedy man"" trended worldwide for hours on Twitter? Eleven knew his time was up, and took off his trademark bowtie. And at this point, the Internet had a good cry. 5. Enter Twelve . As Clara begged the Doctor not to go, he suddenly had a brand new face. Clara's ""anime eyes"" said it all. This was a brand new Doctor indeed. Peter Capaldi is now the Twelfth Doctor, and he just had one question for Clara: ""Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?"" (Oh, and apparently he's got new kidneys.) So that was enough of an emotional roller coaster for an entire season's worth of some shows. Perhaps Smith's final words to the fans will help a little: . ""To the Whoniverse, thanks a million,"" he said. ""You're the best. I'll miss you. And I'll miss the madness."" 'Doctor Who' turns 50 and fans will never be the same .","Matt Smith portrayed the Doctor one final time on a special episode of 'Doctor Who'

"(CNN) -- Howie Mandel endured ridicule from other kids as a child because when his shoelaces came undone, he would limp around without tying them. He didn't want to handle the laces because they had touched the ground, and he thought they were dirty. Mandel, a Canadian comedian, later learned that he has obsessive compulsive disorder, a condition characterized by repetitive thoughts, impulses or images, and behaviors performed over and over. Some people with OCD wash their hands excessively or check to see if doors are locked multiple times. About 2.2 million Americans have OCD, according to the National Institutes of Health. Research has suggested the condition runs in families. Mandel also has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. ""As a child I didn't know that these things even existed,"" he told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""I knew that I felt isolated."" Mandel said his OCD is more complicated than he has led people to believe. It's not as straightforward as a fear of germs. ""I know intellectually that if I shake somebody's hand that I'm not going to get sick and die,"" he said. But there have been times when Mandel has touched something or someone and then obsessed for the rest of the day about it, trapped in a ""never ending obsessive-compulsive world."" Mandel recently appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno, and dipped his hand into a large bowl of hand sanitizer before shaking hands with the host. Mandel admitted to Burnett that he made the situation ""more dramatic than it was,"" and that it was actually not a big problem to touch Leno's hand. ""I don't know when it's going to be a big problem,"" he said. A big concern of Mandel's is that there are no routine resources in place for mental health for young people, the way there are for physical health. Mandel said that just like parents take their children to pediatricians and dentists, mental health -- such as counseling -- should also be part of the picture. ""We take care of our dental health,"" he said. ""We don't take care of our mental health."" Mandel acknowledged that some people with mental illnesses are overmedicated; at the same time, some sufferers of colds want to take antibiotics unnecessarily. But Mandel is more concerned about helping people cope with their life situations, both those who have diagnosed mental illnesses and those who do not. ADHD: Who makes the diagnosis? ""We are so behind in the world as to not have something in place that just teaches everyone how to cope,"" he said. The embarrassment and stigma surrounding mental health issues needs to end, he said. ""I think the solution to making this world better is if we would just be healthy, mentally,"" Mandel said.

"(CNN) -- According to Congress's watchdog agency, there is a new threat facing the nation's armed forces, and the Department of Defense is not doing enough about it. The threat? Global climate change. In a recent report, the Government Accountability Office described what that threat looks like today at U.S. military bases: Air Force runways at remote radar sites being eaten away by encroaching tides. Army training ranges that are flooded, burned by wildfires or bogged down by melting permafrost. Submarines in dry dock, threatened by coastal flooding that might permanently damage the multibillion-dollar machines. Investigators heard from military officials that the heavy rain, storm surges, warm temperatures and droughts that caused these conditions are on the rise. There is just one problem with the GAO's findings: Congress, apparently, is not listening. The House just passed an amendment seeking to bar (PDF) the Department of Defense from dealing with global climate change. It will be a shame if that language becomes law, because the GAO has it right: Climate change is a threat to the nation's security and prosperity. On the other hand, that does not mean the Joint Chiefs of Staff should muster a Climate Change Brigade to go fight the weather. To paraphrase the commander in chief, just because the military is a really good hammer does not mean climate change is a nail. This is not a threat in the traditional sense of the word, nor is there a military solution. Climate change is fundamentally an economic challenge for civil society and civilian institutions. There is, however, an important defense role in dealing with this challenge. Military leaders deserve the plaudits they've received for taking action on climate change. The Pentagon's most important contribution lies not in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, however, but in making sure U.S. armed forces are ready for the consequences of global climate change for defense infrastructure and military missions. And in these areas, the Pentagon has a long way to go. Defense infrastructure is a vast network of land and facilities spread across 27 million acres in every state and around the world. That includes training ranges that are crucial for future military readiness, radar sites that monitor threats to the homeland and bases that support ongoing combat operations. As the GAO report noted, some of these installations are already experiencing climate change effects -- facts on the ground the investigators saw for themselves. The consequences could include higher maintenance costs, fewer training days or even a compromised early warning system for attacks on the United States. The department has started to take practical steps to protect this critical $850 billion investment by assessing risks and vulnerabilities in some locations. Better information will help the military adapt to changing conditions, such as by helping officials prioritize maintenance dollars or revise building codes. This does not necessarily mean more spending at the Pentagon, just smarter spending. As for military missions, there are a range of effects to consider. A recent report by a group of retired high-ranking military officers called climate change a ""threat multiplier,"" meaning that although climate change itself may not directly harm U.S. national security, it can worsen or ignite other threats. Volatile weather patterns may mean less access to food, clean water or shelter, for example, which in turn can undermine weak governments, bring simmering popular resentments to a boil or empower terrorists and extremist groups. Although it is difficult to say whether such destabilization will result in new U.S. combat missions, it is important to consider that possibility and more broadly how these dynamics will affect American interests. U.S. forces will also have to adjust to changes in the physical environment, most obviously the opening of new navigable waterways in the Arctic. Indeed, the Pentagon released a new strategy for the Arctic just last year. The most direct consequence for U.S. armed forces will be more military relief missions, such as Operation Damayan, last year's aid to an important U.S. ally, the Philippines. Humanitarian and disaster relief missions will not be limited to overseas locations, either. Fourteen thousand defense personnel responded to Superstorm Sandy, and last year alone, hundreds of National Guard members supported civilian authorities in dealing with everything from floods in Missouri to fires in Colorado to tornadoes in Oklahoma. The Department of Defense deserves credit for the steps it has taken, such as including climate change in its signature strategy, the Quadrennial Defense Review. But the department also needs to do more to incorporate climate change in how it prepares for the future. To be sure, there are many uncertainties involved, but the Department of Defense is used to matching billions of dollars against uncertainties, risks and long timelines, using analytical tools such as scenarios, war gaming and mathematical modeling. Indeed, there may even be new opportunities, such as positive engagement with key partners and allies that need to develop better means for response and resilience to natural disasters. Unfortunately, many military men and women are reluctant to jump into what appears to be a widening partisan gap on this issue. But just as defense professionals would not let differences of political opinion on Iran or the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region stop them from taking prudent steps to plan for the defense implications of both, they should not shy away from climate change. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said last year that ""the effects of climate change ... are far-reaching and unpredictable, demanding our attention and strategic thinking."" As the Department of Defense acts on Hagel's words, it will be a matter of pragmatism, not politics. Hopefully, members of Congress will follow the recommendations of their own watchdog and stop trying to stand in the way of the progress the Pentagon needs to make.

"Oxnard, California (CNN) -- A few years ago, during one of his lowest points, Ronney Jenkins decided to play a game of Russian roulette. He pointed the metal barrel of a gun at his head, he said, as one ominous click followed another. Eventually -- inevitably -- the gun discharged. What followed was both improbable and lucky: The bullet sailed over Jenkins' head and lodged into the wall behind him. ""It's scary. I think about it all the time,"" said Jenkins, 36, wringing his hands as he recalled one of his two suicide attempts. ""The way it happened, it clearly wasn't my time ... it wasn't my time to go."" Jenkins, a former running back and kick return specialist in the National Football League, might look at that episode as something to forget -- except that the same dark thoughts, at times, still overwhelm him. In the 11 years since he retired from the NFL, Jenkins has dealt with serious cognitive issues: a memory that is feeble at best, crushing depression and rage he can neither understand nor predict. Report: Jovan Belcher's body exhumed for brain study . Jenkins believes that innumerable head impacts during his six-year professional career -- and during the decades leading up to the pros -- explain his struggles. He said that he has tried, in vain, to get help from the league and the NFL Players Association, a union representing players. ""I've reached out and I'm not getting too many calls back,"" said Jenkins. The game that changed everything . Jenkins said the beginning of the end for him, cognitively, began in November 2001, when he was tackled during a game between his team, the San Diego Chargers, and the Denver Broncos. At the tail end of that tackle, Jenkins' neck bent so dramatically that the side of his head appeared, for a split second, to lie flat against his chest. At the same time, his head was being burrowed into the ground. After that hit, Jenkins was unconscious for several seconds. When he woke, his memory of who he was or what he had just been doing had vanished, he said. It is unlikely that his brain could have healed from such a traumatic injury, yet he played the following week. ""Players on the other team ... they were not even understanding why I was playing in that game (the next week),"" said Jenkins. ""When you have players from the rival team acting like they're concerned, it must be something."" First Major League Baseball player diagnosed with CTE . With recent NFL rules changes, that scenario is unheard of today. Under the current protocol, if a concussion is even suspected, players are sidelined. But that was not the case in 2001. And, at the time, Jenkins said he felt he needed to play to keep his spot on the team -- and his income flowing. ""It just seems like there's an agenda and our well-being isn't a part of that,"" said Jenkins. ""(The NFL is) changing all these rules and stuff to make it seem like they care but it's not about changing the rules. ""It's about when something happens to your players and at the end of their career you need to take care of those who need to be taken care of."" Slippery cognitive slope . After that horrifying hit, Jenkins played for four more seasons. During that time, memory problems, along with persistent migraines, would nag him. By the time he retired, Jenkins said a more persistent pall hung over him. ""Everything was getting worse,"" said Jenkins. ""My sleep was getting worse, my moods were getting worse. I'd never been that guy to just be angry. I never showed that type of behavior, and it just got worse."" Curtis Richardson, Jenkins' cousin, said he has lately received troubling text messages from Jenkins, where he seems to be threatening harm. In one text, Richardson said, Jenkins told him he was going to ""kill"" someone he was meeting with at the time. ""Ronney was such a mild-mannered person (before), very quiet, very shy,"" said Richardson, who said Jenkins usually calms down after venting via text. ""For him to go from that, being that shy individual, to an individual texting me that he's about to hurt someone, that's where the level of concern really elevates."" Lamar Campbell: Why I'm donating my brain . Before now, Jenkins was understandably reluctant to reveal such intimate details of his emotional life. But he feels that he is on the brink of something terrible. He hears echoes of his own experience in the lives of former players like Dave Duerson, Ray Easterling, and his former teammate and friend, Junior Seau. All three committed suicide and were later diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the dementia-like disease that is associated with repeat concussions. Jenkins believes that he, too, is suffering with CTE -- which is associated with the symptoms he has: memory loss, aggression and depression. ""The depression and the rage,"" said Jenkins. ""That's what I notice most."" Jenkins' self-diagnosis is -- at best -- a guess, since CTE can only be diagnosed after death. But as the behavioral and mental health issues associated with the disease become clearer, former players are emerging to reveal their suspicions the disease is taking hold. Recently, NFL Hall of Fame player Tony Dorsett told CNN that he struggles with memory loss and wildly shifting moods, and that he suspects that CTE is the culprit. ""I look in the mirror and I say, 'Who are you?'"" said Dorsett during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""'What are you becoming?'"" Self-diagnoses among former athletes, and nonathletes with a history of traumatic brain injury, may reflect a simple desire to give a name to what ails them. Realistically, there is more than one neuro-degenerative disease that could explain their symptoms -- not just CTE. ""The problem is, people are diagnosing CTE clinically all over the place,"" said Robert Stern, professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Boston University School of Medicine, in a recent interview. ""There is no framework to make that diagnosis while someone is alive."" Desperate for help . Jenkins found out last year that he is ineligible for the NFL's neuro-cognitive benefit, a program that could have provided him with financial help for living and medical expenses. He questions how someone who cannot think straight, who cannot remember what he was about to do or say from moment to moment, who has inexplicable rage, would not be eligible for help. Seau had brain disease that comes from hits to head, NIH finds . NFL spokesman Greg Aiello acknowledged that Jenkins has reached out to the organization for help, but that -- as of right now -- he is ineligible for disability programs to which he has applied. Aiello provided documentation of Jenkins' failure to establish test validity -- meaning his answers to a battery of questions did not prove neuro-cognitive problems. Jenkins has appealed the decision; the results of his appeal will be revealed by NFL this month. ""They want to help you...when you're already done, when you only remember what you did two seconds ago,"" said Jenkins. ""I don't want to get to that point before somebody wants to help me. Just, you know, give me some help."" NFLPA spokesman George Atallah said that when players need help, in every case, the organization responds quickly to provide support. He did not elaborate. Meanwhile, Jenkins said his symptoms are getting worse. ""It's hard to deal with, it's a hard subject, just not knowing what's wrong with you,"" said Jenkins. ""Not knowing why these things are happening. ""Your mind just goes crazy. And that's just where I'm at right now."" Video: Scan may detect brain disease .

"(CNN) -- Legendary rock saxophonist Clarence Clemons died Saturday of complications from a stroke, bandmate Bruce Springsteen said. He was 69. Clemons had played sax in Springsteen's E Street Band off and on since 1972. ""Clarence lived a wonderful life. He carried within him a love of people that made them love him. He created a wondrous and extended family. He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave everything he had every night he stepped on stage,"" Springsteen said in a statement. ""His loss is immeasurable and we are honored and thankful to have known him and had the opportunity to stand beside him for nearly 40 years. He was my great friend, my partner and with Clarence at my side, my band and I were able to tell a story far deeper than those simply contained in our music. His life, his memory, and his love will live on in that story and in our band."" Clemons played on such classic hits as ""Born to Run"" and ""Thunder Road"" and is widely credited with helping to shape Springsteen's sound. He passed away at a hospital in Palm Beach, Florida, where he had stayed ever since suffering a stroke last Sunday, said a spokesperson for Springsteen and the E Street Band. He was surrounded by members of his family, including his wife, Victoria, according to the spokesperson. Standing at more than 6 feet tall, Clemons was affectionately known as the ""Big Man"" to fans. He published his autobiography ""Big Man: Real Life & Tall Tales"" in 2009 and suffered some health problems in recent years. In addition to his career as a musician, Clemons also worked as an actor, appearing in the TV shows ""The Wire"" and ""The Simpsons"" as well as the films ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and ""New York, New York."" Tributes to the musician began to pour in on Springsteen's Facebook page Saturday night. ""RIP CC, you were the heart and soul of the E Street Band. Thank you for all the music, you got me through some dark days. Blessings on your journey,"" one post read. ""I just can't imagine that space on stage not being occupied by the big man. We are all better people having been moved by your huge music. Now go play with Louis, Miles and the rest and have a blast,"" read another.

"(CNN) -- Hunger strikes marked the start of the Hong Kong school year as students, parents, and teachers protested against what they perceive as Beijing-led interference in the public school curriculum. Thousands of protesters dressed in black gathered outside the government headquarters Monday ahead of a 5:00 p.m. deadline for the government to drop the ""Moral and National Education"" subject or face further protests. Hong Kongers have decried the subject as an attempt to ""brainwash"" impressionable young minds with pro-mainland-Chinese propaganda. Amid no response from the government, the Civil Alliance against National Education -- a coalition of concern groups -- declared that plans were underway to organize city-wide student strikes and teacher boycotts of the subject. Organizers also called for demonstrators to return to the headquarters every evening in a kind of ""Occupy"" movement, adapted from the global protest against socioeconomic injustice. In a tactic uncommon in Hong Kong protests, by Monday evening, 13 protesters had joined a hunger strike outside the government headquarters, initiated by three teenagers Thursday who have since dropped out due to health concerns. Camped in tents, the mix of students, teachers, and scholars have vowed to remain there until the government withdraws the subject. A parent participating in the hunger strike, Linda Wong, told CNN: ""I want to safeguard for my child the environment in Hong Kong in the future, so my son can learn and think independently."" From Taiwan, Tiananmen activist Wang Dan posted on his Weibo microblogging account that he would engage in a 24-hour hunger strike to ""support Hong Kong's opposition movement against educational brainwashing."" While the city's embattled leader, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, stayed clear of Monday's protest, the territory's Chief Secretary Carrie Lam addressed the crowd, urging broad discussion via the government consultation committee. ""There is no topic that the committee cannot discuss with committee members and other parties,"" Lam said. ""After discussions, according to the findings, we can bring independent and pertinent opinions to the government."" Alliance members have previously declined the government's invitation to join the committee. Leung has said that there is a lot of room for compromise between keeping the subject and throwing it out. ""It's very hard for the government to take any concrete action,"" said Waiman Lam, an assistant professor specializing in civil society and social movements at the University of Hong Kong. ""The Hong Kong government is trapped between the Beijing government and the Hong Kong community,"" she explained. ""I think most likely the government will not take any concrete action except reiterating that the officials are ready to talk to the protesters; please join our committee and continue discussions."" The national education issue has been roiling the city for several months, most notably with a mass street protest on July 29 attended by 90,000 people (police cited 32,000), sparked by the dissemination of a set of government guidelines for teaching the subject. Another mass protest took place outside government headquarters on Saturday, where organizers reported 40,000 participants while the police estimated a turnout of 8,100. While the detailed content of the subject has not been determined, guidelines in a booklet called ""The China Model"" distributed to schools by the government's National Education Services Centre in July were widely interpreted as a basis for how the subject would be taught. The contents of the booklet inflamed longstanding fears of Beijing's encroachment into Hong Kong's affairs and freedoms by stating that China's ruling party is ""progressive, selfless and united,"" and ignoring major events such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. The centre has denied accusations that the subject promotes ""brainwashing."" ""Hong Kong's future and China's future are inseparable,"" said centre director Wong Chi Man.""We will never be independent so we should learn to think the same way as China. Teachers should lead our children to think about Hong Kong's future."" ""In the background, there's a huge mistrust between the central government and the Hong Kong population in general,"" said Lam. ""The demonstrations and the concerns about the national education reflect the continuing anxiety of the Hong Kong people toward the mainland's politics and growing influence on Hong Kong affairs,"" echoed Peter Cheung, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Politics and Public Administration, who spoke to CNN after the July 29 protest. The uproar over the national education subject is reflective of anxieties being aggravated by the new government under Leung, which Cheung said ""lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many people."" ""C.Y. Leung without a doubt reflects a much more pro-Beijing background. If the curriculum was introduced by a more neutral administration, the issue may play out differently,"" he said. The subject is due to be introduced this academic year in primary schools and next year in secondary schools. Each has a three-year period in which to roll out the subject in their classrooms. In Hong Kong, primary and secondary schooling comprises twelve years of government-funded education. A survey of more than 600 schools conducted by an alliance member, National Education Parents' Concern Group, found that only six planned to implement the program in the first year. Of the others, 155 said they would introduce it but not in the first year, 118 said they wouldn't introduce it at all and 198 said they hadn't yet decided what to do. Another 181 declined to respond. ""It's the duty of every teacher, practically of every citizen to teach national education,"" said Leung Kee-Cheong, the principal of the Fresh Fish Traders' School, a primary school teaching the subject this school year. ""You should teach your children that they are Chinese, you should teach your children how China has developed, its history and culture. While you are doing this, you can criticize and speak of the good parts and the bad parts."" Lam said it remains to be seen how the protests will escalate and that government action ""will depend on the bargaining power of the opposition."" ""The question in how much social support (the protesters) can draw in,"" Lam said, in regard to whether student strikes can be feasibly carried out. ""If the government doesn't think these secondary students can constitute a political force opposing the government, including the policy itself, then can the students draw sufficient support from the community? So it really depends on the consolidation of the alliance."" ""It seems that among the secondary school students, the extent of mobilization is not limited, but not extensive enough to call for a Hong-Kong-wide school strike,"" she added. ""So I think the government has also done such calculations."" Tim Schwarz and Vivian Kam contributed to the report.","Protesters threatening student strikes, teacher boycotts if government does not drop Chinese civic education subject .

"Washington (CNN) -- Presidential candidates often lack experience in one critical area: foreign policy. But should she run for president in 2016, Hillary Clinton would have more experience on that front than any other potential presidential competitor. With experience, however, comes risk. Growing global crises, some of which have festered since Clinton's time as secretary of state, could turn what is seen as one of her assets into a liability. Unparalleled experience . Of any potential presidential contender, none could match Clinton's experience overseas. Governors are the most disconnected to foreign policy. Those aspiring for higher office often take international trips to learn about issues. Senators and members of Congress, meanwhile, can beef up their foreign policy cred by serving on committees dealing with international affairs, formulating policies and voting on matters of war, peace and which government to support. But none of that compares to the experience of being directly engaged in global events. If Clinton does run -- and win -- it would be quite a departure from modern-day political ascension. She would be the first president since James Buchanan, the 15th president, to previously serve as the country's top diplomat. (Although it was almost a requirement closer to the founding of the country, with five of the first eight presidents being previous secretaries of state.) But Buchanan, who preceded Abraham Lincoln, is considered one of the worst presidents in U.S. history. His failings, however, had nothing to do with his dealings with foreign policy, but with trouble at home over slavery and his reluctance to engage on the issue. An opening . But Clinton's opponents are sure to make her resume a liability, especially if unrest around the world continues. Sometimes excessive experience is a liability, especially in political campaigns. It's easier to talk about what you will do with no record to show than it is to explain what you've done. Republicans will help tell Clinton's story, pointing out contradictions and inconsistencies at every turn. ""It creates an opening for the Republicans,"" said Alex Wong, former director of foreign policy for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential run. Wong said candidates won't win an election on foreign policy but they sure could lose one on it. Before Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Gaza, ISIS gaining ground in Iraq and Syria, Republicans had been homing in on the issue of Benghazi -- the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound that killed four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens -- insisting that Clinton knows more than she is willing to admit and that it was her negligence as secretary of state that led to a dangerous environment for Americans working in Libya. Hillary Clinton: Putin 'bears responsibility' in downing of MH17 . But since international hot spots are flaring, Republicans have more material to work with and more crises at which to point blame. For instance, after an interview with CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on Sunday in which Clinton said she was ""among the most skeptical of Putin during the time"" in the Obama administration, a Republican research organization, America Rising PAC, noted that it's ""too late to hit the 'reset' button on your record with Russia."" During her first months at State, Clinton spearheaded an awkward media event in which she and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev hit a gimmicky reset button to signal a new start to the U.S.-Russia relationship. ""The dilemma she faces is she was either responsible for a failed foreign policy, or she was not influential enough in the administration to right the ship,"" Wong said. But Clinton's supporters are anticipating the onslaught of foreign policy-related attacks. The group Correct the Record, which was created by Clinton supporters to defend her, lists 11 foreign policy-related accomplishments on its website, including helping ""restore America's leadership and standing in the world,"" building a coalition to enact ""the toughest sanctions in Iran's history,"" playing ""an integral role"" in the missile reduction START treaty with Russia, and supporting the raid to kill Osama bin Laden. Correct the Record also says Clinton ""helped avert all-out war in Gaza"" with a cease-fire in 2012. A tricky paradox . But responding to Republican attacks is only one part of Clinton's challenge to protect and defend her record. She is also undertaking the difficult dance of distancing herself from President Barack Obama's policies while promoting her own, especially as Republicans continue to tie Clinton to what they say is Obama's failed foreign policy. Clinton is more hawkish than Obama, but working for a President includes having to put your policy positions aside if they don't agree. With possibly higher political aspirations, Clinton must distinguish her positions from those of her former boss. She wrote a 596-page book to do just that. She used the opportunity to frame the narrative after the events happened, when context and the outcome of her decisions were apparent. Regarding Russia, in her memoir ""Hard Choices,"" she placed herself in a category within the administration that had more modest expectations, which included progress on some priorities ""the reset delivered."" Clinton portrayed her role in negotiations between Israel and Palestinians as a constant broker able to maintain an honest relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as his and Obama's relationship ""continued to deteriorate."" Clinton wrote about phone calls she had with Netanyahu in which they ""argued frequently"" for more than an hour, ""sometimes two."" After failing to extend the freeze on settlement expansion, Clinton wrote, ""I spent much of the rest of 2011 trying to keep the situation from deteriorating from deadlock into disaster. That wasn't easy."" Clinton: Settlement policy my biggest complaint with Israeli government . Now that Israel and the Palestinians are engaged in intense fighting, Clinton promoted her role as secretary of state while defending the President in her interview on CNN. ""I think the President is doing what he can do to try to get a cease-fire and then see whether we can sort out some, you know, longer-term resolution,"" she said. But Aaron David Miller, with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said Clinton's role at State is not necessarily an asset but definitely not a liability. If the world is relatively quiet by the time 2016 rolls around, foreign policy will be at the bottom of most Americans' priority list. Miller said he admires Clinton for her work in difficult circumstances under a president who didn't give her a lot of latitude. He said she was a good secretary of state who improved America's image around the world but that she isn't ""in the category of slam dunk secretaries of state."" ""There is not a foreign policy crisis that is currently ongoing that you can directly blame Hillary Clinton for,"" he said. That doesn't mean her opponents won't try, though. Why many liberals don't trust Hillary Clinton .","Should she run, Clinton will have more foreign policy experience than any potential rival .
GOP will help tell the story, pointing out contradictions and inconsistencies at every turn .

"(CNN) -- A middle-aged woman walked into the emergency room of Phebe Hospital with a fever on the evening of June 23. Phebe was known as one of the best hospitals in rural Liberia, supported by the local government and international religious and academic partners. Phebe was especially known for its high-quality nursing care, serving as a training hospital for nearby Cuttington University, one of the country's few nursing schools. A few hours after arriving in the emergency room, the woman was admitted to the medicine ward with a list of potential infections -- all the usual suspects in Bong County: malaria, typhoid, sepsis. An epidemic had been raging for months in nearby Guinea, but Ebola was not considered as a possible diagnosis. After all, nobody at Phebe had ever seen a patient before with Ebola, and as the axiom goes in medicine, when you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras. Certainly don't start imagining unicorns. The nurse who cared for the woman that night drew her blood and helped her to the toilet to urinate. When the woman began vomiting and soiled her sheets, the nurse cleaned up the mess, as nurses do all over the world every day. For a disease whose transmission depends on the direct contact of one human being with the body fluids of another, Ebola has no better customer than nurses. The other thing about nurses that the virus finds particularly helpful is they tend to work in shifts. Before the week was out, Bong County's first Ebola patient had died, and seven nurses caring for her had fallen ill. Six of them would also die in the coming weeks. The remaining clinical staff, watching their colleagues falling ill all around them, abandoned the hospital. When the patients saw what was happening, those well enough to walk out did just that. Over the ensuing months, the epidemic rippled across Bong. Hundreds of individuals were infected, and perhaps more importantly, basic social institutions also began to collapse. One by one, all three hospitals in the county shut down due to fear of the spread of the virus, followed by most of the primary care clinics. Women were left without midwives to deliver their babies, accident victims without emergency rooms to care with them. Next the primary schools closed, then the secondary schools, and finally Cuttington University. Guilty of Ebola until proven otherwise . Ebola is not just a disease of individuals but also one that infects society's most basic health and social welfare structures. As a disease that afflicts health care institutions, it is perhaps fitting that the most powerful weapon in the fight against Ebola is not a single drug or vaccine but instead a particular type of health care institution: the Ebola Treatment Unit, or ETU. On September 15, I helped International Medical Corps open the first ETU in Bong County. I have worked in many hospitals, both rich and poor, and have set up refugee camp clinics and trauma field hospitals in poverty-stricken and war-torn countries. But managing an ETU has been an entirely different experience. The primary goal of a hospital or clinic is to care for patients and, if possible, to save their lives. The primary goal of an ETU is to protect the lives of its staff. The secondary goal is to protect surrounding communities and resuscitate local health care systems by taking patients suspected of having Ebola out of their homes and hospital emergency rooms, breaking the chain of transmission. Caring for patients comes third on the list of priorities, though still remains important. After all, why would people go to an ETU if they did not think there was at least a chance that it would help make them better? During the week before opening our ETU, I can honestly say that I worked harder and slept less than during any other time in my life. The sheer number of details involved in the construction and management of this unique type of health care facility is almost endless. Ebola's $1 billion bill hits Africa's bright economic lights . First, a site had to be chosen, which has been a significant roadblock to the opening of other ETUs. Hospitals tend to be built close to the communities they serve; most communities, however, tend to want their ETU as far away as possible. Our ETU sits in the middle of a forest, 2 kilometers (more than a mile) down a rough dirt road, on the grounds of an old leper colony. Perhaps it is not surprising that the survivors of one of humanity's oldest and most stigmatized diseases would be among the few to welcome a treatment facility for one of the newest stigmatized diseases. Second, the design and infrastructure of the ETU had to be perfected, with separate spaces and wards designating different levels of risk, where staff members would know to take different kinds of precautions. A borehole was drilled and giant tanks erected to mix up the nearly 12,000 liters of chlorine required each day to disinfect the ETU and its staff properly. A giant incinerator was built to burn the vast amounts of infected waste produced by the facility safely. Third, supplies had to be purchased, both the normal kind present in any hospital, such as bed sheets and intravenous fluids, but also the expensive (and increasingly difficult to purchase) personal protective equipment. A single outfit of boots, gloves, suit, mask, hood, goggles and apron costs as much as $90, and at full capacity the ETU might go through 100 outfits a day. Ebola hospital overwhelmed by patients . Finally and most importantly, local staff had to be hired and trained to work in the facility. While a small team of expatriates working with International Medical Corps manages our ETU, more than 90% of the staffing remains local. During the week before opening our facility, I helped organize an intensive training for our first 50 staff members, including physician assistants, nurses, nursing aids, hygienists, sprayers, safety monitors, waste handlers, chlorinators, laundry staff and burial team members, to ensure they knew how to protect their health and the health of their colleagues while working in the ETU. Just 72 hours before our opening day, we had a checklist of almost 50 items, ranging from goggles to gravediggers, that we still needed to be able to begin admitting patients safely to the ETU. The pressure to open the ETU had been building for weeks as the numbers of cases of Ebola in the county began to skyrocket. Somehow, and I'm still not sure how, we made it happen.","Phebe Hospital in rural Liberia was abandoned after first Ebola patient infected staff .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- The last time anyone saw Russel Rebello alive, he was near the stern of the Costa Concordia, helping passengers into rescue boats. But the 33-year-old waiter from India never escaped the doomed cruise ship. And he's the only victim of the 2012 shipwreck whose remains haven't been found. Investigators hope that could change soon. A complicated operation to refloat the ship gives them a chance to begin a new search for Rebello. By midday Monday, the ship was floating again, Costa Crociere CEO Michael Thamm said. Salvage crews began the arduous task of refloating the ship on Monday morning so they can move it to the Italian port of Genoa to be dismantled. It's been more than 2Â½ years since the ship ran aground off Italy's Giglio Island with more than 4,200 passengers aboard, killing 32 people in a disaster that drew global attention. And it's been 10 months since salvage teams rolled the 114,000-ton vessel off the rocks in one of the most complex shipwreck recovery efforts ever undertaken. But there's still more work to be done. ""We are not at the end, but we are at a critical moment,"" Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli told reporters. For 10 months, engineers have been hard at work, attaching metal boxes to either side of the ship. After draining water from the boxes, they had to pump compressed air into its place to get the ship to float. It was a dangerous and tricky procedure. The ship is rotting, and there's a real risk the bottom of it could give way. By lunchtime Monday, the ship had been moved 20 meters (about 66 feet) as part of an initial 30-meter (98-feet) shift to the east. The shift dramatically changed the appearance of the wreck from land. After 30 meters, the ship will be anchored and operations will cease for Monday. On Tuesday, five steel hollow boxes, or sponsons, will be lowered, and divers will begin attaching more chains and cables to help reinforce the bottom of the boat. Once that's done they'll raise the ship deck by deck, clearing any debris along the way. After the ship is completely floated, a convoy of 10 boats will then begin a potentially treacherous journey. The ship will be towed -- slowly and carefully -- 240 kilometers (150 miles) to Genoa. Italian Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti told the media that the operation marked the closure of a dark moment in Italy. He said it would have been too dangerous to leave the Costa Concordia in the same position for another year. ""We could have dismantled the Concordia in situ, but they chose to take the more expensive, riskier route to tow it away to save the environment of Giglio,"" Galletti said. Officials said it's likely the towing process won't start for days due to port restrictions. It will take five to six days for the ship to reach Genoa, officials said. Thamm, the CEO, called the operation ""the most daunting salvage ever attempted on a ship of its size."" He added that the cost of the project has already exceeded 1 billion euros -- not including the refloat, the anticipated transport to Genoa or the dismantling. Since the wreck two years ago, 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture, dishes, food, personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed. While salvage crews continue efforts to deal with the wreckage, Francesco Schettino, the ship's captain, is on trial on charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. He denies wrongdoing. Search teams thought they had found Rebello's remains in October. But the body divers found turned out to be that of Maria Grazia Trecarichi, a Sicilian who was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17-year-old daughter, who survived. In a Facebook post, brother Kevin Rebello said he was watching the latest salvage operation live online, since he couldn't make it to Giglio. ""I strongly believe that they will find the body of my dear brother,"" he said. Nine things to know about the plan to salvage the Costa Concordia .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Gulf may still be booming but inflation - and skyrocketing prices - is making life tough for the workforce. Working in the Gulf is less profitable for expatriate workers because of inflation . Many expats initially drawn by the region's tax-free salaries and high standard of living are now feeling the effects of inflation in high rent and living costs. All this is making work in Dubai, Qatar and the surrounding countries a less attractive proposition than it was a few years ago. ""The working population here is growing restless and the reasons are obvious,"" said David Westley, Editorial Director at ArabianBusiness.com. ""Inflation has become a real issue across the region... salaries have risen but they haven't risen as fast as inflation, which in real terms means you've had a pay cut,"" he continued. This means workers are finding it harder to save money and are experiencing a decrease in their standard of living. Add to that a lack of key social infrastructure like schools and some of the major incentives for people to stay in the region are disappearing. ArabianBusiness.com recently conducted an online survey which found that more than two thirds of workers who responded were more inclined to look for another job this year than in 2007. With the Gulf's economic explosion largely dependent on a combination of skilled and unskilled expatriates -- 20 percent of the workforce in some parts of the region -- there is the added worry that increasingly dissatisfied workers could start looking for jobs in other parts of the world. A lack of indigenous workers who can lead the complex infrastructure projects currently being undertaken in the Gulf is already a problem, and a mass exodus of disenchanted expatriates would have serious knock on effects for business in the region. The problems of inflation and keeping experienced workers in the region are intimately connected, according to Richard Thompson, Editor of the Middle East Economic Digest. ""Probably the top two issues for the Gulf at the moment are a skills shortage and inflation and they're two sides of the same coin. The economy has grown too fast ... and that has delivered inflation. The other aspect of that growth is the need to bring in and recruit skills to deliver infrastructure projects,"" he said. And tougher conditions also mean that it could be harder to continue attracting workers from other parts of the world to the region. But workers in the Gulf are not completely motivated by financial concerns, according the the ArabianBusiness.com survey. It found that while salary is an extremely important motivating factor for employees -- 33 percent of survey respondents said money was their key concern -- it is not the only consideration. For the majority of workers, opportunities for promotion -- which remain a strong incentive in the Gulf's vibrant market -- are the single most important condition for staying in a job, according to Wetly. ""One of the things [companies] should try to do is to encourage an environment where you think you can get somewhere. That way you don't have to rely on just handing out the money to get people to stay in your organization,"" he said. Pressure is also mounting on governments to find solutions to inflation. ""If governments depend on expats, then how are you going to train and recruit and develop the local work force? So there is a dichotomy for governments here they have to think for the long term to keep the boom growing,"" said Thompson. There are a number of initiatives being talked about, ranging from proposals to set a minimum wage to governments setting rent caps on property prices. ""We're beginning to hear an increasing amount of businesses calling for a more managed approach to the economic boom particularly on the implementation of infrastructure projects,"" Thompson explained. ""Growing economies such as Abu Dhabi are learning from Dubai's mistakes and looking to a much more structured, strategic approach to development,"" he continued. Wetly believes many of the region's problems are short to medium term -- like expensive housing which will resolve itself by 2010 when more accommodation comes onto the market quenching demand and therefore reducing prices. He is convinced huge growth and an exciting environment will continue to bring expatriate workers to the Gulf. ""Walk around ... Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Doha, Qatar and you find these cities buzzing and for many people that is the most important thing, so I think you will always find people coming here,"" said Westley, ""This region needs expatriate workers just as much as expatriate workers need this market. And I think that's ultimately the truth.""  E-mail to a friend .","Inflation and skyrocketing prices in Gulf making life tough for workers .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Andy Shallal's small business is a rare success in a sea of hard-luck stories. The owner of several popular bookstore cafes, called ""Busboys and Poets"" in the Washington area, Shallal said his annual revenue tops $14 million. But the success hasn't persuaded his bank to give him the loan he wants to expand two of his stores and add 40 employees. Shallal said the only way his bank would lend him money was if he used his home as collateral. ""I want to have a loan that's really a business loan that's going to use my business as collateral,"" Shallal told CNN. ""And I was told no, in these economic times it's very difficult for banks to give money this way."" Small-business owners across the country have voiced similar frustrations, complaining that -- despite billions of taxpayer dollars in relief funds and exhortations from lawmakers to help Main Street -- banks are still holding back on loans. President Obama will tackle the issue Monday when he meets with bank leaders to discuss upcoming financial regulatory reform. He is expected to push banks to increase small-business lending, along with a host of other reforms to the industry. But industry analysts say the liquidity problem won't be easily solved. One small-business expert said stricter government regulations have pulled banks in two directions. ""The banks are going to say, 'Look, it's not like we don't want to lend, it's that we're constrained from lending as a result of the new focus and the new attention from the crisis,"" said Anne Mathias, an analyst with Concept Capital. ""[They will say] 'the regulators are telling us you need to be more careful, you need to have more capital, your capital needs to be more liquid.' "" Scott Talbott, who represents some of the country's largest financial firms at Financial Services Roundtable, said banks are still lending, but they've gotten more wary of potential risk. ""You've seen an increase or a tightening of the credit standards,"" Talbott said. ""So banks are cautious now about lending in terms of who our borrower is. We're looking to make good, solid loans that can be repaid.""

"(CNN) -- A Duluth, Minnesota, police officer will face criminal charges for, as a video shows, beating up a man in a detox facility last month, the city's police department said Thursday. Shawn Reed, the independent counsel looking into the case, decided Thursday to press charges against Officer Richard Jouppi, according to a news release from Duluth police. Jouppi will face counts of fifth-degree assault and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. The officer's attorney, Frederic Bruno, defended his clients' actions as ""100%"" justified. According to a police report written by Jouppi, officers responded on September 21 to transport a man -- later identified as Anthony Jackson -- who witnesses described as being ""extremely intoxicated (and) in two fights tonight."" Duluth police spokesman Jim Hansen said last Friday that officers had gone to a halfway house because Jackson had violated its no-drinking policy. Jackson was brought to the Duluth Detoxification Center ""without incident,"" though once there the police report indicates he exchanged ""unpleasant remarks"" with a female staff member. Security camera footage, later released to media, shows Jackson in a room sitting in a wheelchair trying to take off his coat. He stands up, trying to remove his jacket, when the police officer -- Jouppi, who had been standing by the door -- arrives and pins Jackson's arm behind his head, pushing him back. The video shows Jackson pawing once at the police officer's face, as his other arm is pinned back. Jouppi responds with five punches to Jackson's head, then grabs him by the neck and pulls him off his wheelchair and onto the floor. ""I controlled his right arm at the elbow in order to prevent Jackson from falling through with his threat to strike (a) staff member,"" Jouppi wrote in the police report. ""I sought to take Jackson into custody and delivered two strikes to Jackson's face, as it was the only target presented to me at the time and in order to keep him from delivering more strikes I flipped the wheelchair ... which brought Jackson's back down to the ground."" Jackson was booked on charged of felony assault and later released, Hansen said. But those charges have since been dropped, according to Ernie Swartout, records manager for the Duluth police department -- a move that Jouppi's lawyer said was ""expected"" and ""is pandering to the public."" Division Deputy Chief Mike Tusken told reporters last Friday that police had since visited Jackson ""to reassure (him) that we are taking this seriously and just give him an update that we're doing an investigation on the matter."" The police official also confirmed that Jouppi has been accused in other incidents. ""It is not the first time there have been complaints on the officer,"" Tusken said. Jouppi's attorney described the charges facing his client, even though misdemeanors, as ""disturbing"" and unwarranted. ""It is a black-and-white case,"" Bruno said, adding there is no chance his client will settle. The attorney asserts that Jackson ""clearly stands up in the video and strikes the police officer.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Portions of a taxpayer-funded $2.1 billion Pentagon contract to truck supplies  to U.S. troops in Afghanistan are being indirectly paid  to Afghan insurgents and corrupt public officials as protection money,  a congressional investigation revealed. The U.S military outsources  much of the security for truck convoys carrying food, water, equipment, fuel and  ammunition to remote and dangerous areas in Afghanistan, and those contractors  hire local Afghans who pay bribes for safe passage, according to investigators. ""United States tax dollars are feeding a  protection racket in Afghanistan that would make Tony  Soprano proud,"" Rep. John Tierney, D-Massachusetts, said Tuesday, referring to  an organized crime boss in the popular TV show ""The Sopranos."" Tierney make the  remark at a hearing on the issue the National Security Subcommittee of the House  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. ""This contract appears to  have fueled warlordism, extortion, corruption, and maybe even funded the enemy,""  said Tierney, who is chairman of the subcommittee. The hearing comes shortly  after the release of a 79-page congressional report that details findings  ranging ""from sobering to shocking,"" Tierney said in the report's introduction. CNN reported on Monday that  the military is also investigating the issue. The results of the six-month  investigation indicate that outsourcing the Afghanistan supply chain to  contractors has resulted in ""significant unintended consequences, fueling  warlordism, extortion, and corruption, and it may be a significant source of  funding for insurgents,"" the report's  executive summary said. ""In other words, the  logistics contract has an outsized strategic impact on U.S. objectives in Afghanistan,"" the report said. Investigators found that  Department of Defense ""has been largely blind to the potential strategic  consequences of its supply-chain contingency contracting,"" and that the  U.S. military has little  understanding of how the security is provided. When contractors reported to  the Defense Department that they were being extorted by warlords for protection payments for  safe passage and that these payments were ""funding the insurgency, they were  largely met with indifference and inaction,"" the report said. The  Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) spokesman, Christopher Grey, said the  CID does have an investigation on ""host-nation trucking"" underway but he would  not discuss details. The ""Afghan Host Nation Trucking"" contract in question stipulates that the prime contractors are  responsible for the safe passage of the cargo that they carry. Most contractors  subcontract, hiring local Afghans for armed protection of the convoys  transporting supplies. The manager of the largest  private security provider, Watan Risk Management, said he  complained to U.S. military officials that his  company had to pay bribes ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 monthly to Afghan  governors, police chiefs, and local military officials whose territory the  convoys traversed. Defense Department officials confirmed they were aware of the bribes,  according to the report. The private security  companies that protect the convoys regularly encounter armed conflict  with alleged insurgents and other criminal elements, the report says, and  hundreds of security providers are killed annually. One key convoy security  commander in Afghanistan told investigators he  spent $1.5 million on ammunition per month to protect his convoy trucks. Investigators found no  direct evidence of payoffs to the Taliban, but many military officials  overseeing the contract believed that the Taliban did receive protection  payments, based on information provided to them by contractor representatives,  the report said. Since mid-2009, contractors  have completed over 40,000 missions, subcommittee statistics show. Congressional  members at Tuesday's hearing pressed  witnesses for answers as to how the practice is allowed to continue. Gary  Motsek, assistant deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Program Support, and who is involved with Defense Department acquisition and logistics, acknowledged  the members' frustrations that  changes in the current conditions aren't happening quickly enough. But he said improvements  won't happen  overnight. ""I assure  you we're taking it all seriously,""  Motsek said. ""But if I was a cop on the other side, I would say, 'Damn it, I'm doing what I can with what I  got."" Moshe Schwartz, a specialist in defense acquisition, said that for those who  believe the U.S. military shouldn't be  using outside contractors, ""the solutions include increasing the size of the  military, rethinking current force structure, or choosing not to engage in  certain contingency operations."" Addressing  those who believe that the problem  is due to insufficient planning and poor management on the part of the military,  Schwartz said, ""the solution may be to develop an effective strategy for using  PSCs (private security companies),  improving operational planning, and enhancing oversight."" Schwartz  acknowledged that the Defense Department has taken steps to improve its management and  coordination of private contractors, and but warned more needs to be done.","A $2.1 billion Pentagon contract goes for trucking supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- The body of an ""apparent stowaway"" was found in the wheel well of a U.S. Air Force plane that traveled around Africa before returning to an American base in Germany, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday. The deceased ""adolescent black male, possibly of African origin"" turned up during a ""detailed post-flight inspection"" of the C-130 at Ramstein Air Base on Sunday night, according to Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby. The body didn't affect the plane's flight, nor was it visible during ""standard"" inspections before and after flights, he said. Since taking off from Ramstein, the C-130 had stopped in Senegal, Mali, Chad, Tunisia and Italy over an eight-day stretch, said Air Force spokeswoman Erika Stecker. Where and when did the adolescent male get on the plane? Authorities stated Tuesday that they don't know -- though the fact that the aircraft stopped in parts of Africa now dealing with a deadly Ebola outbreak raises cause for concern. The World Health Organization had confirmed more than 800 Ebola cases in West Africa, which includes Senegal and Mali, as of July 23, but suspects there have been many unreported infections and there may be more like 1,200 cases. Kirby said that lab tests of samples taken from the apparent stowaway's body came back negative ""for communicable diseases."" ""The cause of death, as well as the other circumstances surrounding this incident, remains under investigation,"" said the Pentagon spokesman. The C-130 was ""supporting Africa Command operations"" during its various stops, Kirby said. In April: Teen stowaway raises questions about airport security .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A judge on Friday ordered actress Lindsay Lohan to remain in a drug rehabilitation program until January 3 for a probation violation. Lohan acknowledged in a series of Twitter messages in September that she failed the test and has a drug problem. ""Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away over night,"" Lohan wrote. ""I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elden Fox sent Lohan to jail four weeks ago, but another judge overturned the decision to deny the actress bail later that day. Lohan, freed on $300,000 bail after 14 hours in jail, voluntarily checked into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California, three days later. Defense lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley told CNN late Thursday that an online report that Lohan had left rehab was ""totally untrue."" The Beverly Hills courthouse has been the scene of several Lohan appearances over the past year related to violations of her probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction. In July, Judge Marsha Revel ordered the actress to serve 90 days in jail and 90 days in rehab for violating her probation. The sheriff released her from jail after just 13 days because of overcrowding, and her rehab stint at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center ended after 23 days. ""She has learned her lesson,"" Holley told Fox as the judge agreed to let her out of rehab early on August 25. Fox allowed Lohan to live in her West Hollywood, California, home as long as she followed a new set of rules, including regular drug testing. If she was successful for just 67 days, her supervised probation would end, he said. ""She's very serious about her sobriety,"" Holley said. ""She looks forward to proving to the court that she is taking this seriously."" However, Lohan failed a drug test less than a month later, triggering Friday's probation violation hearing. Lohan's legal troubles began when she was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident, she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills, California. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu, California, drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica, California, police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap.""","NEW: Lindsay Lohan ordered to remain in drug rehab program .

"(CNN) -- As a little girl, Catherine Corless was always curious about the St. Mary's Mother and Baby Home in her hometown of Tuam, in County Galway, Ireland. She wondered what happened inside the stone walls of the home for unwed mothers and babies run by the Catholic sisters of Bon Secours. Decades later, as a local historian, she asked the Tuam registry office for the death records of children at the home from 1925 until its closure in 1961. She was horrified at what came back. ""Hundreds of names. I just couldn't believe it,"" Corless said in an interview with CNN. ""796 names in all. And I wanted to know who these children were."" That simple act of historical research sparked a nationwide outcry -- and now a government investigation -- into the conditions inside Ireland's mother-and-baby homes that existed as recently as the 1980s. Corless' research raised several disturbing questions, including: How did the children die and what were the conditions inside the home? And, most important, for Corless, where were the children buried? Corless says she asked Bon Secours for burial records but was told that none existed. She says her efforts to find burial records at local government archives also turned up empty. She then cross-referenced the death records with local cemetery records but only found two of the children buried nearby. ""I cannot understand why there isn't a burial record for 796 little precious children,"" she said. But Corless now believes she knows where the children may be buried: on the site of the former Tuam home, now part of a housing estate. All that is left of the home is a crumbling stone wall. But in an easily overlooked corner, there is a small walled garden dedicated to ""those who are buried here."" It's been known as The Children's Graveyard ever since 1975, when two boys playing in the neighborhood broke open a concrete slab and made a grisly discovery. One of them, Francis Hopkins, was 12-years old. ""We found a load of skeletons that were clearly that of children."" Francis told CNN, ""We were so frightened, we ran out and our parents told us not to go down there. The priest came to say a blessing and a few days later it was covered up again. And as far as we knew we called it a graveyard since then."" Corless believes this small plot may be where at least some of the children are buried. It was once a disused sewage tank at the edge of the property to the Tuam home. ""If the children were not buried there and there are no burial records,"" says Corless, ""then we need to find out: where are they?"" During her research, Corless also found a 1947 state inspection report on the home. She showed it to CNN. There are several descriptions of ""emaciated"" children in the report. One child is described as so thin that ""flesh hanged loosely from limbs."" The vast majority of the deaths are under the age of one but children as old as nine are also recorded. Causes of death included measles, meningitis and whooping cough. During the worst years, particularly 1946 and 1947, several children were dying every month, sometimes even two in one day. CNN contacted representatives of the sisters of Bon Secours and asked them about the conditions inside the home and the children who died. In a statement they told CNN: . ""The Sisters of Bon Secours today said they were shocked and deeply saddened by recent reports about St. Mary's Mother and Baby Home, which operated in Tuam, County Galway from 1925 to 1961. In 1961 the Home was closed. All records were returned to the local authority, and would now be within the Health Service Executive, Co. Galway. The Bon Secours Sisters are committed to engaging with Catherine Corless, the Graveyard Committee and the local residents as constructively as they can on the graves initiative connected with the site. The Sisters welcome the recent Government announcement to initiate an investigation, in an effort to establish the full truth of what happened."" The Tuam case is the latest in a string of issues linked to Ireland's former mother-and-baby homes, funded by the state but run by various religious orders. The government has now promised to investigate the many allegations, including forced separations, illegal adoptions, and claims that children were subjected to vaccine trials without parental consent. Specifically citing the work of Corless, the Irish government is also considering whether to excavate the possible burial site at Tuam. ""If this is not handled properly then Ireland's soul will be, like babies of so many of these mothers, in an unmarked grave,"" said Ireland's Prime Minister, Enda Kenny. Corless says she will continue to dig for more records of the home in Tuam but she doesn't necessarily want the site to be excavated. More important, she says, is erecting a memorial for the children-- if they are indeed buried there. ""The least they might have is a name over them,"" she told CNN. ""Those illegitimate children need to be respected as much as any other child born. It might bring some justice and maybe healing to those mothers and families.""","The Irish government will look into conditions inside Ireland's mother-and-baby homes .

"(CNN) -- Chances are, you know someone whose child has been diagnosed with attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder. Perhaps you've received that news about yourself or your own child. In many cases, it's a legitimate issue and can require medication, therapy or both. But in my experience, ADHD is sometimes a diagnosis that can be mistakenly given based on a pattern of behavior, without appropriate understanding of the underlying biology. For many children, particularly those in low-income communities, their behavior issues are not really about underactivity of the brain's attentive function, the hallmark of ADHD. Rather, behavior is just one outward sign of a more significant health threat that doctors are just beginning to understand: toxic stress. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the term ""toxic stress"" describes the disruption in brain architecture and other developing organ systems that occur when a child is exposed to strong, frequent or prolonged adversity. Unlike ADHD, toxic stress involves many systems of the body and is characterized by a dramatic increase in stress-related disease and cognitive impairment. I observe its effects every day as a pediatrician working in one of San Francisco's poorest neighborhoods. We want to prevent, screen and heal those who come under toxic stress. It can begin in infancy . When we think of the emotional life of a baby, we often reduce the child's feelings to the way he behaves around a few daily activities. We hear an infant cry when he needs to eat or sleep or when he feels uncomfortable. Most caretakers tune in and attend to those needs. But an infant's well-being is not just about food, rest and diapers. There's a lot more going on inside a baby's brain and body that we can nurture. Early childhood is a time of dramatic development of the brain and other organ systems. Children's brains rapidly adapt to the environment around them, for better or worse. During the critical developmental years, between birth and age 4, some children experience high anxiety or fear because their home or neighborhood environments are unsafe. They're subject or witness to physical or emotional abuse, community violence or even extreme poverty. This trauma can have a tremendous impact on a child's brain development, as well as the development of their immune system, their hormone systems and even the way their DNA is read and transcribed. Toxic stress is not typical stress . Although we all experience some stress growing up -- and some stress actually helps a child learn to navigate our complex world -- repeated ""adverse childhood experiences"" can activate the body's stress response system. That's called ""toxic"" stress, and it can affect the way the brain and body develop. Adverse childhood experiences activate the same kind of ""fight-or-flight"" response you'd experience if, say, you were walking in the forest and you came face-to-face with a bear. Immediately, the body releases stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol that trigger your heart to pound and raise your blood pressure so that you can either fight the bear or run away. Chronic stress leads to frequent triggering of this chemical response, and that can be harmful to a child's development long-term. The groundbreaking study in this area, published in 1998, found that a person with four or more adverse childhood experiences had 2.6 times the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with someone with no such experiences. Adverse childhood experiences also heighten the chance of obesity, stroke, cancer, asthma and diabetes, and multiply the risk of hepatitis, depression and heart disease. Other researchers have found that individuals exposed to high doses of adversity in childhood have increased markers of inflammation in their blood in adulthood and long-term changes in levels of stress hormones like cortisol. A caregiver is a child's best buffer . Even in an atmosphere where stress is frequent and not controllable, a young child's parent or caregiver is the best shield against the effects of toxic stress. When a caregiver is able help the child makes sense of the world, manage difficult feelings and develop healthy coping skills, toxic stress can be prevented. The quality of a caregiver's interaction with a child is a key building block for healthy emotional, social and physical development. Some of the best ways to support a child's health and development involve simple things like talking, laughing, taking time to play with a child one-on-one and just slowing down to spend time together. This is why I am so proud to be a part of Too Small to Fail, a joint initiative between Next Generation and the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This initiative is focused on helping parents and caregivers understand that everyday interactions with children -- even if seemingly small, like enjoying a good book or a laugh with a child -- can protect their health and well-being. Poverty and adversity don't have to be a prescription for lifelong poor health. With strong bonds established in the early years, parents can positively impact their children's lives and help them build a strong foundation for success.","Nadine Harris: Some kids have ""toxic stress"" and not attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder .

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A British couple convicted for having sex on a public beach in Dubai will not face jail after a judge suspended their prison sentences, their lawyer said Tuesday. File image of one of the co-accused -- Vince Acors -- arriving at court in Dubai in September. The couple, Michelle Palmer and Vincent Acors, had faced a three-month sentence, but they were freed on bail in October pending an appeal. Hassan Mattar, one of their lawyers, said he was trying to get permission for Palmer -- who worked in Dubai -- to stay in the United Arab Emirates, and for Acors to travel back to Britain. Acors had been on a business trip to Dubai when he was arrested. The United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, is home to thousands of expatriates and is among the most moderate Gulf states. Still, the oil-rich kingdom adheres to certain Islamic rules. Palmer and Acors were arrested on a public beach shortly after midnight on July 5. Police charged them with illicit relations, public indecency, and public intoxication. A court found them guilty in October and fined them 1,000 dirhams ($367) for the charge of public indecency. Both denied they had intercourse. And during the trial, Mattar argued that the public prosecutor failed to produce corroborative evidence against his clients on the first two charges, though he said both tested positive for liquor. More than a million British visitors traveled to the UAE in 2006, and more than 100,000 British nationals live there, according to the British Foreign Office. The country is in the midst of a building boom to position itself as one of the world's premier tourist destinations. It is already home to the world's largest mall, the world's largest tower, and -- despite being in the Middle East -- the largest indoor snow park in the world. -- CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","The couple, Michelle Palmer and Vincent Acors, faced three-month sentence .

"(CNN) -- The images are all too familiar. Young protesters, disenfranchised and frustrated, take to the streets to fight a government that is ignoring their demands. At first peaceful, the protests are met with the heavy hand of riot police. Photographs of resilient demonstrators -- some standing obstinate amid the clouds of tear gas, others covered in pepper spray -- flood the Internet. But what is surprising about this week's images is that they come from Hong Kong, one of Asia's financial hubs and a territory known for its stability. The impetus for these pro-democracy protests, started by a student boycott of classes and joined by the group Occupy Central with Love and Peace, was the Chinese government's pronouncement that the selection of candidates in Hong Kong's election in 2017 would be limited by a pro-Beijing committee, a move that would ostensibly prevent a leader resistant to Beijing's influence from coming to power. Such an arrangement follows the letter of the Basic Law, which codified the policy of ""one country, two systems,"" as well as a 2007 decree by the National People's Congress that promised universal suffrage in 2017, but hardly their spirit. It is therefore no surprise that the signs have long seemed to point to an eventual clash of perspective. Hong Kong was returned to mainland China from the British Commonwealth in 1997, its institutions grounded in Western and democratic thought. Hong Kong's economic freedoms and openness draws in companies and individuals from around the globe, further perpetuating the territory's ties to the outside world. On the other side of the coin is Beijing, well known for its opposition to the open flow of information and the Western concept of democracy. Hong Kong protests: What you need to know . Both sides have demonstrated restraint, with the protesters remaining largely peaceful and the government pulling back riot police after a day of aggressive crowd control tactics. Moreover, it is in the interest of both parties to maintain a low level of intensity. Violent escalation by the Occupy Central movement would only justify an equally violent response, and international condemnation and domestic anger would follow hostile action by the police. That said, in a meeting with Hong Kong's business elite, Chinese President Xi Jinping asserted that Beijing will not yield. The Chinese government is aggressively censoring posts on Weibo, a popular social media site -- censored posts reportedly increased five-fold over the weekend, and ""Hong Kong"" is now the most widely deleted search term on the social media site -- and Instagram was blocked for the first time in Hong Kong. In the meantime, the Occupy Central movement has already achieved much by bringing greater attention to Hong Kong's struggle for democracy. As the removal of riot police reveals, the international presence in Hong Kong means that Beijing does not have the same freedom of action as it does on the mainland. In China, demonstrations against issues such as pollution, corruption and forced land seizures are common and under-reported, caught behind the government's Great Firewall. But it is harder for the world to ignore the comprehensive and detailed reports emanating from Hong Kong. With their actions, the Hong Kong citizens are assembling the pieces for greater civil and political participation in not only Hong Kong but also mainland China. The possible financial ramifications of the Occupy Central movement could cause Beijing to seek a quick conclusion to the demonstrations. After all, with traffic bottlenecked by protesters, business as usual in one of Asia's financial hubs and China's financial center is in question. A number of banks reportedly temporarily closed some of their branches and asked employees to work from home. Investors, too, are waiting to see the outcome of the protests in Hong Kong before continuing projects. Should the demonstrations linger, Beijing might therefore need to reassess its tactics -- though this could result in an even more aggressive crackdown. The road ahead will not be easy. Xi and the Communist Party are unlikely to shift from the short-term tactic of censorship and suppression. The leaders and participants of the Occupy Central movement risk arrest and censure in a territory and country that values stability above all. But they are carving out a space for civil and political participation throughout Greater China. In the end, such participation will improve both China's governance and the lives of its people. Now if only Beijing can get out of its own way. From umbrella protests to 'umbrella revolution'","Hong Kong was returned to mainland China from the British Commonwealth in 1997 .

"Hurlburt Field, Florida (CNN) -- An Air Force CV-22 Osprey crashed Wednesday during a routine training mission north of Navarre, Florida, injuring five crew members aboard, a military official said. The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The five injured crew members were taken to an area hospital, Nicholson said. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known. The cause of the accident is under investigation, she said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two crashes -- one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers, and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered on the Osprey, and it resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006. They were first deployed by the Marines in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development. 'Conclusive evidence' that F-22 pilot over Alaska did not survive training mission crash .

The gun fires two types of portals that allow the player to get to hard-to-reach places. Not every surface can be used as a portal, so proper selection of targets is key to advancing in the game. The Weighted Storage Cube and Companion Cube, a small box with hearts on the side, are back to help with weighted triggers. There are also Redirection Cubes that contain lenses to deflect laser beams, or Thermal Discouragement Beams as they are called in the game's deliciously ominous double-speak. The puzzles require logical thinking and are smartly done. If you didn't play the first game, ""Portal 2"" does start with some basic puzzles to help you understand how the game's physics, mechanics and portals work. But the difficulty ramps up quickly after a few test rooms. There are some new elements to help work out the puzzles. ""Aerial Faith Plates"" launch you and other objects around the room and often help in adding momentum, which is sometimes critical to get to hard-to-reach places without a portal. Liquid gels become available later in the game; they provide some useful abilities. A blue gel helps Chell bounce, and an orange gel boosts her speed. A white gel can be used to cover walls or floors that normally can't be used as portals, allowing one to be created. There are puzzles that will require one, two or all three gels to complete. All of these additions to the puzzle-solving make for a very intelligent game. It is often best when entering a new room to stop, take a look around and analyze the scene. Be sure to look in all directions, because the way out may force to you to go in a different direction than the obvious one. The story is fantastic, and the writing and dialogue remain one of the cornerstones to this series. GLaDOS's voice is dripping with sarcasm and malice even as her tone remains soothing and calm. Wheatley is silly, frantic and almost childlike. The humor remains dark and dangerous, as it was in ""Portal."" GLaDOS often lies about pressing concerns or dangers, then admits her lie and seems to revel in the deception. Without giving away any story spoilers, the game is pretty much divided into three parts and introduces the CEO and founder of Aperture Science, Cave Johnson. Johnson was heard in promotional videos for the game and has a sarcastic, shoot-from-the-hip attitude that just adds to the great dialogue found throughout ""Portal 2."" The single-player version takes about six to eight hours to play depending on how fast you can solve the mind-bending puzzles. But the action doesn't stop there. ""Portal 2"" offers a co-op version for two players, each operating a robot with a portal gun. GLaDOS puts Blue and Orange, the two bots, through test rooms much like Chell had to experience. It is truly a cooperative game that can't be mastered by just one person. The puzzles are more complex, since they do require cooperation, but the devices and mechanics remain the same as in single-player mode. Orange and Blue can communicate by using indicators to suggest what needs to be moved or where a portal should go. They can also gesture to one another for a wave, a hug or even a high-five after a job well done. A random partner can be found online, but it is infinitely more enjoyable to play with someone in the same room or with a friend. These puzzles can take some time to solve if you've never seen them before, and a friend might be more willing to cut you some slack as you analyze your options. There is no drop-in or drop-out during co-op play. If one player leaves the game, the session is disconnected, creating another reason to play with someone you know. GLaDOS keeps up the sarcasm but, if possible, shows even less empathy for the robots. Her dialogue, of course, remains funny and brutal. Xbox 360 players can play each other across the Xbox LIVE network. Steam, the online gaming platform, is supported on the PlayStation 3 as well as PC and Mac computers, so players on those platforms also can play co-op with one another. ""Portal 2"" was released Tuesday morning, although a Steam promotion gave gamers the chance to play the game Monday night by purchasing a package of independently produced games. Overall, ""Portal 2"" is a sublime game from start to finish, with humor, wit, intelligence and drama carried over from the debut title. The action remains fresh and original, and the dialogue spurs spontaneous laughter even in the deadliest situations. And in case you were wondering ...  there is no cake. ""Portal 2"" is available now for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and Mac. The game is rated E10+ due to fantasy violence and mild language. This review was done playing the single-player version on Xbox 360 and the co-op version on PS3 and PC (through Steam).","The dark humor and tricky puzzles are back from the original, as is the twisted GLaDOS .

"(CNN) -- Hugely successful and often controversial, Glenn Beck is a man full of complexities. He points the finger in his new book ""Cowards"" but calls for ""Restoring Love"" in his upcoming rally. He jokes about being ""Unelectable"" on his comedy tour, but his new studio in Dallas includes a replica Oval Office for his mock presidential addresses. Now, the media mogul is dropping his name from the online TV network based on his personal brand. GBTV will be merged with TheBlaze.com, the Beck-owned but independently operated news and opinion website. The entire network will be called TheBlaze. ""I didn't like the name GBTV from the very beginning for a couple of reasons,"" Beck said in an exclusive interview with CNN.com. ""One, it's a little egocentric, and two, it's television, which doesn't describe necessarily what we do."" Beck and Chris Balfe, president and COO of Mercury Radio Arts (Beck's company), said they planned to change the name once the online streaming network was more established but the early success of GBTV precipitated an earlier name change. The latest estimate is that GBTV has more than 300,000 subscribers. While the numbers are strong, that is still a significant reduction from Beck's nightly audience when he worked at Fox News and talked to millions on the traditional media outlet. ""We are out of the comfort zone for a lot of Americans,"" said Beck of GBTV. The online network that airs Beck's program also has shows such as ""Real News,"" a news roundtable show; ""The B.S. of A,"" a comedy show; ""Liberty Treehouse,"" a children's program; and ""Independence USA,"" a reality show. Much more programming is on the way, and it will soon become a 24/7 channel. TheBlaze.com launched in August 2010 and now claims more than 7 million unique visitors a month. Already before the merger, the Beck empire was increasingly falling under the ""Blaze"" moniker, including a print magazine. ""From a management perspective, what we're doing is bringing together what are the all-stars from both groups into one team,"" said Balfe. That all-star team includes some unlikely executives who have joined the Beck team. There's Betsy Morgan, formerly CEO of The Huffington Post and before that an executive at CBS News. There's Joel Cheatwood, formerly a senior vice president at CNN and Fox News. Also Kraig Kitchin, formerly founder of Premiere Radio Networks, and Carolyn Polke, who was a consultant at Accenture. Another notable part of TheBlaze.com is its clear non-Beckness. ""If you just look at the comments section, there are people who read the Blaze all the time but hate my guts,"" said Beck. But it's more than that -- one of the most memorable and talked about series of articles on TheBlaze.com was a meticulous debunking of the James O'Keefe NPR videos , which claimed to show an NPR executive denigrating the Tea Party, that ran on an Andrew Breitbart-associated website. The series garnered strong praise from places such as long-time Beck nemesis Media Matters. ""Hopefully some of them will discover TheBlaze TV, will discover Glenn's show, and decide that they want to watch,"" said Balfe. ""Others will discover other things on TheBlaze TV which they might like more."" If people were surprised by the takedown of the O'Keefe video, Beck says it's because they don't remember who he was before his Fox News days. ""I think that's people forgetting who I was and what I was saying when I was on CNN before Barack Obama,"" said Beck, who was a Headline News host from 2006 to 2008. ""I was one of the hardest-hitting conservatives on George W. Bush. Republicans didn't like me on George W. Bush. Republicans still don't like me on many things. If any Republican thinks I've been hard on Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich or any of these guys, wait until Mitt Romney gets into office. I'll hold his feet to the fire just as much."" Beck: As we shrink government, grow giving . Of course, it may be the Fox News days that people remember, when he'd assign labels such as fascist, communist and radical to those, mostly on the left, with whom he disagreed, often with the tone of impending doom (and chalkboards). Beck agrees that the polarization and ratcheted-up rhetoric is bad for the country, but was he part of the problem in the first place? ""Nobody ever, ever gives me credit for the times I've said on the air 'the president is right on this, did this right' or 'the media is unfair by trying to say this about the president,' or 'the right is unfair.' I bet I do that at least once a month."" But what about calling Barack Obama a ""coward"" in his new book? ""Sometimes the truth hurts,"" said Beck. ""And if you'd read the book 'Cowards,' you'd see President Obama is not the only one, and it's certainly not a Republican and Democrat book. It is a human problem. Cowardice is a human problem."" While Beck isn't outwardly supporting either of the two major candidates in the 2012 election, he does have a prediction. ""If things would remain stable, I would say we are looking at a loss for the president around the size of, if not greater than, Jimmy Carter,"" he said. ""Americans are tired. They are tired of the finger-pointing. They are tired of the excuses. They're tired of it on both sides."" Beck is someone who constantly talks about truth. TheBlaze.com's tagline is ""the truth has no agenda"" while GBTV currently uses ""the truth lives here."" Explaining his ideology, Beck described it as ""people should be free, people should be unencumbered by regulation as much as possible, that big government always goes corrupt and the truth shall always set you free."" It's this philosophy that seeps into his plans for the independence of the new, merged TheBlaze TV: ""We have to tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may."" Trust comes into play in another area of the Beck empire, arguably where he has his most power and is at his most contentious: radio. Last week it was announced that Beck signed a new five-year deal with Premiere Networks, reportedly estimated at $100 million. Is he worth it? And what is it about the show that makes it worth one the biggest contracts on radio ever? ""The strength of the show is the listeners, and the bond I have with the listeners,"" said Beck. ""They are some of the smartest, unforgiving people. They mean what they say and say what they mean. ... The biggest thing we have going for us is we've always tried to shoot straight with the audience, we've always tried to hold ourselves to our own standards, and part of those standards is we don't waste anyone's time."" With GBTV gone and TheBlaze TV taking over, Beck isn't done. The change is one part of a new plan, which he's dropped some hints about recently, to focus on inserting conservatism into the mainstream cultural landscape. ""A country is made not by policy alone, but by its music, its entertainment shows, all of it,"" said Beck. That plan may get mainstream acceptance like GBTV has. Recently, talent agent Ari Emanuel, certainly not a fan of Beck's politics, praised the network as a ""model"" for the media. It could also face mainstream derision as some of Beck's radio proclamations do, but it likely will get an audience talking. ""Change is not bad,"" said Beck. ""We are on the threshold of something I think is as powerful as the Industrial Revolution was, except this one will happen in a very short period of time. ... Whether we're the ones to [revolutionize media] or we're just the ones who happen to be the first on the scene, I don't know. But we're moving forward because the media revolution has begun."" It's another complexity in the Beck world. While the message is about ""restoring"" conservative values of the past, the delivery model is revolution, and the future.","Glenn Beck's online TV network merging with TheBlaze.com .

"Washington (CNN) -- From one-time participant to present-day activist against the illegal sport of animal fighting, Michael Vick came to Capitol Hill Tuesday in support of legislation that would criminalize spectators and others who organize the fighting. While trying to keep young people from taking part, the legislation more broadly hopes to make it easier to prosecute people who finance and arrange the gambling, provide locations for fights to happen and otherwise have knowledge of the activity. Vick, now a star quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, was released from prison in 2009 after serving 20 months of a sentence for a dogfighting conviction. His case involved bankrolling illicit animal fights in the state of Virginia. ""I deeply regret my previous involvement in dogfighting, I'm sorry for what I did to the animals,"" Vick told a news conference. ""During my time in prison, I told myself I wanted to be part of the solution, not the problem."" He was accompanied by the head of the Humane Society of the United States, Wayne Pacelle, who acknowledged it was initially difficult to consider accepting Vick's offer of help, until he realized Vick could carry some influence. ""The biggest growth area for dogfighting was urban-based dogfighting,"" Pacelle said. ""Michael's own story starting as a young boy getting involved in dogfighting I thought was a very powerful testimonial. ... ""We both agreed that the best thing he could do was speak to these kids because of the platform that he has as an NFL star and to warn them away from this conduct,"" Pacelle said. The House bill, introduced last week, would establish federal misdemeanor penalties against convicted spectators, and make it a felony for adults found responsible for spectators who are children. At the Capitol Hill news conference, organizers played some local television news coverage showing illicit cockfights, including the participants and the surrounding scene. Vick told reporters the video took him right to the problem. ""To see the young kid walking with the cock, you know, was astonishing,"" Vick said. ""It was taking place in a similar setting of what I've been around before. ""This is what our kids are being taught,"" he said, ""and it's inhumane and it's pointless. ""That child could be doing so much more with his life, instead of walking around with a cock in his hand, waiting to fight, even if he's not involved, being there, his presence speaks volumes as to what goes on when people's heads are turned."" The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act (H.R. 2492) was introduced by Reps. Tom Marino, R-Pennsylvania, and Betty Sutton, D-Ohio. Sutton was at the news conference along with Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, who is among the co-sponsors.","Convicted former dogfighting participant Michael Vick wants spectators punished .

"(CNN) -- Think Barack Hussein Obama has it rough campaigning for president with a name like that? The Illinois senator has nothing on Frankenstein Momin. Or Billy Kid Sangma. Or Adolf Lu Hitler Marak. The three men are among dozens of others with equally colorful names who are competing for legislative seats in Meghalaya, a remote northeast Indian state, on March 3. There are about 60 seats up for grabs, 331 candidates vying, and no shortage of unusual names. There's Britainwar Dan, Admiral Sangma and Bombersingh Hynniewta -- all ready for battle. There's Laborious Manik Syiem and Hilarius Pohchen. Boldness Nongrum and Clever Marak. Even a Tony Curtis Lyngdoh. ""It would be unfair to have a laugh at these names. They're reflective of the names here,"" David R. Syiemlieh, professor of history at the North Eastern Hill University in the capital city of Shillong, told CNN on Monday. Meghalaya (""Abode of the Clouds"") is a state of 2.6 million people. It's predominantly Christian -- but hasn't always been. When the indigenous tribes first converted to Christianity, the locals named their children after the missionaries who preached to them. Subsequent generations started favoring words and names they were familiar with but didn't have a good understanding of. ""They may have heard of these names and personalities and it sounded nice to them,"" Syiemlieh (pronounced Same-LEH) said. ""But it doesn't mean that they relate to Hitler or Frankenstein."" The trend lately, however, has been toward a return to more tribal names, he said. Prashant Naik, the chief electoral officer of the state, told CNN that a candidate's name matters little to the electorate -- because so many voters and politicians themselves have peculiar ones. ""You have Australia, you have New Zealand, there's even a Thailand,"" Naik said. ""I don't think that should matter in how people vote."" It certainly hasn't in Hitler Marak's case. He has been elected to public office before, with one of his stints as forestry minister. ""Maybe my parents liked the name and hence christened me Hitler,"" he once told the Hindustan Times newspaper. "" I am happy with my name, although I don't have any dictatorial tendencies.""

"(CNN) -- The Republican presidential primary hasn't exactly overflowed with talent. In December, it was a roll call of the undesirable Right: Romney, Santorum, Gingrich, Paul, Perry, Huntsman and Bachmann -- a list so long and bizarre that Count Dracula could have slipped in on the end and no one would have noticed. Except, as the citizens of Chicago will tell you, the dead always vote Democrat. Now, we're down to a final three, discounting Ron Paul, who, I'm guessing, is only staying in the race to collect air miles. Although the talent pool has shrunk, it has gotten no deeper. As Mitt Romney suffers defeat after defeat at the hands of Rick Santorum, whose chances of winning this thing aren't high, his negatives mount up, and the president looks stronger by the day. The Republican Party is divided and in danger of becoming out of touch. It didn't have to be this way. If Sarah Palin had entered the contest, I'd hypothesize two alternative realities. One, she'd have the nomination sewn up by now. Two, she'd be running even in the polls with the president. What have proved to be problems for the top three candidates wouldn't have been problems for Palin. For starters, she has none of Newt Gingrich's intellectual hubris. There's no way Palin would have promised to put a mine on the moon or suggest arresting judges who make decisions that are too liberal. Her conservatism is far more domestic and down-to-Earth. She's also more disciplined than Santorum. Although we'll probably be talking about them into the next century, Palin's only two serious public gaffes in 2008 happened when she was unable to name a newspaper and was stumped by the Bush doctrine, both slips a product of ignorance. Santorum, on the other hand, is guilty of knowing his own mind all too well, offering unwelcome opinions on everything from the evils of hard-core pornography to the racial politics of the Trayvon Martin tragedy. Compare the response Palin gave to questions about her attitude toward evolution -- ""I think it should be taught as an accepted principle, and I say that also as the daughter of a schoolteacher"" -- with Santorum's claim that Satan ... has attacked America. It's Palin who seems to have a better sense of the limited role that faith should play in politics and a better idea of when to keep her mouth shut. Moreover, she would never tell a journalist that he was talking ""bull***t,"" even if she did congratulate Rick Santorum for doing so. Contrary to the media narrative, even at her most accident-prone, Palin has always been a classy, well-choreographed performer. Lacking the foibles of Gingrich and Santorum, Palin would have been a far more effective anti-Romney candidate because her strengths accentuated Romney's weaknesses. Romney is known as the Etch A Sketch candidate; Palin is aggressively authentic. Romney is seen by many as a moneyed elitist; Palin is the conservative class warrior, happy to slam the ""crony capitalism"" that benefits both big labor and big business. Romney's limitations have been revealed, one by one, in the course of the primary campaign; Palin was well-vetted by the press in 2008 and has nothing left to say or do that would surprise us. Love her or loathe her, we all know who Palin is. Her weaknesses, being old news, wouldn't have dominated the primary narrative like Bain Capital or Seamus the dog, made famous by his terrifying ride atop Romney's car. Palin would have spent the past three months attacking her opponents. Then she would have turned her guns on the president. While it's reasonable to speculate that Palin could have gathered a much stronger anti-Mitt coalition earlier -- and broken out as the GOP front-runner sooner -- it's probably a bigger stretch to say that she would be running stronger against Obama right now. The last national polling done on a hypothetical Palin candidacy was in September, and that showed the president beating her by double digits. Daily Kos did the math and gleefully calculated that Palin would win just seven states in November, and even Mississippi would be a tossup. But those polls asked the public what they thought of a candidate who hadn't declared, who wasn't representing herself in the debates and who was still solely defined by the 2008 race. Guesstimating how well she would have done had she entered the 2012 contest is tough, but considering that at least some polls show both Romney and Santorum within a few points of Obama despite all their problems, it's not unreasonable to presume that Palin would run just as well. Subtract Santorum's gaffes or Romney's elitism, and she might even do a little better. Polls suggest that many voters agree with Romney's approach to the economy but think he lacks empathy for the struggles facing the middle-class. Were she in the race, you can bet your bottom dollar that Palin wouldn't score so low on compassion and authenticity. Most important, Palin has the character and reputation necessary to break out of the Republican Party's demographic prison. In matchups with Obama, Romney's core vote is financially comfortable seniors. He pulls even among all men and folks aged 35-54. The Republicans desperately need a candidate who can appeal to lower-income voters, who can rally men, who can gain women's votes, who can bring out conservatives in large numbers and who can appeal to a younger demographic. All these things happened in the 2010 midterms, when the GOP made inroads into blue-collar households and middle-class suburbs on a policy platform virtually embodied by the Alaskan maverick. The GOP needs a Tea Party candidate -- either Sarah Palin or someone very like her. Alas, it's going to have to wait until 2016 to get its rogue. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: If Sarah Palin were running, she would have the nomination in the bag by now .
He says she lacks problems like Gingrich's hubris, Romney's elitism, Santorum's extremism .

"(CNN) -- Lisa Kudrow is notably normal compared with the kooky roles she's known for playing. Whether it's her 10-season stint as Phoebe Buffay or the fame-starved Valerie Cherish on just one season of ""The Comeback,"" the actress admits a fondness for delusional characters. Since ""Friends"" ended in 2004, Kudrow has developed and appeared in several other shows, and become a producer and writer of her own projects, including ""Web Therapy,"" in which she plays self-obsessed Internet therapist Fiona Wallace. The Showtime series enters its third season on Tuesday, July 23. The new episodes take place solely in online video Skype chats, and will feature a slew of new guest stars, including Steve Carell, Meg Ryan, Billy Crystal and Matt LeBlanc, as Fiona grapples with the ramifications of last season's finale. Kudrow also executive produces the documentary series ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" which premieres the same day on TLC. That show, which traces the ancestry of various celebrities, is an opportunity for Kudrow to dive into her work off-camera as well. The fourth season of the show will feature eight episodes and look into the backgrounds of Kelly Clarkson, Christina Applegate, Zooey Deschanel, Trisha Yearwood, Cindy Crawford, Jim Parsons, Chris O'Donnell and Chelsea Handler. Kudrow invited CNN.com to the offices of her production company, Is or Isn't Entertainment, which she owns with Dan Bucatinsky and Don Roos, to discuss both projects. Sitting in the space's living-room-like conference room, where a massive bulletin board displayed the episode breakdown of this season of ""Web Therapy,"" Kudrow discussed her work on the shows and why fans need to stop waiting for a ""Friends"" movie. CNN: Did you get these two shows to premiere on the same day on purpose? Lisa Kudrow: Isn't that crazy? We don't have that kind of power over TLC and Showtime. I think Showtime changed the date, but I don't think that's why. CNN: Is there one person on ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" this season whose story was most compelling to you? Kudrow: They're all really compelling. That's why we end up shooting them. One of the more different ones we've ever done is Chelsea Handler. Her father is Jewish and her mother is German and they were all raised to be Jewish. Her mother's parents were here from Germany and she grew up with them and knew them really well. Her grandfather was a soldier during World War II who never spoke about it and so she's always wondered. She knew it would be hard. CNN: For those who aren't familiar with ""Web Therapy,"" can you set up the premise? Kudrow: It's a really bad therapist named Fiona Wallace who conducts sessions online only through Skype. Three-minute sessions, because that's all she really wants to do. We end up seeing a lot of her life happen. CNN: When the show began as a Web series, how much of the show's narrative did you have planned out? Kudrow: We certainly knew she had not a great marriage, but it worked given who the two people were. At first we weren't going to see (her husband) Kip until the end -- that was the big surprise -- but then once it was a half-hour format we thought ""OK we need to know a little more about her."" We had her mother show up because we thought it would be important to know why she's so damaged. CNN: When you shoot the online sessions, are you actually interacting with the other actors or do those scenes happen separately? Kudrow: We are shooting together. We're on different sets but on the lens of the camera that we're looking into there's a prompter that's a monitor. So I can see everything the other person is doing in real time and we can hear each other in real time. So it's like a real Skype session. CNN: How much is actually improvised? Kudrow: The dialogue is improvised for sure. We come up with the outlines for stories and we give those to people. Sometimes when we're coming up with the story we have some lines that we think are funny and the person can use them or not. Mostly, it's improvised. We're listening and talking to each other. I definitely crack up. And sometimes I crack myself up, which is embarrassing in a whole other way. CNN: What's changing for Fiona in this new season? Kudrow: She's not changing as a person, but she's taking some hard knocks. In the season before with the campaign -- her husband Kip was running for Congress -- it all exploded because he was having an affair with his campaign manager, Ben. So they have in fact run off together. They're in New Mexico. They're living the gay life, but we'll see them. So he wants to divorce her and she's also being investigated for campaign finance improprieties. (Her assistant) Jerome has left her to work for her mother, who has stolen the idea of Web Therapy. She's doing Net Therapy, which is different. Everything's falling apart. CNN: How many of your ""Friends"" co-stars have now appeared on ""Web Therapy""? Kudrow: We had Courteney (Cox) in the first season, (David) Schwimmer in the second season and now we have Matt LeBlanc. CNN: Watching this show and going back to ""The Comeback"" and ""Friends,"" it seems like you're attracted to characters who are pretty delusional. Does that feel true? Kudrow: Yes, that's what's funny to me! Delusional people are really funny to me. People who live in a different reality, and it's really obvious to everybody else but them, is really funny. For Fiona and Valerie Cherish, there's a certain amount of Teflon coating them. Things don't stick too much. Mess doesn't stick too much. I see that everywhere. If you have kids and you're at a school, the parents are all ""Oh no, my 2-year-old can read!"" I think people are always spinning things and that's what I'm interested in. I had to learn to spin things when my son started school. Maybe it's just people in a panic trying to look calm is what makes me laugh. CNN: How did you feel about the false news a few months ago that a ""Friends"" movie was in the works? Kudrow: Well, I knew there wasn't ever a movie. There was never a ""Friends"" movie. Ever. So I've always known it's not happening. But with this last rumor someone came up with a great graphic with the couch and it looked like a real teaser and I went, ""Wait!"" And then someone came up with a fake story and got some publication to buy the lie that there was going to be a reunion, so I saw on Twitter people were posting this article that NBC was really going to do it. And I went, ""Wait a minute, was I not invited? Oh my God, maybe there is one and I wasn't asked to do it."" I even had a moment where I believed it because everything around it looked real. It was a good setup. CNN: Are the rumors finally put to rest? Kudrow: The creators have put them to rest. NBC has. I don't know who else needs to say, ""It's really not happening."" CNN: Entertainment Weekly recently listed ""The Comeback"" as one of the 100 All-Time Greatest TV Shows. Do you think you'd ever revisit that show? Kudrow: We talk about it all the time, we just haven't asked HBO. Maybe a special, maybe not the series again. At the time we didn't see where it would end. (The character) really just wants celebrity and I think now that we're all a little more comfortable with that notion, it could be interesting.","""Web Therapy"" and ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" return this week .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- NATO members meeting this week in Wales are expected to create ""a very high-readiness force"" to deal with Russian aggression in Ukraine and other international conflicts, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday. In a speech on the NATO website, Rasmussen said the fighting force will be part of an overall Readiness Action Plan that ""responds to Russia's aggressive behavior -- but it equips the alliance to respond to all security challenges, wherever they may arise."" He said this ""spearhead"" force would be able to ""travel light, but strike hard if needed."" NATO will look at possible upgrades to infrastructure that could include airfields and ports, he said. The White House supports the idea of a rapid response team for NATO, but National Security Spokesman Caitlin Hayden cautioned that the force would be ""defensive"" in posture. The new force is ""not intended as a provocation, or as a threat to Russia, but rather as a demonstration of NATO's continued commitment to our collective defense,"" Hayden said. New bases will be set up and equipment pre-positioned at bases, a NATO diplomatic source said. ""We are also facing crises to the southeast and south,"" said a senior NATO official. The plan ""needs to be able to deal with all crises that we might be facing in the future from wherever they might come."" Rasmussen said President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine will attend the summit and NATO will ""make clear our support for Ukraine."" On the ground, Ukrainian forces appear to be outgunned by Russian rebels. ""We have seen as recently as Saturday, that the Ukrainian army is very, very unarmed compared to the rebels,"" said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the situation in Eastern Ukraine. On Monday, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the presence of Russian soldiers on Ukraine soil is completely unjustified and unacceptable. ""Russia appears to be trying to force to Ukraine to abandon its democratic choices through the barrel of a gun,"" he said. Cameron said new sanctions measures will be drawn up by the EU within a week. Ukraine airfield attack reported . A Russian army tank attacked airfields in eastern Ukraine on Monday, Ukrainian military officials said, amid worsening tensions between Kiev and Moscow. A battle is under way at the airport of the eastern city of Luhansk, Ukrainian counter terrorism officials said. ""There is a very, very bad situation developing in Luansk,"" Bociurkiw said. ""Ukrainian officials are warning of a humanitarian catastrophe due to the lack of water and electricity."" Shortly before the attack, Russia urged the Ukrainian military to retreat from civilian locations in the east, saying pro-Moscow separatists in the region will not disarm for fear of getting killed. The same day, Ukraine said one of its patrol boats was capsized and two of its crew are missing off the coast of the city of Mariupol. Officials did not say who was behind the attack. Poroshenko has said thousands of Russian troops are in his nation's east, helping the separatists. Though Russia has denied sending its troops to Ukraine, it defended the rebels' action in the east. ""Washington and Brussels need to ask Kiev authorities to stop shelling the houses, schools, hospitals and so on because you leave militia with no choice but to stand up to protect their people,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Lavrov: 'Let us sit down and talk' ""Let's not ask militia to lay down their weapons and allow themselves to be killed."" Lavrov said negotiations, not threats, will help resolve the crisis between the two neighbors. ""Let us sit down and talk instead of threatening with sanctions and stubbornly making absolutely unrealistic demands of the militia laying down arms,"" he said. ""This is what the peace plan of Poroshenko is about."" Russian President Vladimir Putin sparked controversy when he talked about ""statehood"" for eastern Ukraine. ""Substantive meaningful talks related to the issues of society's political organization and statehood in southeastern Ukraine should start immediately in order to protect people living there,"" Putin said Sunday. The Kremlin later denied that Putin was calling for statehood in the region, saying he was referring to inclusive talks with all sides represented. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych the previous month. Violence broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April when separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Since then, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has killed 2,500 people, according to the United Nations. U.S. lawmaker visits Ukraine . A U.S. lawmaker called for the arming of Ukrainian forces along the eastern border. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, is in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev. He said the conflict in eastern Ukraine is not a rebel uprising, but a Russian invasion. ""We should be providing the Ukrainians with the type of defensive weapons that will impose a cost upon Putin for further aggression,"" said Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In the past, U.S. President Barack Obama has opposed supplying Ukraine with weapons. . Poroshenko warned that his nation's crisis with Russia has worsened, and is inching closer to a ""full-scale war."" The European Union has demanded Moscow withdraw its troops or face additional sanctions. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said new sanctions are in the works for Russia. Proposals will be ready for consideration in a week, he said over the weekend.

"(Lonely Planet) -- How's this for a space oddity? Forty years have passed since the historic Apollo moon landing, and yet the prospect of space tourism remains as distant as ever. Just as well, then, that getting that out-of-this-world feeling without leaving the planet is easier to do than a Vulcan salute. So all you cosmic cadets, moonwalkers and astral travelers out there -- prepare for lift off, as we take you to some of our favorite outer-space hotspots here on earth. Lonely Planet: The world's most unusual beaches . Valle de la Luna (Valley of the Moon), Chile . Buzz Aldrin could have been talking about Chile's Valle de la Luna when he described the moon's 'magnificent desolation'. Strange lunar landforms eroded by eons of wild weather crowd the horizon; bleak dunes and distant volcanoes amp up the surreality. For maximum impact, visit at sunset, when the valley is bathed in an unearthly purple, pink and gold glow... Volcanic Iceland . Dotted with dramatic steaming fumaroles, bubbling mudpots, weird rock formations and lava fields, Iceland is a sci-film waiting to happen. The starkly beautiful and gloriously strange landscapes around Mývatn will make you question what planet you're on. Southeastern Utah, USA . Mars is closer than you think! Canyonlands and Arches National Parks in southeastern Utah give the Red Planet a run for its intergalactic money with their rugged arches, bridges, needles, spires, craters, mesas and buttes. Touch down in high summer for that extra blast of Martian intensity. Lac Abbé, Djibouti . ""...seen from out here everything seems different. Time bends. Space is boundless."" Gazing awestruck upon Lac Abbé's natural smoking 'chimneys' and vast, eerie salt plains, you may recall these words spoken by astronaut George Taylor in ""Planet of the Apes."" Well, he should know: the movie was filmed here! Lonely Planet: Soaking in Iceland's social scene . Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia . This immense, shimmering sea of salt will haunt your daydreams for years to come. In fact, such is Salar de Uyuni's breath-taking, blinding-white otherworldliness, it might just send you into interstellar overdrive. Cappadocia, Turkey . With its exquisite fairy chimneys, valleys of cascading cliffs, and labyrinthine underground cities, Cappadocia is outer space as it might have been imagined by Jim Henson: picturesque and endearing. Lanzarote, Canary Islands . The extraordinary volcanic moonscape of central Lanzarote would make Armstrong and Aldrin feel right at home. The glowing green waters of El Golfo Crater might even tempt them to shrug off those cumbersome spacesuits and go for a paddle... Nazca Lines, Peru . Was Erich Von Daniken onto something? One of Peru's most impressive and enigmatic sights, the mysterious Nazca Lines could easily be mistaken for the doodlings of ancient astronauts. Deep in desolate desert, and only visible from the air, these mysterious lines will certainly stir your imagination... Great Barrier Reef, Whitsunday Islands, Australia . Plunge beneath the waves into the technicolor parallel universe that is the Great Barrier Reef. No spaced-out superlative could do this coral wonderland justice; no cinematic alien could come close to the marvelous marine critters that call it home... Nubra Valley, Ladakh, India . Sometimes known as 'Moonland', Ladakh is bound by mountains and comprised of mountains. Human habitation is sparse, and during the wild winter months, the region is only marginally easier to reach than the moon itself. The imposing, inhospitable Nubra Valley is its wild lunar heart.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- If you are one of the few who haven't seen South Korean rapper Psy's performance of ""Gangnam Style"" on YouTube (which, until I wrote these words, included me), you're missing not only a piece of power pop, but -- some hope -- a harbinger of things to come for Asian music artists. ""Is this an anomaly or an inevitability? The feeling has been that sooner or later, (a music artist) from Asia was going to break into the global sphere,"" said Ruuben van den Heuvel, executive director of music and technology consultancy, GateWay Entertainment. Psy became the first South Korean artist to hit number one on the UK music charts, and at the time of this writing was sitting number two for the third week on the U.S. charts. Anticipation is so high, Billboard Magazine launched a ""Psy Watch"" online on whether the artist will crack the number one spot. ""I didn't expect this kind of thing,"" Psy told CNN recently. ""I made this song, I made this music video and dance moves just for Korea, not worldwide. I didn't expect anything like this: I'm talking to CNN on the VMA (MTV Video Music Awards) -- crazy!"" As CNN's Madison Park writes, Psy's song -- about the wannabe style of the affluent neighborhood of Gangnam in Seoul -- has been sliced and diced with theories about what it means about wealth and class in Korea, and questions about whether Psy embodies the stereotypes about Asian masculinity. The video -- featuring his now famous horsey dance -- has spawned hundreds of parodies and so far has been watched 472 million times and achieved 4.1 million likes -- a record for a YouTube video. One unexpected business bump from Psy's (also known as Park Jae-sang) has been to his father's company, Korean semiconductor company D I Corp. The company's stock -- which was trading at 1,556 won (US$1.40) on July 16, the day after ""Gangnam Style"" was posted on YouTube -- has exploded in value and trading volume in recent weeks, and closed Monday on the Kospi at 13,100 won ($11.83). ""The positive sentiment from 'Gangnam Style' has attracted investors just because of the fact that the company is owned by Psy's father and uncle,"" Lee Sun-tae, a researcher at NH Investment and Securities, recently told Reuters. But Psy's success was softened by the growing global popularity of Korean pop music, or K-pop. The music follows on the success J-pop in the 1990s, which found a strong following in Asia but never crossed the Pacific, unable to break through the Western music market. But now K-pop has South Korea punching way above its weight in the global music business. South Korea has seen its global market ranking jump to 11th in the world from 23rd in the past six years, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Last month, Billboard annual series of top 21 musicians under the age of 21 listed K-pop star IU at 15th on the list which includes heavyweights in the western music business such as Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber. Yet Psy is unlike other K-pop artists, an industry fashioned on youthful looks as well as catchy tunes and dance moves. Psy is a stocky 35-year-old. The fact that his song is largely in Korean would make it an unlikely pick for any western music company as a potential hit. But the force of YouTube and digital downloads is dismantling the old business model for music companies, and Asian artists like Psy are benefiting, analysts say. ""Up to this stage in time, big hit records were driven by the willingness of the record company to get behind the release,"" Van den Heuvel says. ""Now there is less of a dependence on this, because the web has presented a level playing field."" ""The question that's come about -- is he a career artist, or is ('Gangnam Style') just the next 'Macarena'?"" he adds. ""I really, really hope that this guy is going to crack it, because there is nothing more important for the Asian music industry."" The question is not lost on Psy, who is now working with Justin Bieber's manager to build a career in the west off the back of his hit video. ""(The) music video is more famous than I am,"" Psy told CNN last month. ""I hate that, you know? I've got to be more famous than video. The video is much more popular. So when I say, 'I'm Psy,' people say, Psy?' And so I say, 'The YouTube video,' and people go, 'Ahhh!' ""So I'm here to promote myself and say, 'I'm the guy, I'm the guy and I'm the guy!'""","Psy became the first South Korean artist to hit number one on the UK music charts .

"(CNN) -- The man accused of killing a Transportation Security Administration officer in a rampage at Los Angeles International Airport was out of the hospital and in the custody of U.S. marshals Tuesday, authorities said. The suspect, Paul Ciancia, was shot multiple times by police during the November 1 assault. He was released Tuesday morning, the last of those shot to leave the hospital, UCLA Medical Center said. Ciancia was taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals Service upon his release, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. ""No details about his custody status or location are being released at this time,"" Mrozek told reporters in an e-mail. No court appearances had been scheduled as of Tuesday, he said. Investigators say Ciancia, 23, killed TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounded two other agents and a passenger in what appeared to be an orchestrated assault on members of the federal agency responsible for airport security. Investigators found information on the suspect expressing not just anti-federal government sentiment but also anger at the TSA specifically, a federal law enforcement official said. Relatives in New Jersey had received alarming texts from Ciancia before the shootings and raised concerns with local police, who had asked Los Angeles police to check on his welfare. Police missed Ciancia by ""a matter of minutes"" on the day of the shooting, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN.

"WINFIELD, Missouri (CNN) -- Players on Francis Howell Central High School's football team thought they would be doing their strength training in a weight room this week. Teens from miles around came to Winfield, Missouri, to help the community strengthen its levee Friday. But when team members learned that the community of Winfield -- 25 miles to the northwest -- needed help battling a swollen Mississippi River, they had no trouble choosing a different sort of workout. About 30 members of the team from the St. Charles, Missouri, area were among the hundreds of people filling and moving sandbags Thursday and Friday to bolster levees preventing the river from overcoming Winfield. ""We were going to be working out anyway,"" said Devon Doll, a 17-year-old who plays cornerback for FHC. ""We just wanted to come out and help."" Parts of Winfield flooded this week because of failed levees, but authorities, locals and volunteers from elsewhere were working to reinforce levees that still were working. The National Weather Service said the Mississippi River at nearby St. Louis was cresting Friday and was expected to begin slowly receding Saturday. The football players weren't the only teens giving up their summertime activities to help the community.  Watch volunteers fill sandbags » . Erin Andres, a 17-year-old from O'Fallon, Missouri, normally takes summer trips to Florida to help build houses with Habitat for Humanity. This year, however, she couldn't go, but she was more than happy to find she could be helpful closer to home. Erin and her younger sister went to Winfield with a few people from their church Friday morning. They helped fill sandbags and carry them to those who would transport them to the levee. Her house in O'Fallon, 15 miles south of Winfield, isn't threatened by the flooding, but she decided to help the Winfield effort because she wanted to ""help people that need the help."" ""Anyone who can help, should -- even if you're not strong,"" she said. ""If my 8-year-old sister is out here helping, anyone can help. It's a good experience."" Erin said that if she wasn't helping, she would have been hanging out with friends, something she was glad to put aside temporarily. The work also had a bit of benefit for her, she said. ""It takes care of my workout for the day,"" she said. The football team helped from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. CT Thursday and expected to help during the same hours Friday. Lincoln County authorities said that by about 2 p.m. Friday, sandbagging was suspended, with the Army National Guard having nearly completed its efforts to fortify the levees. The coach of the football team had given the players a choice between working out as scheduled or helping with the sandbagging. Those who obtained parental permission went to Winfield. ""It's kind of fun because we're working with our teammates, and everyone's happy because we're working for a good cause,"" Devon said.

"(CNN) -- Five more people are being held in connection with the terrorist attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya, a senior Kenyan government official said Wednesday. The five are in addition to as many as 11 people taken into custody by Kenyan authorities shortly after the September 21 attack. They are scheduled to appear in court on Monday, according to the official, who could not be named due to the sensitivity of the case. Gunmen believed affiliated with the Somalian terror group Al-Shabab stormed the mall at the outset of a four-day standoff that left at least 67 people dead and parts of the center destroyed. Surveillance video obtained by CNN shows gunmen casually shooting some civilians. They reportedly also tortured some hostages, according to military doctors who saw evidence of severed hands and noses. Some hostages had been hanged, according to the doctors.

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson was an international superstar, and many in the black community herald him for breaking down racial barriers in the music industry. Michael Jackson was one of the first black global superstars. ""Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color way before Tiger Woods, way before Oprah Winfrey, way before Barack Obama,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton. ""Michael did with music what they later did in sports and in politics and in television. And no controversy will erase the historic impact."" As the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson and his brothers ""became a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of black popular culture at Duke University's Department of African and African American Studies. ""You basically had five working-class black boys with Afros and bell bottoms, and they really didn't have to trade any of that stuff in order to become mainstream stars,"" Neal said. Young Michael Jackson was the first black ""bubblegum teen star"" in the vein of Monkees singer Davy Jones, Neal said. Jackson continued as a pioneer in the black culture when he broke barriers by appearing on MTV, and by breaking sales records with the 1982 album, ""Thriller.""  Timeline: The life of a ""King"" » . ""At the time that he releases 'Thriller,' I always argue that MTV was arguably the best example of cultural apartheid in the United States,"" Neal said. The former president of CBS Records, Walter Yetnikoff, remembered with scorn that MTV would not play ""Billie Jean"" or ""Beat It"" because it billed itself as a rock station. Looking back on that era, a 1991 Los Angeles Times article quoted MTV founder and then-CEO Robert Pittman as saying the channel's format didn't lend itself to other musical styles, including R&B and country. And Pittman accused his critics of attempting to impose their musical pluralism on the channel's die-hard rock fans. But Yetnikoff said he threatened to pull videos of his other artists unless MTV played Jackson's videos.  Watch Yetnikoff talk about getting Jackson's videos played » . Soon Jackson's videos were heavily in rotation on MTV. Showcasing a black artist paved the way for the popular show, ""Yo! MTV Raps,"" and other black artists, Neal said. In turn, Jackson became one of the first African-Americans to be a global icon. He also influenced a new generation of black musicians, including Usher, Ne-Yo and Kanye West, according to Joycelyn Wilson, a professor of African-American studies at Morehouse College, who specializes in popular culture and hip-hop studies.  Slideshow: Michael Jackson and his music » . Changing appearance . Jackson's changing physical appearance in the past two decades led to criticism he was trying to be less black. ""Here's a man who started off looking very typically African-American and ended up looking like something few people would have recognized early in his career. His nose was trimmed, his lips were different ... his skin was different,"" said Cheryl Contee, who writes as Jill Tubman on Jack & Jill Politics, a blog centered on African-American issues. ""The only thing that seemed to almost stay the same were his eyes,"" said Contee, who also called Jackson ""a genius and more than a trailblazer."" ""I think [it] troubled a lot of people that he left his skin color behind and seemed somehow to be ashamed of who he was [when] he was born,"" Contee said. But during a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Jackson shot down rumors that he was dying his skin to make it lighter. He told the talk show host that he had vitiligo, a disorder that destroyed his skin pigmentation. Black popular culture professor Neal said Jackson's physical changes did not reflect his life on the whole. ""I think if you solely pay attention to Michael Jackson's physicality, you actually miss something that's much more complex. ... Michael Jackson artistically and aesthetically never turned his back on blackness. His work was always in conversation with black culture both in the United States and more globally,"" said Neal. Neal said Jackson's changes were not to deny blackness, nor to become more white. ""This was somebody who most of his career we read as being asexual. And I think that many of the changes to his face, particularly his skin tone, he was almost trying to achieve an a-raciality,"" said Neal. Contee upset some commenters on her blog when she highlighted both the positive and negative aspects of Jackson's life, or what she termed his ""mixed legacy."" ""Some people were very offended that I would dare to mention some of the unfortunate aspects of his later years,"" she said. ""But others [acknowledged] that they had mixed feelings about his legacy and what that meant to African-Americans.""","Jackson 5 went mainstream and maintained black identity, professor says .
MTV didn't play videos of black artists before Jackson .
Expert: Despite his changing appearance, he was always in touch with black culture ."
"(CNN) -- Historically, surveillance was difficult and expensive. Over the decades, as technology advanced, surveillance became easier and easier. Today, we find ourselves in a world of ubiquitous surveillance, where everything is collected, saved, searched, correlated and analyzed. But while technology allowed for an increase in both corporate and government surveillance, the private and public sectors took very different paths to get there. The former always collected information about everyone, but over time, collected more and more of it, while the latter always collected maximal information, but over time, collected it on more and more people. Corporate surveillance has been on a path from minimal to maximal information. Corporations always collected information on everyone they could, but in the past they didn't collect very much of it and only held it as long as necessary. When surveillance information was expensive to collect and store, companies made do with as little as possible. Telephone companies collected long-distance calling information because they needed it for billing purposes. Credit cards collected only the information about their customers' transactions that they needed for billing. Stores hardly ever collected information about their customers, maybe some personal preferences, or name-and-address for advertising purposes. Even Google, back in the beginning, collected far less information about its users than it does today. As technology improved, corporations were able to collect more. As the cost of data storage became cheaper, they were able to save more data and for a longer time. And as big data analysis tools became more powerful, it became profitable to save more. Today, almost everything is being saved by someone -- probably forever. Examples are everywhere. Internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple collect everything we do online at their sites. Third-party cookies allow those companies, and others, to collect data on us wherever we are on the Internet. Store affinity cards allow merchants to track our purchases. CCTV and aerial surveillance combined with automatic face recognition allow companies to track our movements; so does your cell phone. The Internet will facilitate even more surveillance, by more corporations for more purposes. On the government side, surveillance has been on a path from individually targeted to broadly collected. When surveillance was manual and expensive, it could only be justified in extreme cases. The warrant process limited police surveillance, and resource restraints and the risk of discovery limited national intelligence surveillance. Specific individuals were targeted for surveillance, and maximal information was collected on them alone. As technology improved, the government was able to implement ever-broadening surveillance. The National Security Agency could surveil groups -- the Soviet government, the Chinese diplomatic corps, etc. -- not just individuals. Eventually, they could spy on entire communications trunks. Now, instead of watching one person, the NSA can monitor ""three hops"" away from that person -- an ever widening network of people not directly connected to the person under surveillance. Using sophisticated tools, the NSA can surveil broad swaths of the Internet and phone network. Governments have always used their authority to piggyback on corporate surveillance. Why should they go through the trouble of developing their own surveillance programs when they could just ask corporations for the data? For example we just learned that the NSA collects e-mail, IM and social networking contact lists for millions of Internet users worldwide. But as corporations started collecting more information on populations, governments started demanding that data. Through National Security Letters, the FBI can surveil huge groups of people without obtaining a warrant. Through secret agreements, the NSA can monitor the entire Internet and telephone networks. This is a huge part of the public-private surveillance partnership. The result of all this is we're now living in a world where both corporations and governments have us all under pretty much constant surveillance. Data is a byproduct of the information society. Every interaction we have with a computer creates a transaction record, and we interact with computers hundreds of times a day. Even if we don't use a computer -- buying something in person with cash, say -- the merchant uses a computer, and the data flows into the same system. Everything we do leaves a data shadow, and that shadow is constantly under surveillance. Data is also a byproduct of information society socialization, whether it be e-mail, instant messages or conversations on Facebook. Conversations that used to be ephemeral are now recorded, and we are all leaving digital footprints wherever we go. Moore's law has made computing cheaper. All of us have made computing ubiquitous. And because computing produces data, and that data equals surveillance, we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance. Now we need to figure out what to do about it. This is more than reining in the NSA or fining a corporation for the occasional data abuse. We need to decide whether our data is a shared societal resource, a part of us that is inherently ours by right, or a private good to be bought and sold. Writing in The Guardian, Chris Huhn said that ""information is power, and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom."" How this interplay between power and freedom play out in the information age is still to be determined. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","Bruce Schneier: Historically, surveillance was difficult; now it's become much easier .
Schneier: Government and corporate surveillance used to be very different .
He says today NSA can piggyback on corporate surveillance; they're like partners .

"(CNN) -- Dav Pilkey's ""Captain Underpants"" series was the most challenged book of 2013 for the second year in a row, according to the American Library Association. Pilkey, author of the illustrated adventures of two fourth-grade pranksters, was one of eight repeat authors on the list of most frequently challenged books in schools and libraries in 2013. Each year, the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom compiles a list of the top 10 most frequently challenged books as part of Banned Books Week, which runs from September 21 to September 27. The goal of Banned Books Week is to celebrate the freedom to read and highlight the pitfalls of censorship. A challenge is defined as ""a formal, written complaint, filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness,"" according to the American Library Association. The number of challenges only reflects incidents reported, and the organization estimates that for every reported challenge, four or five go unreported. 40 must-read titles to feed your YA book addiction .

"(CNN) -- Too many of America's children aren't ready for kindergarten -- or for what comes after. Only about one-in-three U.S. children are in the process of understanding or actually skilled in the kinds of math and reading activities that support the lessons they will encounter in kindergarten, according to research commissioned by Sesame Workshop. Meanwhile, only about half of children demonstrated the social, emotional and so-called executive function skills that will help them to adapt and learn during kindergarten. In fact, more than one-third of children begin kindergarten not proficient in even one of the areas we surveyed. The results, documented in the ""Kindergartners' Skills at School Entry"" report, suggest that almost half of children -- 44% -- enter kindergarten with one or more risk factors based on their home environment (for example, poverty, parents with less than a high school education). Unfortunately, children with these risk factors typically have lower school readiness scores than those not affected by such circumstances, particularly in reading, mathematics, and executive function skills. All this matters because these ""executive"" skills -- particularly impulse control -- play a pivotal role in children's long-term development. And, despite what some might think, something like self-regulation, and the underlying cognitive skills it requires, can actually be taught during the preschool years. Indeed, the reality is that being ready for school is about much more than just having the academic basics like having a good vocabulary or even just knowing letters and numbers. It's about being smart in other ways, such as being able to solve problems creatively and having flexible thinking, as well as being confident and resilient, and also being kind (important when trying to get along with other children). True, children are born ready to learn. But how and what they learn is critical in predicting children's success in school. It might surprise many to hear that current research has demonstrated that by 18 months, scientists can detect differences in various parts of the brain between children living in low socioeconomic status environments and those in middle or upper class environments. Such findings add to the growing evidence that parents play an absolutely critical role in the development of their baby's brain. So how can we make sure children have all the skills they need to succeed? Children learn best through real-life interactions with the adults and items in their environment. It is through these interactions, as well as their individual genetic make-up, that forms the brain architecture and the foundations for future learning. But while it's important for parents to gain a deeper understanding of what their infants, toddlers, and preschoolers are capable of learning, it is also critical they see what these responsive and nurturing interactions look like in order to maximize teachable moments throughout their daily routines, such as meal time, bath time and bed time. Technology can help with all this. Organizations such as Too Small to Fail and Text4baby, which we are currently partnering with are illustrating for new parents how to talk, read, and sing to their child throughout everyday moments, as well as suggesting ways to engage in stimulating activities that support their child's development, especially language and vocabulary development. All of this seems especially important for those of us who work in the media -- we have a unique opportunity to provide educational experiences to engage young learners and really set them up for life by harnessing the power of technology to show parents and teachers the types of activities that help foster learning. And we can involve every adult in a child's life -- teachers, grandparents and childcare professionals -- in the process. Early development of children's brains is too often overlooked. But by inspiring a sense of joy in learning, and by building upon young children's innate curiosity, we can help give them the building blocks they will rely upon for their whole lives.","Many of America's children aren't ready for kindergarten, says Rosemarie Truglio .

"Washington (CNN) -- Diners who attended President Barack Obama's evening meal Monday were treated to a three-course menu of fusion fare with hints of the subcontinent. Not partaking: the guest of honor, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is midway through a strict religious fast. After encouraging other guests to eat, he sipped only warm water. The timing of Modi's visit, which coincides with the Hindu festival devoted to the goddess Shakti, wasn't expected to deter from the high-level discussions on trade and security, White House officials said before Modi's arrival. And on Monday evening, guests including Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry did enjoy a gourmet meal from the White House kitchen during the working dinner. Opinion: Why Modi's visit matters . The menu included an avocado salad with goat cheese, crisped halibut with carrot ginger sauce and basmati rice, and mango crème brûlée. Ahead of Modi's trip to the United States, which includes a whopping 50 stops to visit with CEOs and a speech at the United Nations, officials said he intended to survive solely on ""nimbu pani"" -- or water with lemon -- for nine days. At the White House Monday, Modi presented Obama with a copy of ""The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi,"" a Hindu religious text that was annotated and translated by the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs posted several photos from the White House proceedings: . .","President Obama and Prime Minister Modi meet for the first time over dinner .

"(CNN) -- The suspect in the killing of Arkansas real estate agent Beverly Carter was asked this week by reporters: ""Why Beverly?"" Arron Lewis, 33, answered directly. ""She was a rich broker,"" he said. ""Because she was just a woman who worked alone -- a rich broker."" Authorities have said they believe Lewis was a stranger to Carter, 49, whose body was found Tuesday in a shallow grave near Cabot, about 20 miles northeast of central Little Rock, Arkansas. In other words, she could have been anyone. ""I work as a team with my daughter. I just think it really made it hit home that it could have been her. It could have been me,"" said Karen Crowson, a broker and past president of the Arkansas Realtors Association. Across the country, Realtors and agents are reeling in the wake of Carter's death. Messages to the family have poured in on social media, laced with something in addition to sympathy: a determination to make sure what happened to Carter doesn't happen again. ""We've just gotten lax,"" said Crowson, who works for the same firm as Carter did, and knew her. ""We live in the South and tend to think everybody's a good person. We're not, by nature, suspicious."" Of course, most of the time, people are good, and everything is fine. ""But it just takes one nut to take away a grandmother and mom,"" Crowson said. 'Drastic wake-up call' Carter's death has already prompted changes in Crowson's office. Going forward, the first meeting with a potential buyer will be required to be at the office, she said. Buyers will be asked for a copy of their identification and for some other information. Such steps can help take ""the power away from the criminal,"" said Tracey Hawkins, a former agent, and safety and security expert who teaches real estate professionals how to stay safe. She said her services have been in high demand since Carter's death. ""My fear is, for a while, agents will be all shook up ... but what inevitably happens is everyone gets complacent,"" said Hawkins. She mentioned at least six other attacks on agents this year. In one, the agent was raped; in another, he was beaten. There have been other instances of high-profile killings. In 2011, 27-year-old Ashley Okland was killed while showing a home in Iowa. A few years earlier, in 2006, Sarah Anne Walker was stabbed 27 times inside a model home in Texas. Each time an attack makes the news, agents vow to change, and then the momentum is lost. But Hawkins is hopeful. ""This has been a drastic wake-up call,"" she said about Carter's death. ""I think they (agents) are finally realizing the danger is not going away."" 'One's too many' Carter was killed in September, ""Realtor Safety Month,"" for the National Association of Realtors. The group's president elect, Chris Polychron, has promised to make safety a priority when he takes office. ""We're not going to let it die, I can tell you that,"" he said. ""It's sad that it took a tragic death of one of our own to run the red flag up."" The exact details of Carter's death are not yet known. She called her husband Thursday afternoon to tell him where she would be. When hours went by with no further word, Carl Carter said, he ""knew something was wrong."" He went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success. ""If we can prevent this from happening to another Realtor or real estate agent, I hope we can do that,"" said Polychron. ""One's too many.""","The death of Beverly Carter, 49, has resonated among fellow real estate agents .

"(CNN) -- Even when a drone's small, turned off, unarmed and resting on a table in a coffee shop, it can make people uneasy. That discomfort could change in the next few years as the airborne gadgets become commonplace and more people buy personal drones. Startups are already popping up with different takes on design, uses and price. The latest aerial offering is the PlexiDrone by DreamQii, a midrange drone for photographers who don't want to mess around with additional complicated technology. White and unremarkable-looking, the PlexiDrone is simple to put together -- just snap in the four propellers and two pieces of landing gear. It can hold a GoPro, the drone photographer's camera of choice because of its light weight, or other lightweight cameras and camcorders. ""This is not designed to be a toy; this is a tool for the average person to use,"" said Klever Freire, founder of PlexiDrone, who showed off his creation last week in, yes, a coffee shop in Brooklyn. The consumer drone market is still wide open for newcomers due to a combination of tangled Federal Aviation Administration restrictions, high price tags, privacy concerns and a bad reputation. Airborne photography is the most popular consumer use for drones, and the Phantom line from DJI currently dominates that field. DreamQii wants to take on the slick white and red Phantom drones with a slightly less expensive design and some quirky features. The PlexiDrone's landing gear can be pulled up in flight so that a camera is able to capture a true 360-degree view without obstructions. Pilots can control the device from a smartphone or tablet, pointing to any direction on a map to set a route. The apps can also control the camera position and track flight hours. When it's not flying, the PlexiDrone is programmed to speak when turned on but not in the air. It spits out a mixture of warnings (such as your GPS is offline), explanations and casual chitchat in a British accent or voice of your choosing. ""Sometimes it has a little bit of a dry wit and sometimes it has more of a sarcastic sense of humor,"" Freire said. The FAA is slowly working on clearing commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, for use. (It's expected to announce details by the end of this year.) Last week, the agency issued an exemption that will allow a handful of TV and movie companies to capture aerial footage with drones, but regular people are still on a short leash. So to help consumers stay out of trouble, the PlexiDrone is also programmed to obey the law. Amateur drone users can't go above 400 feet, and the devices can't be used for commercial purposes without express permission. PlexiDrone limits use of the device accordingly. Like many UAV entrepreneurs, Freire comes from an aerospace background. He worked for Bombardier Aerospace, the company that makes Learjets, for six years. DreamQii now has seven employees, mostly aerospace engineers and one biomedical engineer. At its 800-square-foot office in Toronto, the company prints out drone prototypes on industrial-grade 3-D printers and tests them in a 10-by-10-foot cage. On Wednesday, it kicked off an IndyGoGo campaign to get attention and funds for the first run of 1,000 drones. These early devices go for $480 to $1,200 and are scheduled to ship in early 2015. Freire said the PlexiDrone will cost between $800 and $1,700 when it becomes more widely available after the first run. The PlexiDrone is meant primarily for photographers, but Freire said he hopes to find other uses. ""We're working with a researcher who wants to create a metal detection halo. He wants to swarm these thing together to find landmines."" Google reveals secret drone delivery tests .","The PlexiDrone is a new ready-to-fly tool for aerial photographers .

"(CNN) -- The Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq has been removed from a State Department terror list, officials said Friday. The group was put on the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, which includes more than 50 groups like al Qaeda and Hezbollah, in 1997 because of the killing of six Americans in Iran in the 1970s and an attempted attack against the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. However, since 2004 the United States has considered the group, which has lived for more than 25 years at a refugee camp in Iraq, ""noncombatants"" and ""protected persons"" under the Geneva Conventions. Mujahedin-e-Khalq's move from Camp Ashraf is nearing completion under the auspices of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. The members are relocating to a temporary site there before being resettled in third countries. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was under a court order to decide by October 1 whether to remove the group from the terror list. ""With today's actions, the department does not overlook or forget the MEK's past acts of terrorism, including its involvement in the killing of U.S. citizens in Iran in the 1970s and an attack on U.S. soil in 1992,"" the State Department said in a statement. ""The department also has serious concerns about the MEK as an organization, particularly with regard to allegations of abuse committed against its own members. ""The Secretary's decision today took into account the MEK's public renunciation of violence, the absence of confirmed acts of terrorism by MEK for more than a decade, and their cooperation in the peaceful closure of Camp Ashraf, their historic paramilitary base,"" the statement said. Maryam Rajavi, head of Mujahedin-e-Khalq and president-elect of the National Council of Resistance, praised the decision Friday. ""I understand that this decision was difficult and required political courage,"" Rajavi said in a statement. ""This has been the correct decision, albeit long overdue, in order to remove a major obstacle in the path of the Iranian people's efforts for democracy. For more than a decade, the mullahs made every effort to prevent removal of this designation. ""They do not conceal their anger and disappointment and are trying hysterically to counter Secretary Clinton's decision with their lobby groups in the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe. ""The people of America and the U.S. Government will realize that, contrary to the campaign of demonization and misinformation orchestrated by the religious fascism ruling Iran, our movement is far removed from all the allegations and accusations churned out by the current Iranian regime, is merely striving for freedom and democracy in Iran, and is campaigning against fundamentalism and export of terrorism,"" Rajavi said. Being on the list carries a certain stigma and allows the United States to legally go after financing and take other steps against individuals associated with these groups. Officials acknowledge that the decision has been the subject of a contentious debate within the administration. Mujahedin-e-Khalq is considered by many in the administration to be a bizarre cult-like organization, prompting concerns about its behavior. Officials say these concerns factored heavily in the debate. The group denies that it supports terrorism, and supporters rally daily in front of the State Department to demand removal from the terrorism list. Many members of Congress have pressured Clinton to do the same. Moreover, Mujahedin-e-Khalq has paid well-known former U.S. politicians and former administration heavyweights to speak out on its behalf, including former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, former FBI Director Louis Freeh and former National Security Adviser James Jones. The last major convoy of 680 members of Mujahedin-e-Khalq arrived this month at the temporary relocation site at a former U.S. military base near Baghdad International Airport, the U.N. mission for Iraq said. The State Department said at the time that the arrival marked ""a significant milestone in efforts to achieve a sustainable humanitarian solution to this issue."" Mujahedin-e-Khalq leaders have been reluctant to complete the move from Camp Ashraf to Camp Hurriya, formerly an American facility known as Camp Liberty. They complained about conditions at the new camp, calling it more a prison than a home after the first convoy arrived in February. Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invited members of Mujahedin-e-Khalq to relocate to Iraq in an effort to undermine the Iranian government, which was then at war with Iraq. Iran also considers the group to be a terrorist organization.","Mujahedin-e-Khalq was put on terror list in 1997 .

"(CNN) -- After surviving a near-fatal car accident, Kaitlin Hunter found herself battling a devastating bacterial infection in her colon that also threatened her life. The persistent infection was beaten through a little-known technique involving the transplant of fecal matter from Hunter's mother, which put healthy bacteria back into her colon. Following the July procedure, ""I've been so happy,"" said Hunter, 20, of Marietta, Georgia. ""I'm cured."" Her struggle began more than a year earlier when she was released from a hospital in Sacramento, California. A June 2011 car accident fractured her lower spine, lacerated her liver and colon, and broke all 10 toes. Emergency crews used the Jaws of Life to cut Hunter from her dad's car, and then she was flown to the hospital, where she spent the next month. Upon her release, Hunter flew home to Georgia. It hadn't been the summer vacation she imagined, but she thought she was getting better. But ""right when I got off the plane, I went to the hospital. I was having extremely bad stomach pain. A month later, we found out it was C. diff,"" Hunter said, using the abbreviation for the bacteria Clostridium difficile. How it began . In the hospital after her accident, doctors followed standard care and put Hunter on antibiotics to prevent an infection. In spite of the antibiotics -- or possibly because of them -- C. diff infected her colon, causing severe stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting. Hunter, who stands 5 feet 7 inches tall, lost 40 pounds during her struggle. Her weight plummeted to 85 pounds. It's believed that antibiotics, which kill harmful infection-causing bacteria, also weaken the beneficial, healthy bacteria percolating in the colon. With the colon's defenses down, C. diff grows rampant, releasing a toxin and inflaming the colon. C. diff infections kill about 14,000 people in the United States every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the number and severity of total cases have increased dramatically over the past decade. Experts: Alcohol enemas 'extremely dangerous' Even though antibiotics put someone at risk of developing a C. diff infection, standard treatment still calls for prescribing more and different antibiotics to kill the C. diff and allow healthy bacteria to recolonize. But for many people such as Hunter -- who went through nine rounds of antibiotic treatments -- the healthy bacteria never get the upper hand, and the C. diff just keeps coming back. 'Brand-new' treatment . Increasingly, doctors are taking a different approach. Instead of continued assaults on bacteria, ""fecal matter transplants"" recolonize the colon with new bacteria from a healthy donor. ""This is brand-new for most gastroenterologists,"" said Dr. Suku George, Hunter's treating physician. ""We are very excited about this."" George had never deposited fecal matter by colonoscopy into a patient until Hunter wanted to try it. Hunter's mother ""donated"" one of her stools for the procedure. Next, the hospital lab carefully diluted it, and George pumped the foreign fecal matter right into Hunter's colon. The result ended Hunter's struggle with C. diff. A study published in March reported a 91% cure rate after just one fecal matter transplant, and a 98% cure rate when combined with an additional round of antibiotics. Remarkably, that study only included the sickest of patients. All 77 of the study participants already had a recurring C. diff infection, having tried and failed five rounds of antibiotic-only treatments over 11 months, on average. The study used the colonoscopy method, which many believe is the most effective, because relatively large amounts of fecal matter can be placed deep inside the colon. Other methods use either an enema or a nasogastric tube, which sends fecal matter through the nasal passage, down the throat and into the stomach. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . George tried the nasogastric tube on Hunter, using fecal material from her father, but the C. diff infection returned. He then asked for and received permission to perform the hospital's first colonoscopic fecal transplant. Looking ahead . Gastroenterologists pioneering the practice unanimously seem to agree that eventually a cleaner, commercially developed suppository will replace the crude feces and water mixtures currently in use. ""It'll become a little more acceptable to hospitals and patients and more widely performed,"" said Dr. Lawrence Brandt, a professor of medicine and surgery at New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine who was the lead author on the March study. ""But for people that have recurring C. diff, it doesn't really much matter, because these patients are so ill and so much want to get better. The fact that it's stool, it doesn't matter to them.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded a deadly accident involving a bus driver who fell asleep while driving on a Virginia interstate last year was caused in part by ""acute sleep loss"" as well as inadequate oversight by the bus company and the government. Four people died on May 31, 2011, when a motorcoach operated by Sky Express Inc., with 59 people on board bound for New York, drifted off Interstate 95 near Richmond, Virginia, around 5 a.m. The bus struck a cable barrier, rotated clockwise, then overturned. The roof was crushed. In addition to the four deaths, 49 other passengers were injured. The driver, Kin Yiu Cheung, was slightly injured and refused medical treatment, safety officials said. At a board meeting Tuesday, the safety board said that a 13-month investigation found the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle ""because of fatigue resulting from acute sleep loss, poor sleep quality, and ... the failure of Sky Express Inc. management to follow adequate safety practices and to exercise safety oversight of the driver."" ""This crash never should have happened,"" said the board's chairman, Deborah A.P. Hersman. ""It was entirely preventable. Those travelers were failed at three levels: by the driver, the operator and the regulator."" The safety board ruled out alcohol, drugs, cell phone use, weather, mechanical defects, speed and highway design as playing any role in the accident. The report said the bus company's failure to ""exercise even minimal oversight of its drivers' rest and sleep activities enabled the drivers to drive while dangerously fatigued."" An examination of the driver's work schedule, sleep times and cell phone use revealed that his opportunity for sleep in the 72 hours prior to the crash was limited, the safety board said in a release. The board said another factor contributing to the accident was the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's lack of adequate oversight of North Carolina-based Sky Express, ""which allowed the company to continue operations despite known safety issues."" ""Protecting the traveling public by strengthening bus and truck safety is FMCSA's number one priority,"" the federal organization whose primary mission is to prevent commercial motor-vehicle-related fatalities, said in a statement sent to CNN. ""FMCSA closed the loophole that allowed 10-day extensions for passenger bus companies undergoing safety compliance reviews. It is also why our agency shut down 54 unsafe bus companies in 2011."" The report cited ""the lack of a comprehensive occupant protection system, including systems for providing passenger restraint and for ensuring sufficient roof strength."" In addition to determining the cause of the accident, federal safety officials recommended expanded research on window glazing requirements to protect occupants from ejection as well as developing ways to assess effectiveness of fatigue management plans to improve alertness and limit driving mistakes. Sky Express shut down shortly after the accident. Cheung was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and reckless driving. Motorcoaches transport 750 million passengers each year, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

Kucherena declined to name the employer for security reasons. He told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that Snowden would perform maintenance for the site. Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims . Snowden, a 30-year-old former government information technology contractor, collected information on spy programs -- in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- and exposed the programs to the media. Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Hong Kong in late May and flew on June 23 to Moscow, where he holed up at the airport for more than five weeks. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. After Russia granted him an asylum term of one year on August 1, he left the airport. As Snowden got ready to start his new job, he was also meeting Thursday with a German lawmaker who visited him in Russia. Hans-Christian Stroebele, a well-known leftist legislator in Germany, met with Snowden in Moscow to invite him to testify before the German parliament. According to Stroebele's website, during their meeting, Snowden gave him a letter addressed to the German parliament and to the country's attorney general. Stroebele, a member of the Green party, tweeted a picture of himself with Snowden and said he would hold a news conference Friday to provide details about the letter's contents.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan thanked the judge Thursday ""for being fair"" as the judge ended the felony probation that has followed the actress for nearly five years. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner officially removed Lohan from probation from two 2007 drunken driving convictions, but she remain on informal probation for two more years on last year's misdemeanor shoplifting conviction. ""The only terms on that case are to obey all laws,"" Sautner said. ""It's not that hard."" Lohan's probation officer sent another good progress report to the judge, confirming that the actress has completed the 480 hours of community service and the four-times-a-month psychological counseling sessions ordered, Sautner said. ""I know it's hard when people are following you all over the place, but that's the life you chose,"" the judge told Lohan, advising her to ""live your life in a more mature way, stop the nightclubbing and focus on your work."" Lohan, who has been in court at least 19 times since her first arrest in May 2007, addressed the judge at the end of Thursday's hearing. ""I just want to say thank you for being fair,"" Lohan said. ""It's really opened a lot of doors for me, so I really appreciate it."" The strict rules of formal probation that tripped up the actress and led to four probation violations in the past two years are now gone, but she could face another 245 days in jail if she is convicted of another crime before the theft probation ends on May 24, 2014. Instead of near-daily shifts working at the county morgue, weekly visits to her probation officer and monthly hearings, the actress can now focus on the career that ran off track after a May 2007 DUI arrest. Lohan, 25, has spent 250 days in rehab, 35 days in home confinement, 67 days on community service, 19 days in court and made six trips to jail. The actress has been cast in an upcoming episode of FOX Television's ""Glee"" and filming starts in May on a made-for-TV movie in which she will portray big-screen legend Elizabeth Taylor. Canadian authorities issued a permit Wednesday for Lohan to work in Toronto, where the Taylor biopic will be filmed, a source familiar with Lohan's plans said Thursday. Her recent hosting stint on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" was highly rated, and her nude photo spread in Playboy broke sales records for the magazine. With the legal scrutiny easing, Lohan must still contend with being the constant focus of the paparazzi's cameras -- and some business security cameras -- which follow her day and night.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal investigators Tuesday blamed the pilot of a Southwest Airlines jet for causing the plane to skid off a runway at Chicago's Midway Airport in 2005, an accident that killed a 6-year-old boy. A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700, like the plane here, skidded off a Chicago runway in 2005. ""The probable cause was the pilot's failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the aircraft after landing which resulted in a runway overrun,"" the National Transportation Safety Board ruled. Southwest Airlines flight 1248 slid off a 6,500-foot runway at Midway while landing during a heavy snowstorm in December 2005. The Boeing 737-700 was still moving at 46 mph when it crashed through a barrier wall and then slid into an intersection outside the airport grounds, hitting two cars. The NTSB found the pilot and co-pilot were unfamiliar with the jet's automatic brake system, which ""distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing."" The agency also found the pilot's failure to divert the flight to another airport amid reports of poor braking on the runway and tailwinds above 5 mph contributed to the accident. The accident killed Joshua Woods, 6, of Leroy, Indiana, and injured 12 others, including his parents and two younger brothers. It was the first fatal accident in the history of the Dallas-based airline. None of the 98 passengers and five crew members aboard the Baltimore-to-Chicago flight were hurt. The NTSB found Southwest failed to provide its pilots with ""clear and consistent guidance and training"" on company policies regarding arrival landing-distance calculations. It also said the programming and design of the aircraft's onboard computers and the airline's plan to implement new auto-brake procedures without giving pilots time to learn those procedures contributed to the accident.

A poker prodigy who turned $50 into $40 million in just three years. Archie Karas has described himself the ""king of the gamblers,"" but authorities in San Diego are now calling him a cheater. On Friday, police arrested the 62-year-old Karas, whose legal name is Anargyros Karabourniotis, at his home in Las Vegas, on allegations he marked cards during a blackjack game in San Diego in July. The alleged cheating was also caught on camera, according to authorities. The alleged incident occurred at San Diego's Barona Casino. Karas won $8,000 playing blackjack, but San Diego District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis says video shows the gambler cheated with a technique known as marking cards. Marking cards allows a player to identify the value of cards. If done correctly, neither the dealer nor other players notice the marks -- only the player who is in on the scheme. ""This defendant's luck ran out thanks to extraordinary cooperation between several different law enforcement agencies who worked together to investigate and prosecute this case,"" Dumanis said. Karas is being held in Las Vegas without bail. He faces charges of burglary, winning by fraudulent means and cheating. He is expected to appear in court Monday for an extradition hearing. It was not immediately clear if Karas has legal representation. He won some, he lost some . Karas' exploits are legendary in the poker world. In 1992, he went to Las Vegas with just $50. He got a $10,000 loan from a poker buddy at Binion's Horseshoe, according to Poker.org. Karas tripled the loan in one game. From there he went on to bet and win at pool, then poker. ""I was the best,"" Karas told ESPN in an interview broadcast in 2008. ""Anybody who'd come to town I'd play them, I didn't care who they were and I'd win, too."" But he had a problem, he recounted to ESPN. No one would play him anymore; he had simply won too much. He didn't quit. Instead, he changed the game. ""I had to play dice,"" he told ESPN. He said lines of people used to show up to watch him bet $1 million on each roll. ""I ran it up to $40 million,"" he recalled. ""It was a lot of money."" But as quickly as it came, the money left Karas. He said he lost $20 million in 10 days. Soon, it was all gone. It took him three years to win the $40 million and only three weeks to lose it. If the loss hurt Karas, he didn't show it in his 2008 interview. ""I consider myself the king of gamblers,"" he said, chuckling. ""I made it, I lost it and like Frank Sinatra says, I stood tall and I took the punches and I did it my way.""","Authorities have charged a legendary gambler with cheating .

"(CNN) -- It was a ""crazy"" high-stakes routine that risked everything in the pursuit of gold. Epke Zonderland had linked together the three most difficult moves in the high bar discipline, but the Dutch gymnast knew if he fluffed any one of them it would lead to humiliation on the world's biggest sporting stage. The omens were not promising. A few short weeks before the London 2012 Olympics, as defending European champion he fell off the apparatus and finished 56th. But Zonderland knew that to beat the best in the world he had to persist with his plan. and on the afternoon of Tuesday August 7, he produced one of the most memorable moments of a Games defined by its iconic sporting achievements. ""I was really focused and not thinking about the past or the future but just of the moment,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""The routine was going so fast but by the end of it I was getting more relaxed, and then I did the dismount -- and when I landed the dismount it was the best feeling I ever had."" From the moment the 26-year-old spun off the bar to come down flush on the mat without a hint of a wobble or further movement, he knew the gold was his. Perfect landing . ""It was a perfect landing so it was a really great feeling and the crowd was going wild,"" he recalled. After a nervous two-minute wait for the score, Zonderland was confirmed in first place with a massive 16.533 points, beating Germany's Fabian Hambuechen into silver on 16.400 with defending champion Zou Kai of China third on 16.366. The ""Flying Dutchman"" -- his rather predictable nickname -- was indeed flying high and returned home as a hero to win a string of awards -- as well being named to the Order of Orange-Nassau, one of the highest honors in the Netherlands. The YouTube clips of his performance have become a big viral online hit, and he is regularly named in polls of top performances in the 2012 Games. It's all down to pulling off a sequence of complex moves -- named after former gymnasts. ""The first is the cassina, you have a double somersault and then straight, and you make one turn,"" he explains. ""The second is the kovacs, a double-somersault and then tucked, with your legs, and the third one is the kolman, and it's a double-somersault tucked with one turn."" Zonderland had become renowned as the only gymnast to regularly perform two of the difficult moves in succession, but to perform three had many shaking their head. Crazy risk . ""A lot of people thought that I was crazy because I wanted to do it on the Olympics, because they thought the risk was too big. ""I think I surprised a lot of people to really do it."" For many, such a triumph would be the signal to bow out, but not only is Zonderland setting his sights on the next Olympics in Rio in 2016, he is also combining up to 30 hours per week training with medical studies. ""Of course it's a hard combination. I have a little bit less time for other things but it's great I can do sport at this level and get a great education,"" said Zonderland, who aims to be an orthopedic doctor. Immediate motivation comes in his desire to win his first world title after finishing second at two championships. ""It's the one big goal I have left,"" he admitted. ""It's getting harder and harder to compete at this level but I think I can manage to continue until the next Olympics when I'm 30."" Having started gymnastics training when he was four in the town of Heerenveen, Zonderland will have been in his sport for over a quarter of a century come the next Games, gradually building up the intensity of his efforts. In a typical four-hour session he will do 50 somersaults, and does not just confine himself just to the high or horizontal bar discipline. All-round ability . Zonderland has won European silver on the parallel bars, and it was thanks to his ability over six events that he was even able to appear at the 2012 Olympics. Finishing outside of the top three in the high bar at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo after a disappointing display, he was forced to qualify via the all-round competition at the London test events. ""I wasn't ready for that anymore but it was the only possibility,"" he said. ""I qualified (beating fellow Dutchman Jeffrey Wammes) so I was very happy with that, and after that I could train on the parallel bars and high bars again."" It was during this period that Zonderland decided to go with his high-risk strategy, gaining the support of his coach Daniel Knibbeler, who was ""quite positive also from the beginning. His confidence increased as Zonderland appeared to perfect the routine in almost every training session. But performing it under the pressure of competition is another matter, and Zonderland's spectacular flop at the European championships in Montpellier set nerves on edge. ""I knew from the training where I made it almost all the time that it was possible but the big challenge is in your head,"" Zonderland said. ""On the day of the competition I had a lot of nerves and it was quite hard to get it under control."" Unique feat? But he need not have worried, stunning the crowd and his rivals with his performance. But now he is at the summit of his sport, Zonderland knows he cannot relax. ""You realize there are a lot of talented gymnasts who can do the same as you do, so I think about my competitors who are really working hard,"" he said. ""I heard about one gymnast in the Netherlands who is also able to do it (the triple move) but for the rest I don't think anybody can do it."" He will step up his training for the world championships in Antwerp in the first weekend of October, sacrificing the sort of lifestyle friends of his own age enjoy. ""You don't have so much time to go out or do things with your friends, so sometimes that's hard but with sport at this level you have no choice."" Fortunately, his girlfriend Linda, who competed at a high level in speed skating as a junior, understands the nature of top-class sports competition. Zonderland appears remarkably unaffected by his celebrity status in his home country as the first man to win a gymnastics Olympic gold. Lasting fame . Even his nickname has echoes of the most famous figure in Dutch sporting history, athlete Fanny Blankers Koen, who won four gold medals in track and field at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Blankers Koen was called ""the Flying Dutchwoman"" and was named IAAF female athlete of the 20th century by the world governing body. Zonderland has etched his own piece of Olympics history with his stunning performance in London and set new standards in his discipline -- its impact similar to that of the perfect 10 achieved by Nadia Comaneci at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In his own country, gymnastics has received a massive boost as youngsters look to emulate him. ""It's called the 'Epke effect,' "" his agent of five years Johan Boesjes told CNN. ""He's inspiring a generation of young people and all the clubs have had a massive boost.""","Gymnast Epke Zonderland is nicknamed ""the Flying Dutchman""

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamists in control of northern Mali said they forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery in the lawless region. Witnesses watched quietly as Islamists executed the two by pelting them with rocks in the remote Aguelhok town, according to a local resident. ""I don't know how many rocks they threw or for how long it went on before they were both dead,"" said Haman Maiga, a resident of Aguelhok who witnessed the stoning. ""No one dared to try and stop the Islamists."" The woman had two small children, a boy and a girl, according to Maiga. A leader of a radical Islamic group in the region said Sharia law condemns relationships outside marriage. ""The man and the woman, who were both married (to other people), were having an affair,"" said Aliou Toure, the Islamist commissioner in Gao. ""They were stoned to death, the punishment for infidelity, according to Sharia, Islamic law."" The stoning Sunday is the first reported Sharia killing since al Qaeda-linked Islamists took control of the north. Read more: Is this al Qaeda's 'last chance' for a country? Mali has been in a state of Chaos since a military ruler overthrew the democratically-elected president in March, shaking one of West Africa's most stable democracies. The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government, but uncertainty looms. Ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants have taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of the northern portion of the country. Mali becoming bitterly divided . Aguelhok was among the first to fall when Tuareg rebels aided by Islamist groups occupied the region this year. Months later, two groups with ties to al Qaeda hijacked the separatist uprising by the local Tuareg movement. The two groups now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of Texas that includes the towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu. Islamists have since imposed a harsh form of Sharia law that bans drinking, music and sports on television. Most residents in the area are Muslims, but have protested against the strict form of Sharia as Islamists remain determined to apply it. ""We don't have to answer to anyone over the application of Sharia. This is the form of Islam practiced for thousands of years,"" Toure said. ""The fact that we are building a new country on the base of Sharia is just something the people living here will have to accept."" In addition to the killing, Islamist militants have gone on a rampage for months, destroying sacred tombs in the region and vowing to target more.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blake Mycoskie was traveling in South America when he saw, for the first time, hundreds of children without shoes. TOMS founder and entrepreneur Blake Mycoskie says he wanted to make money and do good at the same time. ""I had never met anyone who didn't have shoes,"" the veteran entrepreneur told CNN. That visit to a village in Argentina inspired the creation of a socially responsible footwear company that blends philanthropy and business. Mycoskie called the company TOMS: Shoes For Tomorrow -- a name that reflects his desire to provide shoes for disadvantaged children in a sustainable way. Mycoskie, now 32, said he realized he could make money and do good at the same time with TOMS. The company's mission is uncomplicated: It gives a free pair of shoes to a child in need every time it sells a pair. Santa Monica, Calif.-based TOMS gave away 10,000 pairs of shoes in the first six months after its launch in 2006. This year the company is on track to donate 200,000 pairs. The stylish slip-ons, which Vogue magazine declared ""cool shoes for a cool cause,"" have become a must-have item among fashion elite and received the People's Design Award from the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt Museum last year. By the time he launched TOMS, Mycoskie already had four start-ups under his belt. But he didn't always have his sights set on the business world. Growing up, his aim was to play professional tennis. He trained hard and earned a scholarship to Southern Methodist University, where he studied philosophy and finance. But an injury sidelined him his sophomore year. That's when he got the idea for his first venture, a college laundry service. Within one year, the business, Easy Laundry, had 40 employees, had expanded to three schools and was generating nearly $1 million in sales. That's when Mycoskie realized he was born to be an entrepreneur and dropped out of school. ""I realized I loved doing this. I realized I loved the idea of creating something out of scratch and seeing it work and seeing the benefits of that,"" he said. Mycoskie eventually sold the company and began other ventures, including an outdoor advertising company and a 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week reality TV channel, which he launched after appearing on the second season of ""The Amazing Race"" with his sister. They finished the competition in third place (missing out on the million-dollar prize by just four minutes), but the experience exposed Mycoskie to the astounding amount of poverty in the world -- a problem that TOMS is tackling today, one pair of shoes at a time.","Entrepreneur Blake Mycoskie is blending philanthropy with business .

"(CNN) -- The woman was related to at least two of the three children. Was she their doting mother? An adoring aunt? Or, given her relative youth, perhaps a much older sister? ""That leaves you with so many possibilities,"" says New Hampshire State Police Sgt. Joe Ebert. All four females are long dead, their bodies crammed into two 55-gallon barrels, the first barrel discovered by a hunter in 1985, the other 15 years later. They have never been identified. Now, there's a new push to solve a cold case that has stymied determined investigators. This week, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, after a request from state police, released new 3-D facial reconstructions of the four victims. They provide more details than previous images. Investigators hope that someone, by looking at gaps in their teeth, thickness of lips, the length of their hair or other features, will make a connection. ""The right person is going to see it,"" says Angela Williamson, director of the center's unknown victim identification team. Seemingly endless questions and possible scenarios swirl around investigators who have sifted through hundreds of tips or leads over the years. Is this a domestic case, or a professional hit? How did the barrels come to be on a wooded lot near a state park in Allenstown, New Hampshire? Were the four transients? Could they have lived on a commune? Did they live in other state or country? Police have no missing persons report associated with the mysterious case. Ebert, in an interview with CNN on Friday, said he has been open to theories and new evidence since he joined the case a few years ago. He's certain of one thing. ""I believe that there is somebody who knows who these children are and knows what happened to them."" Two horrifying discoveries . During deer season in 1985, a hunter made a grisly discovery on a parcel of private property near Bear Brook State Park, known for its bogs, lakes and trails. A steel drum contained the remains of the woman, estimated to be between ages 23 and 33, and the eldest girl, who was between 5 and 11. Original reports indicated they died of blunt-force trauma. Investigators later determined they were related in some way. State police, who handle nearly all homicide investigations in New Hampshire, notified the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a computerized index that includes such reports. It was believed then that the victims might be a mother and child. ""They came to every person's door and asked, 'Have you heard anything, if you knew anyone that's missing?' "" Allenstown resident Andrea Kelly told told CNN New Hampshire affiliate WMUR this week. '""No, we haven't heard anything.'"" Within one day of the discovery of the bodies, state police were called in to investigate an apparently unrelated slaying of a man in nearby Hookset. Suddenly, that murder became the priority of the police force. ""It took a great number of resources,"" Ebert says of the Hookset investigation. That murder was finally solved eight years ago. New Hampshire, with a population of about 1. 3 million, sees an average of only 20 to 30 homicides a year, according to Ebert. About half are domestic incidents. Policy called for troopers to look into a cold case if they were not working on a current homicide. So, in 2000, an investigator drove to the Allenstown scene to check on the proximity of barrels on the property to a road and a mobile home park close by. The property included a trailer and the remains of a burned camp store. In another barrel, the trooper found two more bodies -- a girl between 1 and 3 and another aged 2 to 4. Tests indicated the woman whose body was found earlier was related to the younger child. So far, the girl between 2 and 4 has not been linked to the woman. Suddenly, everything changed. Instead of a mother and child, police broadcast that they had four victims, meaning old assumptions were gone. ""So much can change in that span"" of time, Ebert says of evidence and investigative leads. Police spoke to between 50 and 100 individuals, including the property owner and residents of the mobile home park. Now the case is getting a fresher look. ""We are reanalyzing each and every person,"" says Ebert. The department, when the NCIC broadcasts went out in 1985 and 2000, was flooded with information. ""We took great pains to rule people out."" The sergeant acknowledges that many may question why it took 15 years to find a second barrel 100 yards from the other. ""How do four people go missing and nobody knows it""? The sergeant cites resources needed for the Hookset murder, the number of people in the major crime unit and the fact that autumn leaves covered much of the property. ""They did the best with what they had at the time,"" he says. Florida school deaths remain mystery . ""I keep an open mind to everything"" Williamson, of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, tells CNN that she and her team are awaiting results of more comprehensive DNA testing of the remains of the woman and young girls. They are being aided by additional autopsy photos not available years ago. Evidence indicates the victims were white, but investigators do not know skin tone or eye color. The bones were not in the best condition, given they were exposed to the elements and years of deterioration, says Williamson. They may have died as early as 1977 or 1978. Joe Mullins, a forensic imaging specialist with the center, used newer technology to make the facial reconstructions. The use of clay directly applied on skulls is no longer necessary. Investigators caution people looking at the reconstructions to focus on specific facial features. ""Don't expect this to look like a Polaroid of the family member,"" says Ebert. Based on evidence and poor dental care, officials believe the four may not have been visible members of society. ""If they interacted with people on regular basis and suddenly disappeared you would expect somebody to say something,"" says Williamson, a forensic scientist. And they may not have been in a traditional family setting. ""I don't think they were regularly in school and went home and had dinner with mom and dad every night,"" says Williamson. Ebert says, although it is a possibility, his hunch is the victims are not from New Hampshire. They could be from Boston, about 90 minutes away. Or Canada. Or more remote portions of the Granite State. ""I keep an open mind to everything,"" Ebert says. Police are not certain whether the victims were killed elsewhere and dumped on the property -- or even when. ""It takes a very certain profile of an individual to kill a child,"" says Ebert, who declined to elaborate on consultation with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit. ""We either haven't reached the family members we need to, or we missing their family members and for their own reasons they are not coming forward."" One day, grave marker may bear names . Ronda Randall and her brother, maintain a blog about the Allenstown case and have provided some information they've gleaned to police. ""This case is so compelling,"" says Randall, who grew up in southern New Hampshire and now lives in Maine. ""This story has been very quiet."" The siblings, who on their website say they do not represent a law enforcement agency, have talked with hundreds of people. Ebert says the pair have been in contact with state police. Randall praises police for their doggedness and said she believes the case will be solved. She believes she and her brother are in a sense a proxy family for the victims. A grave marker at a church cemetery in Allenstown -- a town of about 4,400 east of Concord -- refers only to the first two victims found. ""May their souls find peace in God's loving care,"" the inscription reads. One day, Randall says, she would like the grave marker bear names of the four victims. ""I want to see it resolved."" Social media might have made a difference . The woman and the girls were killed before there was text messaging, Facebook and other forms of social media -- a fact not lost on investigators. And, back in 1985, police did not have a clearinghouse for missing people. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children had been in existence for only one year. Social media is a valuable tool for investigators, says the center's Williamson, who leads a five-member team. ""From the missing side it has helped in a lot of cases,"" she says. ""You can see who perhaps who they were talking to. With teenagers, their friends know more than their families know."" Unlike in 1978 or 1985, people nowadays are extremely connected, be it through cell phones, e-mail or social media. ""If you don't get a text within two hours you might wonder what is going on,"" says Williamson. Still, she cautions, there are still cases today when people ""are not reported missing for various reasons."" Ebert says someone critical to identifying the four victims may not have come forward because of a sense of criminal liability or guilt for not having provided clues sooner. The victims, he says, may have been part of a disjointed family. He hopes the DNA testing may clearly show the relationships among the four victims, providing police and the public more opportunities to identify them. ""It's an awful tragedy to lose a person to a homicide. It is terrible miscarriage of justice not to know who carried out the crime against your loved one."" Williamson and her team are working on 650 cases involving unidentified children. The oldest case is from Arizona, in 1933. Since November 2011, the team has helped identify seven children, one of whom was a victim of Gary Ridgway, the so-called Green River Killer, she says. DNA helped solve the cases. Now Williamson hopes to give a family a sense of closure. ""A good day is giving a child their name back,"" she says. ""And we get very excited.""

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo has attracted much of the spotlight this week, signing a new contract at Real Madrid that reportedly makes him football's best-paid player and netting a hat-trick against Galatasaray in the Champions League. You just knew Lionel Messi, Ronaldo's rival in La Liga, would respond. Messi scored three goals himself to take him closer to Raul's all-time record in Europe's top club competition and Barcelona thumped Ajax 4-0 to earn maximum points at the Camp Nou. For all of its possession in the early stages, Barcelona failed to unlock the Ajax defense until Messi won a free kick at the edge of the box. The Argentine took the free kick and put the ball past a helpless Kenneth Vermeer in the 21st minute to start the rout against the Dutch champion. Messi doubled the advantage with another left-footed finish after good work from midfielder Sergio Busquets in the 55th minute before completing his treble in the 75th. With 62 Champions League goals, the four-time player of the year could match or exceed Raul's tally of 71 sometime this season. Ajax's misery was complete when Victor Valdes saved Kolbeinn Sigthorsson's late penalty. ""It was important to start with a win, especially playing at home,"" Messi told Spain's Canal Plus. ""We know how difficult these Champions League groups always are. In the second half we had the ball and controlled the match. ""We found it tough to pressure them initially because they were moving the ball well out from the back. But I think in general it was a great performance."" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino will now fly back to his native Argentina to be with his family following the death of his father. Barcelona and AC Milan are expected to advance from Group G, and Milan beat poor traveler Celtic 2-0 at the San Siro with two goals in the final seven minutes. One was an own goal by defender Emilio Izaguirre. Milan was far from convincing, with the Scottish champion looking the more threatening throughout. Chelsea stunned . Chelsea has endured a slow start to its league campaign under prodigal son Jose Mourinho but an away loss to Everton on Saturday paled in comparison to Wednesday's 2-1 reverse -- at home -- to Basel. Chelsea, the tournament winner two seasons ago and knocked out in the group stage last December, labored for most of the first half but took the lead on Oscar's low shot to the far corner deep in the first half. Instead of adding to its advantage, Chelsea remained uninspired -- barring Oscar's shot that struck the crossbar -- and paid the price when Mohamed Salah leveled in the 71st. Marco Streller's near-post header 10 minutes later gave Basel the win. Chelsea had eased past Basel 5-2 on aggregate in the Europa League in the spring. ""I'm the manager,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""I'm responsible for everything, especially in the bad moments. ""Tomorrow I will not wake up with a smile on my face but I have to wake up again. ""We have to get the points ... in the Champions League. We don't want to play in the Europa League."" Elsewhere in Group E, Schalke 04 didn't stumble at home, blanking outsider Steaua Bucharest 3-0. Not a good start for Dortmund . Last season's runner-up to Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund endured a miserable evening in Italy, falling 2-1 to Rafael Benitez's Napoli in Group F. Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was shown a red card in first-half stoppage time for handling outside the box and manager Jurgen Klopp was earlier sent to the stands for berating the fourth official. Aaron Ramsey continued his fine form for Arsenal, meanwhile, scoring the second goal in the Gunners' 2-1 win at Marseille after the Londoners' fluent passing game failed to click in the first half. In Group H, Atletico Madrid beat Zenit St. Petersburg 3-1 to maintain its impressive home record in Europe and FC Porto edged debutant Austria Vienna 1-0.","Lionel Messi moves closer to matching Raul's record in the Champions League .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- It is the most high-profile meeting in all of Asia this year. China's President Xi Jinping will spend three days in India on an official state visit this week, getting a considerable amount of time with Narendra Modi, India's new prime minister. The two leaders represent not only the two most populous countries on Earth --accounting for a third of the world's population -- they are also the faces of stark changes in their home countries. Both are new, strong, willful leaders with an agenda for reform. Both have made moves to attack a culture of corruption, and to build their economies. And both seem to have designs on being stronger players in their backyards. What will their meeting mean for relations between these two Asian giants? Made in China & India . In an editorial published in The Hindu newspaper Wednesday, China's Xi described how his country could exchange its expertise in infrastructure and manufacturing for India's advancements in information technology and pharmaceuticals. ""The combination of 'the world's factory' and 'the world's back office' will produce the most competitive production base and the most attractive consumer market,"" wrote Xi. This would be an upgrade in current relations, where China has a significant surplus in bilateral trade. Modi, in turn, in a press conference Tuesday talked up the potential of a great partnership: ""Whenever India and China have worked and grown together, this has also led to the development and economic prosperity of the world,"" he said. There are indeed a number of potential synergies. And India has much to learn from China, as I've written previously. According to the World Economic Forum's latest Global Competitiveness Rankings -- an indicator of how business friendly a country is -- China places 28th in the world for overall competitiveness; India ranks 71st. On infrastructure and macroeconomic environment, China ranks 46th and 10th respectively; India tanks 87th and 101st. In many of his recent speeches, Modi has referred to India's rotting infrastructure. Supply chains are broken; institutions are inefficient; large swathes of Indians are disconnected from modernity. India needs money and expertise to fix these problems. That's where China could come in. One of the expected headlines from Xi's visit is an announcement to the effect of $100 billion of Chinese investment into India. If that actually happens, the world's two biggest countries by population could finally begin to realize the potential of their partnership. China may be India's biggest trading partner, but China counts Europe, the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and even Brazil as more important partners right now. Given the the two countries share a large border, India will want that status to change. For China, too, there are clear upsides to increasing trade with a neighbor that has growing economic needs and clout. Regional aspirations . Beyond the rhetoric of business camaraderie, there are fears the two country's regional aspirations could represent a hurdle. Indian media reported on Tuesday a minor border skirmish between Indian and Chinese forces in Ladakh. While border scuffles between the two countries have been largely quelled since India and China fought a war in 1962, both sides have made foreign policy moves that have caused angst. In the past week alone, China's Xi Jinping visited, for the first time, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. In both countries -- close neighbors of India's -- Xi announced large-scale infrastructure projects and deepened ties. Many Indian analysts see China's economic encircling of India as something to be wary of. But meanwhile, India itself has made moves that have irked the Chinese. India's President Pranab Mukherjee visited Vietnam this week, calling the ties between the two countries historic and ""infinite."" Vietnam has long had turbulent relations with China. And earlier this month, much was made of Modi's five-day visit to Japan. Both sides announced increased trade and investment, and have held joint military exercises -- a clear signal to China that it won't have a clear route to supremacy in Asia. Hedging bets . Both Xi and Modi seem to be foreign policy realists, pragmatic in their world view and partnerships. In his aforementioned column this week, Xi spoke of a world moving towards ""multipolarity"" -- a reference to the dwindling influence of the United States, and the increasingly important role of China and India. If both leaders abide by that theme, then their focus for the next few months and years will be not on rocking the boat on military or defense, but on building their respective economies. For both Modi and Xi, foreign policy begins at home. For that, they will need each others' cooperation.","Leaders of world's most populous countries meet in India this week .

"(CNN) -- The bid process has been by far the most controversial that FIFA has ever overseen. Its decision to decide the fate of both the 2018 and 2022 bids at the same time has been widely criticized for encouraging vote collusion between bids -- an accusation FIFA deny. But it was the revelations by the British newspaper the Sunday Times that has marred the process. Undercover journalists secretly filmed two members of FIFA's then 24-strong executive committee allegedly offering to sell their votes. Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti were both suspended by FIFA's ethics panel following the revelations, reducing the voting number to 22. The same ethics panel also cleared the Qatar 2022 and the Spain-Portugal 2018 bid from colluding to vote for each other, allegations that had been made following the Sunday Times investigation. Another investigation by the British press, closer to the bid date, has made further uncomfortable accusations about three other FIFA members. Last Monday the BBC alleged that Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football, Nicolas Leoz, president of the South American football confederation and Ricardo Teixeira, head of the Brazilian football association, all took bribes during the 1990s. The finding by FIFA is just the latest chapter in the ongoing story of the World Cup bidding process which crescendos with the vote on Thursday. Bribery scandal shows that FIFA must change .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona judge declared a mistrial in the penalty phase of the Jodi Arias trial Thursday after a deadlocked jury said it couldn't decide whether to sentence her to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend. That means a new jury will be chosen, but the first-degree murder conviction still stands. A retrial for the penalty phase will begin on July 18, Judge Sherry Stephens said. A status conference has been scheduled for June 20. Since Tuesday, jurors had been deliberating whether Arias, 32, should get a death sentence for murdering ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in 2008. A source with knowledge of the jury's vote said there was an 8-4 split in favor of sentencing Arias to death. Jurors refused to talk to the media and immediately left the courtroom. The hung jury brought to a close a dramatic chapter in a high-profile case that has lasted for months, drawing spectators who lined up for courtroom seats and waited anxiously outside the courthouse. But the closely watched trial isn't over yet. In many states, the death penalty would be off the table if the jury couldn't agree. Not Arizona. ""It's a very unusual circumstance, but it is part of Arizona statute that yes, if you get to this third phase, the penalty phase, and there is a hung jury, it means another jury comes in,"" said CNN's Ashleigh Banfield, who has covered the Arias trial from the outset. In a written statement, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said prosecutors ""will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase."" ""We appreciate the jury's work in the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial and now we will assess, based upon available information, what the next steps will be,"" he said. Legal experts debate what's next . Speculation surged that prosecutors might consider offering Arias a plea deal rather than going through the lengthy steps necessary to find new jurors and present evidence to them. ""I don't think by any means that this is a sure thing you retry the penalty phase,"" said Mark Geragos, a criminal defense attorney. A lot depends, he said, on exactly how many jurors were willing to go with the death penalty this time around. ""If it was 11 to 1 ... for death, you can be sure the prosecutor is going to want a retrial. If it tilted the other way ... they may just decide, 'No, we're not going to do that, we'll try and cut a deal,' "" he said. Another key step for prosecutors will be speaking with Alexander's family to decide whether to proceed, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said. ""The prosecutors have to speak to the family, because we know this family has been in the courtroom day in and day out. They were visibly shaken and upset when this hung jury came back,"" she said. ""And so there's no question in my mind that it's premature to say this will, indeed, go to another penalty phase."" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said that prosecutors have little motivation to agree to a plea deal that offers Arias a life sentence. If the prosecution won in a retrial, he said, Arias would receive the death penalty. But even if they lost, she would probably get ""the same life sentence she would obtain in a negotiated deal,"" he said. ""The only real roadblock to a penalty retrial would be the strong request of the victim's family to accept to a plea and end the process now,"" he said. ""I think such a request unlikely."" Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury's inability to agree on a sentence was announced. Arias appeared to be on the verge of tears. One of Alexander's sisters sobbed. Even the normally stoic judge's voice cracked as she dismissed jurors. ""Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the participants in this trial, I wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community,"" she told them. ""This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities."" An alternate juror and a juror who was on the panel cried as the verdict was being read. As the jury filed out of the courtroom, one juror said, ""I'm sorry"" to Alexander's family. Jurors struggle to agree . Jurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they wouldn't be able to agree on a verdict. Earlier this month, the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that Arias was ""exceptionally cruel"" when she stabbed Travis Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. They pronounced her guilty of first-degree murder on May 8 after 15 hours of deliberations. For Arias to be sentenced to death, a jury's decision must be unanimous. About an hour into its deliberations on Thursday, the jury sent out a question, but the details of its query were not revealed in court. On Wednesday morning, the jury sent out a note saying its members couldn't agree. Stephens told them to try again and ordered them back into the jury room. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state of Arizona. Haven't been following the trial? Read this . A plea for mercy . On Tuesday, Arias pleaded with jurors to spare her. She told them she would dedicate her time in prison to performing acts of charity from behind bars. She said she would teach people to read or to speak Spanish, start a book club and donate her hair so it could be used to make wigs for sick children. She showed jurors several pieces of her artwork. She called Alexander's murder ""the worst mistake"" she had ever made, ""the worst thing I've ever done."" She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime, Arias told the jury. ""But I know that I was,"" she said. ""And for that I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer."" A case packed with twists and turns . Arias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex. Arias became his girlfriend two months later, she testified. They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women. In June 2008, Alexander missed two appointments, prompting friends to go to his house. They found his naked body crammed in a stand-up shower . He had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head. His throat was slit. After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped. Relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable. The trial, which started in January, has been rife with sex, lies and digital images -- among them graphic autopsy photos that showed Alexander's body. Now, if the trial continues, some of the same gruesome details of his slaying may be presented again in court. ""Because in order for a jury to actually impose the death penalty, they really need to see the cruelty,"" criminal defense attorney Ashleigh Merchant told HLN. ""And they really need to understand the motives behind this murder and what great lengths she went to -- to actually cover this up."" HLNTV.com: Friend of Arias tweeting on her behalf .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sophisticated submarine-like boats are the latest tool drug runners are using to bring cocaine north from Colombia, U.S. officials say. Semi-submersible boats used to smuggle drugs are gaining in quality, the Coast Guard says. Although the vessels were once viewed as a quirky sideshow in the drug war, they are becoming faster, more seaworthy, and capable of carrying bigger loads of drugs than earlier models, according to those charged with catching them. ""They tend to be one of a kind,"" U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen said. ""They cost up to a million dollars to produce. Sometimes they are put together in pieces and then reassembled in other locations. They're very difficult to locate."" The boats are built in the Colombian jungle. They sail largely beneath the surface of the water but cannot submerge completely like a true submarine. But they are the latest escalation of a tactical race between smugglers and the U.S. Coast Guard. In the past three months the Coast Guard has learned of more semi-submersible vessels smuggling drugs than it did in the previous six years, when there were 23 cases, officials said.  Watch the Coast Guard chase down a semi-sub » . U.S. Coast Guard intelligence officers predict 85 cases this year and 120 next year. In some instances, the semi-subs are towed behind other vessels and are scuttled if they are detected, Allen said. Authorities are investigating reports that some semi-subs are unmanned and are operated remotely, he said. Diplomatic agreements give the U.S. Coast Guard drug-interdiction jurisdiction in partner countries' waters. Encounters have become so frequent -- and the dangers of boarding the vessels so pronounced -- that the Coast Guard is pushing for legislation that would make the use of ""unflagged"" semi-submersibles in international waters a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison, even if authorities can't recover drug evidence because the smugglers scuttle the transports. ""There's really no legitimate use for a vessel like this,"" Allen said. An unflagged vessel is one not registered with a government. Allen believes the semi-subs are a response to the Coast Guard's tactic of using snipers in helicopters to shoot out engines on smugglers' speedboats. The submersibles' engines are beneath water level. ""We're seeing an evolution in the construction,"" he said. ""Early on we saw fiberglass and now we're seeing steel."" Early semi-subs were capable of carrying 4 or 5 metric tons of cargo; newer ones can carry 12 metric tons, Allen said. Their speed has increased to 12 knots, which is ""a pretty good speed on the ocean."" Despite the increase in the use of the semi-subs, Drug Enforcement Administration officials say most drugs still are transported by traditional methods -- fishing boats, speedboats and airplanes. But Frankie Shroyer, deputy chief of the DEA's Office of Enforcement Operations, called the use of semi-subs ""an emerging threat and we are attacking it through our investigations and working with the interagency community."" The DEA's main focus, however, ""is to dismantle entire organizations,"" he said. ""So we are looking at the organizations that are building these things. ... These are the same organizations that are using containers, the same organizations that are using airplanes, same organizations using go-fast boats."" Allen said the Coast Guard, the Department of Defense and others are working on how to board the vessels. ""In many cases, they don't stop. And it's difficult to slow them down,"" he said. The Coast Guard says drug runners also are resorting to putting refueling vessels far offshore so drug-carrying boats can avoid coastal areas, and even liquefying cocaine and concealing it in fuel. The semi-subs are ""another adaptation ... that we're going to have to adapt to ourselves,"" Allen said. Last year, the Coast Guard seized a record 355,000 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $4.7 billion -- a 2 percent increase over 2006. The Coast Guard's largest cocaine bust ever came in 2007 -- 42,845 pounds stacked in large bundles on the deck of a freighter off the coast of Panama.

"(CNN) -- While Western banking's reputation was tarnished in the wake of the global economic crisis, Islamic finance is being touted by some as a more ethical alternative, with the potential to appeal to customers beyond its Muslim base. What sets Islamic finance apart from other models is that it complies with Sharia moral and religious law, including not charging or paying interest. And with more than 700 Islamic financial institutions around the world, the sector is already worth up to $1.3 trillion globally. CNN's Jim Boulden sat down with Atif Hanif, Islamic Finance specialist and partner at Allen & Overy, to discuss what Islamic finance really is and where it is growing. CNN: How would you describe Islamic finance? Atif Hanif: Islamic finance is an alternative form of finance. It is something that is trying to cater to a particular segment of the population, in this case the Muslim segment, because they are ethically constrained from participating in the conventional banking industry. But the aim is to try and offer to this segment as much as possible of what is available in the conventional sphere -- so in terms of your regular financial services and products, but overlaying that with certain rules which are derived from the Islamic jurisprudence. And the chief among these rules will obviously be the prohibition of charging and paying interest. CNN: I imagine those who're trying to offer these products are trying to explain that they're not just Islamic, they're just different. AH: Absolutely -- I think that's the way they are being pitched, and you know, 20 years ago, yes it was very exotic, but I think these days they're much more a feature of the global financial industry. CNN: Do you think we will see an exponential growth in this? AH: Certainly where I sit I can see Islamic finance moving into newer markets. It's coming out of its sort of traditional dominion in the Gulf and Malaysia and moving into places like North Africa, Central Asia, and also Western Europe to some extent. CNN: Is it going to be a slow growth? What would be your projection? AH: You have to look at a number of factors behind what drives growth in these markets. One, obviously, is the population. I think the second factor is that there are political issues around what's happening in those markets. There's uncertainty; we've all seen what's happening in Libya. It's places like Bangladesh and Pakistan -- a significant population in both countries, and particularly in the case of Pakistan, a case of instability in the last 10 to 20 years. If that ever gets resolved, who knows? That could be a very fertile land for growth. And there's obviously India in the middle, which is not an Islamic country but again has a huge Muslim population, which is a potential growth area. CNN: Malaysia and Indonesia are obvious places, and I know it's growing, but I wonder if there's a lot of untapped potential there as well? AH: Malaysia is very well established. I think that's a very mature market and they are one of, I would say, the pioneers of this industry. So there doesn't seem to be that much further room to grow in Malaysia. But Indonesia is largely untapped. I mean, the Indonesian government is moving in that direction. They have passed some legislation, I understand, to try and facilitate Islamic banking. And some of the Malaysian clients that I work with, the Malaysian banks, they see Indonesia as the last frontier for them to expand their operations and grow.","Islamic finance is Sharia compliant and doesn't charge or pay interest .

"(CNN) -- A mother who says she was harassed and humiliated by employees while breastfeeding her baby at a Target store in Texas last month prompted a nationwide ""nurse-in"" on Wednesday to show support for the public practice. Michelle Hickman, 35, says she was nursing her 5-month-old infant at a Webster Target when several employees asked her to move to the fitting room. Texas law allows for breastfeeding in private or public, but Hickman says the employees continued to direct her to the dressing room even after she mentioned her rights. ""I was sitting down in the store in a remote area,"" Hickman told CNN anchor Isha Sesay on Wednesday. ""Not a single person came by that was a customer and I was completely covered with a large blanket. So I don't see how they find it that offensive."" Target said it has a longstanding policy of supporting breastfeeding in its stores. ""Guests who choose to breastfeed in public areas of the store are welcome to do so without being made to feel uncomfortable,"" Target spokeswoman Jessica Carlson told CNN. ""Additionally, we support the use of fitting rooms for women who wish to breastfeed their babies, even if others are waiting to use the fitting rooms,"" her statement read. ""We continually educate our team members in stores across the country on store policies to ensure all guests have a great experience. We worked with this guest directly to address her concerns and are sorry any inconvenience it has caused,"" Carlson said. In a show of solidarity with Hickman, women from Kansas to North Carolina to Florida held ""nurse-ins"" at Target stores. In Wilmington, North Carolina, more than a dozen women sat comfortably on the ground with their legs crossed while nursing their babies, most of whom were covered by wraps or blankets. Similar scenes played out at Target stores in Sarasota, Florida; Wichita, Kansas; and Houston. ""Things like this are really wonderful because it takes a lot of mother-to-mother support and even though none of us know the mother in Texas, it's just a matter of everyone pulling together and saying, it is OK, don't feel bad about it,"" Emily Barnhill, mother of an 18-month-old boy, told CNN Wilmington affiliate WECT. A Facebook page created to show support for Hickman called ""Target Nurse-In"" had nearly 7,000 members by late Wednesday. ""Let's show them just how many mamas they've offended. We have the right to shop and meet our babies' needs while doing so,"" the Facebook pages ""about me"" section said. ""Public humiliation for doing so will not be tolerated,"" it added. Earlier this year, a Utah woman breastfeeding in a Whole Foods sparked a nationwide ""nurse-in"" after she said she was asked by employees to move locations. In early December, a nursing mother in Brighton, United Kingdom, invited a nursing ""flash mob"" to join her after she was told to stop nursing her baby in a cafe.","Protests held at Target stores across country .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a couple's little getaway, on a little plane, from upstate New York to the Florida coast. It turned into a tragedy. The saga of the single-engine TBM-700 aircraft also turned into an international incident, spurring both the United States and Cuba to dispatch fighter jets to trail the plane after it went radio silent. So what happened? Why might a plane's crew go unresponsive for over four hours, drifting southward over the U.S. mainland, the Atlantic and eventually into the Caribbean as it did? The North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, tweeted it might have been a case of hypoxia, a condition that sets in when a person doesn't get enough oxygen -- as can happen if there's an airflow problem high in the sky. What is hypoxia? The best clues, so far, lie in what U.S. fighter jet pilots saw as they looked into the aircraft: the pilot slumped over and the windows frosted over. Then there was the radio communication, which the Federal Aviation Administration says ended around 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the plane was somewhere above Statesville, North Carolina, about 600 miles south of the Rochester, New York, airport it left from around 8:45 a.m. destined for Naples, Florida. The pilot asks to descend to 18,000 feet because ""we have an indication that is not correct in the plane,"" according to a stream of that transmission posted on LiveATC.net. The air traffic controller told the pilot to ""stand by,"" then to proceed to 25,000 feet as he works on clearing the plane to go lower. The conversation continues off-and-on for over four minutes, though it's largely one-sided: The pilot isn't clear in his remarks, nor does he ever declare any sort of emergency. At one point, he simply repeats his call sign twice when the controller asks if he heard the request to drop down to 20,000 feet. Data indicates the plane didn't drop. It cruised for hours some 25,000-feet above the ground. Until sometime before 2:15 p.m., that is, by which point estimates suggested the fuel would have run out. The aircraft, by then, had slowed considerably -- down to 176 knots (200 mph), from a consistent 308 knots for most of its flight. And it stopped altogether after crashing 14 miles off Jamaica's northeast coast. Larry, Jane Glazers' children 'devastated' The watery crash spurred Jamaica and the United States to swiftly dispatch government aircraft to the scene. By early evening, Jamaican authorities had found an oil slick in the prime search area that -- at that point -- was the only possible sign of the downed aircraft, according to Maj. Basil Jarrett of the Jamaica Defense Force. This differs from earlier reports that a ""wreckage field"" had been spotted. ""(The search) is fairly unpredictable given the size of the area and given the conditions out there,"" said Jarrett, who said the operation would stop at nightfall before resuming Saturday morning with assistance from a U.S. Coast Guard cutter. ""It's very difficult to say what we will be able to recover and when."" As they searched, the Glazer family of Rochester, New York, mourned. The U.S. Coast Guard issued a statement indicating there were ""three people reportedly aboard"" the plane. Yet Scott Fybush, the family spokesman and also the Glazers' nephew, said he believed the couple were the only people on the plane, with Larry Glazer flying the couple toward their vacation home in Florida. While there was no official announcement immediately on the fate of those on the plane, the Glazers' children said in a statement they were ""devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents."" Politicians in New York hailed the couple for their business and charitable endeavors, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo calling them ""innovative and generous people who were committed to revitalizing downtown Rochester and making the city they loved a better place for all."" Larry Glazer co-founded Buckingham Properties in 1970, a year after graduating from Columbia University. According to his official bio, the company owns and manages more than 50 properties totaling over 9 million square feet in the Greater Rochester area. Jane Glazer founded QCI Direct, a 100-employee company that has an outlet store and makes ""two national retail catalogs mailed to 35 million people annually,"" according to its website. A post on Women Entrepreneurs Blog, which is produced in conjunction with the University of Rochester's business school, notes that she ran the New York City Marathon, did whitewater rafting and learned how to fly a plane -- all in addition to raising three children and building her business. The Glazers' children acknowledged late Friday afternoon that they ""too are waiting for answers."" As they do, they took the chance to remember their parents and to express appreciation to those who were quick to offer condolences. ""They loved and appreciated the opportunity to help build the community of Rochester, and we thank everyone in the community for their expressions of support,"" the children said. U.S., Cuban fighter jets trail aircraft . While authorities don't know everything that went on inside the plane, including what caused it to crash, they have spoken about what they did in response. The government response started with those air traffic control communications -- and the alarming lack thereof. The unresponsiveness spurred NORAD to dispatch two F-16 fighter jets set from McEntire Joint National Guard Base in Richland County, South Carolina, to investigate. NORAD said another pair of fighter jets out of Homestead, Florida -- F-15s -- took over around 11:30 a.m. and escorted the plane as it continued south past the U.S. mainland. The American fighter jets broke off their pursuit 12 miles off Cuba, at which point the TBM-700 plane was still cruising at about 25,000 feet. A Cuban fighter jet took over trailing the aircraft as it flew near that Caribbean island, according to NORAD. Their longstanding public enmity notwithstanding, Cuba was cooperating fully with the United States on the matter and did not consider the plane's movement a violation of its airspace, according to a Cuban source involved in conversations between the two nations. The Cuban government even let the U.S. Coast Guard's C-130 aircraft go through its airspace and also gave permission for American ""military aircraft, if necessary,"" according to an official statement. But none of these efforts, from either of these countries, could do anything about the doomed TBM-700 aircraft before it dropped off radar -- according to the flight tracking site, FlightAware.com -- at 2:11 p.m. Both Glazers knew how to fly, although Fybush said Jane Glazer's ability to fly legally may have lapsed. The plane itself was owned by Larry Glazer's company, Buckingham Properties. It was built by the French manufacturer Daher-Socata and powered by one Pratt and Whitney engine. 1999: Evidence Payne Stewart's plane lost pressure before crash . 2012: Small plane with unresponsive pilot crashes into Gulf of Mexico .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman faces welfare fraud charges as she's accused of not reporting money earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress. ""While applying for public aid, the mother of 14 children allegedly failed to disclose that she was also getting checks for personal appearances and residuals from videos,"" said a news release from Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey on Monday. Suleman -- known in tabloids as ""Octomom"" -- has not been arrested, but she has been ordered to appear before a Los Angeles County judge for her initial arraignment Friday, according to the district attorney's office. The prosecutor will ask the judge to set a $25,000 bond, the release said. The charges of one count of aid by misrepresentation and two counts of perjury by false application for aid accuse Suleman of not reporting nearly $30,000 in earnings. From June: Suleman books stripper gigs to save home . Her work was no secret, though. Suleman, 38, performed in adult videos and danced topless at a Florida strip club last year. ""This is not a new career for her,"" her rep, Gina Rodriguez, told CNN in June when asked about her stripping gig. ""She is just promoting her new video."" An adult video featuring Suleman was released in June. Suleman revealed in April that she was so determined to build a future for her 14 young children that she would accept adult entertainment offers, although she would not touch another ""human's flesh."" ""I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money,"" Suleman told CNN's Nischelle Turner. ""I would not kiss somebody. I wouldn't touch somebody."" Suleman, who collected food stamps to feed her 14 young children, filed for bankruptcy in May, but the case was tossed out of court because of paperwork issues. Suleman dreams of building a business ""empire"" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children, she told Turner. She ultimately hopes to become a role model for other women facing major struggles, she said. ""I've got to win the battle,"" she said. ""But right now, people don't understand that."" The criminal complaint, filed by Deputy District Attorney William Clark with the public assistance fraud division, said Suleman applied for public assistance in Lancaster, California, in January 2013. It alleges that she failed to report the extra income earned between in the first six months of last year. Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.

"(CNN) -- Five law enforcement officers were among 70 people in Arkansas charged in a federal drug-trafficking crackdown that also involved public corruption charges, authorities said Tuesday. The five officers took bribes to look the other way while crimes were being committed, authorities said. Investigators are continuing to look at other law agencies for criminal misconduct, authorities said. On Tuesday, 800 federal and local authorities arrested 51 of the 70 people, officials said. Five others were already in custody, and the remaining 14 defendants are considered fugitives, authorities said. The Arkansas National Guard was also involved in making the arrests, authorities said. One agent was shot while serving warrants, and he is hospitalized with injuries that are not life-threatening, authorities said. The law enforcement figures named in indictments are Helena-West Helena Police Department officer Herman Eaton, 46; Helena-West Helena officer Robert ""Bam Bam"" Rogers, 35; Helena-West Helena Sgt. Marlene Kalb, 48; Marvell police officer Robert Wahls, 42; and former Phllips County Deputy Sheriff Winston Dean Jackson, 44, who's now a Helena-West Helena police officer, according to court records and a prosecutors' statement. Their attorneys couldn't be immediately determined or reached for comment. A two-year investigation, called Operation Delta Blues, focused on public corruption, cocaine and crack cocaine trafficking, and money laundering in the Helena-West Helena and Marianna, Arkansas, areas, authorities said. Investigators used 16 court-authorized wiretaps in their investigation, officials said. ""Today's indictments and arrests are merely the beginning. We believe there are more cases of corruption, and we intend to press forward with our investigation to weed out those who would sacrifice their oath and violate the public's trust,"" said Valerie Parlave, special agent in charge of the Little Rock field office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ""Several of those indicted today are no strangers to law enforcement. Many have been charged in state court with some of the serious class (of) felonies, including murder,"" Parlave continued. ""Yet they remain free today. As our investigation moves forward, we continue to find instances where these violent felonies were never completely prosecuted and some of the most serious charges were dropped."" Added U.S. Attorney Christopher R. Thyer of the Eastern District of Arkansas, ""Our commitment to eradicating drug trafficking and violent crime has never been stronger. ""When these two elements are mixed with law enforcement corruption, it can make for the perfect storm in a community. It can paralyze honest law enforcement action, silence witnesses, and erode public confidence in our system of justice,"" Thyer said in a written statement.

"Washington (CNN) -- Taxes, religion and education -- this politically charged trifecta divided the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case involving a state school choice program. At issue is a lawsuit challenging Arizona's tax breaks for voluntary donations benefiting private school scholarships. The 13-year-old program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax breaks for money given to ""school tuition organizations,"" or STOs. Some Arizona taxpayers challenged the program as unconstitutional because, they say, not-for-profit religious organizations award most of the scholarships, and require children to enroll in religious schools. Those opponents say the state has effectively been funneling taxpayer money to religious schools through a third-party ""front"" group. The justices appeared torn over whether that represented a de facto ""endorsement"" of religion by Arizona. ""The state could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of religion-- could not say, if you are a Catholic you don't get these tuition vouchers,"" said Justice Elena Kagan, who was impressive in her command of the complex issues argued. ""But what the state has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that uses intermediaries that can make exactly that distinction, that can say-- sorry, if you are a Catholic you don't get scholarships out of our STO."" One key issue for the court is whether the tax credit means the donated amount is the government's money or an individual's. ""There is a very important philosophical point here. You think that all the money belongs to the government, except to the extent that it deigns to allow private people to keep some of it,"" Justice Samuel Alito told a lawyer for the taxpayer plaintiffs. ""They don't owe it to the government if they have made this contribution. That's the whole point."" Besides the church-state questions, the high court must decide whether individual residents have ""standing"" to sue the state, even if they do not donate to the scholarship program. That could be the key legal point the justices decide to tackle, aside from the larger state-action debate. The growing popularity of school choice plans around the country has raised fresh legal questions about whether Arizona's plan is religion-neutral, and whether parents have true decision-making power, free from government intervention. A federal appeals court ruled the decade-old lawsuit could proceed. In 2002, the Supreme Court separately upheld school voucher programs. Supporters of the Arizona aid program say theirs is no different from the Cleveland program approved eight years ago, because in both cases, government does not direct any money to religious schools. Arizonans can receive a $500 credit ($1,000 for a couple filing jointly) off their state income taxes for contributions to school tuition organizations, which operate as charities. These organizations must spend at least 90 percent of money received on scholarships, and must offer them to students at more than one school. Parents would apply for the tax-credit funded scholarships at either a religious or secular school. State figures show more than 50 school tuition organizations had received about $400 million in contributions through last year. In 2009 the program provided 27,000 scholarships to 373 schools, with most going to students who would not have been able to afford to attend. An Arizona Republic newspaper investigation found that of the $54 million in scholarships awarded in 2008, 93 percent went to students attending religious schools. Four Arizona taxpayers had sued the state and some of the largest school tuition organizations. The plaintiffs are represented by various outside groups including the American Civil Liberties Union. In oral arguments, the divided bench struggled over whether these four Arizona taxpayers could claim they were directly affected by how the scholarship money was spent, and whether the program was funded by money from the government or private contributors. Arguing for the Obama administration, Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal defended the state program, saying parents ultimately control where the scholarship money is spent. ""If you placed an electronic tag to track and monitor each cent that the [suing taxpayers] pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a cent, would go into any religious school's coffers,"" he said. Several left-leaning justices appeared unconvinced. Echoing the arguments of the taxpayer plaintiffs, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, ""Either you pay it to the state [in taxes] or you use it for this [school] purpose, but it's the state's money and it's given you by its largesse, the right to redirect it."" ""Does anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this scheme?"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked the government lawyer. ""The Establishment Clause will be unenforceable unless we recognize taxpayer standing."" ""Suppose that an STO -- this is a hypothetical case -- discriminated on the basis of race. No Hispanic or no white or no black can receive our money,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could well prove the deciding vote in this appeal. ""Don't you think a strong argument can be made that it can be attributed to the state,"" allowing a private individual discrimination claim to be made. ""The state has all sorts of rules about what an STO has to be. The state provides the mechanism through the credit for the funding."" Kagan added, ""There are STOs that make these distinctions that clearly would be impermissible if the state administered the program."" Paul Bender, attorney for the plaintiffs by contrast, faced tough questioning from several conservative justices over the state action. ""How is it discriminating on the basis of religion if the STO doesn't care whether it goes to a religious school or not? It's treated the same?"" asked Chief Justice John Roberts. ""That doesn't matter. If the state's grantee cares, that's unconstitutional,"" said Bender, an Arizona State University professor. ""This is a government spending program. Is there any doubt about that? The money in this program is not private charitable contributions."" ""It's a great leap to say that it's government funds, that any money the government doesn't take from me because it gives me a deduction, is government money,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""This money has never been in the government's coffers. The government has declined to take this money."" Taxpayers are generally limited in their ability to claim constitutional wrongdoing over government spending. A special class was carved by the high court 42 years ago for some kinds of disputes related to the First Amendment's prohibition on government ""establishment of religion."" The current cases are Arizona Christian School Tuition Org. v. Winn (09-987) and Garriott v. Winn (09-991). A ruling is expected sometime next year.","Arizona gives tax credits for money donated for private school scholarships .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- He hasn't even been sworn in, yet India's next Prime Minister has already changed the world's biggest democracy. Narendra Modi's stunning, crushing victory at the polls this week reverses a trend that was beginning to define India -- the localization of politics. Since independence in 1947, with each passing year there have been new and increasingly influential regional parties catering to local interests, cultures, languages, beliefs, castes, religions. The result has been a steady dilution of power: in three decades, no single party has been able to form a national government on its own. Instead, New Delhi witnessed the formation of a series of coalitions, sometimes beholden to the whims of fringe members. That trend has now been destroyed. Indians -- be they Bihari or Gujarati, urban or rural, young or old -- have channeled their yearnings for a better-run country into one vision, one man, and one party. Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) now has a resounding mandate to make clear, single-minded decisions. There are indeed hurdles to legislation -- for example, the BJP is not well-represented in the country's upper house of parliament -- but such is the force of the Modi wave right now, few would want to get in the way. READ MORE: Who is Narendra Modi? In recent years, the India story has soured; as I've written previously, Indians have bought into Modi's rhetoric of being someone who can turn things around. So, what are the big issues Modi's team need to deliver on? Here are three ways the new Prime Minister can address the things holding back India Inc. Bring the nation's infrastructure into the 21st century: Given India's ambitions, and all the talk of India as a global power, consider where the country actually stands. According to the World Economic Forum's Annual Report on Competitiveness, India ranks 85th in the world for basic infrastructure like roads and public services. On technological readiness, India -- the world's so-called I.T. back-office -- ranks 98th. On softer infrastructural issues like education and health, India ranks 102nd in the world. Indians have cast their votes this year demanding to see tangible improvements. For example, India has world-class ports; but its roads are so poor that transporting goods becomes prohibitively expensive. Or consider food: One-third of all food produced in India is spoiled and rendered useless before it reaches a consumer. India's supply-chain mechanisms are blighted by a lack of infrastructure and a system of middle men who delay delivery and force up prices. Modi will need to use a lot of political capital to clean up these systems. Some of these could be done quickly; some will take decades. Modi will need clear visions for short and long-term goals, perhaps involving the private sector to find solutions. Make it easier to do business in India: Ask any investor anywhere in the world about working in India and you'll hear a familiar sigh. Few countries impose as many restrictions and hurdles, and almost none require as many permits, permissions, and bribes to start a business. As I wrote earlier this week, the World Bank ranks India 134th in the world for ease of doing business. It's a shocking label to carry, especially for a nation of India's lofty aspirations. One of Modi's greatest selling points has been his track record and energy in processing requests for new ventures; he has flung open his home state's doors to big business. Modi will be expected to do the same on a national scale. It seems like a logical progression, but adapting to the scale and diversity of this country will be a challenge. In Gujarat he kept some of the most important portfolios all to himself: home, industry, information, ports, general administration, science and technology, and climate change. Put simply, he hoarded power. This will be next to impossible to do at the national level, at least not to the same extent. OPINION: Does Narendra Modi threaten secular and liberal India? Modi will need to pick his deputies well, and learn to delegate. He will need to quickly appreciate the diversity of opinion in India -- even though its people were unified enough to give him an absolute majority. Most of all, he will need to find ways and inducements to bring powerful state leaders on board -- without them, he too will find out why so many businessmen have begun to give up on India Inc. Clamp down on corruption: The writer Gurcharan Das says that in India one encounters ""birth-to-death"" corruption: you pay a bribe to get a birth certificate, and you pay another bribe to get a death certificate. Along the way, life becomes a long series of bribe-taking and bribe-giving -- everyone is complicit. Quite simply, Modi will need to clamp down brutally on corruption, even if it means outing a few skeletons in his own party's closets. Momentum is key here. Modi could probably derive some inspiration from China under President Xi Jinping, which has been on a ruthless drive to out corrupt leaders. But the impacts of corruption in India permeate far deeper than they do in China. It is said that India's ""informal"" sector generates half of the nation's GDP, and accounts for nine-tenths of its jobs. What this means is that much of India's real income is not properly accounted for. For all his rhetoric about small government, Modi will need to find a way to expand the government's coffers if he wants to fund big infrastructural projects. Consider this: only 3% of Indians are eligible to pay income taxes. Of the ones who are eligible, many find loopholes to exploit. This will be a difficult culture to change. Part of Modi's challenge will be to make a case for why his decisions will be beneficial in the long term, even if they cause pain right now. Certain subsidies -- such as those for diesel and kerosene -- will need to be slashed. The BJP's supporters will balk. Modi will need to find the courage to stay the course. One could go on about the many big-ticket issues Modi will need to tackle: health care, foreign policy -- not least relations with the United States -- education, jobs, defense, but the ones I elaborate on above are the ones Modi has been talking about the most -- and those are the ones he will be judged on in his first 100 days in office. One caveat: Checks and balances may seem like hindrances, but overall, they are vital to the security of people. Even with his undisputed mandate, Modi will encounter all kinds of checks -- on religious freedoms, on the judiciary, on constitutional rights, on human rights. On all these issues he will need to display patience and appreciation of the system, and a compassion and deftness of touch he has often failed to display in his home state. Perhaps that will be his biggest internal challenge: to be strong, and yet be willing to appreciate the importance of dissent in a healthy democracy. Indians will give him a lot of time to adjust -- but not forever.

"(CNN) -- As demand for the latest smartphones and other mobile devices soars to a fever pitch, more retailers are jockeying to snatch up older gadgets. Electronics chain Best Buy, Web auction house eBay and most major cellular carriers have either launched or ramped up their trade-in programs in recent months. Each of them, along with myriad startups, wants a bite of the huge resale market. How much you get for an old phone or other gadget depends on a variety of factors, including its age, its condition and how in demand the particular brand is. For example, a newer iPhone model will net you much more than a 3-year-old Windows Mobile smartphone. Retailers have a word for this cultural trend toward perpetual buying of newer consumer technology: upgrades. And as these consumers look to upgrade their hardware every year or two -- even if their current handset works fine -- they tend to build up a trove of slightly outdated gadgets. Retailers are offering incentives to reclaim these past-their-prime phones that can be refurbished and resold, or passed off to overseas merchants. These buy-back retail services usually offer traders only store credit, rather than cash. Also, all of these companies will recycle a gadget that's too old to warrant payment. This is an especially attractive business for cell providers, which are always at risk of losing out-of-contract customers to other carriers. Giving customers credit toward a new phone is an incentive for them to keep paying their subscriptions. Cell carriers take phone trades . AT&T Mobility stores began letting customers trade in phones, including those from competitors, this month. The second-largest U.S. carrier by subscribers is partnering with a company called Flipswap, which specializes in trading phones. To Flipswap, which carrier a phone is tied to isn't important. Most of the company's revenue comes from reselling used phones overseas. Hot markets include Asia, Africa and Latin America, where people aren't as willing to pay top dollar for the latest technology. Being able to take other carriers' devices was a nice selling point for the AT&T partnership, said Flipswap CEO Dave Stritzinger. ""It's a great way to say, 'Hey, we're sorry you're on our competitor's network. Bring that phone in, and we'll give you some money for that.' "" Verizon Wireless, which launched its program in October, and Sprint Nextel stores both take competitors' phones as well. Since introducing its buyback program in 2001, Sprint has taken 23 million trade-in devices, said Chad Lander, a Sprint director overseeing the service. Last year, Sprint began accepting competitors' phones. As a result, the program saw a 100% increase in trades last year compared with the year before, Lander said. Best Buy, a newcomer to trade-ins . For the shopper who doesn't want a monogamous relationship with his cell carrier, Best Buy debuted the Buy Back program in January in all of its U.S. stores and mobile kiosks. It allows customers purchasing electronics to pay up front for the ability to trade them in for store credit later. The big-box retailer publicized the program with a high-profile Super Bowl commercial featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Justin Bieber, in which the celebrities puzzle over ""5G"" and ""6G"" phones. Best Buy has seen some blowback from critics who characterize the program as yet another ""add-on"" at checkout, that, like those product warranties, may not end up being a great deal for the consumer. Last week, the company extended a promotion to offer Buy Back for free on purchases made by Sunday. After that, the program will cost $60 for most electronics people would want to insure. Best Buy pays consumers in store credit. Trading a mint-condition product in the first six months after purchase nets 50% of the original price. Unlike the carriers that take only cell phones, Best Buy also covers laptops, tablets and televisions. With phones, that 50% applies to the unsubsidized price, which is much higher than what people pay when they get phones with two-year contracts. ""Consumers don't realize the real value of these devices,"" said Scott Moore, a Best Buy Mobile marketing executive. ""They may be buying it for $199 right now and getting $265 back."" But how likely are you to turn around just six months later and buy a new phone? That's when the offer starts to look less attractive. Buy Back knocks off 10% of the value every six or eight months until, after two years, the $60 ticket is worthless. The Buy Back program was birthed from a long trial in New York stores. Flipswap, the AT&T partner, manages Best Buy's trade-in service at its stores in Canada. EBay simplifies resale process . Best Buy's offer works only in stores, but customers can check eligibility online. The Verizon and Sprint buy-back programs also apply online, and dozens of Web startups are popping up to offer similar services. Feeling the pressure, eBay stepped in last year with a service called Instant Sale. The auction site partnered with a company called CExchange to handle the physical trades. Transactions look a lot like an eBay seller listing, except for the annoyances of writing descriptions and uploading photos. Once your phone is appraised through the listing process, the site lets you print a FedEx label granting free shipping. CExchange inspects the product, and if it works, the promised money appears in your PayPal account after a few days. Creating a service to compete with the spirit of eBay, which has always been about letting the average person sell their old stuff online, can seem odd. Acknowledging shortcomings of the core business, Arnaud Collin, eBay's director of seller experience, said that with the old way, ""nothing is guaranteed. You may not sell it at all if you're unlucky. ""You have to pack it, send it, pay for the shipping and everything,"" he added. ""Most people don't have time."" Since launching a promotion around Verizon's launch of the iPhone 4, eBay's Instant Sale racked up 1 million trades in a week, Collin said. Which store has the best prices? Unsurprisingly, every trade-in retailer CNN talked to said it offers the most competitive prices. Best Buy said its up-front fee ensures a good price later. Sprint said it constantly monitors competitors to offer an attractive price that doesn't constantly fluctuate. AT&T's Flipswap said it can offer good value because trading is its core business focus. EBay said most of these third-party resellers end up flipping their goods on eBay anyway, so it had the pick of the litter when it landed on CExchange. Not everyone can be the best, except when it is. When one retailer has a better price on a BlackBerry Bold, another will best the others on its payout for a BlackBerry Curve. In our tests, the prices were often close, with most offering between $110 to $140 for a 2-year-old iPhone, for example. EBay asks subjective questions that noticeably affect price estimates. CNN wasn't able to test the evaluation process to see how stringent its hardware tests were. But eBay pays via PayPal, which can be deposited into a bank account, whereas most big competitors pay in store credit. But the lesson is simple: ""Never put a phone in a drawer, because they're losing value every day,"" Flipswap's Stritzinger said.","AT&T launches a service in its stores for trading in old cell phones, including competitors'

"(CNN) -- ""Good Time Charlie's"" recovering from the blues. Charlie Wilson, at the Los Angeles movie premiere with wife Barbara, loves the film about him. Seven months ago, Charlie Wilson -- the former Texas congressman whose story became the book and film ""Charlie Wilson's War"" -- had heart transplant surgery. Recovery was going well until he went to the Los Angeles premiere of the film -- with his doctor, no less. (His wife went, too, of course.) ""I really wasn't able to enjoy all the hoopla ... over the film because I had come to the premiere against my doctor's wishes, and I paid a terrible price for that afterwards,"" he says in a phone interview from New York, alluding to what he calls ""a setback."" But he's feeling much better now, he adds, and he's finally getting a chance to promote the film in which he's the central character. (""Charlie Wilson's War"" came out on DVD Tuesday.) Indeed, Charlie Wilson loves life in general. The U.S. Naval Academy grad and Navy veteran was elected to Congress in 1972, a Democrat bucking the Nixon landslide, and quickly became known for his high-living escapades, which earned him the nickname ""Good Time Charlie,"" and shrewd accumulation of political chits. His savvy came in handy in the early '80s, when Wilson, a staunch anti-Communist, decided to help Afghan rebels in their war against the invading Soviet Union. Over several years, working behind the scenes, his efforts to raise funding through his defense subcommittee, to establish a bond with a CIA agent named Gust Avrakotos (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the film) and to negotiate support from Middle Eastern countries helped the Afghans take the upper hand -- and eventually forced the Soviets out of the country.  Watch Wilson in a bonus scene from the DVD » . Asked what led to the Soviet departure, Pakistani leader Gen. Muhammad Zia ul-Haq was blunt: ""Charlie did it,"" he told ""60 Minutes."" CNN talked to Wilson about seeing himself on film, the political climate and how he'll be remembered. The following is an edited version of that interview. Q: Are you happy with the way the film came out? CHARLIE WILSON: I really was happy with the film, yes. I didn't expect them to be able to hew as closely to the book as they did. It only had an hour and 37 minutes, and they really got a lot in there. ... Hanks did a great job. And Philip Seymour Hoffman did a stupendous job. Q: What was your reaction when you saw Hanks portraying you, and Julia Roberts portraying Joanne Herring, and actors playing other people you know? WILSON: It just put me in a fog of wonder and disbelief. Q: Was it a case where you thought: This person wouldn't talk like that? WILSON: No, no, no, they were too close to the truth. Philip Seymour Hoffman, for instance, was Gust Avrakotos. He deserved that Oscar. I wish he'd have gotten it. Q: Were you an adviser on the film? WILSON: No, no. I was there a lot. My wife and I were on the set a lot. But we were just there at the pleasure of Mike Nichols, and we did a lot of begging -- or I did a lot of begging -- on the script and that sort of thing. But I had no authority whatsoever. Q: Some of the criticism of the film is that it didn't do enough to highlight the blowback that was to come in this decade [when Afghanistan was taken over by the Taliban and became a base for al Qaeda]. Is that a fair criticism, or did the film do what it was supposed to do? WILSON: I think it did what it was supposed to do. If it had a blowback, now it's blowing the other way, if we can just get our focus back on Afghanistan. I don't think there was a serious blowback. I think there was the point that [author] George Crile made in the [book's] epilogue, that the Muslims saw that they took down one superpower and then the radical ones thought they could take down another one. But they're wrong. Q: There's also a lot of talk about transparency now. (Wilson chuckles.) This operation was done largely covertly -- and it had a lot of success because of that. WILSON: That's right, you can't do everything transparently. This was opaque and it had to be opaque, and had it not been, it wouldn't have succeeded. But to be opaque, it had to have bipartisan support. It had to have enthusiastic bipartisan support. But bipartisan support that didn't go to the press, and try to take credit. Q: Is that still possible? WILSON: I don't think so. I was talking to [talk show host and former congressman] Joe Scarborough this morning and we were discussing that, and we were both pessimistic. Q: Is that because of the partisanship, or because everyone has a blog now, and even the slightest nugget gets out and gets blown all the Internet? WILSON: I think you hit the two. One is the bitterness and the extreme partisanship, and the other is the blogs and the cable shows. Q: A lot of times the movie becomes the final word on something -- It's been said that some schoolchildren's idea of the Kennedy assassination comes from Oliver Stone. Would you mind if, when people think of Charlie Wilson, they think of the film ""Charlie Wilson's War""? Or would you hope that they have the sense to read the book, to look into your legislative history or earlier? WILSON: I'm not a stickler. I'll take the movie.

"(CNN) -- If, like us, you've been wondering about the Red Viper's vaguely Spanish pedigree, you may finally be getting an answer. A medieval castle in southern Spain will serve as the newest backdrop in the next season of ""Game of Thrones."" The staff of the Alcazar of Seville confirmed that the castle has been chosen as a filming site for the series, with shooting slated to begin in October. Although Alcazar staff didn't confirm the specific fictional landscape the castle will portray, various Internet reports speculate the castle will stand in for the Water Gardens of Dorne, the summer residence of House Martell. Barring flashbacks or resurrection (please?), we likely won't get to see the charismatic Red Viper, aka Prince Oberyn, in his native setting. But his elder brother, Prince Doran, should be holding court, and hopefully plotting devastating revenge for his brother's explosive (in a manner of speaking) death in season four of the hugely popular fantasy series that pivots on blood feuds between rival kingdoms. The biggest champion of the series' latest destination has been U.S. Ambassador to Spain James Costos, a former vice president at HBO, who announced the news Tuesday. No doubt Spain is excited to receive the flood of ""Game of Thrones"" tourism that shooting locations in Croatia and Northern Ireland have experienced, although the Seville castle is already a popular destination in its own right. HBO hasn't yet announced a premiere date for the fifth season of the program. Royal palace . Built in 712 and designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, the Alcazar of Seville was originally built as a fortress and became a royal residence in 1248. It still serves as a royal palace today, and is renowned for its Arabic influences and Mudejar art. ""We've been working with them to organize everything and are really glad with their final decision,"" an Alcazar representative tells CNN. ""We have broad experience in (filming) -- 'Lawrence of Arabia,' 'The Kingdom of Heaven' -- so we're sure it'll be a success for both parties.""

"(CNN) -- Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says his review of famed Harlem restaurant Sylvia's is being taken out of context and was not racist. Fox News host Bill O'Reilly says his comments about a Harlem restaurant have been taken out of context. On his September 19 radio show, O'Reilly said he took civil rights leader Al Sharpton to the Lenox Avenue fixture and ""couldn't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City."" ""I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship,"" he told listeners. ""It was the same, and that's really what this society's all about now here in the U.S.A. There's no difference."" And later, speaking with National Public Radio correspondent and Fox analyst Juan Williams, O'Reilly said there ""wasn't any kind of craziness at all"" during his dinner with Sharpton: ""There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming, 'M.F.-er, I want more iced tea.' "" ""It was like going into an Italian restaurant in an all-white suburb in the sense that people were sitting there and they were ordering and just having fun,"" he continued.  Watch reaction to O'Reilly's comments » . The comments, part of a broader discussion on the persistence of prejudice in American society, were circulated by Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog group that has been highly critical of O'Reilly. Other media organizations then picked up the comments. But on his Fox News television program Tuesday night, O'Reilly said the remarks were being distorted. ""Anybody who listened to it ... would, I think, have appreciated the discussion for being an exposition of why people are afraid not only of blacks but of everybody they don't know,"" he said. Elsewhere in the September 19 program, O'Reilly said he was trying to reassure whites -- such as his grandmother, whom he said had an ""irrational fear"" of blacks -- that rap-star stereotypes of African-Americans ""are not true."" ""This is what white America doesn't know, particularly people who don't have a lot of interaction with black Americans,"" he said. ""They think the culture is dominated by Twista, Ludacris and Snoop Dogg."" Williams defended O'Reilly during O'Reilly's Tuesday night show. He said portraying O'Reilly's comments as racist was ""rank dishonesty."" ""It's outrageous, because the discussion we had was about how too often the images on TV are these rappers glorifying drugs, glorifying violence, degrading women,"" Williams said. But Suzan Johnson Cook, a former Clinton administration official, said O'Reilly sounded surprised that a black crowd was so civil. ""Was he expecting people to be jumping all over the place?"" she said on CNN's ""Out in the Open"" on Tuesday. ""It's very sad that, in 2007, a man who influences so many people, number one, has that kind of ignorance, who has not been exposed to our culture."" And Sharpton, who is scheduled to appear on O'Reilly's television program Wednesday night, said he has had dinner with the voluble host twice. He told CNN that O'Reilly ""said nothing at dinner that time or the time before that was offensive to me."" ""I don't know the whole context of it,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Passengers traveling on Air France may face more delays as the airline prepares to cancel more flights due to a strike by aviation workers, a statement on the airline's website said Tuesday. Workers, including pilots and flight attendants, have called for a four-day strike to protest a draft law that they say will curtail their right to strike. The work stoppage began Monday. Despite the walk-out, Air France said it was able to operate more than 70% of its long-haul flights, but on Wednesday, the statement lowers that number to 60%. Still, several passengers were caught off-guard by the strike. Amelie Straub waited for an hour for her flight to Brazil Monday night before she was told that it was canceled. When the 26-year-old returned to Charles de Gaulle airport Tuesday morning, she still didn't know whether she would be booked on a flight out of Paris. Straub said she's not upset about the strike, but called Air France's handling of the walkout ""unacceptable."" ""What the crew did last night, I think that's unacceptable,"" she said. ""I don't think we should ban the right to strike, but it should be controlled and we should be given ample warning."" Beatrice Lestic, a general coordinator for the transportation unions in France, said that 60% of pilots were on strike Tuesday, and she expects the number to increase Wednesday. Lestic says Air France employees are against proposed legislation that would require workers to provide a 48-hour notice before they strike. ""Since the arrival of the proposed law, the intentions of government and businesses are clear: removing all means of dissent from air travel personnel,"" the main pilot union, SNPL, said. ""Let there be no mistake: in the light of the government and businesses' will to muzzle airline pilots, we must speak with one voice,"" the union added. In addition to the cancellations of long haul flights -- flights involving long distances, such as international ones -- Air France said more than a quarter of its remaining scheduled flights are not expected to get off the ground Tuesday. It advised passengers to postpone trips until after Friday. CNN's Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","NEW: Air France says despite strike, 70% of long-haul service was in operation .

"Washington (CNN) -- The following is a primer on campaign finance terms relevant to the Supreme Court's 2010 ""Citizens United"" ruling that loosened spending restrictions in federal elections, which will have an impact this election year. Federal Election Commission (FEC): . -- An independent regulatory agency created by Congress with the mandate to ""administer and enforce the statute that governs the financing of federal elections,"" according to its website. Individual donations: . -- Federal law limits this kind of direct contribution to a federal candidate to $2,500 per election. Direct contributions to a national political party are capped at $30,800 per election. Elections such as primaries, general elections and special elections are counted separately. Corporate donations: . -- Direct contributions from corporations to political parties and candidates for president and Congress are banned under long-standing federal law. The ""corporate"" label can mean private businesses, labor unions and nonprofit special interest or advocacy groups. Businesses had been prohibited from making such contributions since 1907, labor unions since 1943. Corporations can, however, make donations through political action committees. ""Hard"" money vs. ""soft money"": . --""Hard money"" refers to tightly regulated contributions to candidates, while ""soft money"" refers to unregulated, unlimited contributions to political parties for so-called ""party-building"" activities. Traditionally, soft money donations have been used for get-out-the vote drives, voter registration efforts and ads that say ""Vote for Democrats"" or ""Vote for Republicans."" Potential uses of soft money, however, were limited by Congress with the passage of the 2002 campaign finance law known as McCain-Feingold. Political Action Committees (PACs): . -- PACs are separate private entities set up by business, labor, individuals or other special-interest groups to raise and spend money to directly help elect federal and state candidates. PACs may give up to $5,000 per candidate and $15,000 for a political party each year. PACs may solicit money from individual employees, shareholders, or members, who themselves may contribute $5,000 per year to the PAC. The National Association of Realtors PAC spent the most money in 2008, more than $4 million. The Supreme Court's Citizens United Ruling made independent spending lawful, but corporations or unions that want to contribute to federal candidate campaigns must still rely on traditional PACs for that purpose. PACs are subject to donor disclosure rules. Super PACs: . -- A direct result of the high court's 2010 ruling, which placed individuals and corporations on equal ""free speech"" footing when it comes to independent campaign spending. -- Technically known as ""independent expenditure-only committees,"" super PACs may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to overtly advocate for or against political candidates. Super PACs must also report their donors to the FEC monthly or quarterly -- the super PAC's choice -- as a traditional PAC would. That choice may prevent some donor disclosure until after the elections take place. -- Unlike traditional PACs, super PACs are prohibited from donating money directly to political candidates. ""527"" groups: . -- 527s are certain tax-exempt groups operating in part as political organizations. Named after a section of the U.S. tax code, they are largely funded by rich individuals, labor unions and advocacy groups. They gained attention in the 2004 campaign through the campaign activities of organizations such as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. ""501(c)(4)"" groups: . -- 501(c)(4) groups are another type of tax-exempt group, named for a section of the tax code. They have grown popular in recent years, after the FEC raised questions about how some 527 groups were operating. The earnings of these 501(c)(4) groups must be limited to ""charitable, educational, or recreational purposes."" They have an unlimited ability to lobby for legislation and participate in political campaigns and elections. There are no political donation limits to 501(c)(4)s, but such donations are generally not tax-deductible. These organizations do not have to disclose their donors. Issue ads: . -- These ads are the most prevalent form of spending by outside groups, like Freedom's Watch and the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL). They can indirectly express support for or opposition to a candidate but may not explicitly urge the viewer to vote for or against that candidate. Critics of such advertising call them thinly disguised campaign commercials. Sponsors do not have to disclose their donors or source of funding, and political parties themselves are free to use their money on these issue ads. Public funding: . -- Presidential candidates who have collected enough donations can qualify for federal money to match what they have raised privately. Public matching funds apply only during the early primary contests, whereas major party presidential nominees qualify for a lump-sum grant that can be used for the general election in November. In return for accepting public funds, candidates must agree not to go over specified spending limits. President Barack Obama opted out of federal matching funds during his 2008 primary race, because he was able to raise so much money from private donors. He also turned down public funds in the general election. CNN's Robert Yoon, Alan Silverleib, and Keating Holland contributed to this report .","The rules changed after the landmark ""Citizen's United"" ruling by the Supreme Court in 2010 .
Super PACs can spend unlimited money but must disclose donors .

"(CNN) -- It's not a phrase that usually gets said out loud, but you have to feel sorry for Cristiano Ronaldo. The Real Madrid player has just finished the season of his life, winning Spain's La Liga while vanquishing the club's hated Catalan foes Barcelona. He scored more goals than he ever has before too, 46 in the league to be precise, and 60 overall. Yet even though Madrid finished nine points clear of second place, it is Barca's Lionel Messi that still gets all the attention. ""Some people say I'm better, other people say it's him, but at the end of the day, they're going to decide who is the best player,"" Ronaldo told CNN in an exclusive interview before this weekend's Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Chelsea at Munich's Allianz Arena. ""At the moment ... I think it is me,"" he laughs. ""Sometimes (the comparisons with Messi) makes me tired ... for him too because they compare us together all the time. Messi breaks Barcelona's all-time scoring record . ""You cannot compare a Ferrari with a Porsche because it's a different engine. You cannot compare them. He does the best things for Barcelona, I do the best things for Madrid. ""I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high. This is why Madrid and Barcelona are the best teams in the world because everyone pushes each other, not just me and Messi but other players."" Good cop/bad cop . Perhaps Ronaldo is right. The world needs the ""good cop/bad cop"" routine of Messi and Ronaldo to bring the best out of both them. It might be the reason why neither has set the world alight on the international stage. But while Messi is hailed as a secular saint, Ronaldo is derided for his self-confidence, some would say over-confidence. How does he cope with the vitriol he provokes in opposition fans? ""Sometimes, you have to put on a mask. You cannot smile every time for all the people. It's impossible, I cannot do that,"" he says. ""This is not my type of personality. And people really don't know me. And I do it for that because I don't want every person to know me, just close friends ... you know, my friends, teammates. These people know me very well. Other people, to be honest, I really don't care about that."" Still, such has been Madrid's dominance in the league that Ronaldo is entitled to feel, if not exactly sycophantic praise, then at least recognition of his and his team's achievements. ""My high point (in my career) is to win the title here in Madrid, La Liga,"" he explains. Clasico win gives Real the edge over rivals . ""(It) was my first time, so I was so happy because it's my best moment here in Madrid, the most important trophy. In terms of individual, it was great for me, the goals that I scored, to break my own record ... to do 100 points in the Spanish league which is a record too. It's phenomenal. ""For me this is the most difficult league in the world. To compete with Barcelona, as everyone knows is very complicated and we beat them. Nine points ahead ... so it was an amazing year."" In Barca's shadow? Barcelona. It is the shadow that follows not just Ronaldo, but also Real coach Jose Mourinho, who has also had a remarkable season in Spain. You could argue it is a shadow that follows the city of Madrid around too. ""The points speak for themselves,"" Ronaldo replies when asked about the rivalry. ""Nine points separated Madrid and Barcelona; it's a lot here in Spain. We played better than them this year, I'm sure about that. I remember we went there one month ago and we won 2-1...nobody can do that, it's very difficult so we deserve to win the league. We are better than them at the moment, but we have to respect them because they are a great team too."" Now there has never been a better time for Real Madrid to break the spell of Barcelona. With coach Pep Guardiola gone and questions being raised about the age of the Barca squad, Ronaldo believes that Madrid could go on to do something special, with the ""Special One"" at the helm. Drained Guardiola quits Barca . ""As a person (Jose Mourinho's) a humble guy ... he's very simple. We joke all the time, with funny stories all the time. It's great. In terms of coaching, he's completely different. He's so serious, so professional."" For Ronaldo, Mourinho has proven himself to be the best coach in the world. ""This is why he wins the titles that he won. Because for me, not just because I work with him, but he's the best because of what he does: the tactics, everything around the players, the motivation ... and you know, the titles speak for themselves. He won in every country that he's passed, so I think that's great. I think nobody ... two or three coaches do that in their lives, so we have to appreciate that."" The worst day . Yet the season has not been without its disappointments. It may well have delivered the greatest single triumph in Ronaldo's career so far, but it also delivered its nadir -- losing to Bayern on penalties in the Champions League semifinals. Ronaldo missed a spot-kick during the shootout as Real's wait for a record-extending 10th European title spilled into its second decade. ""To be honest, it was one of the worst days in my career so far,"" he admits. Ronaldo, Real Madrid suffer heartache . ""It's always tough when you lose something, when you lose on penalties. But I'm not really worried about that because if I didn't score the two goals most of the players aren't going to shoot the penalties, so I have to appreciate what I did in the Champions League, what I did for the club."" The dream Madrid-Barcelona final didn't happen. Instead we have a final that no one could predict. On the one hand a Bayern Munich side that unexpectedly fought back to knock out Madrid. On the other hand a Chelsea side that shocked Barcelona, the world, and one suspects, even themselves. Who does Ronaldo think will win? ""Most people think that Bayern is going to win easily. I don't think so,"" he says, perhaps remembering the battles he had with Chelsea while playing for Manchester United in the English Premier League. ""Don't forget that Chelsea beat Barcelona, which is very, very tough. It will be an interesting game. I don't know which team is going to win. I'm not going to bet on anything because Chelsea is very strong. They defend well, they have a good counterattack. Bayern is a fantastic team too, so it will be a good game."" In 12 months' time he will hope to realign the order of things and play in the 2013 Champions League final. For now he'll have to make do with being the best player in the best league with the best manager in the world. Should you feel sorry for Cristiano Ronaldo? So far everything seems to be going just fine.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Saturday for the public to stop using an instant coffee marketed as a sexual enhancer, the agency announced in a news release. Magic Power Coffee contains a chemical that can cause dangerously low blood pressure when it interacts with prescription drugs such as nitrates, the FDA said. The chemical, hydroxythiohomosildenafil, is similar to sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, which is available by prescription. Customers who have Magic Power Coffee should stop using it, the agency said. ""Because this product is an instant coffee labeled as an 'all natural dietary supplement,' consumers may assume it is harmless and poses no health risk. In fact, Magic Power Coffee can cause serious harm,"" Deborah M. Autor, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's office of compliance, said in the statement. The agency warned the public that sexual enhancement products that claim to work as well as prescription drugs ""are likely to expose consumers to unpredictable risks"" and the potential for injury or death. However, the FDA said no adverse events associated with the Magic Power Coffee have been reported. The agency advised anyone who has experienced a negative side affect from Magic Power Coffee or any sexual enhancement product to consult a doctor or nurse. Magic Power Coffee, which calls itself the ""world's first passion coffee,"" is sold online and by independent distributors. There was no immediate response from the company to the FDA announcement. The Magic Power website contains a disclaimer that reads in part: ""Consult a physician before using this product if you have any medical condition including, but not limited to, strokes, high blood pressure, heart, liver, kidney or thyroid disease, diabetes, anemia, depression, anxiety, other psychiatric conditions, a family history of these or other medical conditions, or if taking any prescription, OTC and/or other herbal medications.""","FDA says consumers shouldn't use Magic Power Coffee .

"(CNN) -- An old wooden carving known as ""the Sacred Cod"" hangs in the Massachusetts State House. That figurine has stared down at lawmakers for more than two centuries as a reminder of how important cod fishing has been to New England, where generations have made a living by casting their nets out at sea. ""It's the only job I've ever had,"" said Al Cattone, a Gloucester fisherman, who -- like his father and grandfather before him -- spent more than 30 years braving the Atlantic's rough waters and cold winds in search of fish. ""It's not so much a job as it is an identity."" But Gloucester, like many coastal towns, now faces the largest cuts ever to the region's commercial fishing industry. An advisory council voted Wednesday to slash cod catch rates by 77% in the Gulf of Maine, a region roughly the size of Indiana that extends from Cape Cod up through Nova Scotia. That move, analysts predict, is expected to decimate fishing communities across the region and have a domino effect on seafood processors, wholesalers, distributors and retailers who all make a living off the water. ""The impact will be severe,"" said John Bullard, the regional administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who voted in favor of the cuts. ""It wasn't easy, but it was necessary."" A response to low cod stocks, the proposed cuts have left thousands wondering what they will do for work at the start of the fishing season in May. Scores of fishermen gathered Wednesday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to hear the vote of the New England Fishery Management Council, which has since submitted its recommendations to the federal government. ""We're doomed, as they say,"" said fisherman Dennis Robillard, whose voice wavered as he acknowledged that his boat, the Julie Ann II, is now up for sale. ""I'm getting out. It just doesn't make any sense to me anymore."" The council also voted to cut 55% of cod catch rates in Georges Bank, an expansive area near Cape Cod, which was named by a 17th century British explorer after discovering an abundance of the ground fish. If approved by the Commerce Department, fishermen catch rates will drop to about 3,550 metric tons of cod in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. A decade ago, they could net around 20,000. From the archives: A fishing way of life is threatened . The fish population . Most analysts agree that cod stocks today are nowhere near healthy numbers, though some fishermen say they've netted more cod recently than in the past. Still, the Gulf of Maine has hit only about 18% of target levels, while Georges Bank fared far worse at around 7%, according to NOAA. A government survey found that Gulf of Maine cod, considered a top earner, were so depleted that even if the fishing industry were to shut down completely, it would still not recover to the levels mandated by federal law by 2014. And yet, while the stocks haven't replenished fast enough, they have come back, according to two decades worth of NOAA data tables. ""It's more of a management crisis,"" said Steven Cadrin, a former NOAA scientist and faculty member at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. ""There's twice as many cod there compared to the 1990s, but they're still not at the levels we'd like to see them at."" Just a few years ago, the government projected that the area was well on its way to recovery after decades of overfishing. Federal regulators then raised catch rates to nearly five times the sustainable level based estimates now believed to have been far too optimistic. That, combined with warmer waters, pollution and policies that protect natural predators like seals, have all contributed to fewer fish that triggered the mandatory cuts. While larger commercial trawlers capable of traveling to more distant fishing grounds are expected to survive, the plan will likely cost most of the region's smaller crews their jobs. ""Fifteen years from now, it'll all be corporate,"" Robillard said. ""The mom-and-pop days are over."" Still, codfish aren't about to become an endangered species, according to Sam Rauch, head of the NOAA's fisheries service. Coming restrictions are about protecting the overall size of the cod population and complying with federal law. Environmentalists say depleted stocks show the region needs time to recover in order to save it. But fishermen are furious. They say the law and its targets are largely arbitrary and argue that murky science surrounding fish estimates has given fodder to those willing to let their livelihoods founder. In September, the Commerce Department declared the Northeast ground fishery a formal disaster, which raised hopes of economic relief that were later dashed in a trimmed-down relief bill for victims of Superstorm Sandy. Confronted with possible drops in domestic cod supply, industry analysts say U.S. consumers will likely look elsewhere, importing more from other countries such as Norway and Canada. But the danger, they say, is a loss of U.S. market share. And for men like Robillard and Cattone, that shift has already occurred. ""I call it the systematic castration of the groundfish fleet,"" said Cattone. But the 47-year-old man from Gloucester also said he never gave his son -- who's now in college -- the option to fish in the way that generations of his family had. ""I was afraid he was going to fall in love with it the way I did,"" he said. ""It's a shame, but it's something I knew I had to do.""","A council voted to slash cod catch rates by 77% in area from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia .

"(CNN) -- Technology has been changing the way we access, enjoy and discuss our entertainment. From smartphones and tablets with streaming movies to video game consoles offering TV shows alongside game play, consumers have increasingly become accustomed to their entertainment colliding and intertwining in new and interesting ways. In an effort to expand that world, the creators of ""Defiance"" are banking on the combined power of an online third-person shooter video game and a weekly science fiction television series to keep fans hooked and actively involved in the franchise. Trion Games and SyFy Network joined forces five years ago to create ""a truly unique entertainment experience,"" according to Nathan Richardsson, VP of development for Trion and executive producer of ""Defiance."" The ""Defiance"" world is set in the year 2046 on a transformed Earth ravaged by conflict and alien attacks. Mutants, evil alien races and robots terrorize what's left of civilization and those who have the wealth and power have fled to Antarctica -- the last refuge for those who want to live comfortably. The game takes place in the San Francisco area while the TV series is set in St. Louis, or what used to be St. Louis before alien terraforming technology destroyed most of the city. The town is now called Defiance, with a population of about 6,000 people of different races. Creators say the geographic split of the story was necessary so each property could stand on its own. Mark Stern, president of original content at SyFy, said a gaming world where hundreds of players are completing missions wouldn't be a good environment for TV storytelling. ""We really did need to keep them distinct and not worry about what we could and couldn't do,"" Stern said. ""We didn't want lots of people running up and down our streets (in St. Louis) shooting everything. It was going to be very, very hard to keep those things separate in that very specific way."" That's not to say the show and the game are completely separate. Events that happen in the game will refer to, and possibly affect, things in the TV series and vice versa. Rob Hill, senior producer at Trion, points out the two main characters from the show, Joshua Nolan and Irisa, actually appear in the game before they show up in the series and go on missions with the player. ""Those two characters leave the game,"" Hill said. ""They drive away from the player having gotten an object the player helped them get and then drive into the television show. (They) end up using that object, which really helps the solution to the pilot (episode)."" The game, which is available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles as well as Windows-based computers, launched two weeks before the SyFy series premier to give fans of the ""Defiance"" universe a taste of what was to come in the show. However, you don't have to watch the show to understand the game -- and vice versa. Hill said the game and the show can stand alone, but the idea of expanding the world through different outlets at the same time was something they felt would enhance the viewer's, or player's, enjoyment of the franchise. ""You'll be missing a lot of background of what maybe happens from either the show or the game, he said. ""It won't be something you are confused by. It won't be 'Why did that just happen?' (But) if you play the game and are watching the show, you might have an inner knowledge that other people won't have about the show."" While both teams were telling a story in the same universe, Stern said the creative process was like digging a tunnel through opposite sides of a mountain to meet in the center. ""They're (Trion) building this deep, rich world and we were trying to create interesting character drama,"" Stern said. ""That was a great benefit to us to have a company working 24 hours a day building out this detail, like a 300-page world Bible, that we could tap when it did become time for us to worry about (questions like) 'What color are the trees?' 'What do the buildings exactly look like?' "" Hill agreed, saying Trion pushed SyFy to think about larger details earlier when the show producers wanted to work in character details. ""We need to define a universe early because our entire game is computer-generated graphics and they take a long time to build. They usually think about what the universe looks like, what it sounds like, and they usually figure that out after they've got an initial script written,"" he said. While some of the discussion about story development, environments and the overall reach of ""Defiance"" got heated, the idea of making something brand new kept both sides focused. Stern said there was genuine enthusiasm on both sides to make it work, but the pressure was intense. ""There's so much scrutiny because of what it is,"" he said. ""There's also this real responsibility feel that, if this doesn't work, you've condemned the idea in general, which is not necessarily fair."" Are science fiction and gaming fans ready for this type of multilayered entertainment? The crossover audience between those two genres seems to be a natural and large one. ""(The SyFy show) is only on for an hour a week and 13 episodes a season, and then people have to wait for the next season,"" Hill points out. ""The fan base really gets into the universe behind these television shows and they don't get to live in it outside of those 13 episodes. We give them the opportunity to come into the game and live in the universe 24/7 if they want to."" ""Defiance"" (the game) is available now for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. It is an online game so it does require an Internet connection to play at all times. It is rated M for Mature due to blood, drug references, sexual themes, strong language, and violence.

"(CNN) -- Financial transactions have always been at the heart of our society, but growing smartphone and Internet penetration are inspiring new, disruptive approaches. What we are witnessing is nothing less than a complete reappraisal of the fundamental principles that underpin business -- and that are set to transform the future. Here are five ways money will change in the future. The four 'P' economic model . Seismic events, including technological innovation, lead to radical behavior shifts -- but our belief systems are just as influential. At present, we are witnessing a ""me culture"" shifting towards a ""we"" mindset of collaboration -- exemplified by micro banking and crowd funding -- with mobile technology being the great enabler. This has impacted commercial structures across the world and leaders now look to new economic models, motivated not only by P for profit, but also P for People, Planet and Purpose; welcome to a reality where a 4P bottom line will become the norm. New alternative currencies . Exponential growth in technologies is inspiring disruptive business models in most sectors, and finance is no exception. Already challenged by declining trust, traditional ""bricks and mortar"" monetary institutions are now joined by a new wave of alternative and open-source ways of managing money. The Bitcoin is an example of digital technology in action -- a global, decentralized currency without physical borders, national sovereignty or middlemen -- and similar P2P (person to person) models will undoubtedly increase in the future. Equally interesting is the rise of local currencies, such as the Brixton and Bristol pounds in the UK, created to encourage trade and strengthen both local community and economy -- both operate largely via mobile. Financial evolution and social mobility . Trading methods for goods and services are constantly evolving -- from gold to coins to paper to credit cards and now mobile-enabled transactions. Within western economies, uptake of mobile payment technology has been slow, in part because of consumer trust on security/fraud issues, but also barriers to entry in this market. Inspiration on where the future is unfolding is to be found in Africa -- where a substantial unbanked population and a growing mobile youth present enormous potential for financial services innovation and financial inclusion. In several African countries, mobile payments have replaced credit cards and mobile services like Esoko now operates in over 15 nations to convey market data and ensure fair commodity trading among farmers. Now the undisputed leader in mobile money, Africa accounted for 15 of the top 20 countries globally in 2013, but in India this trend is quickening with MoneyOnMobile and Easypaisa gaining market influence. Seven ways mobile phones have changed lives in Africa . Collaborative networks and the global brain . Today's mobile networks are like neurons in a massive global brain, which will continue to connect us while chipping away at the power base of conventional financial institutions. Smartphone technologies are also major empowerment tools for two of the 4Ps -- People and Planet. Beyond digital platforms for the transfer of money, goods and services, smartphones are an enabler of education, information, work, health, social participation and more sustainable solutions. It has been predicted, by Ericsson in 2009, that as many as 50 billion devices will be connected to The Internet of Things by 2020. In effect, this ""global brain"" has potential to become a platform for navigating a better life across classes and conventional geographical borders. In Asia, the momentum of innovation is inspiring radical new solutions to drive inclusiveness and, ultimately, economic growth. Last year, Seoul became the world's first official sharing economy and, with 60% of South Koreans owning a smartphone, the city government is championing mobile-enabled collaborations involving everything from startup support to workspace sharing. The best deals in tech . Transparent financial ecosystem . Blurring of online and offline commerce has seen a greater demand for seamlessness, causing most sectors to adopt new multiple channels for financial transactions in order to stay competitive. We are also witnessing ""betapreneurship"" -- in which products or services are tested and developed through interaction with customers -- emerging across the business spectrum, and this is in line with 4P thinking and enhanced by mobile platforms. A new generation of global citizens that wants easy, barrier-free access to money is pioneering and supporting these commerce models. But support is not restricted to Millennials. Edelman found that 84% of people believe business can pursue both its own interests and that of society. The networked society offers transparency and, when everyone and everything that can benefit is connected to the Internet, business must evolve to match a new global mindset. In short, mobile money may become our springboard to achieving a more inclusive and equitable society. 'Funny money' has officially entered the real world .

"(CNN) -- We knew even while researching Tuesday's feature on the global impact of Chinese tourism that the story was likely to generate strong reactions among readers. After all, in a matter of just a decade or so, Chinese tourists have gone from being relatively rare outside of Asia to becoming the most important market in global tourism, surpassing American and German travelers in 2012 as the world's top international spenders, with a record $102 billion shelled out on the road. Chinese travelers the world's biggest spenders . But even we were taken aback by the intensity of the emotions -- often thoughtful, sometimes ugly, always illuminating -- the story elicited among our global readership. (Per CNN policy, we've been monitoring and removing the explicitly hateful and threatening comments from the site.) Many readers focused on the individual habits of Chinese tourists, positive and negative. All comments are at the bottom of this: Chinese tourism: The good, the bad and the backlash . Ed Connolly summed up the feelings of the more outraged commenters: ""Basically get ready for loud conversations, small tips, deceptive behavior and cutting in line. For anyone who has traveled to Asia, China in particular, you know all too well what I'm talking about. Chinese are rude and inconsiderate. Think I'm too opinionated? Spend a week in China and get back to me."" Weighing in from Thailand, Katy Khan voiced a similar sentiment: ""Here in Thailand it's a big deal. They can't stand Chinese tourists and are complaining to the government about it. It's pretty bad. Chinese people are quite rude compared to any other culture I've ever experienced."" Readers such as Mi Jo, however, reported markedly different experiences with Chinese travelers: ""I deal with lot of Chinese tourist every summer and I have to say that they are very kind. They leave impression of shyness. I do not know if they don't talk much anywhere or they are just shocked by cultural differences but they are very very [quiet], and most of them don't speak at all (even though they know English language)."" Added tigerlee: ""Not only you guys but people in China feel uncomfortable with this group of people [rude travelers]. But most of Chinese are friendly and good mannered."" A number of readers compared the reputation of modern Chinese travelers with another frequently bashed group. Wrote William Trudeau: ""Anyone remember 'The Ugly American' and similar discussions about U.S. travelers not all that long ago?"" Apparently, not all of those conversations are from so long ago. Said britishpal: ""I worked in hotels for a number of years, and time after time the thing that got staff all panicked and on edge were when American tourists were expected. Most of the rude behaviors described in this article could just as easily be attributed to American tourists; demanding services that aren't offered, expecting meal times to be extended far beyond reasonable hours, the expectation that their cash-flashing would give them extra entitlements, etc. And to be fair, I've heard British tourists are just as bad in European countries, even outside of World Cup events."" Wrote fattsmann: ""I'm Chinese-American and I agree that mainland Chinese are horrible tourists based on my trips to Europe and the Middle East. The article hits all the key notes and as other comments have noted, Americans had the same stigma/problems about 1-2 decades ago. The key issues are education and awareness of foreign cultures (including learning the basics of a foreign language before travel), respect for foreign cultures and customs, and patience (including waiting in line, not making snap defensive judgments, etc.). Years ago, it was Americans that were rude and culturally insensitive tourists. Now it's the Chinese. Then it will be another group of people with money to travel."" Like fattsmann, a number of mainland Chinese and Chinese citizens of other countries were anxious to join the conversation. Wrote ptran281: ""As a Canadian born to Chinese parents.... I can say I can't stand Chinese tourists! There is such a thing called lining up and waiting your turn. I was called a fake Chinese when I reminded them we don't behave like this in Canada."" iamjustin provided an explanation for the perception of poor behavior abroad: ""I am a Chinese in the mainland; as for the rudeness of Chinese visitors which raised a fire in the comments section, I have something to clarify... The reason why so many Chinese nowadays are so rude and impolite is originated from abolishing of Confucius philosophy and the wild interpersonal abuse in the notorious Cultural Revolution launched by Mao Zedong! ... So the conclusion is that Chinese people in the mainland are the victims of tradition loss, communist political chaos, and the rudeness and lack of self-cultivation are the consequences of the above."" CNN International's Facebook page garnered some even more passionate responses. Edith Duarte points out that Chinese have been global tourists for centuries: ""Guys, thousands of years ago the Chinese have marveled the world. They are in seven continents all over the globe, Chinatowns are all over the U.S."" Meanwhile, Nicolas Serge suggests people on both sides of the tourism equation benefit from Chinese travel. ""The U.S. is encouraging people at home to learn and speak Chinese. Furthermore, Many U.S. students are studying in China. Tourism is helping chinese to learn more about other cultures. We remain certain about an effective partnership U.S. and China could build in the future to face global challenges."" In the end, of course, the Chinese travel boom -- and perhaps some of the resentment of it -- is driven by the almighty dollar. Or, in a potential shift that seems to both worry and excite the world, the almighty yuan. Summing up the ""just because you've got money doesn't mean I have to respect you"" contingent, THEGenuineOLiTWiST wrote: ""In general, most mainland Chinese who are 40 or over are suffering from this money= respect syndrome. The younger ones are much better at 'fitting in' with their travel destination's social and cultural norms."" Perhaps in the end, JohnkinsBob makes the best argument by taking the pragmatic approach to the issue: ""The article makes Chinese tourism sound like the yellow peril. If these people have the cash, bring em on! The U.S. is getting back at least part of the dollars that are being sent over there."" It's a fascinating and important discussion that will surely continue to engage us all in the years ahead.

"(CNN) -- Add another chapter to the illustrious history of freewheeling vice presidential debates. At Centre College in Kentucky, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan engaged in what might euphemistically be described as a lively exchange of ideas. In reality it felt more like a testy verbal brawl between father and son. Consider these key 5 moments from the debate. Ryan: No need to apologize . This is a well played moment by Ryan, one of his best of the debate. He has a specific argument to make, and he fleshes out that argument clearly and logically. Ryan also delivers the material in an effective way. You can see his face become more animated as he speaks, and he uses simple rhetoric to express his doubts about the Obama administration's handling of the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. Politics: Five things we learned from the VP debate . Biden's strategic anger . In this clip, Biden delivers the attack everybody had expected President Obama to launch in the first debate. Biden is sharply critical of disparaging comments made by Mitt Romney and Ryan about Americans who, for one reason or another, do not pay income tax. This is classic Biden. He takes a large philosophical abstraction about the role of government in people's lives and personalizes it, citing his parents, his neighbors, the people he grew up with, seniors, veterans and soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. It's quite a list, and he delivers it convincingly and passionately. Ryan pushes back on the 47% remark . This represents an attempt by Ryan to use humor to deflect a negative, in this case Romney's now-famous comment about the 47% of Americans who don't pay taxes. Debate strategists plan these moments in advance, but it is impossible to predict how they will actually play. In joking about Biden's propensity for verbal gaffes, Ryan is suggesting that Romney mangled his words when referring to the 47%. Ryan does a decent job delivering the line that had been written for him, and he even gets a laugh from the audience. But in the final analysis there's not much Ryan or anyone else can do to counteract the damage caused by Romney's original comment. Biden: Now you're Jack Kennedy? In this exchange the two candidates struggle to dominate the conversation -- again, I am reminded of a father and son going at it over the dinner table. The look of feigned incredulity on Biden's face as Ryan speaks is priceless. For his part, Ryan can barely contain his exasperation at being talked over. Biden's line -- ""Oh, and now you're Jack Kennedy"" -- is a not too subtle allusion to the classic vice presidential debate putdown from 1988, when Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle, ""Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."" Ryan attempts to laugh off the insult, but he seems a bit rattled here. Biden appears to have hit a nerve. Shouldn't candidates know by now that it's never safe to invoke John F. Kennedy in a presidential debate? Politics: First two debates couldn't be more different . Ryan loses his cool . Stylistically this is one of Ryan's low points in the debate. Unsure how to handle Biden's perturbed tone, Ryan loses his cool. He begins squirming in his chair and moving his neck like a bobblehead doll. At a couple of points he emits a strange, snort-like chuckle, a sound that does not exactly enhance his maturity. For the most part in this debate, Ryan did not let an overbearing Biden get under his skin, but not in this clip. Let's give Ryan credit where credit is due. Before the debate he predicted that Biden would come at him ""like a cannonball,"" and indeed he did. Though it wasn't always pretty, Biden managed to dominate the evening, an old lion who had no intention of being taken down by the young gun sitting across the table. Like a master thespian on opening night, Biden conspicuously deployed pretty much his entire bag of performing tricks: dramatic line-readings, huge smiles, exaggerated laughter, asides to the audience. As over-the-top as some of this became, it got the job done. For much of the debate the super-charged veep kept his opponent in a defensive crouch. At times it looked as if Ryan was afraid Biden might ground him and take away the car keys. Ryan did have his moments in this debate, but overall he came across as not quite seasoned enough for the office he seeks. Undergirding every vice presidential debate is the question of which candidate is ready to step into the Oval Office at a moment's notice. By this standard, Ryan failed to hit the mark. Which is not to suggest that the man has no future in presidential politics. The years will obviously take him beyond the problem of immaturity. If Mitt Romney loses this election, it is not inconceivable that four years from now Ryan and Biden might even end up back onstage together, as co-stars in a presidential debate. Opinion: Sports bar Biden vs. seminar Ryan . Overall, this debate's most striking characteristic was the age gap between candidates. In the optics of televised debates a generational difference can cut either way: the older candidate might look out of date and past his prime, or wise and experienced. The younger candidate might look fresh and energetic, or not ready for prime time. In this case, Biden's age tended to work in his favor; Ryan's youth worked against him. Beyond the matter of gravitas, Biden won the debate for a second reason: he managed to put on the table most of the issues that President Obama failed to raise in Denver. This was a tricky maneuver, but for the most part Biden accomplished his mission. This allows Obama to hit the reset button for his rematch with Romney next week. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan Schroeder.","Alan Schroeder: Debate's most striking feature was the age gap between candidates .

"(CNN) -- Travelers who passed through the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport earlier this month may have been exposed to the highly contagious measles virus, local health officials say. The King County Department of Public Health in Washington state is investigating ""a confirmed case of measles infection"" in a traveler who was at the airport while he or she was contagious. The traveler was in the airport's North Satellite Terminal, on the interterminal train and at baggage claim between 8:10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on September 6. The infectious traveler also visited the Courtyard Seattle Federal Way hotel's restaurant, The Bistro, sometime between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. on that day. ""If you were at either of these locations during the times listed above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick is between September 13th and September 27th,"" the health department said in a statement. Measles is spread through the air, by breathing, coughing or sneezing. Symptoms usually include fever, cough and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal. Most people in the United States are immune to the measles virus because they have been vaccinated. The traveler was likely exposed to measles abroad, the health department said. This is not the first time Seattle has made a measles case public. In April, Washington state health officials posted online the locations a woman infected with the virus had been during every hour that she was contagious. The list included a Kings of Leon concert at Key Arena. The United States is seeing a record number of measles cases this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between January 1 and August 29, the CDC confirmed 592 cases, which is the highest number recorded since measles was considered ""eliminated"" in the United States in 2000. The CDC recommends that children get two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine beginning at 12 months, with the second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel. Measles cases at highest level in nearly 20 years . Why worry about the measles outbreak?

"Albany, New York (CNN) -- Ned Norton was working as a fitness trainer for Olympic athletes and bodybuilders when a young man with a spinal cord injury asked him for help. ""At first, I had no idea what to do with him,"" said Norton, who managed a health club in Albany, New York. Together they developed a workout program, and the young man made great strides. ""Even (his) doctors saw the physical and psychological improvements we were able to make,"" Norton said. It didn't take long for word to spread. Patients from a rehabilitation center sought out Norton's help, and he began training them for free. After a newspaper published an article about Norton's workouts with the disabled, his phone rang off the hook. ""So I opened a gym designed to fit their needs,"" he said. For the past 25 years, Norton has dedicated himself to providing free and low-cost strength and conditioning training for hundreds of people living with a variety of disabilities. ""They can't move, they can't be independent. They can't live their lives,"" said Norton, 55. ""I'm building them up, building them stronger, so they can go out and live life like they're supposed to."" Bodybuilder with a big heart . Norton trains more than 120 people every week through his nonprofit, Warriors on Wheels. His clients' disabilities include spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. ""I never worry about what they can't do,"" said Norton. ""I worry about what they can do, and make them as independent and capable as possible."" Participants come to the gym twice a week for one-hour sessions. Norton's strength-training equipment is specially adapted to fit his clients' needs. Most of the people he trains are in wheelchairs and rely on their upper body strength to get around. ""The world is more accessible now for people with wheelchairs,"" Norton said, ""but you've got to be strong to be in a wheelchair."" Tom Clement knows that first-hand. About 40 years ago, he fell off a roof and severed his spinal cord. He has been in a wheelchair ever since. ""When you lose (the use of) your legs, your arms become your legs. So upper body strength is key,"" said Clement, 65. Clement has worked out at Norton's gym several times a week for the past 15 years. He says it's helped him live independently. ""My activities in the gym have increased my ability to maintain the stamina of everyday work,"" said Clement, who runs a frame shop and art gallery with his brother. ""Thanks to Ned, I've been able to live a full life."" For those who can afford to pay it, Norton charges $25 a month. Most of his clients are living on disability income and Social Security, and he says less than half can afford to pay the fee. He never turns away anyone who has a disability. Strength in numbers . Norton is the only trainer in the facility, which was donated to him by the city. Participants often form friendships and motivate one another. They also become resources for each other, providing advice and references. ""After an accident, people are devastated. Their family and friends have no clue what they are going through. They are out there on their own,"" Norton said. ""But when they come here, they get a network of people going through the same challenges."" Kathleen Lane has been coming to the Warriors on Wheels gym for about 15 years to help with her multiple sclerosis. Lane, who is in a wheelchair, also benefits from the social aspect of the program. ""I come out of here feeling better than I do when I first come in,"" said Lane, 51. ""It changed my life. ... Ned's unbelievable."" Norton says many of the people he has worked with have gone on to drive again, gain employment and pursue their interests without letting their disabilities get in the way. ""I'm not a genius. I'm not a miracle worker,"" Norton said. ""But I do know what I'm doing in the gym, because that's what I love doing and that's what I have to offer to people."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- You know things in Chicago are bad when 70 murders in the first quarter can be seen as a good thing. But context is everything: Last year at this time there had been more than 120 murders, so I guess we should thank God for small favors. It seems inconceivable that the city President Barack Obama calls home is also the city where his family may be least safe. Just this Monday a 15-year-old boy was found shot dead in a backyard only four blocks from the president's house. What's responsible for the bloodshed? Gang violence, as usual. Police estimate that of the 532 murders in 2012 -- nearly 1.5 a day -- about 80 percent were gang related. And yet, despite that rather staggering statistic, the national outcry is muted at best -- nothing, to say the least, like the kind we saw last week in Boston. What is it about the word ""gang"" that brings out the apathy in us? Would we view Chicago differently if we called the perpetrators something else? In Chicago, nurses dodge bullets to provide care . I'm not saying the people of Boston do not deserve our sympathy; they do. Nor am I suggesting the apprehension of Boston terror suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not essential. But how do we explain our habit of greeting terrorists with 24-hour news coverage and relentless wrath while overlooking the gangs that terrorize our streets daily -- as if terrorism were only an enemy state and not a concept. The murder numbers may be slightly better in Chicago, but they do not fully communicate the city's state of siege. In February CNN reported that some children living in gang-ridden parts of the city carry guns because, to them, getting caught and serving time for possession of a gun is better than getting caught without one and dying. Last month, city officials announced the closure of 54 ""under-resourced"" schools, which will force some kids to walk across warring gang territory to get to school. For example, in the seven blocks between George Manierre Elementary and Jenner Elementary there are three gangs fighting over territory: Black P Stones, Conservative Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples. Kids and guns: 'These are not isolated tragedies' If it all sounds scary, it's only because it is. And if the name attached to all of this violence were al-Qaeda instead of Gangster Disciples; or if instead of ""gang violence"" the bloodshed were called ""terrorism;"" or if instead of calling the people spreading fear and mayhem gangs we were to call them what they really are -- terrorists -- the nation would demand more be done. After all, if children are afraid to walk to school because they might get killed or if residents are afraid to identify perpetrators for fear of retaliation, I think it's safe to say they are being terrorized. What seems like a linguistic shell game is really an exercise in empathy. The thought of elementary school kids walking across areas of a city controlled by three terrorist groups becomes unacceptable to everyone, not just their parents. Hearing that 25 Chicagoans were shot in one weekend becomes a threat to national security, and not just the mayor's problem. The story of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was caught in the crossfire of a turf war days after performing during the presidential inauguration, was of interest briefly but her story has since faded. She, too, died just a few blocks from the Obama's home. Jonylah Watkins, a 6-month-old girl, was shot in March while sitting on the lap of her father, Jonathan, the intended target and a gang member. Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends . Last week, millions watched as an entire city was shut down to look for one guy. Every major news station was covering the pursuit of one guy. We all know the face and relatives of this one guy. And it's all because he is an alleged terrorist. But more American were murdered in the south and west sides of Chicago than there were U.S. servicemen killed in Afghanistan last year, and yet for some reason we don't view those neighborhoods as terrorized. Last week, Abdella Ahmad Tounisi was arrested at O'Hare Airport because the FBI believed he was on his way to Syria to join a terrorist organization. Tounisi reportedly thought he was in contact with a recruiter for a jihadist militant group, but it was actually an FBI agent. I would love to see the FBI's anti-terrorism resources used in that matter to stop would-be gang members from flooding the streets of the country's third-largest city. Maybe Cornelius German, the boy found dead down the street from Obama's house, would still be alive. Maybe Pendleton, who was playing in a park with her friends, would still be alive. Maybe Watkins, who was sitting on her father's lap, would have had a chance to live. Their deaths wouldn't be considered ""Chicago's problem"" if authorities suspected terrorists were involved. But it's ""gang-related,"" so... The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: First quarter of 2013 saw 70 murders in Chicago .

"(CNN) -- Washingtonians from both sides of the aisle gathered this week to see actor Kevin Spacey in concert, a benefit for the Kevin Spacey Foundation. ""Good evening and welcome to an evening to benefit the Frank Underwood Super PAC,"" Spacey joked to the sold-out crowd, with a guest list including Dr. Jill Biden, several members of Congress and business leaders. Underwood is the ruthless politician Spacey plays as the star of ""House of Cards."" During his performance Monday night, at Washington's Sidney Harman Hall, he threw in Underwood impersonations among his set list, which ranged from Sinatra to ""Piano Man,"" and an ""All Night Long"" duet with Jeff Goldblum. Yes, that Jeff Goldblum. In between songs, Spacey shared lessons from what he dubbed ""Frank Underwood's Guide to Philanthropy."" ""Generosity is its own form of power,"" he said in his signature Underwoodian Southern drawl. Spacey's foundation strives to ""send the elevator back down"" by training and mentoring emerging artists through scholarships and funding. The actor's commitment to arts accessibility and paying it forward was front and center throughout the benefit, which raised over $700,000 for the foundation. ""The most important thing to me is not a financial or monetary thing. When I'm in a workshop and I see that kid in the corner who is really shy and wants to be involved but doesn't know how, maybe is a little scared. I was that kid,"" Spacey said. ""I want that kid ... to have an experience of realizing something about themselves that they didn't know that they were capable of. That's the moment I live for."" 'House of Cards': Season 2 brings more dirty dealing . Spacey said that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, both in attendance, were ""instrumental"" in developing the role of Frank Underwood, although McCarthy wasn't initially willing to work with him. ""When I first asked to meet (McCarthy), he refused to meet me,"" Spacey told reporters after the show. ""Until he found out I was playing a Democrat."" Although both McCarthy and Hoyer came out publicly against the show's portrayal of Congress, Spacey said, ""You've gotta thank Frank Underwood for getting both sides of the aisle to agree on something.""

"New York (CNN) -- Bill Clinton addressed a number of crime and justice issues during a sweeping talk with CNN on Wednesday, including taking on the National Rifle Association and its pro-gun policy. The former president, in a conversation with CNN's Erin Burnett at the Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York, lumped together the NRA, stand your ground laws, and people surrounding themselves only with those who agree with them as problems that lead to a more violent climate in the United States. Obama's Syrian airstrikes get Bill Clinton's approval . Clinton, however, rejected the idea that several high-profile cases with apparent racial undertones mean the U.S. is more racist than it was in the past. ""I think we have enhanced the risks by changing the environment, basically, because it seems we bought the NRA's theory that we would all be safer if everybody in this audience had a gun that was a concealed weapon,"" Clinton said. ""Then if one of them felt threatened by another, they could stand up right here and stand their ground. And we could watch the whole saga unfold. That is what happens."" NRA focuses on three major Senate races . During the 2013 trial of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida, the NRA stridently advocated to maintain stand your ground laws that allow people to respond with force to would-be attackers. A jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in Martin's death in 2013. The case captured the nation's attention and raised a number of question about race. The Zimmerman trial wasn't the only case involving race that Clinton addressed on Wednesday. Clinton pointed out that the more recent shooting of an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri, ignited similar concerns about race and the law. Overnight on Wednesday the city broke into protests again over the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson. Wilson has not been arrested, but a grand jury in Missouri has taken the Brown case. After weeks of calm, Ferguson erupts again over burned memorial . Clinton said one of the primary problems in Ferguson was that the city's police force and political leadership did not reflect the population. ""You can't have a community that is more than two-thirds African-American where only one in six city council people are African-American and only three out of 60-plus police are African-American,"" Clinton said. ""You've got to have some effort to have ties to the community."" Although Clinton said that while cases like Zimmerman and Ferguson do not mean the country is becoming more racist, he did express concern that the country is ""playing with [racism's] darker possibilities."" ""I actually think we're less racist, less sexist, less homophobic than we used to be,"" Clinton said. ""I think our big problem today is we don't want to be around anybody who disagrees with us. And I think that in some ways can be the worst silo of all to be held up in."" The former president later added, ""I think whenever people are insecure, they tend to return to home base psychologically. We tend to want to be with our own, however we define that. ... I think that's what is really at the root of many of our problems today.""","Bill Clinton says the U.S. is at risk for more violence in part because of NRA policies .

"(CNN) -- Joan Lunden made a bold move when she posed for the cover of this week's People magazine. The former ""Good Morning America"" host appears with sparkling eyes and a broad smile, but without her trademark golden locks. At 64, Lunden is fighting an aggressive form of breast cancer, and has shaved her head as she goes through treatment. Joan Lunden, former 'GMA' host, has cancer . While she could have worn a wig for People's photo shoot, the longtime health advocate saw an opportunity to raise awareness. ""I had to make this big decision about whether or not to do the cover with no hair,"" Lunden told People. ""It certainly isn't the comfortable way to go, but I decided I was going to try and help others and show women that this isn't the end of the world.

While sharing the news on ""Good Morning America"" that month, she got some valuable advice on the ABC program from breast cancer survivor and ""GMA"" co-anchor Robin Roberts.

""When it starts to go, it's shocking, embarrassing and depressing. Pre-empt it. Get it shaved off. I did that. And I thought it was going to be like the biggest deal in the world. And you know what? I felt I didn't have it done to me. I walked in and I said, 'Do this.'"" After consulting with doctors, Lunden opted for an unconventional treatment plan that calls for chemotherapy -- as opposed to the typical mastectomy or lumpectomy -- with the goal of shrinking her tumors so surgery can be minimal. ""You have all these decisions to make, and you have to make them quickly. I had no choice but to go into warrior mode and take this head-on,"" Lunden told People. After 12 weeks of chemotherapy, Lunden learned that two tumors had shrunk by nearly 95%. She was able to bypass the second and more difficult phase of chemotherapy, and after a September 23 surgery to remove the remaining mass she's now focusing on her recovery.

"(CNN) -- ""The first thing he asked was 'Are you the one who said that you are the best drummer in this country?' I laughed and told him, 'I never said so.' He asked me if I could play jazz and I said yes. He asked me if I could take solos and I said yes again."" That's how Tony Allen details his first ever encounter with Fela Kuti back in the mid-1960s, a meeting that was destined to trigger an explosive sonic collaboration that a few years later gave birth to the blistering Afrobeat sound -- arguably the most exciting period in the history of popular West African music. This anecdote, and many more others, are featured in the newly released autobiography of Allen, the iconic Nigerian drummer who's left an indelible stamp on the history of world music with his distinctive style and pioneering grooves. Brian Eno has hailed Allen as the ""greatest living drummer."" Read this: The rise of Fatoumata Diawara . Co-written with Michael E. Veal, ""Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat"" follows Allen's life from his early days growing up in the heart of Lagos Island, though his struggling first steps as a badly paid freelance musician, the meeting with Fela and the heights of their ""Africa 70"" band, to his departure from the group and his relocation to Paris in the mid 1980s. Master drummer . Born in Lagos in 1940 to a Nigerian father and a Ghanaian mother, Allen was the oldest of six children. His first gig came in late 1950s when he started playing clefs in a highlife group called ""The Cool Cats,"" before taking over the band's rhythm section. From then on, Allen went on to hone his self-taught drumming skills by dipping into different styles as a member of several other Lagos bands -- including ""Agu Norris and the Heatwaves,"" ""The Paradise Melody Angels"" and ""The Western Toppers."" In 1964, Allen met up with Fela and his career took a different, more exciting path. Over the next 15 years, Allen would be the rhythmic engine for the Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and political rights activist, first for the highlife-jazz outfit ""Koola Lobitos"" and then for the seminal ""Africa 70"" group. Read this: Femi Kuti builds on his father's legacy . It was after the band returned from a 10-month stay in the United States in 1969 that Allen created the potent drumming concept of Afrobeat, fusing the different beats and patterns he'd heard while growing up with the new techniques he'd mastered as a professional drummer -- everything from highlife and traditional Nigerian music to Western jazz, funk and R&B. ""I was looking for something,"" Allen says, from Paris, where he is currently based. ""I wanted to be myself,"" he adds. ""I played like everybody already but there was no point in continuing doing that because I'd be bored completely."" Allen, the only member of Fela's band allowed to compose his own parts, could famously drum in a different time signature with each of his four limbs. Driven by his fluid and steady drumming, Africa 70 went on to record a string of highly successful and politically charged albums, which turned Fela into a huge musical and countercultural icon in Nigeria and abroad. But it was onstage where the full force of Afrobeat's intoxicating sound and the talents of Fela and Allen really shone through. ""With me and Fela, it's a question of telepathy,"" Allen says of the musical closeness he enjoyed with ""Africa 70's"" firebrand leader. ""That is why I was able to stick around this guy for 15 years -- you know, I never did that with anyone before; the maximum time I stayed in a band was one year,"" adds Allen. ""Since I met him I knew that this guy had something, this is the type of challenge I needed ... I just believed that I am meeting a genius and it's great to work with a genius."" Life after Fela . This deep appreciation of Fela's musical brilliance oozes through the pages of Allen's autobiography. But the narrative is also filled with wrangles over payments and recognition. In the end, Allen says it was not the ongoing pay disputes but the increasingly volatile situation around Fela's political activism that led to Allen leaving the group in 1978 -- events like the army attack on Fela's compound in 1977. ""The only thing that happened was that it became a package of madness,"" Allen says. ""I stood it for a while too, I was inside it -- I had been arrested, I had to submit myself because he is like my brother."" Read this: Meet the Malawi Mouse Boys . Allen's departure left a big void in the heart of the Afrobeat sound. Fela, who replaced his polyrhythmic sideman with four drummers during live performances, once said that ""there would be no Afrobeat without Tony Allen."" The two remained friends until Fela's death in 1997. After leaving ""Africa 70,"" Allen went on to form his own bands in Nigeria before relocating to Paris in 1985. Since then, he's released several well-received albums. A musician committed to innovation, he's joined forces with an eclectic roster of both African and international musicians over the years-- including Damon Albarn, King Sunny Ade and Jimi Tenor. Today, at the age of 73, Allen still remains as active as ever. ""I don't see the end of exploring,"" says Allen, who is currently working on a new album. It's a sentiment echoed in his final remarks in the book. ""I still challenge myself every time with my playing,"" Allen writes. ""I still want to play something impossible, something I never played before.""","Legendary Nigerian drummer Tony Allen has released an autobiography .

"(CNN) -- Cameroon, famous for producing world-class soccer players and infectious ""makossa"" music, is on the dawn of becoming known for something else ... tourism. Tourism arrivals grew by 35% in 2012, and Cameroon has a vast geographical diversity characterized by forest, savannah and mountains, alongside a population of over 250 ethnic groups. Its diversity in terrain and culture has led to Cameroon being referred to as ""Little Africa"" or ""All Africa in one country."" It also boasts some of the richest and most diverse wildlife in the continent and is a dreamland for safari lovers, eco tourists, hikers and culture seekers. On a recent trip to Cameroon I spoke with Bello Bouba Maigari, the minister of tourism and leisure, who is championing the growth of tourism in the country. ""If you mention Cameroon, very few people can look at a map and point out where the country is ... our ambition is to be one of the best known and most attractive destinations in sub Saharan Africa,"" he said. I spent the majority of my trip in the coastal Southwest region, an area comprised of relaxing beaches, mountains, wildlife and cultural discoveries. Here are some of the area's highlights. Mount Cameroon . Buea is the capital of the Southwest region, and home to the breathtaking and awe-inspiring Mount Cameroon, an active volcano that stands at over 13,200 feet (4,023 meters) above sea level. Officially the highest mountain in West and Central Africa, waking up at sunrise at foot of the mountain allows for a spectacularly clear view of the mountain, including the peak, which is an amazing sight to behold. Read this: Liberia: From warzone to holiday paradise? Mount Cameroon provides an amazing hiking opportunity. The landscape ranges from tropical rainforest to savannah, and from a bare snow-capped summit to caves and waterfalls, as well as boasting rare birds and flowers. Hiking tours ranging from a few hours to a full three-day excursion, complete with a guide and someone to carry your bags, can be easily arranged locally for $120 - $150 per person. Black sand beaches . If hiking is not your thing, then you might prefer relaxing in the picturesque town of Limbe, perfectly located between Mount Cameroon and the Atlantic Ocean. Driving to Limbe you are surrounded by miles of lush greenery. With views of the Atlantic Ocean, clear blues skies and Mount Cameroon in the background the landscape is simply stunning and the photo opportunities endless. You will be jumping out of your vehicle several times to simply breathe in the amazing air and absorb the view. Limbe is a popular area for tourists as there is so much to do in this pretty town. Wandering Limbe during the day you will find a picture-perfect busy town (exercise caution when crossing the busy streets) with friendly locals, cafes and the famous black sand beaches. In the town I highly recommend sampling the roadside treats of freshly made French crepes, a throwback to the country's French colonial past. The crepes are delicious -- a popular and familiar treat for the Western palate. The black sand beaches are home to beach lovers and local fisherman, and it is fascinating to sit back and watch the fishermen going about their chores. Be sure to ask before you take any pictures of the fisherman as they may not take kindly to the intrusion. Nevertheless, if you are lucky like I was, you could be taken on an impromptu and interesting tour of the area where the fish are cleaned, smoked and prepared to eat. The fish found in Limbe are mainly bar, ribbon and cuttle fish and are the freshest I have ever tasted. Wildlife and tea . Limbe Botanic Gardens provide the opportunity to see rare flowers and walk amongst the 1,500 closely planted trees, many of which are medicinal. The abundance of trees and flowers makes the gardens a paradise for birds. This is a great place to visit for the entire family; It has a large open-air arena where local traditional dancing and drumming take place, and the dancers actively encourage visitors to join in as they teach you traditional dance moves. There is also a wonderful arts and crafts store where you can buy incredible souvenirs from all over Cameroon. The Limbe Wildlife Center is a thrilling treat. A collaboration between the government of Cameroon and the Pandrillus Foundation, the center is home to 15 species of primate and several other animals native to Cameroon. The center is designed so you feel like you are walking almost amongst the primates despite the electrified wire fences that secure both the animals and visitors. A visit to the Tole Tea Estate, the oldest tea plantation in Cameroon, is another treat. Visitors are taken on a tour around the plantation where you witness each step of the entire tea-making process. At the end of the tour you are treated to a delicious cup of tea presented in a beautiful British-style traditional cup and saucer accompanied by a delightful English biscuit. The juxtaposition of this against the West African backdrop is cause for pause, amusement and delight. Somber reminders of slavery . Like other countries in West Africa, Cameroon was a part of the dark history of slavery when for centuries many Africans were taken from the continent to North and South America, and the West Indies. Not far from Limbe is Bimbia village. Situated on the Atlantic Ocean, Bimbia served as a slave port, and while not as intact as other slave castles in West Africa, you can still clearly see the remains and relics of the former fortress. Read this: 'Slave trade ghost town' Currently under restoration, the path to Bimbia Slave Port requires a long walk through bamboo and bushes, and poignantly this is the same path thousands of slaves walked for centuries on their way to the port. Not to everyone's taste, there is a reenactment of captured slaves complete with shackles and chains, which brings the experience of the slave port to a dramatic reality. Nightlife . Nightlife in Limbe is lively and fun, and ranges from outdoor restaurants to packed nightclubs. The Fini Hotel has a fantastic restaurant that serves an array of Cameroonian dishes and local delicacies such as bitter leaf stew, crocodile and cassava as well as shrimp and fish prepared with local spices like fufu and Eru. Plantains and cocoyams seem to accompany almost every meal. French wines are plentiful in Cameroon, but by far the most popular alcoholic beverages are beers, and Cameroon has its own Castel and 33 beer, which are as popular as they are strong. The popular local nightclub Le Calyspo is part of the Fini hotel, and is designed with the international party going crowd in mind. Another popular nightclub is Spyce. Part of the Chariot Hotel, Spyce was much like any other club you would find elsewhere in the world, with a great sound system and energized crowd that dance to everything from local makossa rhythms, to international pop music. This is just a small sample of what Cameroon has to offer tourists. It must be pointed out that the country is an emerging tourist destination, which means there is still much work to be done in fully developing the tourism sector. While the country is easy to travel around, there are advisories warning against travel to the Far North Province and certain border areas. Amenities can vary dramatically, and even the most seasoned African traveler should be prepared to fully embrace a certain amount of ruggedness. Nevertheless, Cameroon is one of the most rapidly developing tourism markets in sub-Sahara Africa, providing a chance for tourists to visit this stunning part of the world before everyone else catches on.

"(CNN) -- A year ago Sunday, Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed while landing at San Francisco's airport, killing three passengers and injuring 187 more. Survivors remember the incident, in which the plane clipped a seawall just short of the runway, spun violently for 330 degrees, broke into pieces and caught fire. It all occurred on a clear day. ""It was like we were all bouncing all over the place. I just remember there being dust everywhere, and I was freaking out and then it just stopped,"" said Esther Jang, 15. Said another passenger, Ben Levy: ""And there was no wind, no fog. I'm a regular at the San Francisco airport. So, yeah, it was so shocking that we could miss the runway by so much."" The crash marked the first time that the new Boeing 777, one of the most sophisticated airliners, was involved in a fatal crash. Since then, another Boeing 777, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, disappeared after takeover from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. Authorities have yet to solve the mystery of what became of the plane carrying 239 passengers and crew. In the Asiana crash, one of the three people killed was Ye Meng Yuan, 16, who died on the ground when she was apparently hit by a rescue truck responding to the scene, according to the San Mateo County coroner. A subsequent video suggested that at one point emergency workers saw Ye's body on the tarmac during the chaos. But a January report by San Francisco authorities asserted that Ye was already dead when two fire trucks ran over her on the airfield. Earlier this year, a lawyer for Ye's family said a video shows that several firefighters saw her lying on the tarmac, but none ""did the basic step of checking if she was alive."" The teenage girl was on her way to an American summer camp from her home in China when the crash happened. Last month, U.S. safety investigators determined that the pilots erred on the approach and landing of the plane. Also contributing to the disaster was crew training and the complexities of a key flight system on the Boeing 777 and how it was described in operating manuals, the National Transportation Safety Board found. Investigators, however, primarily faulted the crew of the South Korean-based carrier for not fully executing intricate systems of the jetliner packed with more than 300 people. The flight crew mismanaged the plane's descent being carried out without the help of navigational instruments, and one of the pilots unintentionally deactivated a system that automatically regulates airspeed, the board's final report said. The crew also delayed its decision to abort the landing with the plane flying too slowly to avoid catastrophe, investigators found. Of the 307 people on board, almost 200 of them were taken to local hospitals with injuries such as bruises, broken bones and spinal damage. Passenger Eugene Rah broke his jaw and injured his back and hip. A year later, he's still dealing with the fallout. ""I'm grateful that I'm still alive. The problem is the consequences change some of my life,"" he told CNN. ""I couldn't really do much normal activities and work as before."" The flight originated in Shanghai, China, made a connection in Seoul, South Korea, and then flew 10 hours to San Francisco International Airport. Pilots blamed for Asiana crash . CNN's Dan Simon contributed from San Francisco.","""We were all bouncing all over the place,"" one survivor says .

"(CNN) -- The ability to live completely off the grid is now a reality courtesy of solar homes, known as Earthships. The U-shaped buildings utilize local resources such as the sun and are made entirely of natural and recycled materials. The future of city living may be to not need the city at all. ""An Earthship is the name we have given a building or vessel that we use to live on this planet that is absolutely independent of all public and municipal utilities,"" explains Michael Reynolds, founder of Earthship Biotecture, who developed the concept. In the mountains of New Mexico, USA, Reynolds has built 15 cliff-top homes which, as well as providing a view, were designed to prove that the Earthships could be built anywhere. At their core are walls made from old tires, bottles, and tin cans mixed with concrete, so your home leftovers are creating new homes. Even sewage isn't spared and is used in indoor and outdoor treatment cells for food production and landscaping. Leftover 'gray' water is also used to flush toilets. ""We were accused of running sewage through the living room,"" says Reynolds. ""That was scary to people but when you see the pictures of what it looks like, it's no longer scary if you understand it."" Most modern amenities such as plumbing, heating, power and even internet are provided in a self-sufficient way to change the face of remote living. The use of a design known as the 'stack effect' in their construction uses natural ventilation to regulate internal temperatures for comfort. ""A lot of people think off-the-grid living is like living in some kind of teepee or something,"" says Reynolds. ""This is a pretty damn nice house."" The Earthships range in price from $250,000 to $1.5 million. But remote deserts are not the only modus operandi, as Reynolds' company has also built 75 homes across the city of Taos, New Mexico and his designs have gone global. Earthships have been built across the USA, entered Europe, and relief projects are being developed in Malawi, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Philippines, and New Zealand. Fundraising is taking place for a self-sustaining music school on Easter Island, one of the most remote locations in the world. But the spread of these ships has not been plain sailing, as their radical design breaks most architectural rules. Reynolds has battled with local governments about the Earthships meeting structural codes. However, his fights are being won as hundreds of people now live, or use, these uniquely designed buildings around the world. The company's next goal is to expand from remote living to more self-sufficient cities which would be more affordable and sustainable to build -- an Earthship city. ""If some government or corporation was getting ready to do a city for ten thousand people, they'd spend ten years putting in infrastructure to support that city's power and sewage,"" concludes Reynolds. ""We don't need that: if I had a thousand acres somewhere, and funding, I could start building a city tomorrow.""","Earthships are self-sustainable buildings independent of all utilities .

"(CNN) -- A fishing trawler swept away more than a year ago by a tsunami off the east coast of Japan has been spotted floating near British Columbia, Canadian officials said. ""It looks fairly sound and has rust streak from being out there for a year,"" said Marc Proulx, the maritime coordinator of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Victoria, British Columbia. The trawler was stable and posed no danger Saturday, officials said. The trawler is part of a giant debris field that was generated by the giant wall of water that struck the east coast of the island nation a year ago following a 9.0 earthquake, sweeping everything from cars to houses into the ocean. The fishing vessel is about 120 miles off the Queen Charlotte Islands, commonly referred to as the Haida Gwaii. The islands are an archipelago on the north coast of the British Columbia. It was first spotted by a Canadian military air patrol, and it has since been determined that it has been adrift without anybody at the helm since March 11, 2011, Proulx said Friday. The Japan Coast Guard identified the owner of the vessel after being contacted Friday by Canadian officials, who were able to provide the identification number on the hull of the ship. The vessel, which was used for squid fishing, was moored at Hachinohe in the Aomori prefecture when the tsunami hit, said Toshiro Yoshinaga, a Coast Guard official. The trawler is considered a navigation obstruction for vessels in the area, according to Canada's Department of National Defense. Mariners received a notice about the vessel's presence. Canadian agencies are monitoring the ship for possible marine pollution, though there are no reports of leaks from the vessel, the defense department said. CNN's Jake Carpenter and Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","NEW: The ship is stable and poses no danger .

"London (CNN) -- You've heard of Banksy, but have you heard of Bambi? Not the Bambi of Disney fame, but the one dubbed street art's new star. The so-called ""female Banksy"" counts A-list celebrities like Kanye West and Brad Pitt as buyers of her stenciled street art. Like Banksy, her works command price tags that run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Also, like Banksy, she is determined to stay anonymous. Defacing property is a criminal offense in the UK, and Bambi has spent years avoiding detection. Now, the intrigue around her identity has boosted her popularity. Michael Sahkai, director of Walton Fine Arts and Bambi's broker, is one of few people who know the artist's real identity. The mystery ""does add to the flavor, and the charisma -- and makes it a bit more interesting,"" he told CNN. When CNN asked Sahkai for some clues to Bambi's identity he revealed she is in her mid 30s, studied at London's world-renowned art school Central St. Martins, and lives in the capital. British media have suggested Bambi is Paloma Faith or rapper M.I.A but when questioned on this Sahkai would only reply: ""Everything is possible."" Bambi's bold images and pop culture references have given her a distinctive voice in the male dominated world of street, Sahkai said. People, he added, are ""amazed by the freshness and unusuality of her works."" Some of her artworks, like an homage to singer Amy Winehouse in Camden, are protected under Perspex and regarded as cultural landmarks. Others, including a famed depiction of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge which was captioned ""a bit like Marmite,"" are painted over. Bambi's ""Diamond Queen,"" created to mark Queen Elizabeth's Jubilee in 2012, has been defaced by graffiti. But Sahkai said Bambi had made her mark in the street art world, which he believes is undergoing a resurgence. ""Banksy relit it fifteen, twenty years ago.

"(CNN) -- On Christmas Day last year, Alan Henning was sitting in a brightly lit cafe in southern Turkey, sharing a laugh with his friends before they set off on their journey. Henning, a big-hearted taxi driver from Bolton, northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling from Britain to Syria to deliver aid to people in need. Nicknamed ""Gadget"" by his peers, Henning was the only non-Muslim in the convoy. He sacrificed Christmas, weekends and family time to do his part for those worst hit by Syria's civil war, and was admired by his fellow volunteers. On Friday, his life of sacrifice ended. A short video released by ISIS showed the apparent beheading of Henning. Before he was killed, Henning spoke to the camera, referencing the British Parliament's decision to join the bombing campaign against ISIS. At the end of the video, ISIS shows an American aid worker, Peter Kassig, and threatens his life. Henning, a father of two, had made four trips to the war-torn country. While part of the aid convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning was part of a much smaller group that volunteered to press ahead into Syria. In video shot that day, he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help.

"(CNN) -- What does a 22-year-old see when she looks at herself in the mirror? Evelyn Apoko sees a face marred by war, one that is jarring to others. Even she can't stand to look sometimes. Doctors reconstructed her jaw, removed scars and balanced her lips. In the coming days, she will get a new jaw implant, a bone graft and a set of upper teeth. ""I see me,"" she says, after pausing to think about how she might describe her reflection. ""I look into my eyes and I know there is something there."" That something came from three harrowing years of captivity and the inner fortitude that fueled her desire to survive, so that she could live to tell about the ugliness she saw. One summer night in 2001, Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) guerrillas snatched Apoko from a community center near her home in Gulu district, Uganda. Notorious for their cold-blooded cruelty, the LRA beat her, tortured her. She chooses not to discuss all the details but says this: if she didn't do what the LRA told her, she knew she would die. Apoko's tale, sadly, is not uncommon. She is among thousands of children abducted by the LRA. Yet her pleas, and the pleas of all others who have tried to put an end to the abuse and killings committed by the LRA, have fallen largely on deaf years, she says. As she awaits her final round of surgery in Austin, Texas, Apoko is glad that the LRA-instigated conflict, the longest running in Africa, finally made headlines this year. She rejoiced in President Barack Obama's decision last week to send 100 U.S. military advisers to the Central African Republic to help hunt down LRA leaders. And she rebuked conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who lambasted Obama and defended the LRA as Christians aiming to remove dictatorship. ""Lord's Resistance Army are Christians,"" Limbaugh said. ""They are fighting the Muslims in Sudan. And Obama has sent troops, United States troops, to remove them from the battlefield, which means kill them."" ""Dear Mr. Limbaugh,"" Apoko responded in a video message she sent to him. ""My name is Evelyn. I am a former abducted child. My heart breaks when I hear your message about the LRA."" She had no mouth left . Apoko, an ethnic Acholi, hailed from a poor family of nine children and grew up working on the farm with her parents. They grew corn, ground nut, cassava, sweet potatoes. She was a night commuter, as were many children in her district. Every night, she traveled almost 10 miles just to sleep in the town center, where her parents felt she would be safer under near other public buildings and under the watch of the Ugandan army. In many cases, parents put their children in cages to protect them from the LRA. The LRA sprouted as a rebel movement in the late 1980s among the Acholi people in marginalized northern Uganda. But if there was a group ideology, little remains today. Human rights groups say the LRA is known as a cult group that follows the self-proclaimed spiritual powers of its leader, Joseph Kony, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for atrocities. For more than two decades, the LRA has targeted civilians and terrorized them in Uganda and other neighboring nations. When the LRA's ruthless ways dwindled support from the Acholi people, it began abducting children to carry on the fight. The group liked to kidnap boys and girls between the ages of nine and 12 -- strong enough to shoot a gun, small enough to squeeze through a window, young enough to have their moral compasses recalibrated to kill. Apoko was one of them. ""It is not uncommon for the girls who are abducted to be converted into sex slaves or forced into marriages with LRA fighters,"" according to Daniel DePetris, associate editor of the Maxwell Journal of Counterterrorism and Security Analysis. ""The boys who are snatched up have two choices, which are not really choices at all. Either they fight to the death for Kony's apocalyptic worldview, or they can expect to be executed and dumped into a mass grave filled with their victims,"" DePetris wrote in a CNN article. Or, sometimes, the girls are used as mules, says Jedidiah Jenkins, spokesman for the advocacy group Invisible Children. Apoko recalled walking and walking. Day and night. Without food, without water. She was forced to carry things. The LRA stays alive by constantly moving, Jenkins said. Through the thick, remote jungles of southern Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. There, people are poor and disconnected from the rest of the world. ""The LRA are basically like sharks,"" Jenkins says. ""When people get too tired, they just kill them."" Or in the very least, hurt them. The LRA soldiers beat Apoko. It was impossible to live among them and not be subjugated. Sometimes Apoko got caught in ambushes or firefights. She saw other children die around her. She had not even reached her teenage years and yet, there was no one around to hold her, soothe her, tell her things would be alright. Days turned to months. More than a year passed like this for Apoko. One day, planes roared overhead -- the Ugandan and Congolese armies often raided the LRA. The winds were strong, the planes flew low. A bomb exploded behind her. Her backpack, laden that day with heavy pots and pans, caught on fire. She felt a sharp pain in her foot. She took her shoe off and saw it was full of blood. She was carrying a child in her arms, desperate to find safe haven somewhere. And then she felt the blast of another bomb. Shrapnel tore into her body, mangled her flesh, shattered all her teeth. In place of her face, there was a giant hole, like a crater in the ground. Her clothes dripped with blood. She gasped for air. She realized the child had died in her arms. She laid her down by her mother's body. She did not want them to be separated. She remembers the guerrillas snapping pictures of her. They sent them to Kony to ascertain if she was worth saving. They were going to pull the trigger unless she could keep walking. And so she did, even with her horrific wounds. The LRA spared her life but refused her treatment. Soon, infection set in. She couldn't tell whether she would survive. She had no jaw or mouth left so she couldn't eat or chew. Instead, she lay down on the ground and poured liquid food into her mouth. She had only one set of clothes, constantly damp and smelly from the saliva that dribbled out. She knew she was a better, kinder person than the people around her who had inflicted such cruelty. She knew she had to escape. 'Hardly human' One night in the fall of 2004, Apoko she said she was going to the bathroom but she never went back. She ran through the forest the darkness and didn't stop until she reached safety in Uganda. She was admitted to the Rachele Rehabilitation Center in northern Uganda, which takes in child soldiers and helps them assimilate back into normal life. And she was able to see her family again. She first arrived for a series of surgeries in the United States in 2005 with the help of Cori Stern, a co-founder of the Strongheart Fellowship Program, which seeks to help young survivors of trauma heal and begin life anew. In between her surgeries, she returned to Uganda to endure more tragedy. Her pregnant mother and the baby girl she was about to deliver died after they were poisoned. Apoko arrived in America frightened and without speaking a word of English. Those who sheltered her here are amazed that she is the same woman who delivered a recorded message to Rush Limbaugh earlier this month. ""The LRA is not Christian,"" she told the talk show host. ""Joseph Kony and his commanders could hardly be considered human."" In the video, Apoko wore a necklace bearing the name of an abducted child, part of a campaign to raise money and awareness. That is her mission now -- to bring peace to children who have suffered. She even wants to try her hand at making a documentary film. And next month, she will appear in an episode of ""Facing Trauma,"" a series airing on Discovery Fit & Health channel about women who have suffered facial injury. ""Enough children have died and too many have been displaced,"" Apoko said in her video. ""Every human being deserves peace in their life. We all deserve to live life without fear."" But all these years have gone by and efforts to quell LRA violence have not been successful. Ironically, it was Limbaugh's statements about the LRA that has cast attention on a neglected conflict, said Jenkins, the spokesman for Invisible Children. Apoko is still waiting to hear back from Limbaugh. And waiting for the last round of surgery. The reflection in the mirror will perhaps be more pleasing to look at then. But she will always see ""something there.""","The Lord's Resistance Army abducted Evelyn Apoko when she was only 12 .
She was beaten, abused and suffered horrific injuries from a bomb blast .
She escaped after three years and U.S. doctors operated on her face .
Recently, she told Rush Limbaugh he was wrong to call the LRA Christians ."
"(CNN) -- Former football star Deion Sanders and a third person also were cited for misdemeanor assault in an incident this week that resulted in Sanders' estranged wife being arrested and taken into custody, according to a statement Wednesday by the Prosper, Texas, police department. The statement said police responded to a domestic disturbance call Monday afternoon at a residence in the Dallas suburb where Sanders, 44, complained he was assaulted by Pilar Sanders, 38, and another woman identified as Dianna Boswell, also 38. Pilar Sanders was detained and taken into custody on a charge of simple assault, a misdemeanor, the statement said. ""Further investigation of the circumstances prompted the responding officers to cite Mr. Deion Sanders and Ms. Dianna Boswell with Class C Simple Assault,"" it continued. Only Pilar Sanders was taken into custody. She was released Tuesday and said she hasn't been given a ""fair shake"" over allegations that she attacked Sanders in an incident he made public in a series of bizarre Twitter postings. ""I understand that I have very little chance at beating a Hall of Fame, two-sport man that everyone seems to love and adore,"" Pilar Sanders said, proclaiming her innocence. The Collin County Sheriff's Office said Pilar Sanders, under an emergency protective order, is forbidden from returning to the couple's home for 61 days and cannot threaten or harass any member of the family. In one of the messages posted Monday on his verified Twitter account, Deion Sanders included a photo of what he said were his children filling out complaints to give to police in Texas. ""Pray for me and my kids now! They just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room,"" said the first tweet, posted at 6:15 p.m. ""She's going to jail n I'm pressing charges!"" Two minutes later, Sanders tweeted again. ""I'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but I warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys. This is on my mama!"" it said. Shortly after that, Sanders tweeted a picture that showed him and his two boys, 10 and 12, filling out paperwork. ""Filling out police reports now! Thank God for this platform to issue the Truth,"" the caption read. Pilar Sanders was booked into jail Monday night on suspicion of assault family violence, according to booking records at the Collin County Jail. Bail was set at $264. ""I can tell you that there are two sides to every story, and the truth will come out in court,"" Larry Friedman, an attorney for Pilar Sanders, said Tuesday. Deion Sanders played for several NFL teams, including the San Francisco 49ers, the Dallas Cowboys and the Atlanta Falcons. He was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame and works as an analyst for the NFL Network. During much of his NFL career, he also was an outfielder with four Major League Baseball teams and played in a World Series with the Atlanta Braves. The NFL Network and Sanders' business manager, Constance Schwartz, declined to comment about the incident. But a clearly emotional Sanders spoke to Dallas television station KXAS on Monday night and appealed for help. ""My kids, they are scared for their life,"" he told the station. ""They just saw two women jump their dad in his own house, in his room, in my room. It's sad. ""I got locks on my doors right now,"" he added. ""Is somebody going to have to die? Is it going to be me before the court does something and get this woman out of my house? It's absurd."" The Sanderses have three children together. Deion Sanders has two other children from an earlier relationship. The couple married in 1999 and starred in a reality show, ""Deion & Pilar: Prime Time Love,"" that aired on the Oxygen network. The marriage soured, however, and the two are in a bitter divorce. In February, Pilar Sanders filed a suit against her husband and his aunt, Laura Jones. She said the aunt attacked her in their 10-bedroom, 29,000-square-foot home in Prosper while Deion Sanders watched. At the time, the athlete tweeted that his wife was the aggressor and the aunt was in the home merely to fix his phone. Pilar Sanders also filed a separate suit against her husband and his daughter, Deiondra, after she called her stepmother a ""gold-digging (expletive)"" and ""the number one gold digger of the year"" in Twitter posts. In the second suit, Pilar Sanders demanded $200 million in damages for libelous and slanderous comments. She claims that her husband ""endorsed Deiondra's false statements"" and himself tweeted he was ""tired of all (Pilar's) lies and foolishness.""","Sanders, his estranged wife and a third person all were cited in the Monday incident .

"(CNN) -- A circus producer said Friday that an animal rights group has paid it $9.3 million to settle two federal court cases claiming elephant abuse. Feld Entertainment, Inc., trumpeted the settlement with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) as a victory for its Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. ""These defendants attempted to destroy our family-owned business with a hired plaintiff who made statements that the court did not believe,"" said Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Feld Entertainment, in a statement. ""Animal activists have been attacking our family, our company, and our employees for decades because they oppose animals in circuses,"" Feld said. ""This settlement is a vindication not just for the company but also for the dedicated men and women who spend their lives working and caring for all the animals with Ringling Brothers in the face of such targeted, malicious rhetoric."" The ASPCA was one of several animal rights groups that sued Feld Entertainment in 2000, alleging that circus elephants were abused. Both parties filed dismissal papers in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The ASPCA confirmed the settlement, saying in a statement that ""the organization does not admit to any liability or wrongdoing."" The court never ruled on the merits of the elephant abuse allegations, it said. ""After more than a decade of litigating with Feld Entertainment, the ASPCA concluded that it is in the best interests of the organization to resolve this expensive, protracted litigation,"" said ASPCA President and CEO Ed Sayres in the statement. Feld's cases, which include allegations of litigation abuse and racketeering, will continue against the other defendants -- the Humane Society of the United States, the Fund for Animals, the Animal Welfare Institute, the Animal Protection Institute United with Born Free USA and Tom Rider, a former circus employee who testified against Ringling Bros. U.S. District Judge Emmett G. Sullivan deemed Rider's testimony tainted because he had been paid by animal rights activists and did not have standing to sue. ""The court finds that Mr. Rider is essentially a paid plaintiff and fact witness who is not credible, and therefore affords no weight to his testimony regarding the matters discussed herein, i.e., the allegations related to his standing to sue,"" he wrote in a December 2009 opinion. CNN was not able to reach Rider on Friday. ASPCA spokeswoman Elizabeth Estroff would not comment on specifics of the case. Friday's settlement did not placate Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. ""While HSUS was not a party to the original case against Ringling, we agree with so many critics of the circus that its treatment of elephants is deplorable and unacceptable. We'll continue to make our case to the public, even as Ringling files frivolous and retaliatory legal actions to divert and distract from its abuse of elephants,"" he said in a statement. John Simpson, lead counsel for Feld and a partner at Fulbright & Jaworski in Washington, said Feld's legal costs since July 2000 have exceeded $20 million, but that settlements with other defendants may be reached. ""We're going to see this through to conclusion, whether it ends in a verdict or whether it ends in a settlement,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""But they know where to find me."" The toll of the case has gone beyond a financial one, he said. ""It gets very personal and nasty out there on the line when the company's employees are handling the elephants in public on walks,"" he said. ""I think the people who have cared for these animals have suffered and been unjustly accused."" CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","ASPCA pays $9.3 million to Feld Entertainment, Inc.

"(CNN) -- Mohamed ElBaradei, who is said to be a candidate for Egypt's interim prime minister following a military coup, has been regarded as an outsider in his native land because of his international achievements as a diplomat and co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. An above-the-fray image hurt him when he unsuccessfully ran for president last year in the country's first democratic elections following the 2011 ouster of despotic President Hosni Mubarak. At the time, ElBaradei was a Johnny-come-lately to the long grind of ground-level politics. As if to prove naysayers wrong, ElBaradei stayed in the fight for Egypt's post-revolution government, and he endured as a reformer, becoming an opposition leader. Mohamed ElBaradei: Fast Facts . Now ElBaradei could possibly land deep inside Egypt's power structure, in the nation's capital where he was born 71 years ago. His political party's claim Saturday -- that ElBaradei was chosen to become interim prime minister -- was contradicted later in the day by a spokesman for Interim President Adly Mansour, who said a decision had yet to be made. ""I hope I'll be the Ã©minence grise,"" ElBaradei told CNN this week, with a measure of laughter. ""I'm getting on with the years ... and I think I'll be much more effective. ""As a lawyer I want always to be within the bounds of constitutional legality but ... we still are between a rock and hard place,"" he continued. ""Either you risk a civil war -- and we have quite a few of them around us -- or, as I said, take extra-constitutional measures to ensure that we get the country together."" Like his father, ElBaradei studied law, earning a bachelor's degree at University of Cairo. He then left the country, traveling as a diplomat. By 1974, he earned a doctorate in international law from New York University, and a decade later, he joined the International Atomic Energy Agency -- which proved to be a brilliant career move because it eventually led him and the agency to share the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. ElBaradei served as chief of the atomic agency for 12 years. He and the agency won the honor for their work to curb nuclear proliferation. As director general of the IAEA, he even challenged President George W. Bush's claims that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program before Bush ordered a coalition-supported invasion of Iraq in early 2003. With those international laurels, ElBaradei was among those who successfully pushed for the ouster of Mubarak after 30 years as president. Still, ElBaradei was considered an above-it-all technocrat who was viewed as an unlikely presidential candidate, though he did join anti-Mubarak protests in Egypt despite receiving death threats. He had no official protection during his participation in those protests. ElBaradei was reportedly placed under house arrest by Egyptian authorities, but he defied a government curfew and went to Cairo's Tahrir Square to join protests in January 2011. The next month, Mubarak stepped down. In March 2011, ElBaradei announced he was running for president, and 10 days later, thugs attacked his car, keeping him from voting in a constitutional referendum. The next month, he returned to his first love -- diplomacy and atomic weapons -- and published a book, ""The Age of Deception: Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times."" The publisher's blurb states that ""ElBaradei takes us inside the nuclear fray, from behind-the-scenes exchanges in Washington and Baghdad to the streets of Pyongyang and the trail of Pakistani nuclear smugglers. He decries an us-versus-them approach and insists on the necessity of relentless diplomacy."" If that was a campaign strategy, it didn't work: In January 2012, he quit the presidential race. In an example of how politics can make for strange bedfellows, ElBaradei then criticized the interim military government -- the same military that has now put him in power -- for failing to bring about ""a real democratic system."" It's clear now, however, that ElBaradei has the attention of Egypt's generals.","Mohamed ElBaradei was born in Cairo 71 years ago, but has been viewed as an outsider .
He traveled as a diplomat and chief of International Atomic Energy Agency .
He unsuccessfully ran last year for president in first elections since revolution .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi was named World Player of the Year for the second straight year Monday, pipping Barcelona teammates Andres Iniesta and Xavi to the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or. Argentina star Messi is the first footballer to win the global award for two years in row since Brazil's Ronaldinho claimed the honor in 2004 and 2005. 23-year-old Messi starred as Barcelona retained Spain's La Liga title and has continued his heroics as they lead the standings this season. He scored no less than 60 goals for his club and country in 2010. Iniesta and Xavi share a midfield partnership for the Catalan giants and both played a key role as Spain won the World Cup, with Iniesta scoring the only goal of the final as they beat the Dutch 1-0. Messi won with 22.65 percent of the votes cast, with Iniesta on 17.36 percent and Xavi third with 16.48percent. He said he had been surprised to win the award again. ""To tell you the truth, I did not expect to win today, to win it makes a very special day,"" Messi told the audience at the gala ceremony in Zurich, which was hosted by CNN's Pedro Pinto. This year was the first for the FIFA Ballon d'Or. It is an amalgamation of FIFA's World Player of the Year and France Football magazine's Footballer of the Year award, which started back in 1956.

"(CNN) -- The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday approved ""high-level rules of the road"" designed to ensure that internet providers grant everyone equal access to the Web. But the 3-2 vote immediately came under attack from both flanks, with internet-freedom advocates saying the new rules don't go far enough and critics saying the government should stay out of online business altogether. In announcing the proposed rules this month, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said they would require high-speed internet providers to treat all types of Web content equally. The rules are designed to, in effect, keep the companies that own the internet's real-world infrastructure from slowing down some types of websites or apps -- say, those belonging to a competitor -- or speeding up others for high-paying clients. For average internet users, the vote affects whether government will guarantee they'll continue to have access to all Web content, regardless of their internet provider's wishes, and whether they'll get that content as quickly as businesses or individuals able to pay more for it. The commission's agenda said the vote addressed ""basic rules of the road to preserve the open internet as a platform for innovation, investment, competition and free expression."" Web freedom advocates argue the vote doesn't do that. Commissioner Michael Copps, a Democrat, signed off on the rules but called them only a ""first step in the right direction."" ""In my book, today's action could have, and should have, gone further,"" he said. ""Going as far as I would have liked was, however, not in the cards."" For example, he said, the rules won't absolutely prevent broadband providers from ""pay for priority"" -- giving faster service to those able to pay for it, or to one favored business over another. Instead, the regulations say those practices ""generally violate"" nondiscrimination rules. The vote was along party lines, with the commission's three Democrats voting to ""concur"" with the rules and its two Republicans voting against them. Commissioner Robert McDowell, a Republican, called the vote a ""radical step"" and said it puts the FCC ""on a collision course"" with the courts, which he predicted will throw the rules out. ""The FCC is not Congress,"" he said. ""We cannot make laws."" Republicans have largely argued the government has no right to interfere with business practices online. McDowell said ""nothing is broken in the internet-access market that needs fixing."" President Barack Obama, in a written statement, called the rules an important part of his administration's goal of advancing ""American innovation, economic growth and job creation."" ""Today's decision will help preserve the free and open nature of the Internet while encouraging innovation, protecting consumer choice, and defending free speech,"" Obama said. As a candidate, Obama pledged to support open-internet policies. Although the commission approved the rules, Congress could still act to amend or weaken them. Members of the House and Senate, from both sides of the aisle, have expressed concerns for different reasons. Internet proposal sets off political firestorm . Lawmakers already are considering legislation that would, in effect, repeal the rules. And at least one is threatening to cut off funding to the FCC to implement  the rules. The proposal also doesn't set the same set of rules for mobile communications as it does for Web-based ones. So, the rules protecting information on a home computer might not keep the same data free on a mobile phone. Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat and one of Congress' most vocal net-neutrality advocates, calls the issue ""the most important free-speech issue of our time."" In a column Monday for The Huffington Post, Franken said some of the current proposal's language could actually weaken protections. ""(T)his Tuesday, when the FCC meets to discuss this badly flawed proposal, I'll be watching,"" he wrote. ""If they approve it as is, I'll be outraged. And you should be, too."" Copps, however, said that ""if vigilantly and vigorously implemented by the commission -- and if upheld by the courts -- it could represent an important milestone in the ongoing struggle to safeguard the awesome opportunity-creating power of the open internet."" Genachowski, the FCC chairman argued that currently there are no rules governing internet freedom and that the regulations strike a balance between the two extremes of opinion. He also noted they include new rules for mobile that address some critics' concerns. He called the policies ""high-level rules of the road"" and called internet freedom an ongoing issue for the commission.","FCC approves open-internet ""neutrality"" plan, with complaints from both sides .

"(Careerbuilder.com)  -- Author BJ Gallagher, who has been a boss and worked for male and female bosses, has a list of tips she's titled, ""How to Tell a Male Boss From a Female Boss."" -- A male boss is aggressive; a female boss is pushy. -- A male boss is attentive to details; a female boss is picky. -- He knows how to follow through; she doesn't know when to quit. -- He's ambitious; she's driven. -- He loses his temper occasionally; she can't control her emotions. -- He isn't afraid to say what he thinks; she's mouthy. -- He's a man of action; she's impulsive. -- He controls his emotions; she's cold. -- He thinks before he acts; she can't make up her mind. -- He thinks before he speaks; she second-guesses herself. -- He tells it like it is; she's tactless. The list might read like an e-mail forward that people laugh at, but considering the average American woman earns approximately 21 percent less than the average man, is there any truth to these perceptions? ""I can tell you that the exact same behavior is judged differently, depending on whether it's a male or a female doing the behavior. This is true at all levels in the organization,"" says Gallagher, author of ""Everything I Need to Know I Learned From Other Women."" It's all about perceptions . Vicky Oliver, author of ""Bad Bosses, Crazy Coworkers and Other Office Idiots,"" says she sees the differences in how people perceive professional men and women. Oliver says leaders of both genders can show aggression and still be accepted by their employees. The problem arises for midlevel professionals. ""Yelling, berating underlings, slamming doors, throwing chairs and loud, truculent phone conversations with vendors on speakerphone that everyone can hear can sometimes be career-stallers,"" Oliver explains. ""If a woman acts out, underlings will gossip about her, and eventually their whispers will be overheard by someone in top management. If a man in the middle behaves in the same way, sometimes underlings will strive to ally with him. They may perceive that he is powerful or protected. His behavior is still errant, but it's less likely to get him in trouble because he'll have more allies to defend him if push comes to shove."" Obviously, abrasive behavior isn't the entire problem. How people react to it is also an issue, and it carries over into other types of workplace behavior. ""Crying is the worst emotion to show at the office, and unfortunately, this is generally a female response,"" Oliver says. ""Crying makes everyone around you feel like you're weak and out of control, and it will positively unnerve some men in the office who won't know how to react. Crying seems to be mildly acceptable in certain circumstances (such as when a female employee is laid off); it's never acceptable as a response to a disagreement or office showdown."" Naturally, if people didn't let tears unnerve them, becoming emotional wouldn't be a problem. But the fact that we use ""emotional"" to describe tears -- but not screaming -- alludes to the problem, considering that they're both effects of an emotion. Beware of the 'crazy' woman . Clinical social worker Irina Firstein has been a therapist for more than 20 years and has seen the problem firsthand. ""Unfortunately, it has been my experience that the workplace is more forgiving of a man than a woman,"" Firstein says. ""A man being emotional usually means inability to control temper. A woman being emotional is being 'crazy.'"" In Firstein's opinion, the problem doesn't come only from men. She says women are more tolerant of a man's unfavorable behavior than a woman's. As a result, a strong woman is seen as competition by male and female colleagues alike, putting her in a tougher spot than her male counterparts. Oliver suggests you try to understand the behavior. You don't have to like it, but you might be able to handle it with less bias. ""I feel that sometimes people react at the office in a similar way as they've been conditioned to in their personal lives,"" she says. Fits of rage could be the result of upbringing or a current household, not necessarily your performance. ""If you happen to be on the receiving end of [someone's] outbursts, it's helpful to remind yourself that most over-the-top reactions are not about business ... it is personal, and it's about something in that person's life that has nothing whatsoever to do with you. The person is just venting steam."" Does that mean you have to accept what's happening? No. Learning how to deal with an angry boss is one thing; learning how to stand up for yourself is another. Know when to speak up . If you're a woman, you could find yourself in this situation more often than you'd like. Author Judy Hoffman still remembers a specific instance when she let intimidation get the best of her. ""I was the only woman on the executive team of our small chemical manufacturing company. At meetings, whenever I would voice my opinion, one male chauvinist -- the vice president of manufacturing -- would sit with his head in his hands, elbows on the table, looking down at the floor,"" Hoffman says. ""It was very clear what he was saying: 'Why in the world would this woman be allowed to sit at the same table with us men, daring to give advice to the president of the company?'"" Hoffman hadn't received that kind of hostility while at the company for 16 years prior to his arrival, and she didn't confront him on the issue. ""To this day, I'm embarrassed that I did not deal with it better as I let it fluster me,"" she recalls. ""But it didn't make me stop speaking up when called for."" Even if Hoffman didn't address the VP, she didn't let him alter her behavior because she knew the problem was his and not hers. When you think about it, if an outspoken woman is going to be called mouthy and a quiet one will be labeled a pushover, what do you have to lose by being strong-willed? &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Seven alleged Los Angeles street gang members are charged with kidnapping and robbing a man who testified in court that they were after a Shaquille O'Neal sex tape he had. Los Angeles prosecutors said they have not verified the sex tape, purportedly showing the retired basketball star having sex with several women, actually exists. The alleged victim is Robert Ross, who said he was a member of the defendants' Main Street Mafia Crips Gang before he became a music promoter. Ross testified at the defendants' preliminary hearing Monday that the gang members kidnapped him at gunpoint on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, California, the night of the 2008 Grammy Awards. They allegedly took him to the Los Angeles home of lead defendant Ladell Rowles. ""Defendant Rowles escorted victim Ross to a back room where he struck him with his handgun,"" the criminal complaint said. The men took Ross' diamond chain, Rolex watch, diamond earrings and $15,000 in cash, the complaint said. Ross, while on the witness stand, said it was then they demanded he hand over the videotape of O'Neal having sex with several women. He testified that O'Neal knew through a mutual acquaintance that he had the videotape. Ross, who said he was friends with O'Neal, testified that he tried to place music groups with O'Neal's record label. A prosecutor said O'Neal is not involved in the case. O'Neal did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment about the allegations in the case. He recently announced his retirement as a pro basketball player after 19 years in the NBA. The preliminary hearing, which began last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, was continued until next month.","Seven alleged gang members are charged with kidnapping and robbing Robert Ross .

"(CNN) -- Illegal immigrants can qualify to pay cheaper in-state tuition rates at California public universities, the state's Supreme Court ruled Monday. The California Supreme Court's unanimous decision reversed a ruling by the state Court of Appeals and allowed the state's higher education institutions to continue their policy of allowing certain unlawful immigrants to pay in-state rates. The lower court had ruled that such immigrants, even if they lived and studied in California, should be treated as ""nonresidents"" when it came to how much they paid to go to these schools. The Supreme Court decision addressed federal laws, which appeared to restrict some education-related benefits for illegal immigrants, and state laws, which appeared to authorize such people to receive in-state rates if they qualified. A California state law, which took effect in January 2002, said those ""without lawful immigration status"" -- if they qualify on other grounds -- can get in-state tuition rates if they have ""filed an application to legalize his or her immigration status."" But the plaintiffs in the case pointed to a federal law that stated illegal immigrants cannot qualify ""for any postsecondary education benefit"" (in this case, lower tuition rates) if other U.S. citizens didn't get the same benefit. In its decision, the California Supreme Court found that federal law did not trump state law in this case. U.S. citizens from outside California, it pointed out, could receive in-state tuition as long as they attended high school in California for three or more years and either graduated from a high school or got their GED in California. The court further stated that illegal immigrants should be treated like anyone from outside California, calling it significant that not all illegal immigrants would qualify for in-state tuition rates, just those who met the criteria. ""We conclude the exemption [from paying full, nonresident tuition rates] is not based on residence in California,"" the California Supreme Court decision said. ""Rather, it is based on other criteria."" The decision applies to 112 community colleges, 33 universities and two independent postgraduate schools in California's public postsecondary education system. Christine Helwick, general counsel for the California State University system that represents 23 schools that educate almost 433,000 students statewide, applauded the decision. ""[The ruling] appropriately expands access and educational opportunities to all legitimate California high school graduates,"" Helwick said in a statement. ""[California's public university system] continues to advocate that racially and ethnically inclusive college universities better prepare students for the diverse workplace of the future.""","NEW: California's public universities say decision ""appropriately expands access""

"(CNN) -- Gaze across the luxury stalls at this year's Monaco Yacht Show, and you'd be forgiven for thinking you'd stumbled upon James Bond's secret gadget lab. Personal submarines, jetpacks, even a fantastical ""walking"" boat are all on offer for a new generation of thrill-seeking millionaires. Younger than ever before, today's super rich are no longer content to spend their holidays lounging on sundrenched superyachts. Instead, they're willing to pay millions for high-tech water toys unimaginable when the prestigious boat show first launched 24 years ago. ""Fifteen years ago a person who owned a superyacht was usually 50 years old,"" explained Monaco Yacht Show managing director GaÃ«lle Tallarida, in her lilting French accent. ""Now we're seeing people who are 30 years old owning one."" Hailing from emerging economies such as China and South America, this new generation of wealthy holiday-makers are looking for unique adventures at sea -- from exploring the ocean floor in a submarine, to zooming 10 meters into the air with a jetpack. ""These toys attract them because they have a special way of enjoying yachts, compared to their parents who perhaps had to wait until they were older to buy one,"" said Tallarida. ""They like sports and really enjoy being in the sea -- not just sailing and lying on the sundeck."" Main Sail takes a look at four of the most eye-popping toys on show: . DeepFlight Super Falcon . Price: $1.7 million . Is it a jet? A sports car? What about a submarine? At first glance, the futuristic DeepFlight Super Falcon is hard to pin down. But the unusual two-person electric submersible, which can plunge 393 feet under the sea, appears to be to the taste of millionaire owners Richard Branson, and Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitz. ""Just as private individuals are now able to explore space, we see our submarines as opening up the oceans for private exploration,"" said Karen Hawkes, who founded the DeepFlight company with engineer husband Graham in 1996. ""Except unlike spacecraft, these owners get to the pilot their own vessels."" The Falcon follows an earlier model, the DeepFlight Dragon, valued at $1.5 million. Both are positively buoyant, meaning they always float back up to the surface, rather than sinking. Triton Submarine . Price: $2.35 -- $4.89 million . The giant squid is real. How do we know? The Triton Submarine caught it on camera during an expedition to the bottom of the ocean last year. The brightly-coloured vessel is available in 11 different models, and able to plunge anywhere between 1,000 and 36,000 feet under water. ""It gives clients the opportunity to see a part of our planet that no human has ever visited before,"" said Marc Depp, the company's sales and marketing manager. ""Many of our clients are also concerned about their legacy and the condition of the oceans, and make their submarines available to marine scientists."" The company expects to build between four and six submarines a year. Iguana Yachts . Price: $388,000 -- $518,000 . Part speed boat, part rolling tank, the Iguana Yacht has unsurprisingly elicited some curious looks from passersby as it ""walks"" out of the water. Featuring two hydraulic ""legs,"" the amphibious vessel can travel for around 800 meters on dry land -- though it's not intended for public roads. ""All of our customers bought the yacht because they have a legitimate use for it, such as entering or exiting a waterfront property,"" said the company's sales manager Steve Huppert. ""We haven't had people buying it simply to show off."" Regardless of their intentions, new owners will certainly be part of an elite group -- six of the unusual yachts have so far been sold. Jetlev Flyer . Price: $35,600 -- $129,400 . Bond fans who watched their jetpack-wearing hero blast into the sky in 1965 film ""Thunderball,"" can now relive the scene -- at a price. The Jetlev Flyer is powered by water shooting through a 10 meter hose, and can travel through the air for up to three hours. It is one of dozens of high-end accessories -- including inflatable slides and jet skis -- available through Superyacht Toys & Tenders, who have stall at this year's Monaco Yacht Show. ""Generally people are getting more adventurous with their luxury toys,"" said Josh Richardson, managing director of Superyacht Toys & Tenders, which first launched three years ago. Around 200 of the water-based jetpacks have been sold. Travel: Superyacht expeditions to the ends of the earth . Property: Inside London's $67m superyacht hotel .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secret Service Director Julia Pierson, called to Capitol Hill to explain misbehavior by her agents, insisted the problems were not reflective of the broader culture at her agency. ""These are isolated incidents of misconduct and we're working every day to correct our behavior,"" Pierson told reporters Tuesday after leaving a closed meeting with top senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. But there have been numerous incidents of misconduct in recent years. In the latest, three agents who were part of the President's advance security detail were sent home from the Netherlands after one of them was found passed out in a hotel hallway after a night of drinking. Also, a Secret Service officer in Florida was involved in a traffic accident and alcohol use was suspected. ""We're human and we make mistakes,"" Pierson said when asked why the agency continues to be plagued by such problems. Chairman Tom Carper of Delaware said just a ""handful"" of Secret Service members are ""shaming and smearing"" the agency, which employs thousands of people. He said he discussed with Pierson modifying hiring and firing rules and making other policy changes if they would help her deal with the problem. ""All of us are human, all of us have temptation and some of these jobs, they travel a lot, they're away from home a lot. They have their own foibles,"" Carper said. ""This director is very committed to making sure there's a set of discipline policy standards to follow."" Pierson, a Secret Service veteran, is the first woman to head the agency. She was appointed to the post by President Obama about a year ago in the wake of an incident involving drinking and prostitutes ahead of the President's 2012 visit to Cartagena, Colombia. ""I have made clear to the entire workforce that I will not tolerate unprofessional behavior or misconduct at any level -- both on and off duty,"" Pierson told the senators, according to prepared remarks released by the Secret Service. ""I remain committed to swiftly and vigorously addressing any instances of misconduct that are brought to my attention."" Pierson told the senators she has instituted several changes beyond those including appointing a chief integrity officer, centralizing the discipline process at the agency, and implementing enhanced ethics and integrity training for employees. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, was one of a handful of senators to go to the hour-long meeting, which was also attended by Pierson's boss, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. ""We've got to get to the bottom of this because it's important to our government to have the Secret Service carry itself with the highest of standards that we expect of them, not only to make sure that ... the President of the United States but all of our leaders are protected,"" said Ayotte who likened recent incidents to a ""fraternity party."" Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the committee, told CNN the senators outlined in the meeting suggestions to the agency to deal with problem but he wouldn't say what those suggestions were. He said he has confidence in Pierson to stay on the job and deal with the issues. ""She's obviously embarrassed because it's a reflection on her management but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt right now and see if things don't change,"" Coburn said. 2 Secret Service supervisors under investigation in misconduct probe .

"(CNN) -- The uncle of a Utah motorcyclist pulled from underneath a burning car by a group of bystanders told his nephew's rescuers Tuesday they are ""heroes to our family."" Tyler Riggs spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan one day after a group of construction workers, students and other bystanders turned into a ragtag team of first responders to save the life of 21-year-old Brandon Wright. The accident happened on a street near Utah State University in Logan and was captured on video. ""I thank you on behalf of my family and I know that my nephew Brandon will hope to thank you at some point, too. I know that you might be shy and want to dislodge the title, but you are heroes to our family,"" Riggs said, adding that his nephew is in good spirits. ""He was talking to us earlier and going through physical therapy and felt good after that. Things could have been much worse,"" said Riggs. Sgt. Jason Olsen of the Logan police was the first officer on the scene. He was about to motion to a fellow responding officer to grab a jack when, ""I realized that these citizens had already organized and were just going to manually lift (the car) up."" The crash occurred when a BMW pulled out of a parking lot and in front of the motorcyclist. Jeff Curtis, assistant chief of Logan police, said the motorcyclist tried to avoid the car, which resulted in him laying the motorcycle down. After crashing, gas spilled out of the motorcycle and ignited, engulfing both the motorcycle and the front end of the car in flames, Curtis said. The motorcyclist became lodged underneath the burning vehicle. The video, shot by Chris Garff, shows several startled bystanders looking under the BMW as flames leap into the air. The crowd quickly grows to include a man in a suit, construction workers wearing hard hats, a woman in sandals and a young man carrying a backpack, the video shows. After one person in the group tries to pick up the blazing car, the crowd joins in and lifts the 4,000-pound vehicle. ""I do remember one gentleman saying, 'We need everybody to come and help lift,' and that's when everybody ran over,"" Olsen recalled. One of the bystanders drags the fallen motorcyclist's limp body from under the vehicle, the video shows. Wright was rushed to a hospital and was in stable condition after surgery Monday evening, Curtis said. The driver of the car was not seriously injured. The man Curtis believes to be the driver appears in the video dressed in a dark suit. He stood a little off to the side from the group and did not help lift the car, the video shows. After Wright is pulled from underneath the vehicle, the man in the suit walks over to look at the motorcyclist. ""He was in a shock,"" Curtis said about the driver, adding that any possible charges related to the traffic accident are pending. ""It was frightening,"" said Garff, who shot the scene from the Ninth floor of a nearby building. ""You don't really see something like that and then when you do, it's inspiring. It gives us hope,"" he told HLN's ""Prime News."" Police are looking for the Good Samaritans to recognize them at a city council meeting for their actions. Most have already been identified, Curtis said. It was a ""life-saving move that the Logan Police Department does not want to go unnoticed,"" he said. ""Each of those people put their lives in danger as they do what they can to rescue Brandon,"" Curtis told ""Prime News."" The area where Wright crashed is highly trafficked, Olsen said. ""I think had this accident happened in a suburban area we wouldn't have gotten that kind of response -- we would have never had that kind of manpower,"" he said. Olsen added: ""It speaks volumes to what people will do in a tragic situation to help another person out.""
