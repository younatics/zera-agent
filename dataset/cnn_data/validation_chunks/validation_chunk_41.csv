"A Twitter hashtag set up to help a man with Down's syndrome find work has landed him his first job. Ben Small, 26, was offered a job at the Wilson's Kitchen café in Liverpool after owners Lloyd and Kellie Wilson responded to the appeal - and he started his first shift there yesterday. Upon his arrival, he is said to have asked Mr Wilson three questions - if he could have free toast, whether he would be provided with dinner and when the next staff party will be.

In the kitchen: The aspiring chef has been inundated with job offers after a Twitter appeal by his stepmother . The aspiring chef has been inundated with job offers ever since his stepmother Fiona Hodge appealed for help on Twitter, but has now begun work at Wilson's Kitchen as a Saturday job. Miss Hodge, 46, said: ‘In these early stages it's about him getting used to a greater level of stability and formality in workplace. ‘It's a Saturday job initially, but he's hoping to do up to the 16 hours he's permitted to work eventually. We're going to build up to it. 'We don't want to overwhelm Ben in his first week, but he might eventually want to find more work and be self-sufficient like anyone else.’ Her original appeal has received more than 800 retweets since she posted the message on March 13 - and was even picked up by comedian Jason Manford.

"The Irish tourist who left his brother fighting for life in an alleged one-punch attack has pleaded for a lesser charge in a bid to head home soon with his family. Barry Lyttle, 33, is facing reckless grievous bodily harm charges after he allegedly struck his brother Patrick, 31, during a late-night argument in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner-city on January 3. Patrick was taken to hospital in a critical condition and spent six days in a coma in the intensive care unit at St Vincent's Hospital before being moved to a rehabilitation centre in Ryde. After making a remarkable recovery, Patrick called for the charges laid against his brother to be dropped. Scroll down for video . Barry Lyttle (pictured) hopes to head home soon with his family after negotiating for a lesser charge . Speaking outside the court, Lyttle's lawyer Chris Watson said the family were hoping the Director of Public Prosecutions would agree to a lesser charge, which could be finalised in the local court. 'The best-case scenario is that whatever happens it doesn't impact on the family's ability to go home,' Mr Watson said. Mr Watson said the family were waiting for the prosecution to consider a medical report of Patrick's condition before continuing negotiations. 'We are pressing to bring the matter to a close as quickly as we can,' he said outside of court. 'We're just waiting for the DPP to look at the evidence that shows that Patrick's recovered fully and there's no ongoing problems.'

The family has been in Australia for months, supporting the brothers. Lyttle told reporters he hoped 'it would come to a close very soon'. Patrick said he had recovered well and didn't need ongoing treatment 'I'm just delighted with all the treatment that I've received,' he said. He and his brother are supporting each other 'the whole way through', he added. The brothers' father, Oliver, has been a constant presence besides his son at court from the beginning . Patrick was treated by paramedics at the scene where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit on January 3 . Barry appeared in the Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday and successfully applied to have his bail reporting reduced. He will now only have to report to Blacktown police station on Fridays, instead of three times each week as initially ordered. Magistrate Christopher O'Brien told the court he had no doubt Lyttle would attend court. 'The defendant has appeared on each occasion ... even in circumstances where his attendance has been excused,' he said. Lyttle is next due in court on April 9.

"The New York Police Department is expanding a gunfire-detection system that notifies officers in real time when and where shots are fired, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced. De Blasio said the NYPD will deploy the system, known as ShotSpotter, throughout precincts in Brooklyn and the Bronx. ShotSpotter utilizes antennas and acoustic detectors to pinpoint shooting locations. The crime center of a police headquarters immediately receives the information, which they can then send out to officers already near the area. On Monday Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the New York Police Department is expanding a gunfire-detection system that notifies officers in real time when and where shots are fired . ShotSpotter's data can also detail for police how many shooters were present and how many shots were fired at the location. Seven units will be deployed in Brooklyn and 10 in the Bronx. The NYPD plans to eventually incorporate ShotSpotter's alerts into mobile devices, which will allow information to be sent directly to officers' phones and tablets. The system has been tested by the NYPD since 2011. In December it registered the shots that killed police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in Brooklyn, according to ABC 7. On Monday shots were picked up within an hour of the the system's activation in the Bronx, according to NYPD deputy commissioner Jesse Tisch. Three shots were fired and they were not called in to 911, CBS New York reported. According to ShotSpotter's website, less than one in five shooting incidents are reported to 911. ShotSpotter utilizes antennas and acoustic detectors to pinpoint shooting locations. The crime center of a police headquarters immediately receives the information, which they then send out to officers in the area . When shootings are called in, the information given is often inaccurate, wasting valuable time and putting the safety of officers and the public at risk, the site said. During a press conference on Monday, de Blasio said ShotSpotter will 'transform the way the NYPD responds to gunshot activity in our neighborhoods.' 'ShotSpotter will help protect our residents, our communities and our police officers,' he said. Systems similar to ShotSpotter have already been employed in Newark, New Jersey, Atlantic City and Washington, according to Bloomberg News. ShotSpotter will be activated in Brooklyn next week.","NYPD will deploy the ShotSpotter system throughout Bronx and Brooklyn .

"A Chinese policeman and father-to-be has been killed by a driver who sped off claiming he was being picked on. Video footage shows traffic officer Mao Shenquan, 32, being dragged along the road by the red BMW after he stopped the driver for trying to turn left in the wrong lane. The SUV had illegally driven onto a zebra crossing and was told to reverse backwards by the police officer who was on duty in the Minhang District of Shanghai. Trapped: The police officer is trapped and dragged along at speed by the red BMW, suffering fatal injuries . Driver Sun Haojie, also 32, ignored the officer and started performing the illegal manoeuvre when Mao made a grab for him, the People's Daily Online reports. The car drove away, pulling the officer at speed for 10 metres until he fell and hit the ground. Witness Liu Zhengjin, who was in another car when the incident happened, said Sun did not stop. 'In that moment I saw the car make a sudden left turn and the police officer reached out to grab the door but the speed of the car was very scary and did not stop,' she said. Shanghai police spokesman Liang Pai said the young officer suffered massive head injuries after either striking his head on the ground or getting hit by the wheels of the car. Doing his job: The young officer is pictured from the car's dashcam moments before he is dragged along by the driver and fatally injured . He said: 'The CCTV cameras as well as Mr Sun's own dashboard camera revealed that he was twice told not to turn left at different points on the road, and at the second point he ignores the advice causing the accident.' Driver Sun told officers he had always made the illegal turn on the road without incident so he felt that he was being targeted by police when he was stopped and stepped on the accelerator. He said it was only after he sped off, that he saw lots of people behind him and realised that it was serious. On camera: CCTV captures the traffic officer  talking to the driver about an illegal manoeuvre seconds before he drives off, fatally injuring Mao Shenquan . Stop: Suspecting the driver is about to do the illegal turn anyway, Mao goes back to chat to the driver . Dragged: Officer Mao gets caught and can be seen trying to keep up with the car as it drives away . Left for dead: The driver continues, dragging the officer for 10 metres before he falls off and suffers fatal injuries . Tragic: The officer lies dying in the street as the red BMW is driven off. Mao Shenquan could not be saved and the driver was later arrested . 'At that moment my mind went blank,' he said. Sun drove off leaving the officer lying motionless on the ground but later returned to the scene and handed himself in to officers. The level-three superintendent was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. His heavily-pregnant wife had to be hospitalised with shock. Colleagues paid tribute to Mao who had told them that being a police officer was 'a great honour'. But they noted concerns that this tragedy was not the first incident of its kind. 'Another colleague sustained head injuries in a car accident in front of me and I took him to Changning District Central Hospital and he was fortunate enough to survive. 'Today I was hoping for the same good luck but he wasn't saved.' China's public security authorities have vowed to crack down on lawless drivers following the fatality.","Traffic cop had stopped driver who was making illegal turn .

"Anyone who enjoys reading over someone’s shoulder while on public transport, or indeed looking at their laptop screen, should be aware. For a man on a recent flight found the perfect way to prevent a nosey fellow passenger – by filming him from his laptop camera. Videoed sitting next to each other on an aeroplane, the filmmaker can be seen talking to his friends on the internet via Facebook. The video maker recorded the man via Photobooth on his laptop, which he opened and left hidden in the background of his screen . The man sitting next to him sits with his arms crossed and with his eyes on the screen. But as the video maker motions to look in his direction the man quickly turns his head and stares blankly out of the window. Returning to his laptop, the video maker keeps an eye on the man who straightens himself back up and scratches his head, as if wondering whether he had been spotted. As the passenger goes in for a second look the process is repeated as the film maker turns towards him and he recoils once more. The man puts on a pair of glasses so as to get a better look at the screen, much to the amusement of the filmmaker . Caught in the act! The passenger quickly turns away as the man looks around to confront him . Smiling as he catches him out a further three times, the video maker notes with a caption that the man is pretending to look out of the window even though it is pitch black outside. The video concludes with the man putting on a pair of glasses so as to get a better look at the screen, much to the amusement of the filmmaker. Explaining how he came about filming the man, the video maker wrote on his original upload of the video that he opened up Photobooth – An Apple Mac application that allows you to take pictures and videos – and left it on hidden in the background.

"A direct telephone line between Cuba and the United States has been re-established for the first time in 15 years. U.S. calls to Cuba have typically been put through by companies in other countries like Italy and Spain. But now an agreement has been signed  that allows Americans and Cubans to make direct phone calls. Etecsa, Cuban's state telecommunications company, said the change would make calls easier and more affordable. President Barack Obama, pictured at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba. A direct telephone line between the two countries has been re-established for the first time in 15 years . 'It contributes to providing better infrastructure and better communications quality between the people and our two countries,' it said. The move marks a historic shift in U.S policy, which aims to bring an end to half a century of Cold War tensions. The lines were originally cut after American phone companies refused to pay a 10 per cent tax on calls between the two countries. But President Barack Obama declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba in December, announcing the re-establishment of diplomatic relations as well as economic and travel ties with the communist island. At the time he said: 'Isolation has not worked. It's time for a new approach. 'We will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests.' Around two million Cuban-Americans are thought to live in the U.S. and many families rely on phone calls to stay in touch. Bill Pereira, CEO of Etecsa, said: 'We hope that this is the beginning of something, of a relationship that will allow us to build and grow and facilitate and ease communication between family members and loved ones.' Havana residents use public phones to make calls in December 2000. The Cuban government cut off direct telephone service from the United States to Cuba, although Cubans could still call the U.S. Residents are hoping that the step forward will lead to other services becoming available. Less than a quarter of Cubans, whose average wage is $20 per month, currently have any type of internet service. Virtually all home connections remain illegal and getting online at government centres is very expensive, as they charge between $2.50 and $4.50 an hour. Obama set connectivity as a priority in the United States' new relationship with Cuba, making telecommunications equipment, technology and services among its first priorities.","Calls previously had to be put through by companies in other countries .

"Scientists say they have found a new dinosaur species which could have grown to 65ft tall – three times the height of a T-Rex. Nicknamed the Sibirosaurus, the creature would have been among the largest to roam the Earth 100 million years ago. It is thought to be related to the Titanosaurus which grew to 131ft long and weighed 90 tons - the equivalent of nine African elephants. Scientists say they have found a new dinosaur species, nicknamed the Sibirosaurus, which could have grown to 65ft tall. Pictured: a Brachiosaurus . The news comes after experts in Russia discovered fossils in rocks on the banks of the Kiya River in Western Siberia in 2008. Pictured: fragments taken for examination . The news comes after experts in Russia discovered fossils in rocks on the banks of the Kiya River in Western Siberia in 2008. The rocks could not be removed so scientists from Tomsk State University extracted fragments from the sandstone for examination, The Siberian Times reported. Dr Stepan Ivantsov, a scientific researcher in the Laboratory of Mesozoic and Cenozoic Continental Ecosystems, said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore. It took many years of research to discover it was an entirely new dinosaur. It is thought a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly identified species. He told the newspaper: 'When we discovered this finding, it was only clear that the remains belonged to a very large herbivorous dinosaur from the sauropods group. It was the first scientifically described dinosaur from this group in Russia. 'Now after work on the extraction of all the remnants and the restoration (of the bones) are almost completed, we can confidently say that we have found a new species, and maybe even genus. Dr Stepan Ivantsov (pictured left) said they originally believed the remains were of a very large herbivore . The rocks could not be removed so scientists from Tomsk State University extracted fragments from the sandstone for examination . 'If we talk about our discovery, this dinosaur lived in the Late Cretaceous period, that is about 100 million years ago.' Experts believe a dinosaur foot found at the same location in 1995 may also belong to the newly discovered species. Dr Ivantsov said: 'We constantly find the remains of dinosaurs on this site, near Shestakovo village. They fall down from the steep river bank regularly and we collect them.' Bones including part of a shoulder blade will be exhibited permanently in Paleontological Museum of Tomsk State University. They were named after the mythical Titans of Ancient Greece - giant deities of incredible strength. Titanosaurs have very long necks and whip-like tails, tiny heads and thick stumpy legs. They ate plants and were armoured with small bony plates along its back which helped protect them from predators. Titanosaurs were some of the biggest dinosaurs to ever walk the earth and weighed up to 90 tons. Pictured: fossil fragments . David Norman, director of studies in Earth Sciences at Cambridge University, said it is not rare to find dinosaur remains, but the discovery is notable because it suggests the large herbivores lived in areas they have not been found in before. He said: 'It is a case of look and usually you will find. Although, they are animals that lived on land and because of that the chances of them being preserved is less than if they were creatures in the seas or rivers, so they are certainly rarer. 'On that basis the discovery that has been made is interesting because it is from a part of the world that hasn't yielded these particular sorts of dinosaurs. 'It therefore increases the geographic range - they have been found in Africa, Europe and China before. It is interesting.' Dr Norman said Titanosaurs are large ling-necked dinosaurs which travelled in herds. He said: 'It is an animal a bit like Dippy, the dinosaur in the hall of the Natural History Museum - it is that sort of shape. It is long-necked and has a long tail with an elephant sized body.' He said dinosaur footprints suggest they travelled in herds with the largest members on the outside creating a kind of ring of steel which protected the women and children in the centre.","Dinosaur thought to be related to Titanosaurus which grew to 131ft long .

"Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett has credited CEO Roger Ailes with saving his life as he struggled with alcoholism last year. Jarrett first revealed his addiction after slurring during a broadcast in April 2014 and a few weeks later, just hours after leaving rehab, he was arrested for drunkenly swearing at an airport police officer in Minnesota - in an embarrassing debacle caught on camera. But in an astonishing turnaround, the 59-year-old is now back in the Fox News anchor seat and healthier than ever - and he believes he has his boss to thank. 'Roger Ailes was the first person to step in and come to my rescue,' he told TV Newser. 'I don't want to sound overly dramatic, but I don't think I'd be here today if not for Roger.' Back at work: Gregg Jarrett is pictured back on air earlier this year following his public struggle with alcohol last year, which included his arrest in a Minnesota airport just hours after he left rehab . In the interview, Jarrett said Ailes, the chairman and CEO of Fox News, was the first person he admitted his addiction to following his meltdown on television last year. Fox News later announced that Jarrett had stepped down from his role as anchor for 'personal reasons' and he went to a rehab facility in Minnesota. But after checking out, he had an 'immediate relapse' and a bar employee at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport called police after he became unruly and started bothering another customer. Footage of the arrest, which was released, shows him calling an officer a 'f***ing stupid ass' before the officer grabs his arm and forces his face against a wall, then slams him into the cell's bench. After the altercation, he was taken to the Hennepin County Adult Detention Center in Minneapolis but was released after posting $300 bond the following day. Thankful: Jarrett, pictured in his mug shot after his arrest last year, said Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, pictured left, helped him fight through his addiction and told him he would have a job to come back to . His mug shot and security footage showing the arrest were soon posted across the internet. 'When I saw the videotape, I was heartbroken,' Jarrett recalled. 'Because that's not me, that's not who I am. And yet, through alcoholism that's what I've become.' But Ailes still refused to give up on Jarrett, telling him: 'We can beat this.' The CEO assured the anchor that his job was safe and that he would continue to get paid, while also regularly checking in on his wife and their two daughters, Grace, 18, and Olivia, 16. Thinking of what he put his daughters through, Jarrett told TV Newser: 'It breaks my heart.' He also hired lawyers to handle Jarrett's case in Minnesota and got him admitted to the Betty Ford Center, while dispatching a Fox News producer to travel with him. Arrest: A video showing Jarrett's arrest by airport police reveals him swearing at a police officer . They forced him down and cuffed him following reports from airport bar staff that he was drunk . He left the clinic last August and started writing columns for FoxNews.com before reporting and eventually anchoring. Again, Ailes was there for him. 'He was the first to congratulate me when I came back on air, first as a reporter,' Jarrett said. 'He picked up the phone and said ""you look great! You were fantastic! Good story. How do you feel?""' Jarrett is now in a post-treatment program, which includes AA meetings, therapy and random alcohol testing, and continues to meet regularly with Ailes - and he's staying sober for him. When he asked Ailes why he took so much care towards him, the CEO responded: 'Not only is it the Christian thing to do, but more importantly, it's the right thing to do,' Jarrett said.","Jarrett's addiction emerged last year after he slurred during a live broadcast in April then took time off 'for personal reasons'

"A Florida daycare teacher was arrested Thursday and charged with neglect for allegedly allowing a one-year-old child to play outside with any shoes or socks on, causing second-degree burns. The alleged incident occurred on a 93-degree day in late June 2014. Police say they reviewed footage from the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch after the little boy's mother complained he came home with blisters on the bottom of his feet. Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, a teacher at the center, claimed the infant didn't participate in outside activities at the school's 'waterpark' - a cemented area where sprinklers run -  because he was not wearing the proper shoes. However the cameras showed otherwise, according to The Herald-Tribune. Charged: Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, has been accused of neglect for letting a one-year-old boy in her care play outside on a hot summer day without shoes or socks on, causing second-degree burns to his feet . The boy can reportedly be seen leaving the classroom without shoes on. While he doesn't appear to have entered the waterpark area, he was playing on a paved walking that lead to the area. The footage then shows him returning to the classroom 30 minutes in Gomez-Garrido's arms crying, kicking and grabbing his feet. Gomez-Garrido can be seen attending to the child, looking at his feet at least twice, before putting shoes and socks on him. She can then be seen placing him on a seat, where he remained for the rest of the afternoon. Police say the boy ran from the classroom at 1.42pm and was picked up by his mother at about 4pm. Gomez-Garrido told detectives a few days later she did not let him play outside. However she  later admitted that she was unable to tend to the infant because she was supervising other children in the waterpark and was the only teacher assigned to the area that day, according to WTSP. Scene: The alleged neglect occurred at the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch in late June 2014 . An investigation however determined that Gomez-Garrido knew the toddler was playing on the hot surfaces outside and did nothing about it. Police say the child needed medical attention, with his burns determined to be second-degree, and that she failed to noitify his mother. Gomez-Garrido is charged with neglect of a child without great bodily harm. She is being held without bond at the Sarasota County Jail.","Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, charged with neglect of a child without great bodily harm in Sarasota, Florida .

"Scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble-like simulations of Earth's interior. By recording seismic tremors, researchers are able to build a 3D picture of Earth's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core. They do this by analysing the speed of the tremors, which travel rapidly through solid rock and slowly through molten magma. Computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures. In this view of the mantle below the Pacific Ocean, slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue . The Princeton team fed data from seismograms into a computer model, which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter. The resulting ""synthetic seismograms"" were compared to real seismograms, and the differences fed back into the model to improve it. The researchers do this repeatedly, comparing data with simulations and extracting differences. With each pass, they improve their model. In these images, slower waves are in red and orange, while faster vibrations are in green and blue. The 3D models were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km) - by the end of the year. His team have been using the number-crunching capabilities of the Titan computer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, which can handle 20 quadrillion calculations per second. Professor Tromp has so far looked at seismic waves from 3,000 quakes of magnitude 5.5 and greater, which were recorded at thousands of seismographic stations worldwide. These stations make recordings, or seismograms, that detail the movement produced by seismic waves, which typically travel at speeds of several miles per second and last several minutes. 'We are specifically interested in the structure of mantle upwellings and plumes,' said Professor Tromp, 'but much of it will be investigating the images for unusual features.' The resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates, which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other. The images were created by Princeton University's Professor Jeroen Tromp who is aiming to create a 3D map of the entire mantle, down to a depth of 1,865 miles (3,000km), by the end of the year . A three-dimensional image showing contours of locations where seismic wave speeds are faster than average . The maps could also reveal the locations of magma that, if it comes to the surface, causes volcanic activity, the researchers said. Previous research on this has only used three types of seismic waves: primary or compressional waves, secondary or shear waves, and surface waves. Professor Tromp technique uses both waves that travel from the quake epicentre to the detector as well as those that travel from the detector to the quake – described as adjoint waves. The Titan computer simulates each wave as it propagates from the epicenter, and the resulting data is compared to real seismograms. The differences are then used by Titan to improve its model. Professor Tromp said: 'You don't know what it is you are looking for…that is the wonderful part of this project - waiting to see what we will discover.' This map shows relative variations in seismic shear wave speed at a depth of 241 miles (389 km). Blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds, and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds . The two panels on the right show a 746 miles (1,200 km) deep slice of the Earth taken from points B to b in Europe as shown in the left panel. A computer program designed by Tromp and his team compares real earthquake data to a computer-generated model, then uses any discrepancies to improve the model .","Scientists are mapping Earth's mantle between crust and outer core .

Plea: Nowsch, who was arrested and charged last month, entered a not guilty plea at the Thursday hearing . 'Scared': Andrews was described as a 'scared' and 'nervous' man after his first appearance . According to KLAS-TV, Andrews asked to speak but the judge denied his request. 'I need to protect your rights. It's best that you don't say anything without an attorney present,' District Court Judge Michael Villani said. After the proceedings Andrews was assigned to Marty Hart, who told the station: 'Right now, he's a scared young man. He's nervous, he's worried about his family and he wants them to know that he loves them.' He confirmed Andrews will plead not guilty. Nowsch, who is accused of firing the fatal bullets from the car allegedly driven by Andrews, entered a not guilty plea. The teenager will find out on April 1 whether he faces the death penalty.

Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers was shot during what police thought was a road-rage incident on February 12 . Prosecutors allege Nowsch fired the shots from a vehicle while Andrews was at the wheel. Andrews' arrest came about an hour after he was named with Nowsch in an indictment. The trial is scheduled for May 26 and the defendants could get the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. District Attorney Steve Wolfson said: 'If you're a getaway driver, aiding and abetting another to commit a crime, you're equally guilty,' Nowsch pleaded not guilty on March 12 to the murder, attempted murder and weapon charges during an appearance at Clark County District Court. He is expected to plead not guilty to the conspiracy charge. The conspiracy charge stems from allegations that Andrews and Nowsch tried to erase their cellphone records to prevent police from linking them to the shooting. The 44-year-old (left) was hit in the head by a bullet and she died at a hospital two days later on Valentine's Day . Andrews is accused of positioning his car so Nowsch could unload what Prosecutor David Stanton said police now believe to have been 24 shots at Meyers and her son Brandon. One bullet struck  Meyers in the head and she died at a hospital two days later on Valentine's Day. Stanton characterized Nowsch as a neighborhood marijuana and anxiety medication dealer who hung out at a park where he encountered schoolchildren and sometimes Meyers. Las Vegas defense lawyer Martin Hart said he had spoken with Andrews in recent days but hadn't been hired to defend him. Hart said he might be appointed to the case when Andrews and Nowsch appear for arraignment next Thursday. He declined to comment on the case or the indictment. Nowsch's attorney, Augustus Claus, declined to comment about the indictment or the arrest of Andrews. Prosecutors allege Nowsch fired 24 shots from a vehicle at Meyers and her son while Andrews was at the wheel . Police initially suspected Meyers was shot in a road rage incident. But days later, investigators revealed she had enlisted her adult son and his gun for a late-night prowl to confront a driver who threatened her on the way home from a mother-daughter driving lesson in a school parking lot. In obtaining a no-bail warrant for Andrews' arrest, Stanton told Clark County District Court Judge Linda Marie Bell that Andrews responded in his silver Audi to a phone call from Nowsch. Nowsch feared that a green Buick Park Avenue sedan with tinted windows driving slowly back and forth in a nearby school parking lot was following him, Stanton said. The prosecutor said: 'He believed the people in the car meant to do him harm.' He said it was a coincidence that Meyers' 15-year-old daughter Kristal was practicing driving in the lot. February 13 - Las Vegas police reveal a mother-of-four is shot during an alleged road rage incident. She was later identified as Tammy Meyers. She was teaching her 15-year-old daughter Kristal to drive at the time. February 15 - Her devastated husband, Robert Meyers, vows to find whoever did this to his wife. He turned off her life support after she failed to recover from her injuries sustained in the incident on Valentine's Day. February 16 -  CCTV of the incident is released by police as they hunt for the alleged killer and his accomplice. Police also disclose a sketch of the suspect and say he is 6ft, mid 20s and 180lbs. February 18 - Questions are raised over whether Nowsch acted in self-defense amid claims Mrs Meyers drove back to her home, dropped her daughter off, grabbed her son Brandon and hunted down the car in question. In response, Mr Meyers insists his son is a hero and not a vigilante. February 19 - Following a tense stand-off with police Eric Nowsch is arrested. Mr Meyers claims he knew the suspect and said he knew the kid was bad. After the incident he claimed he wasn't aware who shot his wife. Added that his wife consoled the youngsters for hours and tried to teach him how to be a man. February 23 - Nowsch is arraigned on murder charges in Las Vegas. March 12 - Nowsch pleads not guilty to murder, attempted murder and weapon charges during an appearance at Clark County District Court. March 20 - Prosecutors unveil an indictment which names Derrick Andrews and Nowsch. It charges them both with murder, attempted murder, firing a weapon from a vehicle and conspiracy. Andrews is arrested an hour later. The prosecutor has characterized Nowsch as a neighborhood marijuana and anxiety medication dealer . The coincidences mounted when the mother and daughter were driving home and encountered an angry driver in a silver vehicle who blocked their path, got out of his vehicle, and, according to Kristal, threatened them. Frightened, Meyers dropped Kristal off at home and instructed her 22-year-old son to come with her to find that driver, Stanton said. The prosecutor said the mother and son encountered Nowsch and Andrews in Andrews' silver sedan. Stanton said the cars Meyers encountered that night were similar in color and design but 'from the evidence presented, Mrs. Meyers was mistaken'","Derrick Andrews arrested last week in connection with February shooting .

"A new study has revealed the best places in the world to live, with Paraguay residents saying they are the happiest. For the first time, the entire top ten of Gallup's Positive Experience Index is from Latin America. The two countries with the worst happiness ratings were both in Africa, with Sudan scoring right below Tunisia, the site of a terrorist attack earlier this week. The United States tied for 15th with a index score of 79, eight higher than the global mean of 71. Scroll down for video . Latin American countries dominated the upper echelons of Gallup's Positive Experience Index. Above, Colombian girls smile outside their home in Buenaventura, despite widespread violence in the city . The United Kingdom tied for 43rd with six other counties, receiving a score of 75. The Gallup study polled adults in 143 countries and asked them a series of questions about the previous day including: Did you feel well-rested? Did you feel respected all day? Did you smile or laugh a lot? Did you learn something or do something interesting? and Did you feel enjoyment? More than 70% of people throughout the world said they experienced  enjoyment, respect, rest, and smiles the day before. Respondents were also asked about their experience of positive and negative emotions. Paraguay also claimed the top spot last year, though its score has moved up from 87 to 89. Colombia, whose contestant also won Miss Universe 2014 earlier this year, was ranked second. None of the Latin American countries that rank the happiest have Gross Domestic Products in the top 25, according to the World Bank. The United States (pictured) was the happiest country with a top 10 Gross Domestic Product, tying for 15th with ten other countries. Above, teenagers in Binghampton, New York .

Top 10 economies ranged in rank from 15th, the US, to 85th, Russia. Researchers say the results stem from the continent's culture, which tends to focus on the positive. Little has changed at the top of the chart, with only Denmark falling out of the 10 happiest countries. Countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe see generally lower scores. Nations formed after the fall of the Soviet Union generally show less positive as well as less negative emotions. Gallup did not include data for Syria and several Gulf Cooperation Council countries such as the United Arab Emirates, which was ranked 15th last year with a score of 79. Syria tallied the lowest-ever positive emotion score last year with 36. The worldwide positive experience indicator has remained relatively constant, hovering around 70.

"The former owner of a Bayswater hotel has been hit with London’s biggest ever fine for an individual for violating fire safety rules. London Fire Brigade said guests’ lives were put in jeopardy due to the shoddy conditions which were discovered inside The Radnor Hotel during an inspection in 2011. It brought charges against then-owner Salim Patel, who was fined £200,000 this week after a successful prosecution. London Fire Brigade said fire doors were missing (right) or tied open with electrical cords or string (left) In addition to the six-figure fine, Mr Patel was ordered to pay nearly £30,000 in court costs after pleading guilty to seven offences under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. He was also handed a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, the London Fire Brigade said. Fire safety officers were stunned when they toured the six-floor, 18-room hotel, on Inverness Terrace, to carry out a routine inspection. They discovered numerous fire safety breaches, including inadequate fire detection systems, blocked emergency exits and inadequate emergency lighting. Fire doors were missing or tied open with extension cords or string, there was evidence the basement store room was used for sleeping, and the owner had not conducted a fire risk assessment. A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said  the hotel, on Inverness Terrace, is under new ownership . Mr Patel was given an enforcement notice, which required him to address the safety concerns to make the hotel safer for guests, but follow-up visits found that no action had been taken, the London Fire Brigade said. The hotel continued to operate without a working fire detection system, so court proceedings were launched against the hotelier. When Mr Patel was sentenced Judge Kennedy said the public expected ‘absolute attention’ to fire safety when occupying sleeping accommodation. The judge told court that Mr Patel did not provide that protection and, as a business owner, he was where the ‘buck stopped’, the London Fire Brigade said in a statement. Hotel owner Salim Patel received a record £200,000 fine this week after a successful prosecution . Neil Orbell, head of fire safety regulation, said he hopes the penalty serves as a deterrent for other hoteliers. He said: ‘Our fire safety officers carry out around 16,000 inspections every year to help ensure the capital's buildings are safe from fire. ‘This is the biggest fine we have ever secured against an individual for breaking fire safety laws and it should send a message to all business owners that if they are shirking their fire safety responsibilities and putting the public at risk we won’t hesitate to prosecute. ‘The size of the fine should also serve as a stark reminder that the court’s take fire safety just as seriously as we do.’ A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said Mr Patel no longer runs the hotel and it is under new ownership. Guests complained about the conditions in a series of scathing reviews on TripAdvisor, where The Radnor Hotel had a rating of two stars before it closed. Of 92 reviews, 59 were filed under ‘terrible’. Helen, from Australia, wrote in August 2012: ‘We were a little alarmed at the fire emergency plan which was printed straight off the internet and put up without being filled in. We drew comfort from the fact the place has not burned down yet.’","Salim Patel received a fine this week after a successful prosecution .

"Scotland's long-term plan to abolish the airport passenger duty (APD) tax completely could significantly harm England's already suffering smaller airports, revealed a report from MPs. A report from the House of Commons Transport Committee said the success of the UK's smaller airports are being held back by the existence of the APD, one of the world's heftiest departure taxes. The MPs said that Northern Ireland was suffering in terms of jobs, growth and connectivity as aviation taxes were higher than in the Republic of Ireland. And when APD is charged at both ends of a trip the tax 'incentivises airlines and passengers to fly from airports located in other EU member states', said the MP's report. The Scottish Government's plans to abolish the airport passenger duty could harm England's airports . The Scottish Government wants to reduce APD by 50 per cent in the next term of the Scottish Parliament and eventually get rid of it altogether in a bid to win the country's airports a 'competitive advantage'. However, there is no such commitment to axing APD in the rest of the UK, despite a decision by the Chancellor to abolish APD payments on children's tickets back in December. A spokesman for the campaign A Fair Tax on Flying, Stephen D'Alfonso, welcomed the report and called on the rest of the UK to follow Scotland's lead. 'We welcome the Transport Committee's report highlighting the detrimental effect that APD has on smaller airports, and the Committee's recognition that a lower level of APD in Scotland will have a negative effect on the rest of the UK,' Mr D'Alfonso said. 'With UK passengers currently paying one of the highest rates of tax on flying anywhere in the world, it is not surprising that the Scottish Government is committed to cutting this damaging tax. However, a cut in APD in Scotland needs to be matched by a cut in APD across the rest of the UK, so that no part of the country is disadvantaged in any way.' A report from the House of Commons Transport Committee said the success of the UK's smaller airports are being held back by the departure tax, which is one of the largest in the world . The report warned that if APD is scrapped in Scotland - the wheels are already in motion with the tax being devolved to Holyrood - 'airports in England would be subject to a similar competitive disadvantage to that currently experienced in Northern Ireland'. £26 per ticket to Europe . £69 per ticket to US, Canada, North and West Africa . £97 per ticket to Australia, Singapore and Indonesia . The abolition of the tax at Holyrood would bring £1billion into the economy by 2020 along with almost 4,000 jobs, according to a report commissioned by Edinburgh Airport. Plans to exempt children from APD, announced in the autumn statement of 2014, was 'a marginal change which did nothing for business travellers and little for smaller airports', the report added. The committee said: 'We found that APD is the principal threat to the smaller airports sector. 'APD cannot be amended to support people, businesses and regional economies because of the operation of European competition law, while proposals to devolve it to the regions would serve only to spread a patchwork of market distortions across the UK.' The report covered around 40 smaller airports ranging in size from Newcastle, which handled 4.4 million passengers in 2013, to Lydd in Kent which handled 1,000 . Launching the report today the committee's chairwoman Louise Ellman said: 'Smaller airports drive economic growth. But the smaller airports sector - which is vital to people and businesses in the regions - is limited by APD. Transport ministers must stand up for smaller airports and make the case to the Treasury that APD squeezes jobs, growth and connectivity.' She added: 'The whole country should share the economic benefits of expanded airport capacity. But that will only happen if new capacity includes new domestic flights to airports outside London. 'The Department for Transport needs to take a proactive approach and ensure that the regions are connected.' Scotland's Transport Minister Derek Mackay told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme found validation in the report and said they would do what was best for their airports. 'It does somewhat validate what we've been saying - that reducing air passenger duty would create economic growth in terms of more routes and sustain the lines that we have at the moment,' he said. 'That's why airports and the airlines have called within Scotland for the power to be transferred to us so that we can be more adept. Scotland's Transport Minister Derek Mackay said didn't mind that 'other parts of the UK may well be nervous but if we have the power then we'll use it to put Scotland at a competitive advantage' 'Some other parts of the UK may well be nervous but if we have the power then we'll use it to put Scotland at a competitive advantage.' The report covered around 40 smaller airports ranging in size from Newcastle, which handled 4.4 million passengers in 2013, to Lydd in Kent which handled 1,000. Airport Operators Association chief executive Darren Caplan said: 'The past few years have been tough for many of our smaller members. 'Reducing APD is the single biggest thing that could enable airports to attract new routes and increase their passenger numbers. APD is the highest aviation tax in the world and is increasingly putting the UK at a disadvantage.' A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'Regional airports make a vital contribution to the UK economy by boosting local jobs and providing important domestic and international connectivity. We want to help these airports thrive as part of our long- term economic plan, which is why we launched the Regional Air Connectivity Fund to support more new air routes. 'We are now assessing bids from airports and airlines for this funding and will soon announce a short list of routes, with a final announcement over the summer. 'We welcome the publication of the committee's report on smaller airports and we will study their conclusions carefully before responding in due course.'","Airport Passenger Duty departure tax is one of the world's biggest .

"Families reacted with fury yesterday at learning that Tony Blair will attend a service honouring soldiers killed in Afghanistan. They say the former prime minister has blood on his hands after sending their sons to war and should be facing an inquiry instead. Mr Blair and his successor Gordon Brown will be among the 2,000-strong congregation at a commemoration service at St Paul’s Cathedral in London. Meet the troops: Tony Blair poses with British forces in 2003 after he took the country to war in Iraq . Politicians, royalty, military chiefs and serving soldiers are on the guest list. But fewer than half of the 2,000 places have been given to the families of the 453 war dead – who are limited to two seats each. Relatives said it was ‘horrific’ that Mr Blair and Mr Brown should have a place, while many family members of those who died did not. Bob Wright, 68, whose son Corporal Mark Wright was killed in an unmarked minefield in September 2006, said: ‘He (Tony Blair) is the last person I would want to see. He would have some cheek going. He took the country to war, and cost all of those lives and he’s got blood on his hands.’ Grandmother Joan Humphreys, 70, said it was ‘horrific’ Mr Blair had been invited but she had not. Explosion: Private Kevin Elliott was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2009 at the age of 24 . The pensioner, whose 24-year-old grandson Kevin Elliott was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2009, added: ‘Kevin was my grandson, we were very close and I haven’t been invited but Tony Blair has. ‘I know mothers who haven’t been invited and he just simply shouldn’t have a place.’ Another guest, Ian Sadler, said Gordon Brown should not have been invited either. Mr Sadler said his 21-year-old son Jack was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007, while Mr Brown was PM. He said: ‘I’m hoping Gordon Brown doesn’t stand up and say anything because he has lots of questions to answer.’ Roadside bomb: Jack Sadler was in a vehicle that had inadequate armour when he was killed by a roadside bomb in 2007 . Mr Blair sent troops to Afghanistan to oust the Taliban and kill Osama Bin Laden following the September 11 attacks in 2001. But the decision sparked widespread condemnation after the war dragged on for 13 years and led to hundreds of British deaths. There was outrage when he sent UK troops to Iraq in 2003. Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in 2007, with the last of Britain’s troops withdrawing from Iraq in 2011 and Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Around 90 per cent of those attending next Friday’s service to mark the end of the Afghan campaign are either current serving personnel, veterans or family members of those who have died. Afghan hero: Corporal Mark Wright was killed in an unmarked minefield in September 2006. His father Bob Wright, 68, said: 'He (Tony Blair) is the last person I would want to see' The Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will also attend, along with defence and foreign secretaries from 2001 to 2014, Nato allies and charities. Mr Blair and Mr Brown were invited by the Ministry of Defence. A spokesman for the Stop the War campaign said: ‘It is obscene that Tony Blair is taking the place of what could be a family member of someone who died in Afghanistan.’ In October 2009 Mr Blair was accused of having ‘blood on his hands’ as he attended a commemoration service marking the end of the Iraq campaign. Peter Brierley, whose son Shaun was killed in Iraq in 2003, refused to shake the former PM’s outstretched hand.","Mr Blair and successor Gordon Brown will be among 2,000-strong crowd .

"Tim Cook has revealed that Steve Jobs once phoned his mother because he was concerned about how hard he was working. In a new book about the Apple co-founder, Cook also reveals the moment Jobs asked him to take over as CEO - just weeks before his death. The book, Becoming Steve Jobs, a new biography by technology reporter Brent Schlender and Fast Company executive editor Rick Tetzeli, was given . Scroll down for video . Apple CEO Tim Cook (left) tried to offer his liver to his ailing mentor and predecessor Steve Jobs (right), a new book claims. Here they are pictured together during a product question and answer session. In a recent interview Cook revealed his average working day - which still leaves little time for socialising. He gets up at 3:45am every morning and begins to check his email, goes to the gym at 5am and to work at 6:30am, already fully briefed and with the day ahead planned out. He goes to bed early: by 9:30pm or sometimes 10pm. 'The Steve I knew was the guy pestering me to have a social life, not because he was being a pest, but because he knew how important family was in his life, and he wanted it for me, too,' said Cook in the book, an extract of which was published by FastCompany.. 'One day he calls my mom—he doesn't even know my mom, she lives in Alabama. 'He said he was looking for me, but he knows how to find me! 'He talked to her about me. There are lots of these things where you saw the very soft or caring or feeling or whatever you want to call it side of him. He had that gene. 'Someone who's viewing life only as a transactional relationship with people...doesn't do that.' In a recent interview Cooks revealed his average working day - which still leaves little time for socialising. He gets up at 3:45 every morning and begins to check his email, goes to the gym at 5am and to work at 6:30am, already fully briefed and with the day ahead planned out. He goes to bed early: by 9:30pm or sometimes 10pm, according to the Telegraph. The book includes unprecedented interviews with Cook and other Apple executives, many of whom were disappointed with the official biography written by Walter Isaacson. 'I thought the [Walter] Isaacson book did him a tremendous disservice,' said Cook. 'It was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written, and focused on small parts of his personality. 'You get the feeling that [Steve's] a greedy, selfish egomaniac. It didn't capture the person. The person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time. Life is too short.' Cook also revealed the moment Jobs asked him to take over as Apple CEO, when on August 11, he went to Jobs' house. 'He said, 'I want to talk to you about something,' ' remembers Cook. 'This was when he was home all the time, and I asked when, and he said, 'Now.' 'He told me he had decided that I should be CEO.' Cook said he thought at the time Jobs was on the road to recovery. 'Every time I saw him he seemed to be getting better. He felt that way as well. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.' Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone in 2007 - the latest in a long line of hit products. The books also reveals Jobs worked for as long as possible. 'He was working his ass off till the end, in pain,' remembers Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of software and internet services. 'You could see it in the meetings; he was taking morphine and you could see he was in pain, but he was still interested.' Previously it was revealed Cook once tried to offer Steve Jobs his liver in a desperate bid to prolong his life. Jobs had been suffering serious health problems as a result of his pancreatic cancer and by January 2009 - two years before his death - was in urgent need of a liver transplant. On learning this, Cook was so upset he took it upon himself to have his blood tested and found that he happened to have the same rare blood type as his good friend and mentor. Steve Jobs posing with an Apple II computer. 1976 Jobs co-founds Apple . 1980 Apple's stock market flotation is biggest since Ford in 1956 . 1985 Leaves Apple to concentrate on new ventures, including Pixar and NeXT . 1997 Returns to Apple promising to revitalise the flagging company . 2000 Resumes as Apple CEO . 2002 iPod launched . 2003 iTunes launched .

Because it is a regenerative organ, the transplanted portion will grow to a functioning size, while the donor's liver would also repair. Bouyed by the findings, Cook visited Jobs at his home in Palo Alto to relay the good news. But Jobs outright refused. 'He cut me off at the legs, almost before the words were out of my mouth,' said Cook in the biography, according to Fast Company. ''No,' he said. 'I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that'. Somebody that's selfish doesn't reply like that. 'I mean, here's a guy, he's dying, he's very close to death because of his liver issue and here's someone healthy offering a way out.' The new biography (pictured right) about Steve Jobs (left) is due to be released later this month . Cook insisted that he was 'perfectly healthy' and stressed that the procedure would not put him at risk. But Jobs 'popped up in bed' and told him: 'No, I'm not doing that.'

"Nigel Farage this morning rejected claims he has been ‘sent by God’ to save Britain from the European Union – insisting: ‘I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’ The Ukip leader’s remarks, echoing one of the most famous lines from Monty Python's Life of Brian, came after he was played a clip of a documentary aired this week featuring one of his more obsessive fans. Former nurse Jill said Mr Farage ‘probably didn’t realise it’ but had been ‘sent to protect us against the EU’. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage this morning insisted he was not the 'Messiah', adding: 'I'm a very naughty boy' The 59-year old dominatrix, from Poole in Dorset, told the Channel 5 documentary ‘Farage Fans and Ukip Lovers’ that Brussels wanted to install microchips in everyone – and would send people to the guillotine if they refused. She said Mr Farage, 50, was Britain’s only hope. 'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection.' Jill added: 'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.' 'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people. 'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.' Played the clip on LBC this morning Mr Farage insisted he was not placed on Earth to save Britain from Brussels. In Monty Python's Life of Brian, the hapless Brian, played by Graham Chapman (right), is hailed the Messiah - but his mother, played by Terry Jones (left) tells his followers: 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy' The cult 1979 film follows the rise of Brian Cohen, who was born on the same day as Jesus and is mistaken as the Messiah . He said: ‘Jill, I’m sure, is an absolutely delightful woman, but I have to disappoint her. Jill, I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’ Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies. She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it. 'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage. 'I do think that Nigel Farage has bought a new era and openess to England where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked.' Jill, pictured left at her home in Poole, believes UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been sent from God to save us from a foreign invasion . Jill is pictured demonstrating her hobby and is grateful Brits can now be more open about their sex lives . The bondage enthusiast also believes UKIP can enhance the NHS by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it, like herself. 'I have been a nurse most of my life, I have my views about the NHS. I think people who need big breasts, who need their nose done, should receive help from the state,' Jill said. 'I think Nigel should look into this. I want big breasts. I have seen my surgeon and I am going to have implants. 'I think I should get them on the NHS. Nigel could get a higher women's vote by bringing that into play.'","Former nurse Jill, 59, of Poole in Dorset, said Nigel Farage was sent by God .

"An illegal immigrant who committed 'revolting' sex offences on the London Underground could receive a £7,000 payout because he was kept in jail for 'too long' while officials tried to deport him. Naseer Chawki, who claims to be 34 and from Iran, was detained for more than four years while Home Office officials fought for deportation, after he was convicted of sexually abusing two women on a rush-hour Piccadilly Line train. But he has now won a High Court battle against Home Secretary Theresa May, after a judge ruled that he had been illegally held for seven months - against his human rights - during that process. Naseer Chawki, who sexually assaulted two women on a rush-hour Tube, could be awarded £7,000 after the High Court (pictured) ruled he was unlawfully held for ten months while officials tried to deport him . Deputy High Court Judge Stephen Morris said Chawki's payout is yet to be assessed, giving no indication of what the figure would be. But according to human rights lawyers, the payout given to Chawki could be between £5,000 and £10,000. In 2013, a Supreme Court judgment set a precedent that those detained illegally should receive around £1,000 for each month they are held against their human rights. It means Chawki can expect to receive around £7,000. During today's hearing in London, the court heard how Chawki - who has failed in a bid to claim asylum - arrived in Cardiff from Iran in 1999 before moving to Liverpool. He then moved to Seven Sisters, north London. The court heard how, in November 2008, Chawki was given a three-year jail term for carrying out two sex assaults on the London Underground, as well as possessing a false identity document. Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) had claimed Chawki was held because he posed a 'serious risk' to the public but has lost the case . Chawki had pleaded guilty to the offences, after he pressed himself against the women on a crowded rush-hour train. The attacks had been witnessed by commuters and Chawki was later traced using DNA evidence and Oyster card records. During the hearing over those offences, the court heard how the  'revolting' sex attacks had had 'very lasting effects' on the victims. Judge Martin Beddoe, who heard the case at Southwark Crown Court, said he would recommend deportation after he had served time in jail for the crimes. Chawki was then released from jail in December 2009. Following an order for his deportation, he was placed in immigration detention, while officials began the process. But he was released from immigration detention in March last year after attempts to deport him failed. He was made to wear a monitoring tag. After his release, Chawki launched a legal battle, claiming he had been held in immigration detention when then was 'no prospect' of him being deported. Mrs May disputed his claim, saying he posed a 'serious risk of harm' and that there was a 'serious risk' that he would abscond. Judge Morris ruled that detention had been lawful for the majority of the four years and four months Chawki was held. But he ruled that the detention had been unlawful between mid-September 2013 and March last year. He said that, by that time, there had been 'no sufficient prospect of removal within a reasonable time'. During the 2013 case which set the precedent on the issue of payouts, the Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of State had breached the human rights of Mr Faulkner by keeping him in detention for 10 months longer than necessary. Mr Faulkner was serving a life sentence but had brought the case over the delay in reviewing the need for his further detention, on the grounds of whether it was necessary for public protection. The Secretary of State was ordered to pay him £10,000 in damages, setting a precedent of around £1,000 in damages per month held unlawfully.","Naseer Chawki, from Iran, was convicted in 2008 of assaulting two women .

"At first glance, Sara and Erin Foster would seem to be your average Hollywood blondes - tall, willowy and blessed by the genetic gods. But these are truly funny girls. And for the past two years, the sisters have been working on what is being talked about as the new must-watch comedy of the season. Barely Famous takes two vacuous sisters, played by Sara and Erin, and sends them up as they star in their own reality show - although the characters seem determined to ignore this fact as much as possible. Funny girls: Erin Foster (left) and her sister Sara (right) are debuting their new comedy, Barely Famous . Showbiz royalty: Erin and Sara are the daughter of legendary music producer David Foster, seen together in 2008. Their new show, a mockumentary reality show, is 'about Hollywood and the desperation to be famous', says actress Sara . Desperate to get on the Hollywood A List, Sara and Erin's alter-egos find themselves breaking into Courteney Cox's home, trying to coax free designer bags away from Kate Hudson and looking down on anyone who appears on reality TV - even though they're starring on their own show. As the daughters of legendary music producer David Foster, Sara, 34, and Erin, 32, grew up rubbing shoulders with showbiz royalty. Indeed, their step-mother is Yolanda Foster, of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fame, and their step-sisters are models Gigi and Bella Hadid. But actress Sara - who appeared on 90210 - is quick to stress: 'We're not spoofing Housewives, or any franchise. This show is about Hollywood and the desperation to be famous, we're pulling the curtain back.' Married to tennis player Tommy Haas with a young daughter Valentina, Sara adds: 'I watch reality TV and I'm not judging anyone who goes on it, but the thought of having my personal life on TV and that being my job is not for me.' Barely Famous launches on March 18 as one of VH1's first scripted shows, and Erin, who was a writer on NBC comedy The New Normal, says: 'It's really a mockumentary about two sisters who say they would never do a reality show, but they are actually starring on their own show and won't admit it anyone. 'We are not being mean spirited, we're poking fun of a culture that is such a huge part of our lives today. 'Without judgement, we're in a really crazy time right now, you become famous first and then you figure out what you want to do with it. It's a really backwards way of having a career.' She adds: 'There is no skill involved in acquiring a million Instagram followers, although that's a job now, you actually get paid for it, it's ridiculous.

'There is this voyeuristic obsession and what we forget is that people show you the parts of their lives they want you to know about and they hide the parts they don't want you to know about. 'This makes a regular person feel like a celebrity has a perfect life or relationship or career or body and they forget there are all these apps involved in making you believe it.' 'We wanted to make a show that was light and fun, but showed the neuroses between two people filming a reality show and the strategies and manipulation behind it,' Erin says. 'Nothing on the show is pulled from a real experience, it's pulled from things that you witness in LA, like you go to a hair salon and you're made to wait an hour and a half because a celebrity just decides to turn up. Everything's status related and you can be made to feel like a real loser!' Despite living in LA, both sisters - who have another sister, Jordan - are down to earth. They were brought up in the San Fernando Valley by their mother Rebecca Dyer, David's second wife, as Sara notes: 'Our parents divorced when we were five and we lived with our mom in the Valley. Our mom was a single mom with three kids and she struggled, so we didn't have the life that people assume.' And Erin agrees: 'Your environment is not as influential as the people you are raised by and we were raised by two people who were very grounded, strong and present parents. 'My sisters and I grew up in LA and none of us ever went to rehab, got pregnant, got a DUI - and we never got into trouble! We are a testament to our parents.' Music producer David has won 16 Grammys and produced superstars including Barbra Streisand, Christina Aguilera, Whitney Houston and Jennifer Lopez. Friends in high places: Sara and Erin Foster got their childhood pal Nicole Richie on board as well and she makes a guest spot in Barely Famous . Characters: Erin and Sara Foster play two sisters, aptly named Erin and Sara, desperate to be famous, who sign up for a reality show - but refuse to acknowledge that fact . Family: The Foster sisters step-mother is Yolanda Foster, of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Fame, and their step-sister is rising model Gigi Hadid . Erin says: 'Our dad is wonderful, he's such a good example to have grown up watching. He was really young, 13, when he dropped out of high school and became a professional musician. He was around the music scene in 1970s and '80s and he never touched a drug and he doesn't really drink. 'Our mother is totally removed from Hollywood, she looks beautiful and natural for her age and she has no interest in fame. 'We weren't raised around an obsession with fame, it's so destructive. If anything, we were raised to believe that's NOT what success looks like. It's not everyone knowing your name.' As for their step-sister Gigi, 19, who was recently named model of the year, Erin says: 'Gigi deserves all the success in the world, she's getting recognition for something she's doing well. 'We're so proud of her, no-one deserves this more than she does.' During filming, Sara and Erin called upon famous friends including Sara's best friend Kate Hudson, childhood pal Nicole Richie, Jessica Alba, Molly Sims, Ashley Benson and Milla Jovovich. Erin says: 'When we developed the show, everyone was excited. You're made to take yourself so seriously all the time and they got to have fun.' Reality bites: Yolanda Foster appears on the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and her husband has made infrequent appearances - and he has also appeared on the Princes of Malibu . Sara appears in a scene where she attempts to blag a free designer bag - only to be trumped by Kate Hudson, sniffing: 'She got nominated for an Oscar 15 years ago.' And she says: 'It was so fun to be in a scene where we have to pretend we don't know each other, fighting and taking the p***s out of celebrity culture - like she needs another free bag!' The girls have poured all their heart into the show and Sara readily admits: 'This is our baby, we've given it our blood, sweat and tears.'

"Whiplash insurance claims linked to car crashes are rising again - adding £93 to the average premium, new figures show. The rise is being driven by lawyers trying to drum up business through cold calls and nuisance text messages. New figures from the insurance firm Aviva suggest the number of personal injury claims linked to road accidents will have risen by nine per cent in the the year to April 2015. Around 80 per cent of these will include a claim for whiplash, which is a far higher proportion than other comparable nations in Europe. This will add up to 840,000 pay-outs worth £2.5billion. A whiplash sufferer. Lawyers using nuisance text messages and cold calls are driving up claim numbers . Aviva says it is evidence of a damaging ‘compensation culture’. It believes a high proportion of the claims are bogus and blames ambulance chasing claims management companies and law firms. The insurance firm’s data shows that 96 per cent of personal injury claims it received last year were brought by third parties. The Government has put in place measures to try and tackle the menace, including introducing a cap on the legal fees surrounding claims as part of the LASPO Act. A new regime that vets and accredits medical experts who assess whiplash injury claims has also been set up by the government under an organisation called MedCo. However, Aviva say these do not go far enough and it wants an end to cash windfall payments to people claiming a whiplash injury. Instead, it says insurers should – in the first instance – be required to offer sufferers medical treatment. Whiplash involves the sudden hyperextension (right) followed by immediate hyperflexion (left) of the neck, resulting in damage to the muscles, ligaments and tendons . The firm’s chief executive, Maurice Tulloch, said there has been a failure to address the excessive numbers of minor motor injury claims and the escalating costs surrounding them. ‘The UK’s compensation culture is at the root cause of the £93 cost of whiplash claims paid by motorists within their insurance premiums,’ he said. ‘Customers have told us they are fed up with compensation culture and all its trimmings: the nuisance texts and calls from claims management companies, excessive lawyers’ fees and fraudsters abusing the system for their own financial gain.’ Mr Tulloch said: ‘We are here to help our customers when they need it, and pay genuine claims quickly. But we must address how to best treat the excessive number of fraudulent, exaggerated and minor whiplash claims which are driving up the cost of insurance. ‘Sadly, we are now witnessing a resurgence in the number and cost of whiplash and soft-tissue injury claims despite some very positive developments, such as the LASPO Act, which helped reduce customer premiums. Aviva chief executive Maurice Tulloch: ‘Customers have told us they are fed up with compensation culture' 'The introduction of a new system for sourcing medical reports in soft tissue injury claims is also a step forward.’ Aviva says the length of time between an accident and a whiplash claim should be reduced from three years to one. And it argues that any claim should be backed up with medical evidence that the symptoms have lasted for more than three months. Where someone can demonstrate real and lasting symptoms, they would be offered treatment rather than money. Where problems persist, the insurer says cash payments would be offered against a set tariff. Aviva claims its proposals could cut motor insurance tariffs by an average of £50 a year. Mr Tulloch said: ‘It is possible to cut the cost of motor insurance and ensure those who have suffered genuine injuries get the care or compensation they deserve. ‘We believe that everyone is entitled to fairly priced insurance to protect what is important to them. Introducing these reforms is a challenge but we will not hide away from this - the UK’s motorists deserve even more affordable motor insurance.’ Aviva says the large number of whiplash claims has driven up premiums here to an average of £372 a year. They are some 40per cent less in France and 50per cent cheaper in Germany. At the same time, the proportion of insurance claims which include whiplash are much lower in these two other countries, where legal fees are also less.","Rise driven by lawyers using nuisance text messages and cold calls .

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (above) said Britain would become the first country in the world with a nationwide meningitis B vaccination programme after the Government reached a deal with drug maker GlaxoSmithKline . All babies will be offered an injection against deadly meningitis B – ending a year-long delay, the Health Secretary said yesterday. The vaccine costs £20 a time and is expected to be available on the NHS by the end of the year. Jeremy Hunt’s announcement follows growing pressure from charities, highlighted by the Mail, which warned that children were dying and suffering devastating injuries while wrangling about the cost continued. There are around 1,870 cases of meningitis B in the country each year and it commonly affects the under-fives and teenagers. It leads to around 120 deaths and leaves another 400 with life-long disabilities including brain damage, amputations and blindness. A panel of scientific advisers had recommended in October 2013 that the vaccine should not be introduced as it was not deemed cost-effective. But ministers told the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation to carry out another assessment and this concluded last March that it should be offered. The Government then spent almost a year negotiating with drugs manufacturers trying to agree a cheaper price. On Saturday, the Mail highlighted how the jab was being denied to babies because of the cost row. Nearly 800,000 babies each year would be eligible for the jab at an average annual cost of £16million. Charities estimate the NHS would spend around £3million treating and caring for just one child who has survived meningitis but is left with life-long disabilities. GPs would give the injection to babies from the age of two months, with boosters at four months and 12 months. In most cases, they would have it with the five-in-one jab and the rotavirus oral vaccination. The move means the UK will be the first country in the world to offer the vaccine to all babies. Mr Hunt said: ‘We can go ahead this year with rolling out the meningitis B vaccine and that’s something families, particularly those with young children, will really welcome.’ Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered . Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. The disease is an infection of the meninges - the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. The first symptoms usually include fever, vomiting and headaches. Others include limb pain, pale skin, neck stiffness, dislike of bright lights and confusion. It is commonly found in children under five years of age but can also affect teenagers aged 15 to 19. It is fatal in around 10 per cent of cases. Some of those who survive are left with long-term problems, such as amputation, deafness, epilepsy and learning difficulties. He said ministers had had a ‘stand-off’ with Novartis, which owned the vaccine, ‘for the best part of a year’ as it failed to agree a cheaper price. The jab, called Bexsero, has since been bought by GlaxoSmithKline, which has agreed a lower cost. Sue Davie, of the charity Meningitis Now, said: ‘To know that babies will be protected is fantastic and another great step forward in our fight against meningitis.’ Chris Head, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘We are delighted that vaccinating all babies against this devastating disease is within sight, cementing the UK’s position as a world leader in meningitis prevention.’ Dr David Elliman, a consultant in Community Child Health at the Whittington Health NHS Trust, North London, said: ‘It is great news. The vaccine will mean the numbers of children suffering this terrible illness will be further reduced.’ Meningitis is an infection of the outside layer of cells surrounding the brain and spinal cord, causing inflammation and damage. It can kill within hours and is the most common cause of death by infectious disease in childhood.","Britain will be first country in the world with the vaccination programme .

"Dramatic video footage has emerged showing an enormous group of sharks in a feeding frenzy off the US coast. Video taken from high up on an oil platform captured hundreds of the predators circling 30 miles from the shores of Grand Isle, Louisiana.

"A former Special Forces soldier is rounding up supporters for a leadership bid against Ed Miliband if he does not win the General Election, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Dan Jarvis, who entered the Commons only four years ago, has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if Mr Miliband fails to dislodge David Cameron from No 10. One senior Labour MP, who met privately with Mr Jarvis in the Commons a month ago, said: ‘Dan wants to go for it if the result is disappointing.' Ex-Special Forces: Dan Jarvis has told potential supporters he is prepared to run if Mr Miliband fails to dislodge David Cameron from No 10 . He added: 'I thought about it for a couple of weeks, then rang him to say he could count on my backing.’ The news has emerged as the Labour leader faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week. With polling day barely six weeks away, Rochdale Labour MP Simon Danczuk will discuss Mr Miliband’s lack of voter appeal with party peer Lord Glasman in an interview broadcast on LBC on Monday evening. During the debate, Mr Danczuk asks: ‘What has Nigel Farage got that Ed Miliband doesn’t?’ The peer – a former adviser to Mr Miliband – responds: ‘He has got the ability to sit in the pub and be at his complete ease, which is a very magical gift. Ed is… from the seminar room.’ Mr Jarvis, the Shadow Justice Minister, is rapidly gaining support on the party back benches as a ‘clean skin’ candidate who, unlike many rivals, was not an adviser or Minister during the Blair or Brown governments and is ‘untainted’ by association with Mr Miliband’s inner circle. Some MPs also argue that the 42-year-old ex-Para’s military career – a rarity in Labour ranks – would be more appealing to voters than Mr Miliband’s background as a policy adviser. In any leadership contest, Mr Jarvis is likely to face the more experienced figures of health spokesman Andy Burnham, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, education spokesman Tristram Hunt and ambitious frontbencher Liz Kendall. Ed Miliband faces the embarrassment of two senior party figures openly debating his failings during a broadcast interview this week . The backer added: ‘Dan has a clear view of his own strengths, and an even clearer view of his rivals’ weaknesses.’ Mr Jarvis became the first person since the Second World War to resign a military commission to contest a by-election. He successfully stood in Barnsley Central in 2011, shortly after his wife Caroline died of cancer, aged 43, leaving him to care for their two children. Mr Jarvis has since remarried and now has a third child. The former major spent 15 years in the Paras, and was awarded an MBE after serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. In keeping with his action-man image, it was reported last week he had pacified a drunken thug wielding a bottle who demanded his wallet. Under party rules, if Mr Miliband fails to win power in May but doesn’t resign, a leadership election can be triggered only if 20 per cent of the party’s MPs nominate a specific challenger. The winner, elected by MPs, MEPs, party members and unions, would be announced at the party’s next annual conference.","Dan Jarvis is gathering supporters for a leadership bid against Ed Miliband .

"A woman has finally achieved her dream of having children, thanks to eggs donated by her sister. Lisa Blake, 41, spent six years and £7,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner Stephen, 37, both suffer from unexplained fertility problems. After a fourth round of IVF failed, the couple, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor. Seeing how desperate they were to become parents, Miss Blake's younger sister, Julie Wealand, 35, offered to donate her own eggs. And finally, in December 2013, Miss Blake became pregnant. She gave birth to healthy twin baby boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 months, in July last year. Lisa Blake, 41, gave birth to healthy twin boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 month, in July 2014 . Miss Blake said: 'I was so happy to discover that I was finally pregnant. 'Julie has given me the best gift I could ask for, I'll be forever grateful.' The couple's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby. Miss Blake, who has been in a relationship with Stephen for 15 years, said: 'We started trying for baby when I was 34, but after two years we realised something was wrong. 'Doctors couldn't explain my fertility problems - I just couldn't get pregnant. My sister had also struggled to conceive so I knew my age wasn't to blame. 'Growing up, I always dreamed of having at least two children, and there was nothing I wanted more than to be a mum. 'My friends have kids, most from when they were younger, so I only had to attend one baby shower. But when I saw people with children, I wished it would be me.' Aged 36, she turned to IVF treatment in an attempt to conceive. But three agonising years and three failed IVF attempts later, the pair were still childless. Meanwhile her sister Mrs Wealand, who lives in California with her husband, gave birth to two children of her own, conceived through IVF treatment. Miss Blake said: 'I was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant. Even though she lives abroad, we're really close and I loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew. 'But I still longed for a child so Stephen and I pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of IVF. 'Adopting would have been our final chance for children because we couldn't afford to pay for more treatments.' Miss Blake (right) had been trying to conceive for six years, and had spent £7,000 on IVF treatment. She was only able to have children when her sister, Julie Wealand, 35, (left), donated her eggs . Miss Blake became pregnant in December 2013, and gave birth to twins Joshua and Harrison in July 2014. She said her sister had given her 'the best gift she could have ever asked for' But the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs. Miss Blake said: 'At first we were devastated - they didn't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew, who would be willing to donate their eggs. 'We went to my parent's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said. 'She promptly replied ""You can use mine"". 'I was in disbelief and giddy with excitement.' After Mrs Wealand's generous offer, they began the long process of tests and counselling. Her eggs were harvested and fertilised with Stephen's sperm. A year later, Miss Blake was implanted with Mrs Wealand's eggs, but sadly, it was unsuccessful. Miss Blake said: 'I was so disappointed when I discovered that Julie's eggs hadn't worked. 'But despite the emotional toll, I knew I had to just carry on.' So later that year in December 2013, they tried for the final time, using Miss Wealand's embryos they'd frozen from the fourth try. Miss Blake, pictured with partner Stephen, 37, and her newborn babies, gave birth by Caesarean section as doctors feared she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia . Miss Blake and her partner said they were 'overjoyed' when they discovered they were having twins, who, eight months later, are thriving . She will now celebrate Mother's day with her sons. She said: 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood' Miss Blake became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins. She said: 'I'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests, which were all negative, while trying to conceive from IVF, so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal. 'During a hospital scan, we discovered we were having twins, I was even more overjoyed.' At 35 weeks, doctors worried that Lisa was suffering from pre-eclampsia - a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure, which affects some women in the second half of their pregnancy. In order to minimize the risk, doctors delivered the twin babies via Caesarean section. Miss Blake said: 'I was disappointed that I wouldn't have a natural birth, but all I cared about was the boys being healthy. 'Julie wanted to be my side when I gave birth, but only one person is allowed in the operating theatre so Stephen clutched my hand instead. 'Without her, we wouldn't have a beautiful family.' Now eight months old, Harrison and Joshua are thriving. Miss Blake said: 'I still can't believe I'm a mum and I can't wait to celebrate Mother's Day with the boys. 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood.'","Lisa Blake, 41, and her partner Stephen were desperate to have children .

"A sex killer who is currently serving life for four rapes and three murders is planning to appeal his sentence - and wants police to dig out more than 6,000 documents to help him. David Mulcahy and his schoolfriend John Duffy became known as the 'Railway Rapists' after trawling train lines targeting lone victims in London and south east England in the 1980s. Duffy was jailed for life in 1988, but it was not until 2001 that he named his accomplice as 55-year-old Mulcahy from Chalk Farm in north London and he was also jailed. David Mulcahy, 55, (pictured in 1999) who was dubbed one half of the 'Railway Rapists', is appealing his prison sentence. He wants the Metropolitan Police to release all records about him to prove his innocence . Despite the conviction, Mulcahy has maintained he is innocent and wants the Metropolitan Police to release every single detail they have about him on their records. He took the force to court today and told a judge that the documents are vital in proving his innocence. But officers have refused to release the information, saying it could take weeks or even months of costly work to get it together, and it would be 'disproportionate' to make such a huge effort. John Potts, Metropolitan Police data protection officer,  told Central London County Court that the documents, if piled on top of each other, would be more than three feet high. John Duffy (left) was jailed for life in 1988 but didn't name his accomplice as Mulcahy until 2001 (right) He added that to work through the 6,000 documents would take 23 full working days and would likely lead them to more documents that would eat up a similar amount of time. There would also have to be meetings with victims' families, senior officers and others mentioned in the papers before they could be released, he said. The force's barrister, Robin Hopkin, said: 'My client has provided all the information it holds that can be provided without it undertaking disproportionate levels of burden in terms of cost and time.' But Mulcahy, appearing via a video link from Full Sutton Prison, said the force is obliged under the Data Protection Act to give him everything he wants. Mulcahy is jailed at maximum-security prison Full Sutton, near York, where he appeared from via videolink to Central London County Court today . 'I should be entitled to all the documents that the police hold,' he told Judge Margaret Langley. 'I am preparing an appeal and I need those documents for the appeal. I am fighting for liberty and life.' The judge said a decision on the case would not be made until later this year. Mulcahy was given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29, in 2001. David Mulcahy and John Duffy were described chillingly as 'two bodies with one brain' for the way they hunted for women to rape and murder. Mulcahy and Duffy were drawn together as a pair of 11-year-olds on their first day of school in 1970. They were bullied at school and built an alliance, becoming obsessed with martial arts. Alison Day (left), 19, was visiting her fiancé when they pulled her off Hackney Wick platform, raped her twice, and strangled her with her blouse. Maartje Tamboezer (right), 15, was raped, killed and badly burned by the pair. She was cycling home from school in Horsley, Surrey, when they tripped up her bike with a fishing line . Just two years later, Mulcahy was suspended from Haverstock Hill Comprehensive, in Chalk Farm, north London, after killing a hedgehog by stamping on its head. Duffy stood by laughing. As they grew older, their larks became much more sinister. They planned and executed their murders together, down to the tissues Duffy carried in a matchbox to wipe away and burn forensic evidence. They went on what they called 'hunting parties' cruising along singing to Michael Jackson's hit song Thriller as they searched for lone women to rape and murder. Going out at night and weekends in search of prey, they would prolong their excitement by comparing victims after each attack. They tossed a coin to decide who should be first to rape before murdering them. Third . victim: Anne Lock, 29, pictured on her wedding day, disappeared after . leaving work at London Weekend Television in north London four weeks . after getting married. The pair raped and killed her in a nearby field . For their first attack, they had . planned a kidnap using false names and accents, kitting themselves out . with balaclavas, sticky tape and knives. It didn’t work because the pair became 'nervous', Duffy later said. Nevertheless, they had snatched a young woman off the street in the early hours and raped her in turn behind a wall. Then, . over the next four years, they embarked on a campaign that would claim . them a joint place in the criminal record books as history’s most . prolific rapists. Despite their silence pact, John Duffy gave evidence against Mulcahy when he was sentenced to 30 years for his crimes. At the Old Bailey in 2001, Mulcahy was . given three life sentences for the murders of Alison Day, 19, Dutch . schoolgirl Maartje Tamboezer 15, and newlywed Anne Lock, 29. He was also convicted of seven rapes and five conspiracies to rape.","David Mulcahy and John Duffy were known as 'Railway Rapists' in 1980s .

"James Webster (pictured) was warned he could yet face jail for filming up women's skirts as they leaned over supermarket freezers in Maidenhead . A man has been warned he could yet face jail for lurking behind women as they bent over supermarket freezer counters and used a hidden camera to film up their skirts, a court has heard. James Webster, 35, took photos as his victims leaned against the display cabinets in the aisles and eventually attracted suspicions as other shoppers saw him moving the bag he was carrying so that he could get a clear up-skirt view. Today Webster was waiting to discover his fate after magistrates ordered a pre-sentence report to be carried out by the probation service. The court heard that an upset shopper alerted management who found the 35-year-old, who sports long dreadlocks with beads weaved through them, positioning his hidden camera underneath another woman's skirt as she leaned over a freezer. Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could covertly film between women's legs. Prosecuting, Joanna McGlew told magistrates in Slough, Berkshire, that an upset shopper had noticed the dreadlocked voyeur and raised the alarm. 'The defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead,' she added. 'A shopper was observing him and he saw him acting in an odd manner. 'He saw the defendant crouching down and Mr Webster kept moving a bag, which he kept with him, under the skirt of a girl and the girl seemed unaware of this. 'He then saw a lens protruding from the satchel. He was upset by this and reported it to management.' She told the court that the store manager arrived to see Webster trying to slide the spy camera bag under the skirt of another woman leaning over in the freezer section. 'He saw a female customer bend over one of the freezer aisles and saw Mr Webster manoeuvre a bag to a position under the girl's skirt,' Miss McGlew added. Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, Berkshire, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing. However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper Webster, who now lives with his parents on the outskirts of Norwich, turned himself in to police. Webster admitted one count of outraging public decency by covertly filming up women's skirts in the Lidl store in January. Wearing a big black jacket, black trousers and shoes, he spoke only to confirm his name, address and plead guilty to the charge yesterday. However, Francis Domingo, defending, insisted Webster felt ashamed and remorseful for his actions and appealed for a community sentence. 'When he was interviewed by police not only did he make admissions but he also said his actions would be considered lewd, obscene and disgusting and the women involved would be highly upset and embarrassed,' Mr Domingo added. 'Throughout the interview he was very tearful and remorseful. This is a man who has clearly faced up to his actions. 'He was close to tears as he told me he just wishes he could turn the clock back and wishes it had never taken place.' Webster was caught taking photos up women's skirts at Maidenhead Lidl (pictured) after a concerned customer contacted management . Mr Domingo told the magistrates that as soon as his client left the store he threw the camera away in disgust at himself. He also said that Webster, now of Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean. 'As soon as it happened he said to himself 'Oh my God, what am I doing?' and threw the camera away in disgust,' he added. 'He clearly has a conscience. He listened to his conscience and surrendered himself. This should be pitched in terms of a community level.' The court adjourned the hearing until next month  to give probation time to compile a pre-sentence report on Webster. Webster was released on conditional bail, however, presiding magistrate Anne Brown warned him that all sentencing options remained open. 'We are going to ask for a pre-sentence report and you will have to cooperate with probation services,' she added. 'We are going to ask for a look at all the options. We are going to leave open all options.'","James Webster, 35, took photos as victims leaned against display cabinets .

"A schoolboy who says he was so overweight and unfit he looked 'like a tomato' after  PE lessons decided to put himself on a diet - and shed almost three stone. Owen Clarke, 12, weighed 10st 8lb (67kg) last summer and says he was embarrassed by his size, and because he got so red and sweaty after exercise. He begged his mother to let him join her on a diet so he was fit enough to play football with his friends. And after swapping chocolate bars for low-fat yogurts, the 5'4"" schoolboy is now a healthy 8st (50kg). Owen Clarke, 12, weighed 10st 8lbs (left)  and was embarrassed as he was so unfit he looked 'like a tomato' after a PE lesson. He decided to put himself on a diet, and managed to lose nearly three stone (right) Owen lost weight by giving up biscuits, chocolate bars and sausage rolls and instead snacking on yogurts, homemade scotch eggs, cucumber and carrot sticks . His efforts inspired his mother, Michelle Hatfield, to re-evaluate the food she was feeding her family, as she didn't realise her son was overweight in the first place. The 33-year-old has now swapped  convenience foods ans takeaways for meals made from scratch, crediting the change on her son's desire to be healthier. Owen, from Leicester, said: 'I was a bit lazy before losing weight and didn't enjoy sport that much. BEFORE . Breakfast: One large bowl of coco pops . Lunch: Two sandwiches with cheese, one full fat yogurt, one bag of crisps, one chocolate bar. Dinner: Pizza, chips and full-fat barbecue sauce. Snacks: Biscuits, chocolate bars and sausage rolls. AFTER . Breakfast: 38g of puffed wheat with sweetener. Lunch: Two wholemeal bread ham sandwiches, one packet of crisps, an apple . Dinner: Homemade spaghetti bolognese. Snacks: Muller yogurts, homemade scotch eggs, cucumber and carrot sticks. 'I remember hating it because I'd get really tired and I'd look like a tomato after PE but that's all changed now. 'Nobody really said anything bad to me about my weight but I couldn't play football with all my friends and I wanted to change. 'Now I absolutely love football and I play for at least an hour every day. 'I never used to enjoy PE and felt a bit left out but now that's all changed. 'I feel like I can compete and enjoy myself without getting embarrassed.' When he started losing weight in January 2014, Owen was 5""1 tall. His weight meant he was technically classed as obese, as he had Body Mass Index (BMI) in the 99th centile of the BMI chart. After losing more than two stone in five months, he now has a healthy BMI. Owen's efforts made Ms Hatfield realise it was the food she fed him that made him pile on the pounds. She said: 'It all started when I decided I wanted to lose some weight on a slimming world plan and went home to tell the family that I was going to change my diet. 'It didn't take long for Owen to ask if he could join me. 'We always ate convenience food because it's so much cheaper. I'd been brought up that way and I've never known anything different. 'One afternoon, Owen came over to me and asked if he could change his diet too.' Before he lost weight, Owen's BMI meant he was obese. After losing weight (pictured left and right), he has a BMI in the healthy range . Owen swapped chocolate and sausage rolls for low fat yoghurts and cucumber and carrot sticks. He is now able to play football with his friends, and plays for up to an hour a day . Ms Hatfield, who dropped from 13st 8lbs (86kg) to 11st 1lbs (70kg) at the same time as Owen said she never saw her son as being overweight. She said: 'When he first asked me if he could do it too, it made me feel awful. 'I'd never looked at him and thought he was fat or overweight. He's my son and you just don't look at your children like that. 'I'd obviously noticed but until he came to ask me that, I'd always dismissed his weight as nothing more than puppy fat. 'It took me a while to get my head around it because I couldn't get over the fact that it was my fault. 'I'm his mother and it's always been my responsibility to feed him. Ms Hatfield said: 'Owen made me realise how irresponsible I'd been with the food I was buying' 'That moment when he asked if he could join me at Slimming World finally made me realise how irresponsible I'd been with the food I was buying in. 'I'm really proud of Owen because he did this all on his own back and it's inspired me to think differently about the food I put on the table. 'He wasn't pushed to lose weight at any stage, he's just got his head down and done it. 'Even though I was initially pretty ashamed of myself, I couldn't be any more proud of Owen. 'His transformation has been amazing and I feel like a better mother too. 'He's been so determined from the very start and he's had the discipline to maintain the weight loss. 'Now when I take him to the supermarket, he's out looking for Muller Light rather than chocolate trifles!' Owen added: 'My attitude towards food has completely changed too. I've actually started to see the grease on takeaways and it puts me off. 'I'm really proud of how much weight I've lost and my friends at school have noticed too. 'My friends have all said congratulations and are really impressed with how much I've managed to lose.' Owen's dad, Lee Clarke, has also noticed his son's remarkable transformation when he cares for him at weekends. Mr Clarke, who works at Dunelm Mill, said: 'It really is amazing. I'm so proud of him. 'It's done wonders for his confidence and it's just great to see.' One in five children now leaves primary school obese, official figures show . More than three quarters of parents refuse to admit their child is overweight, as official figures show one in five  children now leaves primary school obese. Researchers at Imperial College London found 77 per cent of parents claimed their overweight child was ‘normal’. Among those who did accept their child was too fat, many claimed it was just ‘puppy fat’ or their genes. Others said their child was just ‘solid’ or that they had a ‘big build’. The study came as official figures found the number of obese 11-year-olds has increased since previous years. Experts warned that lifestyle habits are ingrained by the time a child is 11. Mr Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, warned: 'Those 11-year-olds are probably going to end up as obese adults.’ Other experts say the problem of childhood obesity is compounded by the fact parents often don’t realise, or refuse to admit, that their child is fat.","Owen Clarke, 12, was embarrassed to weigh  10st 8lb (67kg) last year .

"A pregnant woman and her husband were forced to sleep in the car park of an Auckland motel after the receptionist said he had no record of their booking. Unfortunately for Lucy and Gary Best, they had failed to check the TripAdvisor reviews of Epson Motor Inn before they decided to stay there. The couple, from Kerikeri in New Zealand, may have decided to book in somewhere else had they spent some time researching their accommodation. Complaints from past guests range from mould in the bathroom and unpainted walls to blood on the bed sheets. Lucy Best and her husband Gary were forced to sleep in their car after the motel said there was no record . ‘I thought I was lucky to find somewhere because it was one of a very few that were available,’ Mrs Best told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I'm not fussy so at $75 a night it sounded reasonable and within distance.’ But when the pair arrived on February 21, they were told the motel was booked out despite Mrs Best having a 'full confirmation' receipt as proof when they went to check in. 'The guy at reception looked confused and said there was no booking for Lucy Best,' Mrs Best said. 'He then gave me a book of motels in the area and told me I should call around. 'I was devastated and it was our first night out together without our two-year-old son since May 2014 so it was rewarding but I ended up in tears trying to find accommodation.' The photo advertised by Epsom Motor Inn doesn't appear to add up, according to previous guests . Kel K who stayed at the motel with his wife recently said his room had 'wet carpet with a light fur of mould on it' (left) and 'unfinished repair in the bathroom' (right) Another guest, KarolynTimarkos, said the motel should 'invest in exit mould' after staying in an 'unclean' room (left) and old rubbish left behind by previous guests . The 29-year-old said she spent the next few hours scouring through the phone book but the couple had no luck. 'I called every motel, hotel and hostel - while trying not to sob over the phone but every single one said they were fully booked out because of the concert in town,' Mrs Best said. 'We ran out of time because we had to meet up with some friends who had flown in from the UK and then it was time to head to the gig. 'My husband bought some bath towels and we agreed it was looking likely we were to sleep in the truck.' The couple found a quiet cul-de-sac and camped inside their four-wheel-drive overnight. ‘It was the worst night’s sleep I’ve ever had,’ Mrs Best said. ‘I am half way through pregnancy and my husband is 1.8 metres tall. ‘There isn't enough words to describe the anger and upset I felt as it totally ruined what should've been an exciting and happy weekend. ‘To get no offer of help was disgusting, having worked in customer support myself I was in shock. ‘But I do feel like I’ve dodged the bullet after reading those horrible reviews on Trip Advisor.’ Mrs Best said she was left in tears after spending hours trying to find another accommodation but had no luck . Motel manager Richie Chen told Daily Mail Australia he feels 'terribly sorry' for Mrs Best and has offered 'free of charge' accommodation. 'We've done what we could,' Chen said . 'Something went wrong on our website and it was something I couldn't fix. I couldn't just ask someone to move out and give the room to her - we don't work like that. 'She was never charged when she made the booking but we have already provided her a complimentary - free of charge accommodation - so everything will be paid for. 'I'm not in a position to comment on the condition of the motel but all I can say is I've done what I can as a manager.' An Auckland Council spokesman told Daily Mail Australia there were no records of complaints but the council will be investigating the motel. The 29-year-old mother said it was the first time in almost a year to spend quality time with her husband Gary .

"Everyone who meets Brian Maixner is greeted with a huge laugh and an even bigger smile. Only the waiter and single dad from Wichita, Kansas, has struggled with dental issues since he was a child, after chipping one of his front teeth lead to a series of infections that he has never been able to get on top of. It was something that struck Fred Boettcher, an attorney from Oklahoma, who was in town catching up with his daughter at the Doo-Dah Diner, where Maixner works. 'I took one look at this young man and knew he was something special,' Boettcher told KWCH 12. 'He carried himself with such kindness and confidence with a mouth that looked painful. I was struck by that.' Problem: Waiter Brian Maixner has suffered severe dental decay across his mouth since he was a child, but could not afford to have it fixed . Ongoing issues: Maixner, a single father, said his dental problems started when he chipped a front tooth at a child, leading to a variety of other issues he hasn't been able to afford to get fixed . Boettcher decided he wanted to help Maixner, who was until that point a complete stranger. He went over and spoke to Maixner's manager, and told her he was leaving behind a $25,000 tip to help him get a new set of teeth. 'This man doesn't know me and this is something I could never afford to do for myself,' Maixner said, admitting he burst into tears when his manager told him the news. 'It touched me so much that he cared.' The grand gesture came at no surprise to Boettcher's daughter. 'Dad gives so much, I remember him buying groceries for people in need when we were growing up,' Meredith Boettcher Young said. New reason to smile: Last week Maixner underwent a number of procedures and now has a whole new set of teeth, thanks to the generosity of a random customer . Overjoyed: 'This has been a complete life changer,' Brian Maixner said of his new chompers . Kind-hearted: Fred Boettcher was visiting his daughter Meredith (pictured together) in Wichita when he noticed Maixner and decided he wanted to help . Before: Brian Maixner had always been self-concious of his smile, growing up with teeth problems that had lasted well into adulthood, but that has changed thanks to customer Fred Boettcher (left) New man: After years of painful dental problems, Brian Maixner got thousands of dollars of work done on his teeth—all without paying a penny, thanks to a generous diner who wanted to help . Maixner has since undergone a number of procedures and now has a complete new set of top front teeth. The dental work has changed his life, he says, with friends, family and regular customers shocked at the difference it has made. However no one seems happier about what happened than the person responsible, Boettcher. No matter what religion you might be or whether you even believe in an after life the way to be satisfied in your life is to be kind to everybody and be as generous as you possibly can be,"" Boettcher said. 'As happy as that fella may be it feels so much better to be able to put a smile on his face.'","Brian Maixner is a single dad and waiter from Wichita, Kansas .

"Customers of internet service provider iiNet say unlimited access to  Netflix has slowed their internet connection since its launched in Australia last week. iiNet says on-demand streaming service Netflix now accounts for 15 per cent of its consumer traffic, thanks to a partnership that allows customers to watch as much Netflix content as they like without it counting towards their monthly data quota. But iiNet said any problems with internet connections were not being caused by the rise in Netflix users, instead blaming slow speeds on disruptions to the Telstra network, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Customers of iiNet say unlimited access to Netflix has slowed their internet connection since the on-demand streaming service launched in Australia last week . Customers took to Twitter to express their frustration at slow internet speeds. 'Uggggh Internet has been unusable in the last few days. Yay for unmetered Netflix @iiNet but also thanks for the congestion,' one user wrote. Another posted: 'So #Netflix is 1/7 of iiNet's traffic. Helps explain why Internet slowness is even more s***ty than usual.' But iiNet chief David Buckingham said any slow speeds customers were experiencing were due to issues with Telstra's copper network. 'We are having countless mass service disruptions on the Telstra copper network right now, so it might be people caught up in those who are commenting,' Mr Buckingham told the Herald. Telsyte senior tech analyst Rodney Gedda said it was possible that the Netflix launch had hit iiNet's internet speeds. Netflix will stream season three of its original series Orange is the New Black when it premieres on June 12 . 'That sounds like a bit of buck passing by iiNet,' Mr Gedda told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is possible that iiNet is feeling the heat of the Netflix launch. 'Because it's a new service in the local market and has attracted a lot of publicity, the more people that subscribe puts more load on the network.' Telstra spokesman Steven Carey said the company could not  comment on the performance of the iiNet network or any congestion it may be experiencing. 'iiNet is responsible for the end-to-end management of their network and iiNet customers need to contact them if they are experiencing problems,' Mr Carey told Daily Mail Australia. 'A ""mass service disruption"" refers to a fault on the copper line, not the kind of congestion on a network that it is being reported iiNet is experiencing.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted iiNet for comment.

"Netty Edwards, 46, was left distraught after being told she had to drop out of the Spen 20 Race in Spenborough, West Yorkshire, for being 'too slow' A keen runner who has completed a host of charity races and half-marathons was forced to quit a 20-mile race after just 1.4 miles because marshals told her she was 'too slow'. Netty Edwards, 46, was left distraught after being told she had to drop out of the Spen 20 Road Race in Spenborough, West Yorkshire, because the race 'wasn't for people like her' and that marshals wouldn't wait for her to finish. The race organisers, Spenborough & District Athletics Club, had not specified a cut-off time for the race in its terms and conditions, but the mother was apparently told to stop despite running at a pace of 12 minutes per mile. If she had been able to complete the race, she would've finished in four hours if she had remained at the same pace. Mrs Edwards, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, who runs to work every day and has a host of medals from previous races she has completed - including the Great North West Half Marathon - was left in tears at the decision. She immediately took to social media to vent her frustration, writing: 'Well this a first… 1 and a half miles in and pulled off the course for being too slow lead marshal says his team r not to stay out as long as it's going to take me !!!!! (sic). 'He cycled up to me and says u r way behind u r far too slow. It's not for ppl like u (sic).' She later posted a photograph of all the medals she has previously received from completing races alongside the message: 'Well they might not be fast times but all well and truly earned… didn't soddin want ye medal anyway #Spen20 (sic).' She claims a marshal cycled up to her as she approached the 1.5 mile stage of the race on Sunday and told her to stop. The race, which had up to 400 entrants, costs £11 to enter. Hundreds of people have now taken to social media to condemn the race organisers and support Mrs Edwards – who is a keen charity runner. Paula Wilson said: 'She was told to stop running as she was too slow 12min mile pace. I wouldn't say was slow.' Sarah Hamilton said: 'I'm so mad on #NettyEdwards behalf. #ThisGirlCan & this girl should've been left alone to get on with her run. Shame on you #SpenboroughAC.' And Sarah Browne added: '#Spen20 horrible treatment of the awesome #nettyedwards today & so discouraging to anyone 'slow'. Boo.' The mother took to Facebook to vent her frustration after allegedly being told by a race organiser that she was 'too slow' at 12 minutes per mile and that race marshals wouldn't wait for her to complete the race . The keen runner posted a photograph on Facebook of all the medals she has received by completing races over the years (pictured), including several for charity races and the Great North West Half Marathon . Mrs Edwards said the pace shouldn't matter and that it is the taking part that counts. She said she runs to and from work every day in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and has previously raised money for charity by running . However, despite the support, one racegoer and organiser responded by claiming it is standard practice to pull people from the race if they are too slow. Ian Ogden replied to Mrs Edward's post online and said: 'I believe you were aware that you could start earlier but decided not to it is standard practice for race organisers to withdraw marhsalls at a cut-off point 12/13 min miling as a RUNNER that has done many distance races you must be aware of this. (sic).' He followed it up with another post which said: 'Thanks for all the publicity you have created for our fantastic event. 'Netty I'm sure it will ensure our race goes from strength to strength and you will be welcome back next year now that you are aware that starting early is the best option by the way we are a really friendly club that caters for all abilities (sic). Frank Reddington, of Spenborough & District Athletics Club which organised the Spen 20 Race, said: 'I am sorry that the day was spoiled for Annette. 'The race is a well established mainly club runners event and while we are accommodating a level of slower runners who enter, we do not have the resources to facilitate people who do not have a reasonable level of fitness to take part in this race.' Mr Reddington confirmed that Mrs Edwards had her entry fee refunded.","Netty Edwards forced to quit Spen 20 Race in Yorkshire for being 'too slow'

"More than 300 former students of a prestigious high school have signed an open letter demanding that an invitation for federal cabinet minister Scott Morrison to speak at a fundraising event is withdrawn. Published in full on the blog of former student Danny Yau, the petition is addressed to Sydney Boys High School's Old Boys Union which is asked to 'immediately rescind the invitation so as to spare the organisation, and the school itself, the embarrassment of being seen to celebrate the achievements of a man who has so flagrantly disregarded human rights'. The former Immigration Minister is scheduled to attend the cocktail fundraiser on April 15 as a guest speaker. Over 300 former students of the prestigious Sydney Boys High School have demanded for Scott Morrison's invitation to speak at the school's fundraiser be withdrawn . He and a number of other former students will present speeches which reflect on 'how their lives were shaped by their experiences at Sydney Boys High School,' the invitation reads. It adds that the $75 ticket fee will 'go towards the construction of the Governors' Centre and to support the on-going activities of the Old Boys Union'. However Mr Morrison's possible attendance has enraged some former students of the school who deplore his role in advocating Australia's detention centres. 'In his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Morrison was at best complicit, and at worst the chief protagonist, in advocating offshore immigration detention policies that violate the United Nations Convention against Torture,' the letter reads. The open letter, signed by the Old Boys and addressed to the Old Boys Union, slammed the former Immigration Minister's role in advocating Australia's detention centres . Sydney Boys High School: 'Immediately rescind the invitation so as to spare the organisation, and the school itself, the embarrassment of being seen to celebrate the achievements of a man who has so flagrantly disregarded human rights,' it read . It goes on to say that despite the signatories supporting 'free political discourse, dissent and contrasting opinions', this matter 'is not a question of restricting freedom of speech, but instead reflects the desire not to tacitly endorse the actions of a man who has demonstrated callous disregard for human rights. 'It is cruel and insensitive for the Union to laud this man's connection to the school, its graduates, and their families.' The petition mentions the UN's and the Australian Human Rights Commission's condemnation of Australia's Regional Processing Centres which have been found to violate the human rights of asylum seekers. Amongst those who signed the letter were former Supreme Court judge Hal Wootten (right), renowned journalist and documentary maker John Pilger (left) and about 30 former Sydney Girls High School students . 'We note that the Convention against Torture proscribes torture as an international crime, and calls on all signatory states to prosecute or extradite individuals who have directly perpetrated or otherwise authorised torture,' it adds. Amongst those who signed the letter were former Supreme Court judge Hal Wootten, renowned journalist and documentary maker John Pilger and about 30 former Sydney Girls High School students. Mr Morrison's response to the highly critical petition was to assure he would not politicise the fundraiser. 'Everyone is entitled to their opinion, including those I disagree with. That is what I learnt at Sydney Boys High School,' he said, according to Fairfax.","Open letter demands for the federal minister's invitation to be revoked .

"If it were possible for anything to be hot in Buffalo this winter, it was the newfangled 'ice bikes' that debuted at an outdoor skating rink. The bicycles on ice skates were an immediate hit when they glided onto the Ice at Canalside the day the new rink opened on the city's waterfront. Since that December day, the bundled riders who have ignored breath-taking cold to rent them have convinced inventor Lisa Florczak that she's onto something. That, and the inquiries from several other cold-weather cities in Wyoming, Michigan, Minnesota and Canada interested in rolling them out next year. Scroll down for video . Lisa Florczak (pictured) came up with her version of the ice bike after seeing on the Internet that the contraptions were used in Beijing . 'I had no idea if this would work or how people would respond,' Ms Florczak said on a recent afternoon as some Parkinson's patients tested the bikes for their exercise potential. 'I thought I might end up being the laughingstock of the city.' Instead, she is relishing being part of Buffalo's efforts to revitalize its waterfront and draw people year-round, even when the Lake Erie breeze is something more endured than enjoyed. The bikes give even nonskaters a chance to try out the ice, along with the warm nuts, hot cocoa and craft beer sold at nearby kiosks. Florczak's family business, Water Bikes of Buffalo,  rented pontoon bikes that let riders pedal the Buffalo River in warmer months. Then economic development officials put out a call for ideas for the 33,000-square-foot ice rink being built nearby on a recreation of the Erie Canal. 'They said the ice is going to be pretty large, and they thought they might need something more than just skating,' Ms Florczak said. Curling, hockey and broomball leagues emerged. 'I thought: `What a perfect opportunity to go from water biking to ice biking,' Ms Florczak said. The 26-inch bikes work with a dull blade in the front and a rectangular base attached to an ordinary bike frame . The inventor had looked up 'things to do on ice' on the Internet and saw that bikes that ride on ice were already being used in Beijing, she told The Boston Globe. She bought a bike off the rack at Wal-Mart and worked with General Welding and Fabricating in Elma on a design. The bikes had to be sturdy, not tip and co-exist with ice skaters. Prototype testing showed that sharper blades, like on ice skates, were too fast, as were flat blades that worked like a ski. The finished product is a 26-inch bike that sits on a rectangular base with a duller blade replacing the front wheel. While originally scared that the bikes would damage the ice, Ms Florczak told The Buffalo News 'The rink guards said they did as much to the ice as a 5-year-old would do while ice skating.' Stainless steel so they don't rust in the snow, the contraptions ride like a regular bicycle, only without the need to balance. Riders brake by pedaling backward. 'It's pretty neat,' said Dave Wolf, of East Amherst, after giving a bike a spin. 'They take a little getting used to. No sharp turns.' 'But once you get used to it, it's a pretty nice ride.' Ms Florczak said there were hours-long waits for the bikes during a warm December and riders have persisted despite a  frigid and snowy winter in Buffalo . Mr Wolf, who has Parkinson's disease, said he rides a three-wheel bike in the nice weather and likes the idea of a winter alternative. The inaugural year had 15 bikes on the ice on weekends only, with riders paying $10 for a half-hour turn. Ms Florczak said there were hours-long waits for the machines during a warm December. Riders have persisted despite a winter that has seen nine daily records broken for low temperatures. Friday was the 60th day in a row that there was at least an inch of snow at Buffalo International Airport and the 30th of a snowpack of at least 20 inches. Soon ice bikers may be able to outfit their own bikes to ride on the abundant ice. There are plans to sell kits that will let people convert a cycle for about $1,500 and the company is hoping for orders from other cities will make for a busy 'offseason.' Ice Bikes of Buffalo, the name Florczak chose for the venture, is laser-cut into the running board. It was important, she said, that her city get its due if the bikes took off. She also wants to keep production local, after seeing relatives lose jobs during Buffalo's economic struggles. 'It's been,' she said, 'an incredible ride so far.'

"An explosive text message sent by the treasurer of the federal Liberal Party referred to Tony Abbott's chief of staff as a 'horsewoman of the Apocalypse' as he urged for her to be dumped. The string of text messages from party treasurer Philip Higginson were sent to a senior Liberal figure last year about staffer Peta Credlin and leaked to the ABC's Four Corners. Mr Higginson, who urged his Liberal colleague to 'negotiate the removal' of the PM's chief of staff, sent the messages during a dispute over annual accounts with Ms Credlin's husband and Liberal Party federal director, Brian Loughnane. Scroll down for video . The string of text messages from party treasurer Philip Higginson were sent to a senior Liberal figure last year about staffer Peta Credlin and leaked to the ABC's Four Corners . 'I'm refusing to sign the 2013/14 accounts... it has brought... the Horsewoman of the Apocalypse out of her den as you can image (sic). Black robes flowing. Stay tuned for the hatchet job on me... it's hurting me just mainly watching the party suicide,' Mr Higginson wrote. 'I do hope you can negotiate the removal of Credlin. That would be a huge win in itself.' Liberal sources believe the dispute was involved in the Prime Minister's leadership crisis this year. Mr Higginson signed the party accounts in February, but wrote emails to the Liberal Party executive in which he described Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane's relationship as a 'conflict of interest'. Mr Higginson was considered a good friend of Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he sent the text messages late last year urging for the chief of staff to be dumped . Mr Higginson urged his Liberal colleague to 'negotiate the removal' of the PM's chief of staff Peta Credlin and referred to her as the 'Horsewoman of the Apocalypse' He wrote that 'how this party ever let a husband and wife team into those roles' was beyond him, and that their relationship was causing dysfunction and 'wooden and unreliable communication'. Mr Abbott downplayed the emails at the time saying the leak was a 'storm in a teacup'. He restated his confidence in the power couple. He pointed out that Mr Loughnane has been the federal director for 12 years and Ms Credlin has occupied a series of senior positions for various ministers and party leaders. 'So if this is a problem, it's been a problem for 10 years. In fact it is no problem,' Mr Abbott told told Macquarie Radio. But Four Corners has revealed the issue led to Mr Abbott and Mr Higginson having a heated meeting before Christmas. The Prime Minister wouldn't comment on the meeting, according to the program. Mr Higginson sent the messages during a dispute over annual accounts with Ms Credlin's husband and Liberal Party federal director, Brian Loughnane (pictured) Ms Credlin has been credited by disgruntled coalition backbenchers, 39 of whom voted for a spill in February, as one of the problems with Mr Abbott's leadership. Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop says the latest internal party leaks are damaging and should stop. 'It's always unfortunate if there are leaks to the media that are damaging in any political party,' she said. 'Anything of that nature is obviously most unfortunate and shouldn't be said.'","Liberal party treasurer Philip Higginson sent explosive text messages to senior Liberal figure about staffer Peta Credlin .

"A major player in online travel has finally 'fallen into line' by removing excess credit card charges two years after the Royal Bank of Australia ruled that surcharges should be limited to ‘reasonable costs’. Online booking agent Wotif confirmed they are dumping their $5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $20 million dollars back into the pockets of Australian consumers. They are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $9.95 per person. Wotif have dumped excess booking fees which could save Australians $20 million a year . While Wotif has been praised for the move, consumers who expected to see a drop in prices  may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent, reported Newscorp. Tom Godfrey thinks there needs to be a regulatory body to stop companies from charging exorbitant prices for using a credit card or booking online . Tom Godfrey from CHOICE told Daily Mail Australia that an increase in commission prices could be an effort to further 'fleece' customers in a bid to offset losses from dropping the controversial credit card fees. Wotif said the change is not a bid to recoup costs lost by the surcharge but a reflection on their recent acquisition by competing company Expedia. Mr Godfrey said the rise in commission will increase up front costs of travel however the removal of the credit card surcharging is win for consumers and a clear warning to other companies who continue to ‘flout’ the ban on excessive charges. ‘It’s great to see consumers unite to drive change because it sends clear signal to businesses that we aren't happy.’ He said excessive credit card charges are costing Australian’s over a billion dollars a year, with some of the ‘worst offenders’ being Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin and Tiger. ‘People are sick and tired of being ripped off by the top end of town,' he said. Klaus Bartosch, the business man responsible for an anti surcharge petition that's been signed by over 100,000 people, welcomes the change and agrees this move puts more pressure on other major players to respond to 'consumer sentiment' by removing 'outrageous fees'. 'No where else in the world does this exist,' he said. Mr Bartosch started an online petition to stop airlines and travel companies from taking advantage of consumers by charging 'ridiculous' amounts for using credit cards . Mr Bartosch said prices are 'misleading' and not an accurate reflection of what businesses are actually paying to use credit cards. 'They are just plucking these figures from their backsides to rip of consumers,' he told Daily Mail Australia. CHOICE recently released a report that shows merchants are only paying around 0.8 per cent for Visa and Mastercard and 2 per cent for prestige cards like America Express and Diners Club. According to the latest research data made available by MasterCard, Australian consumers are being surcharged about $1.6 billion each year. Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar and Virgin continue to flout the ban on excessive credit card surcharges . Mr Bartosch believes these numbers prove that Australian's are facing excessive surcharges and that companies 'can not be trusted to self regulate'. CHOICE have also called for a regulator who have explicit legal power to limit credit card surcharges. According to Mr Godfrey excessive surcharging needs to be regulated by a body with the power to demand evidence of fair pricing and subsequently enforce significant penalties for non compliance. 'For too long hotels and airlines have been thumbing their nose at the government and there needs to be a regulatory body who have more power to enforce the ban,' Mr Godfrey said.","Wotif have removed a controversial $5.50 credit card surcharge .

"Skeletal remains were discovered on Saturday as workers cleared a makeshift homeless community called 'tent city' in Fort-Worth, Texas.

A group of around 50 homeless people evacuated a camp set up behind some bushes and trees in Fort Worth where they built meager homes in which to live. After numerous complaints from neighboring residents about the impoverished group's decision to camp on private property, the city destroyed the campsite on Saturday and the inhabitants left. Town officials previously expressed the desire to eradicate prostitution and drug problems in the area that may be worsened by homelessness, reports the Star Telegram. David Miller told The Star Telegram that he will have to move the small home he built for himself that includes a bedroom, a closet space, windows, and a fluffy white cat named Chamuka. 'I just go by what they say,' Miller said of the city’s plans. 'I know of places I can go. That’s why I’m not really worried. I’m not worried at all. I’ll go somewhere. I’m not going to go too far when I go — no further than what I can carry in a couple bags of clothes without getting too tired.'

The city gave the homeless residents verbal notice that they needed to leave six weeks ago. They also offered some help by bringing in aid to connect the people with programs and shelters, Brandon Bennett, the city’s director of code compliance, told the Star Telegram. Amy Bernoski Ebnet, founder of a nonprofit called Rita's Hope said that destroying camps merely moves homeless people instead of addressing then problem of homelessness. 'What is going to happen on March 28, of moving the property these individuals have and putting it in dumpsters and then giving them nowhere to go, is not a solution to homelessness. That just continues to move a problem,' Ebnet said. 'And when I say moving them, I don’t mean relocating them. I mean knocking over their stuff and having them go find somewhere else to live.' Brandon Bennett, the city’s director of code compliance said the living outdoors is not the bestc solution for the homeless population. Moving areas: Jackie Webb makes preparations to leave a homeless tent camp, taking all his worldly possessions with him in shopping carts . Change: Jackie Webb, pictured inside his tent with his dog, left the campsite on Saturday along with 49 others . 'We are pushing these folks toward the services and the lifestyle that will break the chains that will get them out of homelessness,' Bennett said, adding that they are 'managing' the problem, not moving it. 'I was down there and watched a young girl exchange sex for money — prostitution is not a way out of homelessness. We are going down there and people are doing drugs and drinking — that is not a way out of homelessness,' Bennett said. 'They are not getting the medical services they need to have a healthy lifestyle — that is not getting out of homelessness.' Bennett said in some ways that the property owner is the victim when homeless people set up camp because he had to pay for part of the destruction. 'To a big degree, he is a victim,' Bennett said. 'These people trespassed on his property, littered on his property and destroyed parts of property. I’m sorry they are homeless, but there are a lot of services available to these folks, and I encourage them to take part in the process.' Fort Worth cleans up about 100 camps a year and the city cleans around 68,000 pounds of trash from the campsites. Residents are given a few days to claim their belongings.

"Lord Mandelson feared he would have to break in to 10 Downing Street after civil servants told him it would be inappropriate for him to be seen entering the front door after the last Election. Gus O'Donnell, the then Cabinet Secretary, told the Labour peer it would be wrong for senior Labour aides to been seen entering No10 while talks were still ongoing about which political party would form the next Government.

"The classic advice was given to me first by no less a figure than Dame Barbara Cartland — then aged 90 — at one of her bizarre lunches to launch yet another romantic novel. She was busy rattling off a roster of men who had proposed to her over the decades, when she broke off and fixed a skinny guest with her gimlet eye. ‘After 40,’ she told me, ‘a woman has to choose between her face and her figure. My advice is, keep a lovely, plump pretty face, and stay sitting down.’ Scroll down for video . Former model and actress Candice Bergen, 68, admits in her recent memoir that food is fun, and that it is ridiculous and sad to vomit or starve to stay stick-thin . Then she took to a chair to demonstrate, in a froth of princess-pink tulle from which her elaborately painted face rose in triumph. As she got up again and started working the room, distributing souvenir gold-leaf acorns from her garden and finishing the list of long-deceased suitors — the object of her remarks, a skinny fellow journalist, scowled and fiddled with her lettuce. I — past 40 by then — smiled my chubbiest, most complacent smile. It’s not often my tribe get our bums and faces validated over those of grumpy glamazons. In Bergen's (pictured in the 1960's) memoir she merrily admits to putting on more than 2st over the past 15 years . Now, that face-and-figure tip has been reiterated by Candice Bergen, former model, actress and Oscar nominee, whose memoir A Fine Romance will be published soon. In it, 68-year-old Bergen merrily admits that over the past 15 years she has put on more than 2st. ‘I am a champion eater. No carb is safe,’ she joshes. Food is fun, she believes, and it is ridiculous and sad that her contemporaries either starve or vomit in secret to stay stick-thin. Bergen sounds a riot, just the girl for a grand night out. She also sounds — and here’s the key — confident and sexy. None of that weird, skeletal, Sarah Jessica Parker or Victoria Beckham vibe for her, nor that gristly, hard-body Madonna look, all abs and biceps. Oscar nominee Candice Bergen (pictured) is confident, sexy and fun, despite putting on more than 2st over the last 15 years . Her brand of femininity, which is shared by domestic goddess Nigella Lawson, is a bounce and a grin, a wink and a cuddle. The buxom woman’s image may not suit the gay-dominated fashion industry or the anxious self-hating celebrity circuit, but children (and, frankly, most men) gravitate towards the comfortable female form. Both have an entirely natural instinct to bond with a female who seems fun, comfy, confident and able to enjoy her food. Bergen and Nigella's healthy, curvy figures differ from the tiny frames of celebs such as Victoria Beckham (pictured) and Sarah Jessica Parker . Indeed, scientists lately delighted us with news that the particular sort of fat on the female backside is rather special. It is vital for the formation of the healthy foetal brain in pregnancy. So any cheek from your teenage offspring, and you can riposte: ‘Your brain is made out of my bum! Ha ha ha!’ Before the health-police start pursing their lips, I hastily say that by ‘buxom’ and ‘comfortable’ I absolutely do not mean obese. There is a clear line to be drawn between the chub of the healthy and vigorous middle-aged and the vast jelloid spread of the clinically obese. Domestic goddess Nigella Lawson (pictured) has a curvy figure and a healthy face, she shares her fun, comfortable brand of femininity with former model Candice Bergen . This is not about those sad whale-forms who wheeze and waddle and risk diabetes; who can’t fit in train or plane seats. Of course, serious obesity needs help, or in the last desperate resort, gastric-band surgery. But that is quite different from the 2st-above-model-weight which Candice Bergen is talking about. We all know perfectly well when we are ladling on the lard in the wrong places: if sensible, we take action. There are times — post-pregnancy, doing double-duty as a working mum or just imprisoned by sedentary work and depression — when women (and men) cross the line. But we do know inwardly when that point is. That is quite different, though, from the neurotic, bulimic daily anxiety of struggling to be unnaturally thin, too skinny for your natural metabolism. Of course, some wiry women stay very slim all their lives without giving it a second thought. It can be very annoying for cautious eaters to see these lucky freaks piling into the pies with no apparent effect. Others enjoy engaging in such ferocious sports that they rarely put on an ounce. Actress Sarah Jessica Parker (pictured) sports a skinny, skeletal figure, similar to that of Victoria Beckham. But Libby Purves says there's nothing wrong with some extra weight and curves . But what about the rest of us? As long as we walk our 10,000 steps a day, eat lots of veg, swim or bike or Zumba and can nip upstairs and sprint for a bus, there’s no problem with a bit of extra round the bum. Or in having (shock!) a stomach which is not concave, or thighs which occasionally meet. The upside, as Cartland and Bergen remind us, is that a woman’s face doesn’t become haggard so quickly; her skin stays peachy and she won’t have that mean, cool, pinched, starved-weasel look so common on the social pages. Rather, she exudes a contented, cheerful aura of enjoying life. She does not carry the quivering paranoia of one who is frightened of knives and forks, or sit with an agonised, tense expression in restaurants sipping mineral water and pretending not to be hungry. It’s about confidence. That’s what makes many happy, rounded, smiling women attractive. The morbidly obese aren’t confident — how could they be? But neither are those for whom every morsel, every pinch-of-an-inch, every dress size above 8 is a source of self-loathing. They have been conditioned to think they have no real right to take up space, and must keep a vulnerable adolescent skinniness all their lives. They fear food. We can see here one memorable movie scene where Bridget Jones has her curves on display as she arrives at a garden party dressed as a bunny . A lovely moment in the Bridget Jones’s Diary movie is when she is counting calories and someone says: ‘Don’t you need 1,200 or something just to live?’ And she realises it had never occurred to her before that food was actually necessary. It was, to her, just a reprehensible addiction. But you can’t go cold-turkey on food, so what you need is a cheerful relationship with it and your body. And if, as life goes on, some of nature’s bounty settles as padding on your healthy active body, so what? It’s certainly nobody else’s business. One of the most irritating eras in journalism was when Sarah Ferguson was first married, long before she blotted her copybook. The papers sneered ‘Duchess of Pork’ and laughed at her broad-bottomed, bouncing shape, so far from Diana’s fragile, bulimic slenderness. However, young Sarah was active: a rider, a black-run skier, a sexy, larky happy girl. Nothing wrong with her except an unfashionable shape. Has she looked better, happier, jollier in her skinnier after-years? I think not. Papers were cruel to brand active Sarah Ferugson 'Duchess of Pork' (pictured) in response to her broad-bottomed, bouncing shape . So hurrah for Candice Bergen and her rollicking attitude to life. She looks great. I find myself humming an Irish ditty we used to sing in the pubs of West Cork, with the chorus: ‘For she’s a great big shtout lump of an agg-er-i-cultural Irish girl. She neither paints nor powders and her figure is all her own…’ The last line rises triumphantly with a cry of ‘The full of your arms of Irish love — is Mary Ann Malone. Whoopee!’ And I will bet Mary Ann Malone had a gorgeous, peachy, Irish face and the comfiest of backsides. Good for her.","Former model Candice Bergen admits she has put on 2st in 15 years .

"Jobless father-of-three Mario Bustamante-Leiva targeted City workers in London's bars, cafes and restaurants, stealing £21,000 worth of goods . One of London’s most prolific thieves has been jailed for three years after stealing £21,000 worth of phones, wallets and computers during a five-month crime spree. Jobless father-of-three Mario Bustamante-Leiva, 39, of no fixed address, wore a flat cap and a large overcoat even in the height of summer in order to conceal his pickings. The Chilean national trawled exclusive bars, restaurants and coffee shops looking for laptops, mobile phones, iPods and tablets. The Old Bailey heard in one case he even stole a bag containing an entire family’s passports and airplane boarding passes. Police have released CCTV footage which shows the brazen thief swipe an unsuspecting woman’s handbag from under her nose as she chats with a friend. Bustamante-Leiva can be seen hooking the bag with his foot before quickly leaving the cafe with the handbag tucked under his coat. He has now admitted 22 charges of theft between July and December 2014. Judge Christopher Morris QC branded Bustamante ‘dishonest to the fingertips’ as he sentenced him to three years in prison. The father-of-three was also sentenced to 12 months to be served concurrently for attempted burglary as he was convicted at Inner London Crown Court last November. Scroll down for video . His crime spree began in July 2014 in the City and his last offence was committed on November 28 2014, when he stole a bag and ipod at the ‘Counting House’ on Cornhill. City of London Police detectives identified him as a suspect in November 2014 after he stole a bag in Catch bar on Liverpool Street. Bustamante-Leiva was caught on CCTV snatching a woman's handbag as she sat in a London cafe . The footage shows him hooking his foot under the woman's chair in order to grab her handbag . As a result Crime Squad officers reviewed other similar crimes in the City and found that Bustamante-Leiva had also committed these offences. He was arrested on December 5 2014 when an officer spotted him entering ‘The Monument’ public house in the City, whilst listening to an iPod he had stolen from ‘The Counting House’ the previous week. ‘You are dishonest to your fingertips. Over a five month period you committed a series of thefts from the public, over that long period, to a total of some £21,000,’ the judge said. ‘Before you embarked upon that course of conduct, you had also committed the offence of attempted burglary. ‘I have no alternative, but to order that you be sent to prison.’ Bustamante-Leiva was arrested at the Monument pub in Fish Street Hill on December 5 whilst listening to an iPod he had stolen from The Counting House in Cornhill the previous week. ‘All counts relate to the theft of personal property from sandwich shops, bars and pubs in the City,’ said prosecutor Jennifer Newcomb. ‘He would enter the premises wearing a flat cap, large coat and backpack or large bag over his shoulder, even in the height of summer. ‘He would then stand or sit close to a person who had their bag on the floor or the back of a chair. Bustamante-Leiva then quickly ducks and grabs the bag after pulling it from underneath her chair . The footage shows him swiftly leaving the cafe as the unsuspecting woman continues to chat to a friend . ‘He would observe them and at an opportune moment remove the bag with his foot or the back of his hand. ‘After he obtained the bag he would hide it under his coat and leave the premises with the bag and its contents.’ Detective Sergeant David Morgan from the City of London Police said: ‘These crimes caused a massive inconvenience for the victims, along with anguish for the loss of both valuable and sentimental items, which far exceeds the financial cost of the thefts. ‘Although this thief is now behind bars we urge the public to be vigilant and look after their belongings when socialising in bars, coffee shops, restaurants and clubs. ‘If you witness any suspicious behaviour, please contact police immediately.’","Mario Bustamante-Leiva, 39, stole wallets and computers worth £21,000 .

"A business owner has been sentenced to two years in jail for setting his own shop on fire in Sydney's west. Chadi Jomaa, 38, was seen walking around outside the grocery shop before it caught alight in October 2013. In CCTV footage aired on 9News, the father-of-six is seen wearing a black hoodie, grey shorts and white sneakers as he drops something on the ground just moments before the building in Wentworthville explodes.

The materials he used to set the shop alight were petrol and a set of matches, The Daily Telegraph reported. A blinding light fills up the frame as chunks of debris is blown across the footpath and onto the street. Then a man - who lived in the apartment above the uninsured store - is shown crawling on his hands and knees to safety, narrowly escaping being buried beneath the rubble. But Jomaa was not so lucky.

"Tragic accident: Sgt Andrew Joseph Doiron of the Canadian special forces was killed Friday in Iraq. Kurdish peshmerga forces claim to have accidentally killed Doiron in a friendly fires incident, after mistaking him for an Islamic militant . A Canadian special forces soldier was killed in a friendly fire incident after he and others ignored an order to stay in their car and showed up to the front line unannounced, a spokesman for Iraq's Kurdish forces said Sunday. The death Friday of Sgt. Andrew Joseph Doiron marked Canada's first casualty as part of the U.S.-led coalition's war on the extremist Islamic State group. Canadian officials could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday on the peshmerga claim, though Canada's defense minister previously acknowledged Doiron's death came as a result of 'a case of mistaken identity.' Peshmerga spokesman Halgurd Hekmat said a group of Canadian soldiers showed up unannounced Friday to the village of Bashiq, in Iraq's Nineveh province near the militant-held city of Mosul. The area had seen heavy fighting against Islamic State militants the previous day. 'When they returned, the peshmerga asked them to identify themselves,' Hekmat told The Associated Press. 'They answered in Arabic, that's when peshmerga started shooting. It was their fault.' Hekmat added that he doesn't know why the Canadians were there. 'I consider it an improper action by the Canadians and illogical,' he said. Two Kurdish officials later told the AP that Doiron's body was flown to Canada early Sunday following a military ceremony at Irbil International Airport. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief journalists. Canada's defense department on Saturday announced the death of Doiron, a soldier in the Canadian Special Operations Regiment based at Garrison Petawawa, Ontario. Three other Canadian soldiers were wounded in the incident and are in stable condition, Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney said. Sgt Doiron and other soldiers were shot when they unexpectedly showed up at the front line in Bashiq, Iraq on Friday. Bashiq is located not far from the ISIS stronghold city of Mosul . Canada has 69 special forces soldiers with Kurdish peshmerga fighters in what the government calls an advising and assisting role. They were sent to help train Kurdish fighters last September in a mission that was billed as noncombat with the elite troops working far behind the front lines . The fact that Canadian special forces have been training and assisting on the front lines and directing airstrikes has stirred controversy in the country, but Kenney said the rules of engagement will remain the same. Kenney said Doiron's death had 'nothing to do with combat,' saying it was a case of mistaken identity on the part of Kurdish fighters at night. 'It was caused by a failure of identification. There will be an inquiry,' Kenney said. The Islamic State group currently holds a third of Iraq and Syria. The U.S.-led coalition began airstrikes targeting the extremists in August. So far, four other troops have been killed as part of the coalition, not counting Iraqi forces. They include a U.S. Marine presumed lost at sea in October, a Marine killed in a noncombat incident in Baghdad in October, a U.S. Air Force pilot killed in December when his jet crashed in Jordan and a captive Jordanian pilot burned to death in a cage by the Islamic State group.","Sgt Andrew Joseph Doiron of the Canadian special forces killed Friday .

"Probe: The IPCC is to investigate a retired officer's claims he was told to keep quiet about Cyril Smith (pictured) after seeing him at a sex party with two boys in Stockport in 1988 . The police watchdog is to examine claims that a paedophile sergeant ordered a junior officer not to tell anyone after catching Cyril Smith at a sex party with two boys. The account of the officer, then a young beat bobby but now retired, that he was threatened with the Official Secrets Act after he found the 29-stone Liberal MP at the home of a known sex offender in 1988 was the latest piece of evidence of an Establishment cover-up of Smith’s decades of abuse. Yesterday the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC) announced it would be overseeing the investigation into the unnamed ex-officer’s claims. He came forward earlier this month to describe how as a probationary officer he discovered Smith at the party with a prolific sex offender and two drunk teenage boys in Stockport. Smith and another officer in civilian clothes who was also present walked off, he said, while one boy left and the other was taken back to his children’s home. He claimed that the following day he was called to a meeting by a senior officer and Sergeant Don Mackintosh and told he would be breaching the Official Secrets Act if he ever told anyone. ‘In no uncertain terms I was told to say nothing,’ he said. ‘They knew Smith was there and knew who he was.’ Mackintosh was later exposed as a prolific abuser of young boys over more than a decade. He was found hanged in his home last year while facing fresh indecent assault allegations. The retired officer claimed that earlier this year he had an anonymous call from a man who warned him to ‘keep your mouth shut’. The allegation about Smith is already being investigated by Greater Manchester Police’s Operation Clifton which is looking at how previous reports of child sexual abuse were handled or allegedly covered up. But yesterday the IPCC said it would now ‘manage’ how the alleged incident in 1988 was investigated. ‘The IPCC’s involvement will ensure independent oversight of the investigation, while ensuring Greater Manchester Police’s wider ongoing criminal investigation is not affected,’ a spokesman said. Serial child abuser Smith, who was MP for Rochdale from 1972 to 1992 and died aged 82 in 2010, escaped possible prosecution at least eight times after orders were made at the highest level to cover up his crimes. The officer was pulled in by Sergeant Don Mackintosh, who turned out to be paedophile, left, who threatened him with the Official Secrets Act and told him to stay silent about his claims over Smith (right) Last year the Daily Mail exposed his pervert past when it serialised Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk’s book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith. It revealed Smith avoided police and court action for decades despite leaving a trail of victims. Most recently, the Mail revealed how a former chief constable of Lancashire was told in the late 1970s that an official at the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had asked his force to lie about past investigations into Smith. Mr Danczuk said: ‘I welcome the fact that the IPCC are investigating the possibility of a police paedophile cover-up. This incident suggests there could have been a paedophile network straddling both politics and the police.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Independent Police Complaint Commission to look into latest claims .

"A threat against President Barack Obama's niece, a player on Princeton's women's basketball team, prompted increased security at the Tigers' NCAA Tournament game at Maryland on Monday night. Leslie Robinson is a freshman forward for the Tigers. Her father, Craig Robinson, is the brother of first lady Michelle Obama. Scroll down for video . President Obama's niece, Leslie Robinson, was threatened on Monday before Princeton played Maryland . The freshman forward was not made aware of the threat before the game, but her coach did know about it . President Barack Obama sat beside his brother-in-law Craig Robinson (right) at Princeton's game on Saturday . Before the second round game began at the XFINITY Center in College Park, Maryland, a woman left an eight-minute voicemail for the Maryland athletic department claiming a man was driving around campus with a Glock handgun, USA Today reported. A person who spoke to the AP said the threat was taken seriously. After Monday's game, Princeton coach Courtney Banghart confirmed that she was aware of the threat before tipoff but  Robinson was not. Princeton lost to Maryland 85-70 on Monday, the Tigers' only defeat of the season. The Tigers forward did not appear in either of Princeton's NCAA Tournament games this season .

"A woman suing a prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firm in a high-profile case alleging gender bias testified on Tuesday that she did not reject the initial romantic advances of a male colleague and even discussed having children with him. Plaintiff Ellen Pao told jurors the colleague, Ajit Nazre, first approached her romantically during a trip to Germany after she had been struck by a cab. She was dazed from her injuries and couldn't object to his advances, she said. In court on Tuesday: Ellen Pao(left) leaves the courthouse during a lunch break from her trial in which she claimed her former colleague Ajit Nazre (right) made sexual advances after she was in a car accident . 'I got hit by a cab and then he tried to hit on me,' Pao said. Under further questioning by Lynne Hermle, an attorney for defendant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Pao said she and the co-worker eventually had an affair and she told him she loved him. Pao claims in her lawsuit that she was denied a promotion at the firm because of gender bias and then fired after she complained. Her lawsuit has spotlighted gender imbalance at elite Silicon Valley investment companies that are stacked with some of the nation's most accomplished graduates - multiple degree holders from schools such as Stanford and Harvard who are competing aggressively to back the next Google or Amazon. Women, however, are grossly underrepresented in the venture capital and technology sectors. Pao addressed that issue under questioning by her attorney, saying her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector. 'I've tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path,' she told jurors. 'I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists.' Improper treatment: Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao is suing her former employer, Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, for $16 million alleging she was sexually harassed by male officials . Pao was questioned for the first time by Hermle. Their exchanges were often tense, with Pao staring at the lawyer and pausing before responding yes or no. Hermle also showed emails to the jury in which Pao and the co-worker exchanged compliments and banter. In one email from 2006, after the affair began, Pao wrote that she was always looking out for Nazre- 'never stopped, never will.' In text messages that year, she said she didn't think he was a bad person and she wasn't mad at him for not being able to have a real relationship at the time. Pao previously testified that she began the affair after the colleague said his wife had left him. She said she broke it off several months later when she learned that was a lie. Gender equality: Ellen Pao, pictured on Tuesday, said her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector . After she ended the affair, Pao testified, the colleague retaliated by shutting her out of emails and meetings. When she raised the retaliation issue with management, a senior partner explained how he had met his wife at another company while he was married, and perhaps Pao could have the same outcome with her colleague, she testified. The firm did nothing about the retaliation, she said. When it came to Pao's application to work at Kleiner Perkins, Hermle talked about the job requirements. The position called for the candidate to have a sense of humor, be intelligent, analytical, thorough, and humble, reports Business Insider. 'You understand what humble means, Ms. Pao,' Hermle asked. 'Modest, not arrogant, someone who does not exaggerate their skills,' Pao answered. 'It would also include someone who does not think they’re better than their partners?' Hermle countered. Millions in damages: Ellen Pao, pictured on March 3 and on February 26, is seeking $16 million for discrimination and retaliation in a lawsuit against the firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers . Pao also told jurors that she had sought $10 million from the firm in exchange for voluntarily leaving, saying she believed the figure would prompt the firm to change its treatment of women. Pao did not receive the money and continued working at the firm. Her lawsuit seeks $16 million in damages. Pao said she made $400,000 a year, excluding bonuses, at Kleiner Perkins, and is making $170,000 a year, with a target bonus of $80,000, as interim CEO of Reddit, her current job. Pao, 45, said Kleiner Perkins repeatedly dismissed her attempts to open a discussion about gender bias and instead hired an antagonistic investigator to look into her complaint. Kleiner Perkins has denied wrongdoing and says Pao didn't get along with her colleagues and performed poorly as a junior partner. Pao was composed on the stand under questioning by her lawyer, even while discussing potentially emotional topics such as her firing. She said Steve Hirschfeld, an investigator hired by Kleiner Perkins to look into her complaint, did not appear open to what she had to say. 'It felt antagonistic,' she said. 'There were times I felt he was grilling me about answers I didn't have.' Hirschfeld eventually concluded that Pao had not been retaliated against and there was no gender discrimination at the firm. Pao said she filed her lawsuit after running out of ways to try to get her concerns addressed within the company. But afterward, partners stopped coming to her office to talk, and she received a poor performance review that caused her to nearly vomit, she said. She was told in October 2012 to pack up her belongings and leave the office, she said.","Ellen Pao is seeking $16million in a sex discrimination lawsuit against Silicon Valley company Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers .

Frist Ava asked Brock if he has ever been in love, then she explained that she hadn’t and asked him what it was that made him human. ‘What attracts you to me?’ asked Ava, sounding increasingly like an automated chatbot. The conversation ended with Ava telling Brock that he has ‘passed my test' and she invited him to visit her Instagram account. Unfortunately for Brock the @MeetAva account turned out to be just a promotional tool for the forthcoming sci-fi movie Ex Machina and it featured a photo and video promoting the film.

"George Osborne today handed a £3,000 boost to first time buyers to make it easier to get on the housing ladder. In his final Budget before the general election, the Chancellor announced a new 'help-to-buy ISA' only available to those yet to buy their first home. The new savings account will see the Government add £50 to every £200 which savers manage to put away towards a deposit. It will mean that anyone who saves £12,000 towards a deposit will have it topped up by £3,000. But critics said it will still take first-time buyers five years to save the cash by which time house prices will have soared by another £15,000. Scroll down for video . The new savings account will see the Government add £50 to every £200 savers manage to put away towards a deposit . Matt Hutchinson, director of the house share website SpareRoom, welcomed Mr Osborne's announcement - but said it might still not be enough. He said: 'At first glance, a handout of up to £3,000 from the Government for hopeful first time buyers looks too good to be true. 'But to get your maximum £3,000 bonus, with maximum monthly payments of just £200, you'll be saving for four and a half long years. By which time, prices will likely have risen again and a £15,000 deposit won't be enough.' The accounts will only be available for the next four years, but once they have been opened there will be no limit on how long people can save for. They will be available through banks and building societies this Autumn, with first time buyers  able to make an initial deposit of £1,000 when they open the account. There will be no minimum monthly deposit – but people will only be able to save up to £200 a month. The government has also capped the total bonus they will pay at £3,000. The Chancellor said the soaring size of deposits was making it harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder . According to Treasury documents released today, people outside London now need almost £30,000 for a deposit on their first home, while in London they need almost £70,000 . First-time buyers in London will be allowed to use the bonus to buy homes worth up to £450,000 - but for everyone else the ceiling will be £250,000. Unveiling the new savings accounts in the House of Commons this afternoon, Mr Osborne said they were needed because of the growing size of deposits. According to Treasury documents released today, first-time buyers in London now need almost £70,000 to get their first home. Outside London people need almost £30,000. Soaring house prices and tighter mortgage rules have made it harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder . Mr Osborne told MPs: 'The Help to Buy ISA for first time buyers works like this. For every £200 you save for your deposit, the Government will top it up with £50 more. It's as simple as this – we'll work hand in hand to help you buy your first home. This is a Budget that works for you. 'A 10 per cent deposit on the average first home costs £15,000, so if you put in up to £12,000 – we'll put in up to £3,000 more. 'A 25 per cent top-up is equivalent to saving for a deposit from your pre-tax income – it's effectively a tax cut for first time buyers. We'll work with industry so it's ready for this autumn and we'll make sure you can start saving for it right now.' The new accounts will be limited to only one person rather than one home – meaning couples can receive a double bonus. But the small print of the scheme reveals that people will not be able to use the bonus to buy properties abroad. The new ISAs were part of a raft of measures to help people's savings go further. The Chancellor said new rules would be introduced to stop people paying any interest on their savings. People will be able to make £1,000 of interest on their savings before any tax is applied. The move will take 95 per cent of people out of savings taxes. Workers will also be able to earn £11,000 before paying income tax at all.","George Osborne's move puts £3,000 in the pockets of first time buyers .

"Seventeen years after Oregon decided to become the first state to hold all elections with mail-in ballots, it took another pioneering step on Monday to broaden participation by automatically registering people to vote. Gov. Kate Brown signed a bill that puts the burden of registration on the state instead of voters. Under the legislation, every adult citizen in Oregon who has interacted with the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division since 2013 but hasn't registered to vote will receive a ballot in the mail at least 20 days before the next statewide election. The measure is expected to add about 300,000 new voters to the rolls. Eligible Oregonians will get postcards saying they've been registered and have three weeks to opt out. They'll automatically be registered as 'unaffiliated' but can select a political party on the postcard and return it to election officials through the mail. They can also choose to cancel their voter registration entirely. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed an automatic voter registration bill on Monday, March 16; Oregon has been holding elections by mail for 17 years . Oregon Republicans are already angry about the possibility for voter fraud – millions of ballots will be in mailboxes with limited control over what happens to them – along with the cost of implementing the measure and whether the DMV can ensure personal information remains secure. Information the DMV has on file, such as age, residential information, signature and citizenship status, will be transferred to the secretary of state, who will then automatically update registration information. But more than anything, Oregon's new law changes an 'opt-in' voting system to one where people can only choose to 'opt out.' 'It just changes expectations for who's responsible for making elections work,' said Barry Burden, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and director of the Elections Research Center. 'In every other state it's the responsibility for the voters to make sure it happens.' Some other states have considered such legislation but none has gone as far as Oregon. Minnesota nearly implemented automatic voter registration in 2009 before the plan was vetoed by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who said 'registering to vote should be a voluntary, intentional act.' Similar concerns were raised by Oregon's minority Republicans. 'Simply because it makes us unique or makes us first does not necessarily mean that it actually improves on what we're doing,' said state Sen. Jackie Winters, a Republican from Salem. When it came up for a vote in the state Senate last week, all Republicans and one Democrat voted against it. The Democrats hold a 18-12 advantage in the Senate so the bill easily passed. State Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, a Portland Democrat who carried the bill in the Senate, said there were rumblings the measure was a 'secret plot' to enroll more Democrats.  But she denied that was true. Oregon already has one of the highest voter registration rates in the nation — 73 percent of Oregonians were registered to vote and 70 percent of them cast ballots during the 2014 general election. Tony Green, spokesman for the secretary of state, said the legislation is expected to eventually capture all unregistered voters who are in the DMV database after taking actions such as obtaining or renewing a driver's license. Two years ago, when the measure was first proposed, Green said there were questions about whether the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division records were confidential under federal law. The legislative counsel determined the secretary of state and the division could share information as long as it was for legitimate government purposes, he said. Accidental governor: Brown's predecessor, John Kitzhaber, resigned after his fiancee was accused of using her influence with the governor to benefit clients of her eco-consulting company . Oregon's move will result in about 300,000 ballots being sent through the mail to people who will be automatically registered to vote . Automatic registration is not uncommon in other countries. A 2009 report by the Brennan Center for Justice says nations where the government takes the lead in enrolling voters have much higher registration rates. Argentina has a 100 percent registration rate, while Sweden, Australia and Canada all have registration rates over 90 percent. Myrna Perez, deputy director of the Brennan Center's Democracy Program, said a state needs to already have reliable agency records of eligible Americans who have demonstrated citizenship in order to successfully follow in Oregon's footsteps. Oregon only grants driver's licenses to people who can prove they're in the U.S. legally by presenting passports, birth certificates or other documents. David House, a spokesman for the Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division, has said the agency can separate citizens from noncitizens based on those documents. Oregonians were the first to see all-mail elections, and the state has since been followed by Washington state and Colorado. 'Oregon is a true leader in accessibility to voting and I challenge every other state in this nation to examine their policies and find ways to ensure there are as few barriers as possible in the way of the citizen's right to vote,' Brown said. Brown took office  last month after her predecesor john Kitzhaber resigned over ethics allegations involving his fiancee-adviser and a string of government contracts.","Ballots will be sent to about 300,000 new voters, whether or not they want them .

"A woman who appeared on NBC's weight-loss competition 'The Biggest Loser' has reportedly penned an expose on the hit reality show program.

Speaking out: Kai Hibbard (seen left and right) has reportedly penned an expose on'The Biggest Loser.' Hibbard finished as the runner-up during the show's third season . A source in the book industry told the Daily News 'The show didn't invent fat-shaming, but exploits it. Her proposal was so juicy. It has a bigger, more important message about weight and health.' According to the newspaper, Hibbard's book claims that 'The Biggest Loser' refused to purchase new underwear for contestants, whose underwear drooped as the pounds came off. The Daily News reported that alleged contestant hook-ups and remarks made by show trainers when the cameras aren't rolling are included in the book. A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment. Hibbard posted a link to the Daily News story on her Facebook page, writing 'Like most things reported in the media, this is *sort of* correct. I hope more than a ""tell all"" that when all is said and done it stands as a statement on the media, society and how shame is not a motivator but a paralytic from someone who has regretfully been there and done that.' Remarks: Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster' Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment. She recently told the New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in.' She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, ""You’re going die before your children grow up."" ""You’re going to die, just like your mother."" ""We’ve picked out your fat-person coffin"" - that was in a text message. One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised. The consistent ""Biggest Loser"" health transformations of over 300 contestants through 16 seasons of the program speak for themselves.'","Kai Hibbard, who appeared on NBC's weight-loss competition 'The Biggest Loser,' has reportedly penned an expose on the hit reality show program .

"A member of the Nebraska state legislature has compared police officers to Islamic terrorist group ISIS. State senator Ernie Chambers, a liberal-leaning independent from North Omaha, was speaking in Nebraska's unicameral capitol building when he said, 'My ISIS is the police.' The chamber was discussing a bill that would allow concealed weapons to be carried in bars when Chambers, 77, began talking about police violence and comparing law enforcement to extremists. Scroll down for video . Ernie Chambers, 77, a Democrat from North Omaha, said during a debate about a gun control measure that 'My ISIS are the police' (file photo) The state senator (above, in blue shirt) responded to statements from colleague Tommy Garrett (inset) that residents were afraid of ISIS by criticizing police and comparing them to the terrorist group . Senator Tommy Garrett, a sponsor of the bill, said that the measure was necessary because residents of Nebraska were afraid of terrorist groups, according to The Omaha World Herald. 'Nobody from ISIS ever terrorized us as a people as the police do daily,' Chambers said. 'The police are licensed to kill us,' he said. 'My home is not threatened by ISIS, mine is threatened by the police.' The senator, who is African-American, described instances of seeing police brutality against blacks. Though the liberal legislator said that he was a nonviolent person, he added that he would carry a weapon against police. 'If I carried a gun, I would want to shoot [a police officer] first and then ask questions later like they say the cop ought to do.' Members of the legislature spent hours criticizing the statements this week after they were picked up by conservative talk radio. Chambers caused further controversy when he was speaking about police and said, 'If I carried a gun, I would want to shoot him first and then ask questions later like they say the cop ought to do' (file photo) The legislator has faced numerous calls for an apology or resignation, including from US Representative from Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry (pictured, file photo) State Sen David Schnoor called for Chambers to resign, according to Watchdog.org. Republican legislature member Beau McCoy said he would ask for an apology every day and was later joined in the request . US Representative from Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry called for the legislature to censure Chambers. He said that 'condoning violence against police is reckless and contradicts the sacred duty of a lawmaker to protect society.' Despite widespread condemnation of his statements, Chambers refuses to back away from his remarks. 'I meant what I said and I said what I meant,' he said. 'I’m not going to resign,” he said. 'I’m not going to apologize.' Extra police troopers were stationed at the Nebraska capitol building on Thursday and Friday. Chambers has refused to back down from his statements about police and ISIS and said he would not resign or apologize . Last week's incident was not the first race-related controversy in recent Nebraska politics.

"A mother who didn't know she was pregnant is in shock after she gave birth down the toilet - for the second time. Stunned Kirsty Parker, 25, went to the loo with stomach pains but minutes later suddenly went into labour. Before she knew what was happening her 3lb 40z baby daughter Ruby had arrived - and landed in the toilet bowl. Kirsty Parker holds her baby Ruby in the hospital - the tiny tot was born into the toilet, however, it was not the first time as Kirsty also had her older daughter Amber in the same way . She fished the newborn out of the water and mother and baby are both doing well since the dramatic arrival. The unexpected birth came just nine months after her previous child Amber was born - also down the toilet. Kirsty had shown no signs of pregnancy apart from gaining a small amount of weight and feeling 'a little moody'. She was at her mother Angie Parker's home in Torrington, Devon, last week when Ruby, her second child, arrived in the lavatory. Kirsty said: 'I just thought I was coming down with a stomach bug. I had been having slight pains since around 2.30pm but I wasn't worried about them at all. 'It seemed to happen so quickly. One minute I was fine, and the next minute I had given birth to a baby down the toilet.' Kirsty with her family, L-R, Harry, Amber, Angie (Kirsty's Mum), Ronnie, Lee and Crystal - Amber was also born in the toilet and Crystal was born on the bathroom floor . Kirsty said she screamed for her Angie, to come upstairs and they both struggled to get the tiny baby out of the toilet before she was taken to hospital. She had previously given birth to Ruby's sister Amber down the toilet at her own home. Baby Ruby is in North Devon District Hospital in the special care baby unit as she weighs only 3Ib 4oz. Doctors believe she was ten weeks premature but she's doing well. Kirsty said: 'Who needs to go to hospital to give birth? I'm still in shock really. I think it's more that I just did not know I was pregnant. Tiny Ruby is being kept in the hospital as she only weighed 3lb 4oz at birth but she is currently doing well . Tiny Ruby is being looked after at the North Devon District Hospital in the special care baby unit . Kirsty's nine-month-old baby Amber was also born into the toilet but that time Kirsty knew she was pregnant . 'I'm religious when it comes to taking the pill daily and I didn't have any morning sickness. I had been a little moody beforehand but I just put that down to lack of sleep from having Amber.' When Kirsty told her partner Lee Wren on the phone what had happened he said he did not believe her. Lee, 34, said: 'I thought she was joking, it was just a complete shock.' Baby Ruby is sister to Kirsty's  daughter Crystal Stevenson, seven, Lee's two sons Harry, five, and Ronnie, four, and the couple's baby Ambe, nine months. Kirsty's mother said: 'It's all quite a shock but I think there are some things in life you can control and this is not one of them. Ruby was obviously just meant to be.' But it wasn't just Ruby and and Amber who were born in the bathroom. Kirsty has revealed that she also had Crystal on the bathroom floor of her mother's home. Adorable Ruby is said to be doing well as Kirsty continues to get over the shock that she was pregnant . Kirsty poses with her daughter Amber, her mother Angie who helped her with Ruby and her partner Lee's son Ronnie Wren . Kirsty said: 'As all my previous births have been in a bathroom - that is obviously just where I like to have my children. 'I had my first child Crystal who was born eight weeks early on the bathroom floor. That was a shock but I knew I was pregnant with her - and with Amber - but on neither occasion did I know I was in labour.' Kirsty said she did not have any morning sickness - and thought she had just struggled shifting the baby weight from Amber's birth nine months previously. She said: 'If I knew I was pregnant there are things I would have done differently. 'I would not have had any coffee or egg mayonnaise. I am very good when I am pregnant and fortunately I am not a very big drinker anyway. 'I did feel guilty about some of these things but both Lee and my mum said I shouldn't as I had no idea I was pregnant.'","Kirsty Parker, 25, thought that she was just having stomach pains .

"J.C.X. Simon, 69, and three other men participated in the racially-motivated attacks in the 1970s . A 69-year-old black man who was convicted of participating in the infamous 'zebra murders' in San Francisco, California, in the 1970s was found dead at San Quentin State Prison. J.C.X. Simon was one of four black men convicted of carrying out a string of racially-motivated attacks that killed 14 people and injured seven. He was found in his one-man cell shortly before midnight Thursday, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The cause of death is unknown and an autopsy is planned. Simon was convicted of two first-degree murder charges, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon in 1976 and was serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole, the maximum sentence allowed In California at the time. The killing spree was dubbed the 'zebra murders' because of the special Z channel radio band investigators used, the San Francisco Gate reported. During a six-month murder spree from October 1973 to April 1974. the four men targeted white victims and murdered the majority of them with an execution-style shot to the back of the head. The other three men who were convicted - Larry Green, Manuel Moore and Jessie Lee Cooks - are serving life sentences at other California prisons. The trial saw 174 witnesses testify and was described as 'San Francisco's longest criminal trial' at the time. The victims were aged 15 to 87 and did not know one another, the Los Angeles Times reported.

"UK defence cuts risk leaving America to tackle the twin threat of Russia and ISIS on its own, it has been claimed. Retired British army chief General Richard Dannatt suggested there was ‘no-one else’ for the US to turn to in Europe. It comes days after a UK think tank predicted that up to 30,000 British service personnel could go leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade. Retired British army chief General Richard Dannatt (pictured) suggested there was ‘no-one else’ for the US to turn to in Europe . Now there are fears the United States could be left without a credible partner as it stands up to a number of global security threats. Lord Dannatt, who served as Chief of the General Staff between 2006 and 2009, told the Washington Post: ‘If the UK can’t do it, who else is the US going to turn to in Europe? There’s no one else.’ He added: ‘The concern is that we’re going to fall from being a significant player to a bit-part player. ‘The UK isn’t of much use to the US if we don’t have a worthwhile military force behind us. Anybody can talk tough. But if you don’t back it up, everyone just laughs at you.’ The comments come a week after the US Army chief of staff General Ray Odierno revealed he was ‘very concerned’ about cuts in the British military. A UK think tank predicted that up to 30,000 British service personnel could go leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade (file picture) Earlier this week, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, warned of a ‘dangerous’ gulf emerging between American and European spending on defence. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that governments in Europe needed to spend more and that cuts around the continent were ‘concerning’. A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of Britain’s forces face redundancy over the next parliament. It comes as Prime Minister David Cameron faces calls to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013-14 defence budget was £34.3billion, down from £35.9billion in 2010-11, when the coalition took over. It comes after a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was inevitable that Britain's defence spending would drop below the Nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts.","Retired British army chief General Richard Dannatt says there is 'no-one else' for US to turn to in Europe .

"The exact details of the birth of the new royal baby next month will be forever shrouded in mystery. However, one thing is certain, unlike many other queens-in-waiting, the Duchess of Cambridge will have a fleet of medical staff and a range of drug options available to her to ensure the arrival of the new prince or princess is as pain-free as possible. By contrast, when Queen Elizabeth I was born in 1533, giving birth was considered such a dangerous practice, women were encouraged to write their wills. The evolution of childbirth: By the 1940s, men were increasingly present at the birth although the advent of the NHS in 1948, meant that more mothers than ever before were now having their babies in hospital. This vintage illustration  shows a proud father meeting his newborn twins circa 1952 . Retro advertising from the 1950s also shows how attitudes towards pre and post natal care have changed over the years . Men were banished from the delivery room, as were doctors, and midwives - who had learned their trade from their own mothers - were the experts, rubbing ointment on the swollen bellies of their patients to speed up delivery and sprinkling herbs over the floor  to make it smell nice and help the mothers relax. Scottish historian Ashley Cowie, who has appeared on NBC's  Legend Quest, said women were often afraid of giving birth as they feared they would die. He said: 'In the 15th century it was not unusual for girls to be married between the ages of 15 and 19 and the average number of children born to one mother was between five and seven. 'Childbirth was a dangerous time in a woman's life, and most wrote wills when they knew they were pregnant. 'An ancient method of birth control was to extend breastfeeding, which is nature's way of spacing out children.' He added that upper class mothers hired women to feed their babies. 'The hand that rocked the cradle was closer to the truth than you would imagine and among the upper classes it was common to have wet nurses breastfeed so that the mother would soon be pregnant again. A sketch of a woman sitting in a birthing chair in the mid 1500s which were thought to aid nature . Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on their wedding day. The couple went on to have nine children, two of them born with the assistance of chloroform . Meanwhile, having babies in the Middle Ages was shrouded in superstition and folklore. He said: 'Several rituals surrounded medieval childbirth, including the burning of the newborn's umbilical cord. Fire was seen as a way of purifying the sinful origins of conception.' Mothers and midwives also used special birthing chairs, which women believed put them in the best position possible to deliver their baby. Leah Astbury, who is studying for a doctorate at Cambridge University and researching maternal and infant health in 17th century England, said: 'Women gave birth at home, assisted by a midwife and a group of female friends, neighbours and family members, called gossips. When her labour began, it was often her husband’s job to fetch them. During the 16th century, even queens (Henry VIII's wives Jane Seymour and Katherine Parr) weren't immune from the lack of understanding about cleanliness, and both died of puerperal fever, a septic infection of the reproductive organs that always resulted in death. 'At the birth, herbal remedies and a drink called caudle, a kind of fortifying alcoholic porridge or eggnog, were commonly drunk to keep her strong during the birth, and possibly dull the pain. 'Seventeenth century women often expressed a complex relationship with the pain of labour. On the one hand, childbirth had the potential to be redemptive. It was part of Eve’s penance. 'In reality, however, families were obviously relieved when women gave birth relatively easily and recovered quickly.' This treated disk was said to determine the sex of an unborn child after it was placed on the tongue . Babies in a maternity unit in the 1950s and 1960s were kept in one room to enable their mothers to rest . Three pregnant women relax in medical 'space-suits' in 1965 in an attempt to ease childbirth and raise the intelligence of their offspring. A suction pump next to the chairs lowers pressure inside the suits, while a gauge in front of them gives a constant reading . In 1672, physician Percival Willughby wrote Observations in Midwifery, a book about contemporary labour practices. He wrote: 'Let all midwives bee assured, that it is not their labours, in pulling, and haling their women’s bodies, that causeth deliver. But that it is the work of Dame nature.' Remarking on one case, he wrote: 'Her mother-in-law was a midwife, and had used her very harshly; through her unhandsome doings, her body was much bruised, and, by her pulling the infant by the arme, shee had destroyed the infants life...' The medical man notes that placenta was placed on the baby’s head  to prevent sore eyes, while at the time there were few tools and a hook called a 'crotchet' was employed to pull out, often dead, babies. A woman is handed her newborn baby during the Second World War . By the time Queen Victoria was crowned in 1837, male doctors could be present at births although they were not supposed to look at their patients, just touch them. Having borne nine children, Queen Victoria became an expert at childbirth and is said to have persuaded Prince Albert to attend the births, using chloroform as a pain relief for eighth and ninth children. sciencemuseum.org.uk . By 1914, pain control during labour was an option, although one technique, using a morphine-type drug called Twilight Sleep, which knocked women  out and erased the memory of what they'd gone through. While the idea of giving birth in a stupor might have appealed to some women, there were risks to both mother and baby. By the 1940s, men were increasingly present at the birth although the advent of the NHS in 1948, meant that more mothers than ever before were now having their babies in hospital. The biggest shift in attitude to childbirth and pregnancy arrived kicking and screaming in the 1970s. Arguable for the first time, conception, pregnancy and childbirth were embraced as something that could be modified to suit the individual. Some women claim their doctors advised them not to give up smoking as it would help them relax during pregnancy, while mothers with a low iron count were advised to drink a pint of Guinness. It was also customary for mothers to be given an enema to 'clear them out' and women were routinely given a vaginal shave for 'hygenic reasons'. Breast feeding was encouraged and smoking was allowed on the ward. Men also had the choice whether to attend the birth or not, although many fathers-to-be still deemed that a labour ward was not the place for men and spent the time at the pub instead, ready to wet the baby's head. Times have changed yet again, and as the Duke of Cambridge gets ready to welcome his new child, it would be surprising if he chose not to attend the birth, lit a congratulatory cigarette next to his wife or took her a pint of Guinness for medicinal purposes. Mixed messages: Here a woman in 1970 reads a poster warning of the dangers of smoking when pregnant although some doctors told mothers the habit would help them relax .

"French culture minister Felur Pellerin, who has called fro the country to stop blockading English words from entering the French language . France should stop blocking English phrases from entering their language and embrace new words from other nations, the country's culture minister has said. Fleur Pellerin, who was born in South Korea and also speaks fluent English and German, says the French language is not frozen and that the country should be thankful for English words 'enriching' their lexicon. The government's stance marks a dramatic break from France's previous rigid defence of its language, especially from English words entering it. Miss Pellerin said: 'The French language is not frozen. A language is always evolving. 'Some languages - like English today, or Italian in the past - have been particularly generous in offering hundreds of new words to French. 'French is not in danger and my responsibility as minister is not to erect ineffective barriers against languages but to give all our citizens the means to make it live on.' Current French legislation states that all public advertising is in French or at least includes a translation of non-French terms. There was also a campaign to stop terms such as 'e-mail' 'challenge' and 'marketing' from creeping into the French language. But many French linguists have welcomed the minister's comments. Alain Rey, author of a dictionary on the history of French and a member of a Commission on French Terminology, said attempts to stop the adoption of some commonly used words were ridiculous. He pointed out that the word 'challenge', for instance, in fact originally came from Old French ('chalonge') before being taken up in English. 'Passing laws (against loan words) is to tilt at windmills,' Mr Rey said. A woman holds open a copy of the 2015 edition of the French 'Petit Larousse' dictionary. Current French legislation states that all public advertising is in French or at least includes a translation of non-French terms . Miss Pellerin's comments come just months after she admitted that she hasn't read a single book over the past two years, despite being appointed culture minister. To add to her embarrassment, she was also unable to say on a TV show which book by France's Nobel Literature Prize winner Patrick Modiano was her favourite, just minutes after having said she had lunched with the author. Only two weeks beforehand, she had hailed Modiano as representing the 'influence and vitality of French literature in the eyes of the world.'","Fleur Pellerin says French should stop trying to block English words .

"A doctor who made a stand against sexism in medicine has received hundreds of messages of support from disgruntled women physicians across the world. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar, posted a lengthy post on her blog discussing how she is frequently belittled because of her sex, with people regularly referring to her as a 'lady doctor' instead of just 'doctor'. She pointed out that she has also been judged by members of the profession in the higher ranks of her hospital who claimed she got into her position because she was pretty. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar in Melbourne . Writing on blogspot.com, Dr Witt, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'Sexual harassment is every time you call me ""blondie"" or ""Barbie"", every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants, every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset, every time you call me a ""lady doctor"" instead of a ""doctor"". 'Sexual harassment is two weeks ago when I lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said, ""they shouldn’t send you up here, you’re too clucky"". She continued: 'It’s also the consultant who commented that I’d ""obviously gotten to where I was at a young age because I was pretty"" (Um, maybe I’m actually good at my job?). 'It’s the surgical registrar who told me if I wanted to be taken seriously I needed to dye my hair dark.' Dr Witt wrote the essay in response to recent comments by a respected Australian vascular surgeon called Dr Gabrielle McMullin, who suggested women should accept sexual advances by their male colleagues instead of making a complaint that could damage their career. Dr Witt, who says she has faced sexual harassment at work . Dr Witt believes that sexual comments of the kind she has experienced are causing serious damage to the medical profession. She said: 'These seemingly harmless comments, coupled with the line that we 'need to take a joke', teach women in medicine that they need to just accept everyday sexual harassment. 'And worse still, they encourage those deeds further along the spectrum of sexual harassment. 'Where do we draw the line between commenting on someone's appearance to commenting on her body to making an unwanted sexual advance? 'Clearly we're having a great deal of trouble with the grey zone, so why don't we stop subtle sexual harassment where it starts.' Dr Witt ended her blog post with a call to arms for female medical workers, suggesting that they point out sexual harassment when it happened to the person in question. She said: 'I’m going to ask you,that this week you look out for subtle sexual harassment and call it out. 'Whether you’re the med student, the consultant, the nurse, the dietician or the plaster tech, that when you hear a comment towards a woman that would not be made if she was a man say ""hey! Let’s not make jokes based on gender"", or ""I don't think that's appropriate."" 'Maybe, just maybe, the tiny ripples of change could start here.'

"Ed Miliband is so unimpressive that mums would rather hear about politics from Phillip Schofield, a new poll shows today. More women with children would like the This Morning star and his co-host Holly Willoughby to give their opinions on the big issues ahead of the general election than are willing to give the Labour leader or Nick Clegg the thumbs up. With eight in 10 mums planning to vote on May 7, David Cameron and Nigel Farage are neck-and-neck, with 15 per cent saying they have been impressed with both the Tory Prime Minister and the Ukip leader. Scroll down for video . Some 11 per cent of mums want to hear more on politics from Phillip Schofield (left), but just 7 per cent are impressed with Labour leader Ed Miliband . Asked which leaders impressed them last year, 15 per cent named David Cameron and Nigel Farage . One in 10 people would like to hear about politics from stars like Phillip Schofield, Alan Sugar and Jane Street Porter . Thousands of women with children have been polled by supermarket Asda as part of its MumDex series of surveys. It reveals that 55 per cent of them are not impressed with any of the current party leaders. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was ranked third on 10 per cent, behind Mr Cameron and Mr Farage. Just 7 per cent were impressed by Mr Miliband, followed by 5 per cent who said the same of Green leader Natalie Bennett. A dire 4 per cent thought Mr Clegg was impressive. Some 55 per cent said 'non of the above'. By contrast 11 per cent said they wanted to hear more from Schofield about politics, and 7 per cent named Willoughby. Schofield was especially popular among mums in Wales, where 19 per cent wanted to hear his views on politics, and among the under-30s, where the figure was 21 per cent. More than a fifth (22 per cent) of mums under the age of 30 would like to hear from Holly Willoughby, who is currently on maternity leave from the popular daytime show. The survey suggests that mums are more interested in the political views of This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby . Some 15 per cent of mums were impressed by David Cameron and Nigel Farage, followed by 10 per cent who said SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. Only 4 per cent were impressed by Lib Dem Nick Clegg . Some 10 per cent were interested in Apprentice star Lord Sugar's political opinions, another 10 per cent said Janet Street Porter. Russell Brand interests 9 per cent, while 8 per cent named Jamie Oliver, Karren Brady and Lorraine Kelly. With just weeks until the election, the survey will make grim reading for all the parties. Some 71 per cent of mums say that they would be more likely to vote for someone if politicians answered questions directly and honestly. After the recent row over MPs' second jobs, 57 per cent said they would be more likely to support someone who had 'normal lives' outside politics. Coming across as honest and not too stage-managed or polished would also woo 57 per cent. Almost half want less jargon and less bickering and in-fighting. Only 14 per cent said a politician having children would help win them over. The survey suggests that 80 per cent of so-called Asda Mums are planning to vote, equivalent to 8.4million women. And two thirds have still not made up their mind about who to back on polling day. More than half (56 per cent) focus on what politicians are saying, a third notice the language they are using and 30 per cent notice how trustworthy they sound. Mr Cameron last year used a Cabinet reshuffle to promote women including Nicky Morgan, Liz Truss and Esther McVey. Mr Miliband has also pledged to have women as half of his ministers. But such moves are seen as stunts. A third thought the reshuffle was a PR exercise. Only 4 per cent thought it would make any difference to the political system. Hayley Tatum, from Asda, said: 'With 80 of mums planning to turn up and cast their vote on polling day, Asda Mums are an incredibly powerful force and most of them haven't made up their minds on which they'll vote so it's still all to play for.

"These captivating black and white portraits may appear centuries old but a closer inspection will reveal rather modern-looking models. The images have been taken using a Victorian photography technique and are part of a project to resurrect the earliest form of the art. Instead of the instant results of Instagram and other digital apps, each picture takes 20 minutes to develop and requires a number of chemicals. Scroll down for video . Turning back the clocks: Andy Martin uses a Victorian camera and a method called tintype photography to create these stunning portraits . The pictures are the work of Andy Martin, who has turned his back on 21st century cameras to practise tintype photography. The method was invented in 1850 and, although initially used for formal studio portraits, it became enormously popular and photographers started offering casual portraiture at events such as fairs and amusement parks. The process works by coating a metal with a chemical called collodion before placing it into a silver nitrate solution, which makes it light sensitive. The plate is then loaded into the camera and the picture is taken. The exposure time can be anything from a second to a couple of minutes, depending on the light conditions. The plate then has to be developed in a solution of iron sulphate and finished with a fixer, which makes the image fully appear. In Victorian times this would have been the deadly poison potassium cyanide, but Mr Martin opts for a less risky sodium thiosulphate. Modern models: Among his 500 portraits is a photo of musician Gruff Rhys (left) from Welsh rock band Super Furry Animals . Resurrecting early art-form: He is currently working on a project using the technique and hopes it will encourage others to have a go . The whole process has to be done in a dark room under a red light. Mr Martin's project started when he was given a worse-for-wear Victorian camera by a friend. It had been sat abandoned in an attic for at least 70 years - the stand had been destroyed by woodworm and the bellows were in tatters. After repairing it he spent a day with Sean Mackenna, a tintype expert who had honed his skills at Civil War re-enactments, learning the technique. He has now taken pictures of about 500 people, using about 1,000 plates and hopes to exhibition them and possibly even make a book. Among the photos featured is Gruff Rhys from Welsh rock band Super Furry Animals and Second World War hero Charles Eagles, who took part in the D-Day landings and was injured by an exploding mine on July 22 1944. Mr Martin, from Sunderland, said: 'It all started about five years ago when I got this camera from a friend whose uncle was having a clear out of his lock-up. 'I got in touch with this guy in London who was one of the first to resurrect the process in the UK back in the 1990s and asked if he would mind showing me the process. 'I went down to London and spent the day talking about how it works, shot a few plates and he sent me on my way with a lot of 1850s reading material. Mr Martin's project started when he was given a worse-for-wear Victorian camera which had been rotting in an attic for at least 70 years . Also among the photographer's models was  Second World War hero Charles Eagles (left), who took part in the D-Day landings . 'It's sort of trial and error though, I would say I'm still learning now. 'People think old fashioned photography you have to wait ages for your pictures to be developed and sent back but actually this was quite instant. 'You could create an image in 15 to 20 minutes, it was the first instant photography really. 'Like a shot of film, it's all got to be done in a dark room under red light. If it wasn't it would just ruin the plate. 'It would also be ruined if the collodion dried before you got a chance to develop it. It's a short window of about 20 minutes. 'My grandfather made a toolbox during the Second World War and I've inherited it. 'It's basically a suitcase but it folds out and it's got this hood that covers the top half of your body and you have all your chemicals inside the box and I can work from that box inside the van anywhere. 'Although it's a bit tricky from Tunstall Hill, the highest point in the city. It was probably the windiest day I've experienced and I had to get my friend to hold down the dark room while I worked. 'I think we're a bit overwhelmed with digital images and camera phones now and this technique involves people going out of their way to do something a little bit more interesting. 'Anyone can take a photo and whack an Instagram filter on it, and I do it too. But with this you have to really think about composition and exposure.' Technical: The tintype method, demonstrated by this picture of toy robots, has to be done in a dark room under a red light . Andy Martin, of Sunderland, stands next to the Victorian bellows camera which he restored to working order to produce stunning images . The photographer, pictures in his studio, said: 'I think we're a bit overwhelmed with digital images and camera phones now' Pictured, the Beamish Museum's Colliery Railway, which forms part of Andy Martin's Victorian album .

"It's an irrefutable truth. Nothing goes better with eggs than bacon. But the perfect pairing? Finding Hollywood actor Kevin Bacon serving up some eggs in your kitchen. The American Egg Board seem to have cracked it by running a series of online and print advertisements featuring the affable A-Lister. Scroll down for video . Kevin Bacon stars in the American Egg Board's newest online and print advertising campaign . The video features scenes of a housewife leaning in to sniff Kevin Bacon as he lies on her kitchen counter . The Hollywood actor shunned the silver screen for his latest role, opting instead to pick this straight-to-web offering. The short video, filled with bacon puns, shows that the actor doesn't take himself too seriously. The highly entertaining tongue-in-cheek advertisement opens with a woman making scrambled eggs for breakfast when Kevin Bacon appears in her kitchen, lying suggestively across the counter. The hilarity kicks off as he then spouts a string of mirth-inducing puns. And the memes have started... Come here for your Bacon: The tongue-in-cheek advert last for two minutes and is filled with puns . 'Nobody knows eggs better than Bacon,' he says, smouldering suggestively. He then goes on to wax lyrical on the goodness of eggs as the woman listens wide-eyed and breathless. 'You know I love the smell of bacon in the morning,' he says as he takes the plate of eggs away from her. 'And I like the smell of Bacon,' she states, as she leans in to sniff the Footloose actor, just as her husband walks in. The meta advert – at one point the actress says 'you sound like a commercial' – has been wildly praised for its tongue-in-cheek approach to eggs. The American Egg Board said it's the first time the group is using a Hollywood celebrity in a major marketing push. But which bacon are they talking about here? The ad is full of funny moments like this . The online campaign is supported by print advertisements which also reference the star's last name . The campaign comes at an opportune moment; eggs which were long shunned and viewed as high-cholesterol are now back in vogue in the fickle world of food fashion due to their high protein content. Bob Krouse, CEO of Midwest Poultry Services, an egg producer in Mentone, Indiana, said  that he's glad the egg board is taking a slightly edgier approach in its marketing. Mr Krouse said: 'I always felt like egg farmers were too conservative.' The 'Wake Up To Eggs With Bacon' push by the ad agency Grey is an update on the 'Wake Up To Eggs' campaign that launched in 2012. 'With a last name like Bacon, I'm the obvious choice, and I'm excited to be a part of the new Incredible Edible Egg campaign,' the actor said. 'I like the creativity behind the idea, and I've always been a big fan of eggs.' The egg and Bacon pairing has been received with delight byTwittersphere. The Project TV made a joke of its own: 'There is now officially only one degree of separation between Kevin Bacon and eggs.' User @diannenice said: 'Is there nothing @KevinBacon can't do? Radio station K-Rock tweeted: 'Can anyone tell us why this took until 2015 to happen?'","Kevin Bacon stars in the American Egg Board's latest online ad campaign .

"Britain is set to feel the chill again as a cold air mass from Russia brings temperatures as low as 1C this weekend with snow expected in some parts of the UK. After the country basked in 17.5C heat last week with thousands of people flocking to parks and beaches, the start of spring is to be pushed back by a 'raw' polar blast from the east. The Met Office blames the low temperatures on high pressure building in the North-east and say the Midlands and the North of the country could see a dusting of snow on the hills.

"A six months pregnant woman from Pennsylvania faces up to five years in jail for allegedly hiding 89 packets of heroin inside a 'body cavity'. The North Jersey Record reports that retail worker Marina McCarthy, 22, of Gouldsboro, was secretly filmed on Friday afternoon reaching into her pants as she sat in the back of a police SUV. She had apparently been stopped while traveling with her 27-year-old mechanic boyfriend, Dakota Dunning, because the car he was driving had a temporary registration plate that was not visible. Retail worker Marina McCarthy, 22, of Gouldsboro, faces up to five years in jail after allegedly hiding 89 packets of heroin inside a 'body cavity' Officers reportedly then found that the vehicle was unregistered and uninsured and that Dunning and McCarthy both had warrants out for their arrests relating to previous incidents. Captain Jonathan Miller told the North Jersey Record that troopers got increasingly suspicious that there were drugs on the scene as they spotted 'fresh needle track marks' on Dunning. A K-9 dog also detected an illegal  substance, according to the report. Dunning and McCarthy were arrested and taken to Glen Rock Police Department in New Jersey for further questioning.

"It has been described by guests as a night spent living like the Flintstones. But the owners of this Devon B&B were actually emulating the Iron Age - not the Stone Age - when they built an elaborate thatched hut, complete with open log fire, for adventurous guests. Ambitious farmer, Charles Cole, 49, has hand-built a primitive wooden roundhouse in Devon, which comes complete with a six-ton thatched roof to protect guests from rain. Scroll down for video . Upcott Barton in Devon aims to transport guests back to another time, and provide a cosy back-to-basics experience . Cuddle up! The hut has no electricity, and relies on a stone hearth fire for warmth and cooking. Food is available on arrival, if requested, and candles are on offer for lights . Pop the kettle on! Take advantage of the fire, or get a meal cooked for you upon your arrival by the hosts. The hut is designed to allow ventilation when the smoky fire is lit . Forget electricity, the only luxuries you will experience are candles, an open stone hearth fire, a single cold tap and a composting toilet. Mr Cole had dreamt of creating the B&B since he was a teenager, after watching a BBC documentary of a small community recreating an Iron Age settlement. He made the decision to make his dreams a reality and created Upcott Barton using materials found purely on his farm. The project was a family venture, with Mr Cole, his wife Iona, 42, and their children Hedley, 23, Lizzie, 21, May, 18, and Charity, 14, spending six months and a total of 2,500 hours manpower to create the dwelling. They helped to construct the walls from from a sand and lime mixture, and even now it is completed, Iona and Lizzie help out with running its everyday bookings. He said: 'You have in the back of your head a little dream that is there all through your life. 'We are farmers and we were looking at ways to try and diversify what we do and lots of farms have converted barns but we wanted to try something completely different. 'We thought it cannot be that hard but my grief, you wouldn't believe the work. 'If we had known in the first place we probably wouldn't have started it but the roundhouse turned out far better than we thought.' The hut is 30 metres in diametre, with a six ton roof made out of 14in thick water reed thatch. The walls were made by Mr Cole and his son Hedley, 25, who trained with the Royal Marines and featured on Channel 4's Royal Marines Commando School . Bare essentials! Switch off from the busy world, and enjoy a simple night stay in Devon - but don't expect a luxurious experience! All the furniture in the roundhouse was made from Mr Cole's 214-acre farm. All members of the family helped out on the project, which had been Mr Cole's dream since he had been a teenager . Although it is a Iron Age roundhouse, many guests have said they felt it is similar to Fred and Wilma's home in the 1960s cartoon, The Flintstones . The hut took Mr Cole, his wife Iona, 42, and their children Hedley, 23, Lizzie, 21, May, 18, and Charity, 14, six months to build, which is a total of 2,500 man hours . Historic roots! Allegedly the land which the roundhouse sits on today was home to the Dumnonii people who inhabited the area from at least the Iron Age up to the early Saxon period . Mr Cole admitted feeling anxious that the wooden structure would fill up with smoke from the fire. The father of four said: 'The terrifying thing about it was we were not sure that the whole idea would work at all because the fire may have smoked the place out, we had to build the whole thing before we could try it out - thank heaven our fears were unfounded.' The house sleeps two to ten guests and Flintstones wannabes will be relieved knowing the farm can provide meals if they do not wish to try their chances on the stove. Although guests will be experiencing primitive living, it will set them back £170 a night to experience life as a Bedrock resident. Bookings can be made through the Canopy & Stars website or from the owners at upcottbarton@btconnect.com. Inspiration for the home came from a fly on the wall documentary called Living In The Past on the BBC in 1978, where a small community recreated an Iron Age settlement . A fear the family had in recreating their homes was ventilation and there were concerns the smoke from the fire would fill the roundhouse, thankfully the smoke passes through the thatch, allowing meals to be cooked on the hearth . The painstaking reconstruction of an Iron Age roundhouse was achieved by Charles Cole in the heart of the Devonshire countryside . The whole family helped out, including daughter Lizzie, (left). The Cole's cobbled the doorway, (right), to create an attractive welcome to the property . Release your inner Flintstone in the roundhouse, which sleeps two to ten guests, and can be booked for £170 through the Canopy & Stars website . Luxury - Iron Age style. Animal skins are optional for a snug night in the wooden retreat. Mr Cole wanted to turn back the clock for guests . The six ton roof was created with 28ft long timbers from surrounding woodland and a thatcher put in the 14inch thick water reed thatch . Daughter Lizzie did sketches of what the hut could look like, (left), which look remarkably similar to the end product, which is now accepting bookings for hotel guests, (right)","Since he was a teenager, Charles Cole dreamt of turning back the clock to create an authentic roundhouse .

"George Osborne vetoed plans for a 'patronising' Tory Election slogan which said 'Well Done You' in an attempt to thank voters for putting up with spending cuts.

But it was quickly rejected by the Chancellor, who said it was 'patronising and insensitive'. Scroll down for video . Pictured is how the slogan vetoed by George Osborne might have looked as a poster . Instead, the party replaced it with the slogan: 'We are with you' which is expected to be used during the campaign . The slogan was quickly rejected by the Chancellor, who said it was 'patronising and insensitive' Instead, the Tories opted for the more cautious 'We Are With You', which was launched by the Prime Minister in Manchester yesterday. A source said: 'There was general astonishment when it was suggested 'Well Done You' was a good message. It is patronising and would rightly have been greeted with a large raspberry by the electorate. 'We already have a struggle on our hands to rebut Labour claims that Cameron and Osborne are rich and out of touch. Short of putting a picture of Marie Antoinette on it, I can't think of anything worse. 'It didn't take very long for Osborne to tear it up.' M&C Saatchi went back to the drawing board and later produced the far more successful image of Labour leader Ed Miliband peering out of the top pocket of former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. The agency was set up in 1995 by Maurice and Charles Saatchi. The brothers' previous firm, Saatchi and Saatchi, designed Margaret Thatcher's famous 'Labour Isn't Working' poster in the run-up to the 1979 Election.

"Since the Arab Spring in 2011, Yemenis have endured intermittent fighting, attempted coups and increasing violence but now, with Houthi militiamen advancing on the beleaguered forces of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi in the second city of Aden, things look increasingly bleak. With the capital Sana'a also in the hands of the Iran-backed rebels, women and children are now on the front line of a conflict that, last night alone, saw an estimated 40 people perish after Saudi war planes apparently bombed a refugee camp. Now a haunting new set of photos has shed light on what Yemen stands to lose, including a Bedouin minority that has lived in Yemen - and neigbouring countries such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia - for thousands of years. Under threat: These women were photographed in Amran, a town that fell to the Houthis last summer and is now being targeted with air strikes . Front line: These girls live in Shaharah, a village in Houthi controlled territory close to the Saudi Arabian border . Fighting: This little girl was photographed close to the city of Taiz which fell to the Houthi militia yesterday . The pictures, which were taken by French photographer Eric Lafforgue, show the country's women and children going about their daily lives, whether chatting in the market or having their nails hennaed. But more than ever, their future looks uncertain with Saudi Arabian troops massing on the border, Iran refusing to back down and nightly air strikes conducted by planes from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and even Sudan. So far, most have been confined to the capital with Sa'naa's international airport among the targets hit last night, along with an army camp in Saadeh and the Red Sea port of Hudaida. 'There were huge blazes in the mountains outside Sanaa. It looks like they hit a missile depot and it was on fire for half an hour or so. Then there was anti-aircraft fire until dawn,' a Sanaa resident said. Nevertheless, even before the Houthi advance began, life wasn't particularly easy for the women of Yemen. One third of girls are married off before the age of 18 according to UNICEF, with a handful marrying aged nine or 10. 'Many activists campaign for a minimum age for marriage but enforcing that in the remoter areas is difficult,' explains Lafforgue, a frequent visitor to Yemen. Dangerous: Shaharah is currently in rebel hands but for the women who live there, little has changed so far . Restricted: For many women, life in Yemen is restrictive. Here, a woman is seen shopping accompanied by two male family members . Changing times: For these women, who live in the Yemeni capital, life has become increasingly dangerous since the 2011 Arab Spring . Historic: These women live in  historic Al Hajjarah, a town built by the Sulayhid dynasty in the 12th century. It was once popular with tourists . 'Yemen is a country where female genital mutilation (FGM) remains an issue, even though it has been officially outlawed. Many girls miss out on education as well.' Hadi's government had set a target of 90 per cent of girls in education by the end of 2015 but with the Houthis and soldiers loyal to ousted president Ali Abdullah Saleh now in control of most of the country, it's a target that is unlikely to be hit. 'Convincing parents of the benefits of sending their daughters to school is difficult,' adds Lafforgue. 'Many families in rural areas think it is a waste of money to educate a girl. 'Instead, they expect them to stay at home and cook or collect firewood and water. When they marry, the girls are expected do much the same.' Despite strict rules that often mean that the only part of a Yemeni woman visible are a pair of hennaed hands, Lafforgue says the same rules are not applied to foreign women who are regarded as 'a third sex' in Yemen. 'They don't have to wear a veil or anything like that, although it is appreciated in some places,' he says.'They are allowed to do everything, including eating and speaking with men. 'When I walked through Sa'naa with a girl wearing trousers, many Yemeni men came up to me and asked: ""Is it a man or a woman?""' Trousers, unless with a long robe, are not supposed to be worn by women.' Some do have more freedom, however, among them the bare-faced ladies of Taiz and Jebel Saber close to Aden. But with both towns falling to the Houthis yesterday, their days of being allowed to do as they please could be numbered. Traditional: Women living in Shaharah. Because the village is so remote, fetching water means a daily trek to a well miles from home . Making a living: A lady carries water in a village just outside Al Hudaydah while another battles a flooded wadi in Tihamah . Scorching: Women living in the huge Hadhramaut province in central Yemen often wear tall hats as extra protection from the sun . Decorative: The only adornment visible on most Yemeni women is a pair of hennaed hands . Education: Many village women such as this one are not educated because their families see it as a waste of time, according to Lafforgue . The current round of fighting in Yemen has pitted government forces led by President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi against an Iran-backed rebel force made up of Houthis and soldiers supporting former leader Ali Abdullah Saleh who was ousted in 2012. Supporting President Hadi is an Arab coalition led by  Saudi Arabia and including Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Sudan among others. The Houthis are from a Yemeni Shi'ite sect and are allied to Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. The Saudis and other Sunni Muslim countries in the region fear the advance of the Houthis will ultimately threaten the world's top oil exporter. Much of the fighting is focused on the port city of Aden where President Hadi is holed up amid bloody clashes with Houthi forces. Aden is Hadi's last stronghold in Yemen and remains besieged despite a fifth day of  air strikes aimed at checking the Houthi advance. The Saudi air strikes, part of an operation named Decisive Storm, may herald a full-blown invasion, with troops already massing on the Yemeni border. However, Reuters reports that US officials say that Saudi Arabia is reluctant to take the next step if at all possible. Different life: Not all Yemeni women live restricted lives. In Jebel Saber in Taiz, close to Aden, women have similar powers to men . Overrun: Residents of Taiz such as this women have now been overwhelmed by Houthi rebels who advanced into the city yesterday .

"Nick Clegg was accused of hypocrisy last night after it was alleged that a Liberal Democrat fundraiser had sought to bypass donation laws. Ibrahim Taguri told an undercover reporter posing as a wealthy Indian businessman that he would be able to channel money via family members and backdate cheques to avoid appearing on public registers. He was also said to have promised big donations could ‘open doors’ and introduced the fake donor to key figures including Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured, faces questions over his party's attempts to bypass donation limits . Mr Alexander was recorded at a dinner thanking the supposed businessman for what he was doing, adding: ‘I won’t intrude on the details, but genuinely it will make a difference.’ All donations of £7,500 or more are supposed to be publically registered. Last night Sir Alastair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Mr Clegg’s high-minded rhetoric on sleaze was not matched by his party’s actions. ‘The leader of the party has always taken a stand on high standards in politics,’ he said. ‘There’s a conflict between what he says, and what his party is doing. ‘Any attempt to breach legal rules around party donations is a very serious matter. It is most unfortunate that the Lib Dems seem to be encouraging people to get round the legal provisions of party funding rules. You’d expect higher standards and better leadership.’ Last night it emerged that the Lib Dems had agreed to hand back Mr Taguri’s Commons pass after accepting he should not have had one as it raised the prospect of him using the Parliamentary estate for fundraising purposes. Sir Alastair said: ‘It is against the rules to carry out party political campaigning in the Commons, so allowing him to have a pass could be in breach of the rules. You’d class fundraising as party political campaigning.’ Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, pictured, thanked the undercover reporter who posed as a wealthy Indian businessman who was seeking to pump money into the Lib Dems for the election campaign . Lord Ashdown, the party’s election campaign leader, admitted that Mr Taguri – who yesterday quit as the Lib Dems’ general election candidate in Brent Central and is now likely to stand as an independent – had ‘serious questions to answer’. Mr Clegg told LBC Radio that Mr Alexander had done nothing wrong, save being polite to someone to whom he was introduced. The Deputy Prime Minister said the recording showed ‘Danny being a polite guy, just saying thank you to someone who he has been told is supporting the party’. ‘The idea that Danny or any parliamentarian has done anything wrong is categorically untrue,’ he said. ‘On the issue of Ibrahim Taguri, no cheque has been received by the Liberal Democrats, no cheque has been cashed. If we had received this cheque in question, of course it would have been scrutinised and checked.’ Mr Taguri, who has also stepped down as the Lib Dem race equality champion, denied any wrongdoing and said he was ‘confident that I will be exonerated of all the claims made against me’. He intends to fight the election as an independent but said he hoped to return to the party fold after clearing his name. The undercover reporter was apparently able to secure meetings with senior figures including Mr Alexander after giving several thousand pounds and promising far more. He was introduced to figures such as Lord Ashdown, taken to Mr Clegg’s office and attended a dinner for major party benefactors where he met Mr Alexander, the newspaper said. The fake donor is alleged to have been told by Mr Taguri that he could channel a donation via a ‘cousin’ after explaining that he wanted to remain ‘discreet’ about his financial support. He went on to hand over a cheque for more than the £7,500 threshold beyond which donations must be publicly registered with the Electoral Commission. Commission guidance, issued in 2007 in the wake of a scandal of ‘proxy’ donations to Labour, says giving money via a third party ‘must not be used as an attempt to evade the controls on permissibility and transparency’. Backdating a cheque could have allowed the donor to split the gift into smaller amounts of less than £7,500 – thus allowing him to evade declaring his name. A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: ‘We are aware of what’s been reported and are establishing the facts before determining what further steps to take.’","Senior Lib Dems were filmed talking about bypassing party finance laws .

"They may be on rival networks battling for ratings, but some of Australia's leading female media personalities have joined forces for a worthy causes. News anchors Chris Bath and Natarsha Belling, and actresses Rebecca Gibney and Marta Dusseldorf join presenter and model Nicky Buckley, fitness guru Michelle Bridges, and The Fred Hollows Foundation's Founding Director Gabi Hollows as ambassadors for National Prevention Week. Dressed to the Nines in glamorous gowns, the group of accomplished media personalities appear in the new issue of Prevention magazine in support of various causes that are close to their hearts. Scroll down for video . Coming together for a cause: (L-R) Chris Bath, Marta Dusseldorp, Michelle Bridges, Natarsha Belling, Nicky Buckley, Gabi Hollows, and Rebecca Gibney pose together to support National Prevention Week 2015 . Network Ten presenter Natarsha Belling wears a black lace dress for the photo shoot in her role as Heart Health Ambassador. A study by Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggests that adopting six simple habits can cut the risk of heart disease by a staggering 92 per cent, Prevention magazine has reported. The lifestyle changes include sticking to one alcoholic drink a day, eating a high-quality diet low in red meat and trans fats, not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, exercising for at least 2.5 hours a week and watching less than seven hours of TV a week. Belling, 39, is an ambassador for Heart Research Australia, and told the magazine about the effect witnessing her father's heart attack had on her. Joining forces: Heart Health Ambassador Natarsha Belling (L) and Stroke Ambassador Chris Bath (R) are supporting causes close to their hearts . Simple changes: 2.5 hours of exercise per week, a high-quality diet, and sticking to just one alcoholic drink per week may reduce your risk of heart disease by 92 per cent . 'Heart disease is an extraordinarily important issue, which hit home for me recently when my dad suffered a heart attack and underwent major surgery,' she said. 'Once you see a loved one crippled with heart disease, you realise how debilitating it is.' Cardiovascular disease (including heart, stroke and blood vessel diseases) affects one in six Australians. Accounting for 13 per cent of all deaths, it claimed the lives of 20,046 Australians in 2012.  Each year, around 55,000 Australians suffer a heart attack, equating to one heart attack every 10 minutes. Chris Bath, 47, wears a strapless black sheer striped dress for the photo shoot. The Seven News anchor is the Stroke Ambassador for the campaign, which runs from March 23 - 29, in an effort to raise awareness about preventable health. 'I'm on board National Prevention Week with this wonderful bunch of women because I believe in getting the most out of life and so do they,' she said. Without a doubt, it's an initiative that saves lives by giving people vital information about how best to preserve good health. 'I learned so much about one of our most preventable diseases, stroke, after my Dad had one. I was horrified to discover there has never been Federal funding to tell Australians how to save themselves from stroke, yet around 80 per cent of strokes are preventable. 'It's our second biggest killer and leading cause of adult disability. So why not get the message out there about how best to stave off a stroke? Why not give people the information they need to live healthy lives? Why not save the health system money by preventing illness before it strikes? It's what National Prevention Week is all about. Bring it on.' Mental Health Ambassador Rebecca Gibney, who looks sensational in an intricate blue gown in the shoot, opened up to the magazine about her personal battle with mental illness. The 50-year-old actress revealed that she remained silent about her own struggle with severe anxiety from her teens until she was well into her early thirties, as a result of feeling overwhelmed by a sense of guilt. 'I couldn't explain it because on the surface my life looked perfect,' she said. 'I had a wonderful job, great friends and a fabulous family, so consequently I felt guilty.' According to the Mental Health Council of Australia, almost half the total population (45.5 per cent) experience a mental health disorder at some point in their lifetime. Depression is predicted to be one of the world's largest health problems by 2020. Brave: Mental Health Ambassador Rebecca Gibney (L) has opened up about her own battle with severe anxiety, while Ovarian Cancer Ambassador Nicky Buckley (R) lost her mother to the disease . Model and TV personality Nicky Buckley is Ovarian Cancer Ambassador. 'Having lost my precious mum to Ovarian Cancer ten years ago, I am proud to be the Ovarian Cancer Ambassador for National Prevention Week to help shine a light on the need to focus on preventative health for women over 40,' she said. 'In doing so, I encourage women to put themselves first, listen to their bodies, and give themselves the best possible chance of early detection.' Marta Dusseldorp is currently dazzling onscreen in A Place To Call Home. The in-demand actress is using her star power for a good cause as Breast Cancer Ambassador for the campaign. 'Breast Cancer affects so many people - younger, older, mothers, daughters and grandmothers,' she said. 'It is important to support those who have gone through breast cancer and to never give up the search for a cure. As an ambassador I hope to keep the conversation going and to help shine a light on all the incredible people who work tirelessly to combat it.' Statistics from the National Breast Cancer Foundation states that on average, seven women die from breast cancer every day in Australia, while one in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. 'Doing something is better than doing nothing': Fitness Ambassador Michelle Bridges encourages women to make fitness part of their daily routine, like brushing their teeth . Fitness guru Michelle Bridges joins the host of TV stars as Fitness Ambassador. 'What I've always tried to tell people is that doing something is better than doing nothing,' she said. 'You don't need to love fitness to make it a part of your lifestyle, you just need to do SOMETHING and make it a small part of your day, everyday. Eventually it becomes habit and routine. 'You don't need to motivate yourself to brush your teeth because its routine and in just the same way, you don't need motivation for fitness, just consistency. Preventative health is not about being perfect, it's about being consistent and committed to making a positive change about your future.' Finally, esteemed eye health campaigner Gabi Hollows rounds out the group of ambassadors for National Prevention Week. The Fred Hollows Foundation's Founding Director is Eye Health Ambassador. 'We couldn't be more thrilled to join forces with seven of Australia's most high profile women to raise awareness around the power of preventative health,' said Jacqueline Mooney, editor of Prevention magazine. 'Now in its third year, National Prevention Week continues to go from strength to strength with the introduction of three new causes: heart disease, ovarian cancer and preventable blindness. 'Each of our ambassadors has been personally touched by the issue they've chosen to champion, and we've been blown away by their support. What many of us don't realise is that just one tiny health change a day can have a hugely positive impact. It's a message we're extremely passionate about and, through National Prevention Week, we hope to reach as many women as possible.'","Natarsha Belling, Chris Bath, Rebecca Gibney and Marta Dusseldorp are ambassadors for National Prevention Week .

"Fancy footwork: Kristina Rihanoff on Strictly Come Dancing . My husband is holding me in his arms, gazing fondly into my eyes and leading me across the floor in a series of sinuous moves that, quite frankly, I never imagined he could make. Such a moment never seemed possible because, like many women, I have been made a wallflower by a can’t-dance, won’t-dance partner. We never even had an opening waltz at our wedding 30-odd years ago. David, my husband, doesn’t so much as bop at parties. However, with the help of Strictly Come Dancing’s Kristina Rihanoff, we are getting the chance to take to the floor together – and in the process improve our fitness and our general mood, and even make our marriage healthier. Dressing up and taking your partner’s hand to dance à deux is catching on all over again, thanks to the huge success of the TV dance show. ‘Learning dance steps allows couples to enjoy the closeness of each other and creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy,’ says Kristina, who has partnered celebrities from newscaster John Sergeant to pop singer Simon Webbe on the TV show. ‘Some therapists suggest it as a form of marriage counselling. It allows men to lead and feel in charge again, and women to feel they are being taken care of by their partner. ‘Plus it releases endorphins as your heart rate goes up.’ And so I found myself relearning the essential 12 steps of salsa for the first time since I did the cha-cha-cha at Victor Sylvester’s Saturday morning ballroom classes for children, decades ago. Dancing was in my blood: my father danced his teens and 20s away and became an eight-times ballroom dancing champion. Kristina is giving David and me a taste of the weekend workshops she’s running at Champneys health spa over the next few months. But I find myself wondering how her students are going to cope with a class lasting three-quarters of an hour when we are knocked out after ten minutes of practice. ‘I feel like a robot,’ grumbles David, who has zero ballroom experience but bucks up when Kristina puts Santana on the sound system. He is musical – playing guitar – but his sense of rhythm does not extend to his feet, which Kristina says is surprisingly common. As for me, although I spent two years of my teens jiving in Soho discos, learning specific steps 40 years on is a discipline I’m finding taxing. It’s a more demanding workout, in fact, than anything I did on a brain-improvement programme I recently attended. ‘You need to focus absolutely,’ explains Kristina, who says the extreme attention needed to learn a sequence is good for improving mood as well as fitness. ‘When I started partnering Simon he was extremely down, but felt the dancing had a very positive effect. ‘Like yoga, ballroom dancing takes you out of yourself; you can’t think of anything else while you’re practising, so it takes you away from your everyday worries.’ Masterclass: Anthea dances with Kristina as David looks on. The Strictly star says learning dance steps together creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy between couples . A recent study in Poland suggested that dancing can elicit an improvement in mood. Another soon-to-be-published study shows that learning to dance improves leg muscle architecture in older women, while dementia patients were found to feel much better after taking a Latin ballroom class for a 2013 study. The aerobic effect is obviously a plus for weight loss; Kristina says John Sergeant lost more than two stone while training with her for an unimaginable eight hours a day. I say ‘unimaginable’ because after 15 minutes, my reluctant partner and I are so winded that we wonder whether we can even survive till the end of our session. I blame my shortness of breath on the need to accomplish a full underarm twirl in just three steps, every minute or so. Even so, given that our other steps involve only a gentle rocking back and forth and bringing feet together, my heart rate is raised in half the time it takes when I walk at nearly 4mph on the treadmill. David becomes furious as he keeps forgetting to switch to the side-step that kicks off the next part of the salsa sequence. Kristina reassures us that we are no worse than any beginners, and half an hour later we’re congratulating ourselves on remembering all 18 steps of our sequence and even keeping time with the music. I could see myself going on to tackle the foxtrot, the quickstep and tango. But first, I need a partner – the one I’ve got says he prefers his salsa with avocado on a nice tortilla. At least Champneys will guarantee everyone who books Kristina’s course someone to dance with. Strictly Ballroom weekends cost from £395 and take place on March 28-29 and May 22-24.

"Wealthy renters have paid £100 million up-front this year alone to cover their entire tenancy as competition for ideal homes intensifies, it was revealed today. With six or seven people chasing every top London property, bidders are desperate to beat their rivals to seal the deal on a home. As a result they are willing to pay a full year's rent, deposit and fees up-front - handing over £200,000 on average to the landlord. Areas in most demand: A map shows the top ten locations for up front rental payments in London . This is based on figures from Dataloft, which says the average prime London home costs £3,500 per week to rent. In total, around £100 million has been paid up front in the first ten weeks of 2015, which is twice as much as the same period last year. The frenzy is being caused by the General Election, fears of mansion tax and influx of super-rich escaping Russia and Ukraine, according to letting agents E J Harris. Stamp Duty has also turned vendors into landlords and buyers into tenants as the central London £2 million to £20 million sales market has stalled. A number of these rich people are happy to pay their entire tenancy up front despite the properties costing them around £10,000 per week. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, above, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years . The top ten locations for up front rental payments are Mayfair, Belgravia, Knightsbridge, St James's, Soho, Fitzrovia, Marylebone, Westminster, Chelsea and Kensington. On Mount Street, in Mayfair, more than 80 per cent of the tenancies are secured by up-front payments with lettings values rising by 25 per cent in the past two years. Elizabeth Harris, managing director of E J Harris, said: 'The dramatic rise in up front tenancy payments is driven by several factors. 'Stamp Duty and mansion tax concerns has turned purchasers into tenants and so competition has risen for the best homes which has led to a rise in up front bids. A photo taken on Eaton Place in Belgravia - the area in London came second in the top ten list of up front rental payments . 'The London lettings market has become increasingly international with a new wave of wealthy tenants from Russia, Ukraine, Nigeria and China who are happy to pay their rents entirely up front. Estate agent Tunstall Lettings had one case where a young woman in China paid £4million up front for five years for a property in One Hyde Park. E J Harris had another case of a wealthy Nigerian paying more than £1million up front to rent a property in Mayfair. 'Despite new lettings coming onto the market, the speed at which new lettings instructions are getting tenant offers has increased dramatically, so the number of available lettings properties is actually lower at the end of each week.' The mad market has been highlighted by a number of eye-opening deals. A one-bedroom Mayfair apartment was snapped up by a desperate tenant in a record-breaking 40 minutes. An a wealthy young man paid £400,000 up-front to rent a luxury flat only to love the place so much he bought it three days later - for more than £10 million. Mark Tunstall, managing director of Tunstall Property, added: 'They have the financial wherewithal to sidestep the referencing requirements usually imposed by landlords by offering up-front lump-sum payments. 'Whilst global interest rates remain at historical lows it is of little consequence if those with substantial liquid cash reserves have to pay their rent in advance. 'And similarly, it doesn't confer the benefits on landlords that it used to do, when they would often accept a discount on the asking rent in return for the benefit of a slug of cash which they could then invest profitably elsewhere.' Knightsbridge came third on the list of top ten areas where money is paid up front for property rental .","Some pay full year's rent, deposit and fees up-front to land properties .

"It's one of the most common schemes tourists encounter when they visit Paris, with plenty of guides and websites warning holidaymakers to turn and walk away. Filmed in the tourist-heavy area along the river Seine in Paris, this footage shows a woman trying to pressure a holidaymaker into signing a petition, without explaining why or what it is for. The woman in the video approaches the videographer, asking if he speaks English before holding out a pen and encouraging him to sign the paper she’s holding. The footage shows a woman trying to pressure a man into signing a petition, without explaining what it is for . ‘What is it?’ the man asks, while recording the interaction. She continues to push the paper toward him, getting visibly upset when the man continues to question what exactly it is that she’s asking him to sign. She pushes the pen toward him several more times, despite the man’s protests, before giving up and stalking off angrily. According to the video maker, tourists are targeted by people on the street, who urge them to sign petitions and then demand they make a ‘donation’ to the organisation. ‘The problem is that there’s no organisation behind the petition,’ the man wrote online. The filmer is approached  by a woman, asking him to sign a petition for an unknown organisation . When he asks for more information, including what the petition is for, the woman gets visibly agitated . ‘Any money ""donated"" goes straight into the pockets of the scammers, or worse yet, into the pockets of their over-bosses, typically found in certain Roma communities.’ The French capital launched a 26-point anti-crime strategy in autumn last year and brought in police officers from other European countries to beef up security at top attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, Champs-Elysees, Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre. With about 30 million visitors a year, Paris police brought in reinforcements from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Romania to help to patrol areas visited by tourists. It appears the plan is paying off as police announced this week that violent thefts against tourists from China, who are frequent targets for the City of Love’s criminals, have dropped by 25 per cent in 2014 compared to the same nine-month period in 2013. The petition can also be used as a distraction tactic while a partner pickpockets the tourists’ wallets or purses. ‘When in Paris, do not sign petitions,’ the man warns. ‘Ignore these individuals.’ The man also warns visitors that the scammers typically first ask if you speak English so that they can ascertain whether you’re a tourist, as opposed to a French-speaking local. Earlier this month the Chinese embassy in Paris urged tourists to stay off commuter trains that run between central Paris and France's Charles de Gaulle Airport. According to officials, there have been an unusually high number of robberies on the RER B trains since February. The RER service has long had a reputation for being a crime hotspot, but, thankfully, according to the Paris police, tourist muggings are down eight per cent over the last year. Every year foreign visitors are tricked out of small change or, worse, find themselves in dangerous situations or the victims of crime. Eventually, after pushing the pen toward him several times, she gives up and walks off in a huff . While this is by no means a warning against travel, being prepared and on guard can go a long way to evading confidence tricksters, wily locals and credit card bandits. Take sensible precautions against street and car crime. Don’t keep your passport, credit cards and other valuables in the same place; use the inside compartments in bags where possible. Carry your bag across your body rather than on your shoulder. Don’t be distracted around tourist attractions and cash points. Pickpockets can work in gangs: one to distract you while the other one goes into your bag. Keep your belongings close to you in restaurants and bars. Be aware of common scams used to obtain money from tourists, there are petition, 3 card trick and gold ring tricks which are all to be avoided, more information can be found here. Thieves and pickpockets operate on the Paris underground, RER lines and at mainline stations, for example Gare du Nord. There have been several victims of serious assault on the RER line B, which serves Paris Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports and Paris Gare du Nord Eurostar terminus. There have also been serious assaults on RER line D, which serves the Stade de France. Peter John, author of Around the World in 80 Scams, covers some of the top cons in his book, and adds in handy advice on how to avoid any trouble. For many of the scams, he believes the best advice is simply to walk away. On distraction muggings the perpetrators aim to distract you while they rob you. For example, a woman with what looks like a baby – it very often is just a doll or bundle of clothes – walks up to you and makes pleas for money for her baby. She might throw it at you too and insist you hold him/her/it for a moment. By the time you've got rid of her you'll notice your pockets have been pilfered by her accomplice. Mr John says: 'People can be distracted in any number of ways – from spraying mustard or tomato sauce onto the victim's cloths to asking for directions.' The battle to curb thefts and mugging in Paris in an ongoing one, but officials are constantly developing new programmes to counter these. The 26-point strategy (see box above) is focusing on Eastern European gangs, who were believed to be responsible for much of the thefts from tourists. Police said the number of Eastern Europeans who have been arrested for crimes has dropped by nearly a quarter.","In heavy-traffic areas, like along the river Seine, scammers prey on tourists .

"Some apps for Android smartphones are tracking people's movements every three minutes. This is according to a US study that found apps can collect a device's GPS coordinates on average of 6,200 times over two weeks. The study also revealed that most smartphone users have no idea how closely they are being tracked, and many were surprised by the results. Scientists asked 23 users of Android's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests. They found that even when an app provided a location based service, some attempted to collect more data than was needed. Groupon, for instance, requested one participant's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks . Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University asked 23 users of Android's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests, according to a report by Elizabeth Dwoskin in the Wall Street Journal. They found that even when an app provided a location based service, some attempted to collect more data than was needed. Groupon, for instance, requested one participant's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks. Meanwhile, the Weather Channel's app requested device location an average 2,000 times, or every 10 minutes. The main focus of the study, however, was on how users reacted to how often their data was being shared. They received a daily message, or 'privacy nudge,' telling them how many times information such as location, contact lists or phone call logs had been shared. Some nudges were alarming. One notable example: 'Your location has been shared 5,398 times with Facebook, Groupon, GO Launcher EX and seven other apps in the last 14 days.' When the participants were given access to AppOps, they collectively reviewed their app permissions 51 times and restricted 272 permissions on 76 distinct apps . '4,182 (times) – are you kidding me?' one participant asked. 'It felt like I'm being followed by my own phone. It was scary. That number is too high.' Another participant said: 'The number (356 times) was huge, unexpected.' 'The vast majority of people have no clue about what's going on,' said Norman Sadeh, a professor in the School of Computer Science's Institute for Software Research. 'Most smartphone users, in fact, have no way of obtaining this data about app behaviour. But the study shows that when they do, they tend to act rapidly to change their privacy settings.' Millions of people are being spied on by free apps they have installed on their mobile phones, security experts have warned. Many flashlight apps which allow a device to be used as a torch also secretly record the most sensitive personal information. This may include the location of the phone, details of its owner and their contacts, and even the content of text messages. The data is then transmitted to market research companies and advertising agencies to track user’s shopping habits, experts claim. But it is also suspected that criminal gangs, hackers and identity thieves have developed torch apps of their own to obtain personal data about consumers which could give them access to their bank accounts. The most popular flashlight apps for Android smartphones have been downloaded tens of millions of times. They include the Super-Bright LED Flashlight, the Brightest Flashlight Free and the Tiny Flashlight+LED. But few customers realise that many programs have capabilities far beyond switching on the phone’s light, according to American cyber-security firm SnoopWall, whose founder Gary Miliefsky has advised the US government. The study used a permission manager for Android 4.3 called AppOps. During the first week of the study, app behaviour data was collected for 23 people as they used their own Android mobile devices. In the second week, they were given access to AppOps, and in the third and final phase they received the daily privacy nudges detailing the frequency at which their sensitive information was accessed by their apps. The researchers found that app permission managers were helpful. When the participants were given access to AppOps, they collectively reviewed their app permissions 51 times and restricted 272 permissions on 76 distinct apps. Only one participant failed to review permissions. But once the participants had set their preferences over the first few days, they stopped making changes. When they began getting the privacy nudges, however, they went back to their privacy settings and further restricted many of them. During this phase, which spanned eight days, users collectively reviewed permissions 69 times, blocking 122 additional permissions on 47 apps. 'App permission managers are better than nothing, but by themselves they aren't sufficient,' Sadeh said. 'The fact that users respond to privacy nudges indicate that they really care about privacy, but were just unaware of how much information was being collected about them.' The AppOps software was discontinued on later versions of Android. While iPhones do have a privacy manager, it does not tell users how often their information is used or for what purpose.","Some apps for Android are tracking movements every three minute .
This means they collect location data roughly 6,200 times over two weeks .
Most smartphone users have no idea how closely they are being tracked ."
"Man who would be President: Texas Senator Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his bid on Monday . Ted Cruz will reportedly announce his intention to run for President of the United States this Monday, which would make him the first officially declared hopeful in the 2016 election. The Texas Republican senator, who is still in his first term of Congress, is due to commit himself to a presidential campaign at a speech in Virginia next week, according to senior advisers. Aides in the Cruz camp spoke about his intentions to the Houston Chronicle, but insisted on remaining anonymous. Cruz will hope to triumph against other GOP front-runners such as Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Rand Paul to win his party's nomination. The Chronicle reported that Cruz will announce at a convocation ceremony held at Liberty University, Virginia, the world's largest Christian university. Sketching out his campaign strategy, Cruz aides said he will hope to raise more than $40million to help him compete in the primary campaign. Cruz is said to be skipping the step of forming an 'exploratory committee', which Jeb Bush has already taken, and will directly announce the bid. He will hope that his conservative credentials will play well with the Tea Party wing of the GOP, and also rely on scooping up second and third-preference votes from less convinced voters. Though he lacks the clout of other candidates within Washington and the political establishment, strategists admit, they hope that with the voters of key states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, he will be able to carry the day nonetheless. However, Cruz remains an outlier in a busy Republican field. A poll earlier this month, from Quinnipiac University, gave him 6 per cent of the GOP vote. Men to beat: Jeb Bush, left, and Scott Walker, right, both command more GOP support than Cruz. Bush has formed an 'exploratory committee' for his bid, while Walker has yet to announce . In comparison, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker took 18 per cent, former Florida governor Jeb Bush won 16, with three other hopefuls still polling better than Cruz. However wins the Republican nomination will still have to win out against the Democratic contender, most likely Hillary Clinton, to take the White House next year. Nobody else has outright declared an intention to run yet. However, MSNBC reported last week that Rand Paul is planning to announce on April 7. The Kentucky senator will reportedly make the direct announcement is Louisville, which would give Cruz a two-week head start.","Texas senator will reportedly declare his candidacy in Virginia on Monday .

"A Queensland retiree has travelled across Australia knitting fake breasts for cancer survivors and documented her journey in a series of scenic photographs. Retiree Dawn Toomey, 69, from Deception Bay, north of Brisbane, drove around the country with her husband Ray for three months last year sightseeing and making prostheses – called 'Knitted Knockers' – to be donated to women who have undergone mastectomies. Ms Toomey's husband Ray took pictures of her knitting in all the spots they visited in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Retiree Dawn Toomey, 69, travelled across Australia knitting fake breasts for cancer survivors . Ms Toomey got the idea from her daughter, who read an article about the charity Knitted Knockers Australia and suggested she get involved .

Ms Toomey got the idea from her daughter, who read an article about the charity Knitted Knockers Australia and suggested she get involved. In three months Ms Toomey knitted 128 breasts, and after returning home to Queensland she set up a local branch of the charity. There are 15 around Australia including the head office in Burwood Victoria. Knitted Knockers provides volunteers with 100 per cent cotton yarn, which they buy at a discounted price from Bendigo Woolen Mills with money fundraised by the organisation. 'Wool is no good, people get itchy with wool, but the cotton is very soft,' Ms Toomey said. Ms Toomey said the Knitted Knockers are very popular with women who have had mastectomies and have decided not to undergo breast reconstructions.

'The very first person I gave a set of prostheses to was my friend Brenda, she had been wearing a heavy silicon prosthesis,' she said. 'If they sit against the body people get a heat rash, they are hot and heavy. 'When I actually gave her a set of knitted knockers she was just in tears. 'If you just wear weightless ones it still makes you look feminine without the weight of the silicon.'

"A couple are going to have to completely redecorate their nursery and fund a new wardrobe for their newborn baby boy after being told they were expecting a girl. After buying dresses, kitting out a pink nursery and choosing a girl's name, James Radley and Clair Evan, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, were delighted when doctors told them they were expecting a girl in October. After five months preparing for the birth of their new daughter, Clair, 23, began having contractions in the early hours of Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Surprise! Clair Evans and gave birth to son Hugo after being told she was having a girl . But following a quick labour at Hull Women and Children's Hospital, the couple were shocked when rather than the new daughter they were expecting, she gave birth to a healthy, 8lb 7oz baby boy. Clair said: 'As soon as I had given birth we asked the midwife if she was OK and the doctor put him on me and said he was a boy. 'I said some choice words and James started laughing. I thought, 'it can't be a boy, everything I have bought is pink!' 'Of course we were just happy he was healthy. 'When they placed him on me, I thought 'what do I do now?'' The couple were told at a 20-week scan that they were expecting a baby girl and  chose the name Eden Elsie . The couple spent £400 on decorating their nursery and buying clothes for the daughter they were expecting . The couple, from Beverley, Yorkshire, have named their new arrival Hugo and James Radley said he was shocked but delighted. The 34-year-old who has a three-year-old daughter, Olivia, from a previous relationship, said: 'I am over the moon. 'It is all a bit surreal. The first thing I did when we got home was order Hugo a Newcastle United outfit.' The couple were told at a 20-week scan that they were expecting a baby girl and had already chosen the name Eden Elise. Clair said: 'We were really happy. I was in particular because I think every girl wants a girl and we thought it would be nice for Liv to have a little sister. 'We got all of the nursery things and co-ordinated her room. I had a baby shower and got lots of girly things.' The couple also revealed how friends and family initially did not believe them when they were told Clair had given birth to a boy. Clair said: 'We are quite a comical couple so we weren't surprised when people said they didn't believe us. Happy Families: Hugo is the first son for the couple and James has a three-year-old daughter, Olivia, from a previous relationship . Think Blue: The couple had a pink baby shower and rushed to get their nursery decorated in time after moving house. They are waiting to redo the room for their son . 'We had to send people a picture of him. I'm just thankful I didn't buy a pink pram.' The couple had a mad dash to buy new baby clothes on Thursday morning. James Radley said: 'We found out on Clair's 20 week scan that we were expecting a girl. 'Two weeks later we named her Eden-Elsie and we spent the next 18 weeks buying pink clothes. 'We moved house just three weeks before Clair was due so it was a massive rush to get our pink nursery decorated in time. 'Clair had a pink baby shower and we had a wardrobe full of pink outfits for our new arrival. 'We spent around £400 on our unborn baby girl so when Clair went into labour we had no idea that we were about to meet a boy. 'We just turned to each other and laughed when we were told he wasn't a girl. 'Obviously we were thrilled to have a son but it was a huge shock. 'All the outfits we had bought to the hospital were pink so I had to dash out and buy him something blue to go home in. 'Our parents thought we were joking when we said we had a boy and we had to send them pictures for them to believe us. 'We named our baby boy Hugo and we are now waiting to redecorate his nursery. 'Our three year old, Liv, keeps calling him Eden though as she's still a little confused that he's actually her brother, not sister!'","Clair Evans, 23, from Beverley, told she was having a girl .

"Residents of rural communities could be forced to travel miles to their nearest bank after the biggest lenders refused to commit to never shut the ‘last bank in town’. After months of negotiation, the Government failed to secure the crucial agreement to protect customers, as bank bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking. The High street banks have agreed to new industry-wide rules setting out a series of steps they must take before closing branches. Blame it on the internet: As they refuse to commit to never closing 'the last bank in town', bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking . But critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country – even when there is no other bank in the community. Under the new regime banks will have to consult with local communities before any branch closure and ensure there are alternatives for customers such as free cash machines, ‘mobile banking vans’, and a local Post Office where they can sort out their finances. Existing rules stipulate that they have to go through this process only if they are closing the last branch in a town or village. Banks also have to give 12 weeks’ notice before they shut a branch. Business secretary Vince Cable described the new ‘protocol’ as a ‘major step forward’ in ensuring those who do not bank online are ‘not left behind’. But last night Labour described the rules as another ‘nail in the coffin for the High street’, as all the major lenders have now ditched a previous commitment always to keep open the ‘last bank in town’. Vince Cable described the new ‘protocol’ as a ‘major step forward’ in ensuring those who do not bank online are ‘not left behind’ Lloyds became the last to do so in October, as it announced a three year plan to shut 200 branches and open 50. Efforts by Mr Cable to force banks to reinstate this commitment have been rejected and experts have warned that 978 branches around the country are now at risk. In total more than 500 branches are expected to be shut during the course of the year, with 210 closures announced so far. Of these 124 are the last branch in the community. For example, some 8,000 residents of Keynworth in Nottinghamshire have been left without a bank after the closure of their local NatWest branch earlier this year. and St Agnes in Cornwall has also lost its only branch after Barclays put down the shutters for the final time. There are now just over 9000 bank branches across the country, half the number of 25 years ago. Derek French from the Campaign for Community Banking said efforts by the coalition to beef up protection for consumers have failed. He said: . ‘The government is trying to gloss over the fact that in reality it has achieved nothing and will not prevent hundreds of branches from disappearing from Britain’s high streets. This is hugely damaging for local communities. The hardest hit will be small businesses, the elderly and the vulnerable – who rely heavily on their local bank’. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said: ‘This is a massive embarrassment for Vince Cable. Local communities sometimes rely on the basic services of a branch and this feels very much like another bail in the coffin for the High Street.’ The bosses of all the major banks have justified the closure of branches by stressing the soaring popularity of digital banking – both online and on smart phones. They have also argued it is not viable to keep certain branches open because so few customers use them. Royal Bank of Scotland boss Ross McEwan last year described its busiest branch as the 7.01am train from Reading to London Paddington, with over 167,000 using its mobile banking app between 7am and 8am on their commute to work every day. The British Bankers’ Association says internet and mobile banking is now used for transactions worth £6.4 billion a week – up from £5.8 billion last year. But according to charity Age UK, more than a third of older people have mobility problems making travelling long distances to their nearest branch difficult. Almost 15pc have limited dexterity which means it is hard to use the internet while 4.8 million people aged 65 and over have never been online. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK said: ‘Accessing cash and paying bills are essential services which must be easily available to everyone. But the combination of bank and building society closures, particularly in rural areas, and the industry’s growing reliance on online services mean access has become increasingly difficult for many older people.’ Vince Cable has said that the Post Office can play a vital role in providing an alternative for bank customers. Most banks already offer basic services via the Post Office’s 11,500 branches.","Biggest lenders refused to commit to never shut ‘last bank in town’

The helpless 36-year-old was beaten so badly that he feared he was going to die. He was  left with a fractured eye socket and severe bruising all over his body. Scroll down for video . This is the horrifying moment a vicious thug stamped on a shopkeeper's head six times as he lay unconscious on the floor during a terrifying newsagents raid . The shocking CCTV footage shows shop owner Naresh Nagarajah being pinned to the ground by a hooded robber, while a second man mercilessly stamps on his skull as he tries to crawl away . Nottinghamshire Police released the 66-second CCTV footage today in a bid to track down the three culprits . Sickeningly, a third man, who does not appear to be involved in the beating, is seen stepping over Mr Nagarajah, as his two accomplices continue with the brutal assault. Speaking after the attack, Mr Nagarajah, who has owned and run the shop for eight years, said: 'I remember being hit and kicked and trying to escape. I thought I was going to die.' The attack, which Mr Nagarajah says has left him 'traumatised', took place after the three men walked into MV Supermarket in Arnold, Nottingham, just as the shop was closing on March 3. The video shows the three thugs knocking over stacks of cans, before one of the men begins punching the father-of-two to the ground. After leaving him unconscious, the men then flee from the store with around £5,000 worth of cigarettes. Nottinghamshire Police released the 66-second CCTV footage today in a bid to track down the culprits. Mr Nagarajah added: 'When I think about what happened, it's very scary.

'It was around closing time, I had gone out to close one of the two metal shutters, then just popped back into the store to turn off the CCTV screens, and then turned round and the men were there. 'It was so traumatic and horrendous that I think I have blacked out several parts of it.' He added: 'They had metal things on their hands. One of them was holding me. He sat on me and punched me.

'Apparently when they had left I phoned the police, but I don't remember that and I don't remember going to hospital. 'I looked back at the CCTV afterwards and a man actually stops a few metres after walking past the shop, because he has obviously heard something, but then after three or four seconds he walks off again.'

'The injuries he suffered, as nasty as they were, could have been so much worse. 'We are releasing this footage because we believe someone in Nottinghamshire knows who these men are. 'Perhaps you recognise something about their clothing or the way they carry themselves. Or maybe you have heard someone bragging about the robbery.

"Comotion: A meeting of Staffordshire bull terriers turned into a brawl in Halesowen, West Midlands . Their pet dogs have an unfortunate reputation for aggression, but now it’s angry bull terrier breeders who are in the dog house – after their club meeting erupted into a furious row. Insults and punches were said to have been exchanged at the annual meeting of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, and police are investigating after a 56-year-old woman complained that she was assaulted. The incident resulted in the club president and other officers resigning on the spot. The drink-fuelled events were the culmination of a long-standing row over a vote for a club officer at the previous year’s meeting. About 90 people turned up at Cradley Labour Club in Halesowen, West Midlands, last month for the meeting. According to the club, one of its aims is to ‘foster a feeling of fellowship among fanciers’. But trouble started when president Barbara Beaufoy was asked by member Marie Stokes, from Walsall, why there was no record in the minutes of concerns about the handling of the vote for the officer in 2014. A witness, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Mrs Beaufoy said, “Sit down, you silly little girl. We don’t have to listen to scum like you”. Marie then stormed out.’ The witness said that as Mrs Stokes left, another delegate, Graham Hyde, started slow hand-clapping and chanting: ‘Out! Out! Out!’ Mr Hyde – who is approved by the Kennel Club to judge Staffie shows – was asked by club member Karon Jackson, from Cannock, Staffordshire, to keep order. The witness said: ‘He started shouting at her and arguing with her because she’d asked him to sit down. Then I heard someone say he’d hit Karon – he’d arm-punched her in the chest.’ Invitation A poster for the Staffordshire bull terrier show which took place on Sunday February 22 . Another source, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘We are working hard to improve the image of Staffies and this happens. We think it was because the bar was open and the meeting went to pieces after people had a few drinks.’ Mr Hyde, 57, denied hitting Mrs Jackson and said he was assaulted. ‘There was no way I landed a finger on Karon Jackson,’ he said. ‘I was verbally and physically attacked. I admit I applauded and shouted when Marie Stokes walked out because I was glad to see her leave.’ Brawl: About 90 people turned up at Cradley Labour Club (above) in Halesowen, West Midlands, last month for the meeting in which a fight broke out . The meeting descended into chaos when Mrs Beaufoy and the other club officers resigned and walked out. Mrs Jackson has made a formal statement to Staffordshire Police. Neither she nor Mrs Stokes were available for comment. West Midlands Police said: ‘We have been made aware of an allegation of assault.’ A Kennel Club spokeswoman said: ‘We are aware of the situation but cannot comment further.’ Mrs Beaufoy said: ‘The Kennel Club is dealing with the matter.’","Insults and punches said to have been exchanged at the annual meeting .

"A leopard was given a very prickly reception after it tried to make lunch out of a plucky porcupine. The predator was put firmly in its place after the spiky creature refused to back down during a fight in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Concern for the porcupine - armed with sharp quills - soon faded as it put on an aggressive show and proved more than a match for the confused leopard.

A leopard had its confidence roundly spiked after being pricked by a plucky porcupine during a fight in Kruger National Park, South Africa . The young leopard faced up to the porcupine after the pair had tumbled out of a bush and into the road. Wildlife enthusiast Lisl Moolman, 41, caught the bizarre battle while out on the road and armed with her camera . Looking slightly uncertain, the predator sizes up his opponent for dinner, pacing from side to side as he decides the best course of attack . But concern for the porcupine - armed with sharp quills - soon fades as it put on an aggressive show and proved more than a match for the confused leopard . The amusing pictures show the sharp skirmish with the spotted cat. She had been driving along the road when she saw the leopard dart across. Minutes later the leopard and porcupine tumbled out of the bushes and began to fight. Ms Moolman said: 'The porcupine was a worthy opponent. It was quite aggressive and shaking its quills, raising them to appear larger. 'The leopard was certainly inexperienced. Reluctant to give up the fight, the leopard prowls after his plucky opponent, eyeing up his armour for a weak spot . But it seems he has been outwitted by the spikey warrior, who scuttles off after delivery a prickly blow to the leopard's paw . The battle over, the leopard lies on the ground and gives up as the porcupine walks away unscathed. Ms Moolman stayed with the battling creatures for twenty minutes before the leopard gave up and walked off to lick its wound on its front leg .

"Heather Mack, facing a death sentence if she is convicted of murdering her mother, took her new-born baby daughter back to hospital on Friday after the child showed no signs of improvement from her earlier sickness. Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella. A prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition. Scroll down for video . Second visit: Heather Mack, facing a death sentence if she is convicted of murdering her mother, took her new-born baby daughter (pictured) back to hospital on Friday after the child still showed signs of illness . Improper treatment: Doctors are reported to have been shocked at the lack of motherly attention shown to baby Stella and a prison source said medical staff were appalled at the baby's dirty condition . 'The mother appears not to have been washing her properly, if at all, ' the source told Dailymail.com exclusively. It is understood there are concerns that because the baby has not been kept clean the area where the umbilical cord was cut might become infected. 'The baby's high fever is more of a concern than the jaundice,' said the source. Miss Mack, 19, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital - where she gave birth to Stella Schaefer last week - after pleading for the baby to receive ‘proper hospital treatment’. After baby Stella developed a high fever and her skin took on a yellowish colour - an indication of jaundice - the child was taken on Wednesday to the clinic inside the walls of Kerobokan prison. Seeking help: Miss Mack, 19, pictured on Friday, obtained permission from the Bali Prosecutor’s office to return, under guard, to the Sanglah Hospital so her baby could get 'proper hospital treatment' Neglect claims: When baby Stella returned to the hospital on Friday with her mother Heather Mack, 19, and the pair waited for medical treatment in a busy  room . With Miss Mack and her co-accused boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer - the baby’s father - looking on, clinic staff treated the baby with medicines, but her condition did not improve. Throughout Thursday, Miss Mack pleaded to be allowed to return to hospital with the baby, but she was told this would not be allowed until the Prosecutor’s office gave permission. She had to wait a further 24 hours before that permission was given - and today Miss Mack was helped into an ambulance with the baby and taken to the hospital. Newborn: Heather Mack is pictured above leaving hospital for Kerobokan prison in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday where her child fell ill . Tiny: Miss Mack's shawl briefly slips and the head of the tiny baby, famous even before she was born, was revealed on Monday . Jaundice in new-born babies is most commonly caused by immature livers being unable to remove bilirubin from the blood. Baby Stella was born several weeks early in a caesarian operation and medical experts say early births can result in jaundice, which will eventually go away. But prison sources said today that while this was explained to Miss Mack, she is understood to have been concerned about the baby’s high temperature. She is also understood to be under pressure from her boyfriend’s mother, Ms Kia Walker, to make arrangements for the baby to be taken away from the prison cell and raised in a healthier environment. Trial: Mack (left) and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (right), both from Chicago, are accused of murdering Mack's socialite mother Sheila Von Weise-Mack, 62, and hiding her body in a suitcase at an upmarket Bali hotel . It is not known whether Ms Walker has offered to take care of her grand-daughter, but Miss Mack made it clear before the baby’s birth that she intended to keep her daughter with her for the permitted period of two years, should she still be in prison during that period. She and Tommy Schaefer, 21, are facing separate trials for the same crime - the murder of Ms Mack’s 62-year-old socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack, who was murdered in a Bali hotel room last year. The prosecution alleges that Schaefer killed Mrs Wiese-Mack by battering her about the head and face with the metal handle from a heavy fruit bowl, after which Miss Mack helped him to force the body into a suitcase which was then loaded into the boot of a waiting taxi. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel - and Mrs Mack was allegedly the only person who had permission to open the box. Miss Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel.

Cara Strobel said she and fellow travellers were waiting inside the terminal when the truck crashed into one of the Boeing 737’s engines as the plane sat on the snowy apron. She told MailOnline Travel that an official at the airport said the truck was unoccupied and left in gear, allowing it roll into the jet engine near a fuel tank. The 25-year-old, who was heading to Florida for a family holiday, said: ‘All of a sudden we saw the reflections of the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles and an announcement was made that we would be delayed. As a precaution Southwest Airlines decided to ground the plane and bring in a replacement aircraft . ‘I unfortunately don't know the details of how it happened, but it looks as though the rear of the truck was what hit the engine. ‘As far as I know, no one was injured. If anything it looked like a ""fender bender"" and they're sending us a replacement as a precaution. ‘I'd much rather have a new plane and have them check out this one.’ The back end of the truck collided with one of the plane's engines on the airport's snowy apron . A Southwest Airlines spokesperson told MailOnline Travel that no one was on board the plane at the time of the collision. The spokesperson said the truck belonged to a different airline. Cara said Southwest Airlines staff informed passengers that they would be delayed by about two hours as a replacement plane was brought in from Washington, DC. The spokesperson for the Dallas-based airline said: ‘The 119 customers will arrive at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport about two-and-half hours behind schedule and our employees are working to accommodate any travel needs created by the delay. ‘We thank our delayed customers for their patience as our people worked to recover from the operational curveball and deliver those customers safely to their destinations.’","Passengers were waiting inside the terminal when the collision occurred .

"Half of the terror attacks carried out or plotted in Britain involve members of just one extremist network, a new report reveals. Al-Muhajiroun, a banned organisation once fronted by hate preacher Anjem Choudary, has been linked to a series of atrocities and plots dating back to 1997. A new book by terrorism expert Raffaello Pantucci has now found that since its formation in the 1980s, the group has been central to Islamic extremism in the UK. More than 20 terror attacks plotted or carried out in the UK - including the 7/7 bombings which killed 52 people - have been linked to extremist network al-Muhajiroun in a new report . It is thought the first known violence directly linked to the group took place in 1997, when a member of the organisation attacked a police officer. At least one of the bombers who carried out London's 7/7 bombings had met a key supporter of al-Muhajiroun, Omar Khyam, before the attacks which killed 52 people on underground trains and a bus in 2005. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby in a street in Woolwich, south-east London in 2013, had both attended events organised by the group. Despite having been banned in 2005, the group has morphed to take on a series of other names, and its influence continues to be felt, with Brustholm Ziamani, who was sentenced last week for plotting an attack inspired by that on Lee Rigby, also having been inspired by al-Muhajiroun. Research shows that out of 51 attacks and plots carried out or foiled in Britain, al-Muhajiroun had influence in at least 23. Mr Pantucci, who studies extremism for defence forum The Royal United Services Institute, said the group sold its followers a radical interpretation of Islam which often inspired them to  commit violence. He told MailOnline: 'It is an oversimplification just to write them off as outcasts or losers, some of them have been involved in quite serious gang activity or crime in the past and end up finding this as a kind of redemption for their activity. 'You also have to remember that some of the top figures are quite charismatic people who are good at drawing people in and given them these very aggressive ideas.' Hate preacher Anjem Choudary (left) was once a leader of the group before it was banned. Supporter Omar Khyam (right) met up with at least one of the London bombers before they carried out the 2005 attack . Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed (left), pictured with radical cleric Abu Hamzu (right) Mr Pantucci said that the group's influence had been underestimated in the past and hoped his book - whose title We Love Death As You Love Life is taken from quotation by one of the 7/7 bombers - would encourage politicians to crack down on the organisation and its spin-offs. He added: 'These people are very good at being in the periphery and the background without ever having their hands on the device or being directly implicated in plots, which would see them given heavier sentences. 'I think constant disruption of the group is not a bad thing. By proscribing these groups you force them to change their name, their website, which inhibits them, also by arresting them on more minor charges you take them off the streets for a time.' Al-Muhajiroun was set up by Omar Bakri Mohammed, a Syria-born Islamic extremist who lived in Britain from 1986 until he was banned from returning in 2005 after going to Lebanon. Anjem Choudary, who remains in Britain, later became the public face of the organisation, which re-emerged as groups called Islam4UK and Need4Khalafah after it was banned.

Then-al- Muhajiroun leader Bakri Mohammed says its possible he was 'one of their number'. 2002: US journalist was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan. London-born Omar Saeed, a member of al- Muhajiroun, is later convicted over the plot and remains in prison in Pakistan. 2004: Five men, four of whom are thought to have been members of al-Muhajiroun, were caught by police while plotting to build a huge fertiliser bomb, which they dicussed setting off in the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent or the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London.

Mohammed Chowdhury, one of four men convicted over the plot, had been an activist for al-Muhajiroun. 2013: Richard Dart, a Muslim convert who was a key member of al-Muhajiroun spin-off Muslims against Crusades, is jailed for plotting to attack soldiers in Royal Wotton Bassett. 2013: Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who had both attended al-Muhajiroun events, kill Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich. 2015: Brusthom Ziamani jailed for planning a Lee Rigby-style attack.

"Beautifully and intricately crafted, this wooden temple is the product of two years of hard work and planning - and on Saturday night it will be burnt to the ground. The stunning 75ft timber sculpture is the work of renowned American artist David Best, famed for his wooden temple creations set alight during Nevada's annual Burning Man festival. Towering into the sky in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, the structure was made by Catholics and Protestants working together to honour those who died in the Troubles. Scroll down for video . Spectacular: This towering structure in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, is the work of renowned American Burning Man artist David Best . During the Northern Irish conflict in the late 20th century, more than 3,600 people were killed and thousands more were injured as paramilitaries and security forces fought each other over a period of 30 years. Symbolically, many of the commemorative temple's panels were designed and made by more than 100 young people from around the city. The structure, which features a giant wooden chandelier hanging down from a central spire, has been open since last Saturday and members of the public have been encouraged to scrawl messages and leave mementos in tribute to lost loved ones. The temple, located in Corrody Road Country Park, was organised by Artichoke, a charity which works with artists to create large-scale events, and will be burnt on Saturday March 21 at dusk. Thousands of people have already visited the impressive creation and a number of poignant messages are visible across the intricate panels of wood. Bonfires have traditionally been a source of division in the city of Londonderry, also referred to as Derry. Majestic: Workers are pictured in Londonderry's Corrody Road Country Park at sunset during the construction of the impressive creation . Bonfires have traditionally been a source of division in the city of Londonderry, also referred to as Derry, but the temple is about unity . Huge towers made of wooden pallets are set alight every year to celebrate the victory of King William of Orange over Catholic King James in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. US artist Best decided to turn the tradition on its head - creating a work of art that Catholic and Protestants could work on together and burn in a symbol of peace. Best has now produced eight temples for the Burning Man Festival, which takes place in the Nevada every August, and each one has had its own name, with 2014's creation named the Temple of Grace. Helen Marriage, director of Artichoke, said the project was building on the legacy of Derry's City of Culture. Speaking to Belfast Live, she said: 'Ever since we began working in Derry-Londonderry in 2012, I have been interested in how our work might begin to undermine some of the long-held fears and anxieties prevalent in the city. 'David Best's work was always part of my thinking and I'm really pleased we've been able to return to build on the legacy of Lumiere. 'Temple offers a new take on the bonfire tradition, creating a shared space that welcomes everyone.'

"Chinese officials have taken an unusual step in the fight against scrap metal thieves by starting to fit their manholes with GPS tracking devices. Councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high-tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old, low-tech versions, according to the People's Daily Online. The seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red-faced, turning for sale in various places around the world. High tech: The new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves . Problem: More than 240,000 manholes were stolen in Beijing over a 10 year period, thanks to metal values . The chains also proved unpopular, with many pointing out they could easily be cut, and were dangerous for people walking along the street. One man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face, thanks to the chain. It is hoped these new covers, which were developed by a Chinese tech company, will not only put would-be thieves off stealing the items, but also help track those who do give into temptation. The covers, along with drain grills, can fetch high prices on the black market, as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years. It has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone. Measures: Previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked . The new covers, designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features, are made out of a metal with a far lower value, as a further deterrent. A test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of Hangzhou this month,  and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city. But it is not just about the money. Officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well, as people could trip on an upturned manhole. Tao Xiaomin, of Hangzhou urban management office, explained: 'When a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees, the tag will send an alarm signal to us.'","New high-tech covers hope to curb the number of thefts on China's streets .

"Gone: Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building last Wednesday after school . The father of missing Minnesota fourth-grader Barway Collins took out a $30,000 life insurance in his son's name before the boy vanished nearly two weeks ago, it emerged today. Barway Collins 10, was last seen after school March 18 near his apartment complex in Crystal. Police said they were working to find the boy and were checking flights to see whether he might have been sent overseas to his mother, believed to be in Liberia. Last week, Police Chief Stephanie Revering named Barway's father, Pierre Collins, a suspect in the child's disappearance, saying the man who was seen weeping at a vigil has not been entirely honest with investigators. Mr Collins has stopped talking to the press about his son's suspected abduction amid mounting suspicions concerning his alleged involvement in the case. Fox 9 reported Tuesday that according to sources, Mr Collins, 33, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. Police said the father failed a lie-detector test  last week, but he has not been arrested or charged with any crime as of Tuesday morning. Pastor Harding Smith, who has been acting as the family's spokesperson, said Collins has told him he had nothing to do with his son's abduction. In a recent interview with CNN's Nancy Grace, Collins said he last saw Barway as he was getting ready for school on the morning of March 18. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway’s father has not been completely truthful with us': Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering, right, releases a videoshowing 10-year-old Barway Collinson a school bus prior to his disappearance . Grilled: Pierre Collins, accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last week, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional . Police have released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an ‘uncle’ are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway’s father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. 'There's my dad': The footage in question  (pictured) also has audio and, police say, as the bus pulled up to Barway's building he pointed out his father and an uncle. Previously, police had been searching for anyone who might have seen Barway at that point, the moment of his disappearance . Emotional? Barway Collins' father, Pierre Collins, wipes away tears as he stands with his wife, Yamah, and supporters at vigil Monday for their missing son. Police say Pierre failed a lie-detector test and is not sharing everything he knows . Over the past 13 days, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies have been searching the area for Barway with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses. Officials are now focusing their search efforts along the Mississippi River south of Interstate 694, where Pierre Collins was spotted walking in a park after his son went missing. A $12,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the person responsible for Barway Collins' disappearance. According to the Crystal Police Department, a man and woman pictured in a screen shot from a CCTV camera installed at the front entrance of the Cedarwood apartment complex may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school. So far, the mystery couple have not been named as suspects or even persons of interest in the case. Missing? Massive billboards have sprung up to help in the search for Barway, but now police have started to wonder just how missing he truly is . Pierre Collins and his wife Yamah , stand with supporters at a vigil a week ago in Crystal. Police now say they are working to find the boy and checking flights to see whether he might have been sent overseas to his mother, believed to be in Liberia . Outpouring of support: A young boy adds a donation for Barway Collins' family to the pile during the vigil last Monday . Inside job? Police have not issued an Amber Alert saying the 10-year-old (center) may be with someone he knows . While law enforcement officials continued searching for the missing fourth-grader, members of Crystal's Liberian community were busy handing out fliers featuring Barway's picture to help bring him home. At around 5pm last Monday, more than 100 people gathered outside Cedarwood apartments for an emotional prayer vigil. 'We miss Barway,' his father, Pierre Collins, told the crowd. 'Barway has been gone for a very long time now. We are begging and asking everyone to look out there.' Chief Revering also attended the gathering, promising Barway's family to continue looking for him until he is found, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune. Barway was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Mr Collins and his wife, Yamah, said the entrance surveillance camera caught their son opening the front door to the building, looking inside and then closing it, as if someone called him outside. 'Please just bring him back. We just want Barway back. We don't want anything from them. Just let him go. Just let him come home,' the parents begged, according to KARE11. Collins is described as 5 feet tall, weighing 80lbs with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white T-shirt, black pants, red shoes and carrying a red school backpack. Anyone with information on Barway Collins' whereabouts is being asked to call police.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building March 18 after school .

Ben Stack, 40, has warned other Far North Queensland fishermen to be wary while out on the water after he came face-to-face with the salt water crocodile on a recent trip. Mr Stack was fishing in a small creek in Cape York when the Threadfin salmon he had just caught suddenly felt like a 'heavy dead weight'. A Cape York fisherman accidentally pulled in a crocodile that was taking a bite out of a salmon he had hooked . Ben Stack has warned other Far North Queensland fishermen to be wary while out on the water after he came face-to-face with the salt water crocodile . Mr Stack thought the fish was stuck  under a log, so he leaned over the side of the boat and started pulling in the line. 'I was hanging right over the side of the boat because I was trying to look in the dirty water to see what the fish was caught on,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Describing the close call in a post on his Cape York Guide to Explore, Hunt and Fish Facebook page, Mr Stack said what happened over the next few seconds 'felt like a lifetime'. 'First, I saw a bit of silver, then I saw my lure with the fish's mouth wide open,' he said. 'I lifted the leader some more and leaned over further to see what the fish was hooked up on. It was at this moment, I realised I was staring eye to eye with a solid salt water crocodile. Mr Stack said  he was grateful he was able to capture the incredible moment on film . 'We were face-to-face and no more than 20 inches (51cm) apart. Fright kicked in, I released the leader and flew backwards into the boat.' Mr Stack said he had his camera poised to take a photo of his catch, and he was grateful he was able to capture the incredible moment on film. 'I couldn't believe what I had just experienced and I didn't think anybody was going to believe me,' he said. 'Thankfully these pictures had turned out. 'Be careful while fishing creeks and rivers with crocodiles in them because one may be hiding under your boat.'","Ben Stack was fishing in Cape York when he pulled in a salt water croc .

"New video footage has emerged of tourists fleeing in fear after they hear the sounds of gunshots following a terror attack on a Tunisian museum. The terrifying short film shows how the visitors are enjoying a guided tour of the National Bardo Museum in Tunis before gunshots are fired, making the group jolt with surprise. Initially not sure what is happening, they hesitate and the tour stands still - but as the horror dawns on them, the group begin to run for their lives. Terror: Two tourists hold tightly onto each other as they run away from the sounds of gunshots during the attack on the National Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia . Disturb: The Italian group were being given a guided tour on the museum when they were disrupted by the sound of gunshots . Attack: The camera points towards the sound of the gunshots, where terrorists had opened fire on unsuspecting visitors. Isis have claimed responsibility for attack which killed 21 people . Italian publication La Repubblica posted the footage, which was shot on a device owned by tourists Marcello and Maria Rita Salvatori. The camera continues to roll as the tourists sprint away from the sound of gun shots, before congregating in hushed quiet in a small room as they try to work out what has happened. The new footage has emerged on the same day as Tunisian government and museum officials announced they have had to delay the re-opening of the centre because of security concerns. Afraid: The tourists huddle together after rushing away from the sound of guns being fired, and stay quiet to try and work out what is happening above . Head of communications at the museum Hanene Srarfihas revealed she expected the museum to open on Sunday instead. She said: 'We have been surprised at the last minute, but the interior ministry says that for security reasons we cannot receive a large number of visitors.' However an official ceremony marking the reopening of the museum went ahead on Tuesday as planned and was attended by Tunis residents, urging tourists to return to their country. Protest: Tunisians gather outside the National Bardo Musuem to demonstrate and plead for tourists to visit the country again . Demonstration: The campaigners carried signs and placards outside the centre, which was attacked by terrorists last week. Isis have claimed responsibility . Unsafe: While a ceremonial re-opening of the National Bardo Museum took place on Tuesday, security fears mean authorities had to cancel its formal re-opening to the public . Tension: A woman wrapped in the flag of Tunisia chants slogans during the demonstrations outside the National Bardo Museum, while security forces carrying guns control the entrance to the centre in Tunis . They shouted slogans and held placards, some of which read: 'Visit Tunisia' and 'Muslims are not terrorists'. Another said: 'I'm Tunisian. Islam is my religion and I love you ALL. Visit Tunisia. Peace.' Innocent: Tunisian children chant during the reopening of the Bardo Museum following deadly attacks in Tunis . Dress: Tunisians dressed in traditional costumes gather outside the National Bardo Museum during ceremonial reopening . The terror attack killed 21 people - including 17 cruise ship tourists - and two gunmen were killed by police. On Sunday Tunisia's president President Beji Caid Essebsi said a third attacker - the suspected mastermind - is still on the run following the massacre. Tight security: Tunisia's national museum (pictured with heavily armed Tunisian policemen on guard outside) has delayed a planned reopening after last week's attack on foreign tourists due to security concerns . Footage: News of the delayed reopening comes after a CCTV video was released showing a pair of gunmen roaming the Bardo, and appearing to allow one visitor to go free . Bardo curator Moncef Ben Moussa said that the museum is delaying the reopening, and it will probably reopen on Sunday instead. He did not elaborate on what prompted the last-minute change, citing only logistics and security. Authorities have arrested several people in the attack, the worst in Tunisia in 13 years, and are still hunting for the suspected mastermind. Officials have said none of the museum's major archaeological treasures suffered damage. Over the weekend President said the attack involved 'three aggressors' and the third man escaped. He was speaking live with French network iTele from inside the museum. Suspects have been arrested over the attack but it was previously believed just two gunmen launched the attack on the museum. The news comes after a video was released of the pair roaming the Bardo. The one-minute video posted on the government's Interior Ministry Facebook page shows the two men scurrying through the Tunis museum, carrying assault rifles and bags. Statement: On Sunday Tunisia's president President Beji Caid Essebsi (pictured) said a third attacker - the suspected mastermind - is still on the run following the massacre . Shattered: The walls and windows were peppered with bullet holes while unused grenades lay scattered among debris following last week's attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis . One of the attackers is wearing a baseball cap and a heavy jacket, while the other wears a red hooded jumper and tracksuit pants. At one point, they encounter another man with a backpack walking down a flight of stairs. They briefly acknowledge each other and let the unidentified man walk free before unleashing the deadly attack in the country's largest museum. The video also shows stills of the dead gunmen - named as Yassine Laabidi and Hatem Khachnaou - who were killed in a firefight with security forces, including a picture indicating at least one was wearing an explosive belt. Police responding to the attack shot and killed the two gunmen. They were identified as Tunisians in their 20s who had trained in Libya. Essebsi said the extremists who have recruited about 3,000 Tunisians to fight in Iraq and Syria have no credible connection to Islamic belief. He said his country was at war with them. 'When war is brought upon us, we will wage war,' he said. Yassine al-Abidi had breakfast with his family as normal on morning he and his fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui attacked the Bardo museum last Wednesday killing 21 people and injuring more than 60 others . Graphic: Al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui pictured were both killed after a four-hour standoff with special forces . ISIS claimed Wednesday's attack on foreign tourists in Tunis, the deadliest involving foreigners in Tunisia since a 2002 suicide bombing on the island of Djerba. Tunisian fighters make up a disproportionately high number of foreign recruits to ISIS in Syria, with as many as 10,000 having signed up. The government said the two gunmen had trained in jihadi camps in Libya before the attack inside the heavily secured Tunisian parliament compound. Police in Tunisia have arrested five people described as directly tied to the two gunmen. Four others said to be supporters of the cell were also arrested in central Tunisia, not far from where a group claiming allegiance to al Qaida's North African branch has been active. ISIS issued a statement and audio on jihadi websites applauding the dead gunmen as 'knights' for their 'blessed invasion of one of the dens of infidels and vice in Muslim Tunisia'. As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected. The government now plans to deploy the army to major cities to bolster security following the shootings.","New video shows moment tourist group hear the gunmen opening fire .

"A beauty therapist who was clinically dead for 30 minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest in bed was saved by her pet dog who howled for help. Joanna Mellor, 24, went into cardiac arrest after going to sleep next to her boyfriend Andrew Rayment, 27. Upon discovering she wasn't breathing, the couple's five-year-old pet Labrador, Leo, began barking. This woke Mr Rayment, who hurriedly dialled 999 and performed CPR on his girlfriend until paramedics arrived. Scroll down for video . Joanna Mellor, 24, suffered a cardiac arrest in her sleep, but her five-year-old dog Leo barked until her boyfriend woke up and realised she wasn't breathing . Leo barked until Miss Mellor's boyfriend Andrew woke up. Andrew dialled 999 and performed CPR on his girlfriend until paramedics came and she was rushed to hospital for life-saving treatment . In hospital, doctors said her heart had stopped for 30 minutes before Mr Rayment began CPR. She was able to make a full recovery after her cardiac arrest, something paramedics said is unheard of . Incredibly, doctors said Miss Mellor's heart had stopped for 30 minutes before Mr Rayment managed to resuscitate her. Miss Mellor, who lives with her boyfriend in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, has since been diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. This is a condition in which she has an extra electrical connection in the heart, causing it to beat abnormally fast, triggering a cardiac arrest. Miraculously, she has now made a full recovery. She said: 'I owe my life to my dog and my boyfriend. If Leo hadn't woken Andrew up I might not be here today. 'I remember going to bed and drifting off the sleep and the next I know I'm in intensive care in hospital and told I'd suffered a heart attack. 'The doctors say I was technically dead because it took Andrew 30 minutes to get my heart started. 'Andrew said he woke up with Leo barking and jumping up at my side of the bed and going mad. 'He says he could tell something was wrong with me and dialled 999 and the operator talked him through CPR. 'At first the doctors said I might be at risk of brain damage and I couldn't feel my legs and one of my hands was all limp but I've now made a full recovery.' Miss Mellor now says she 'owes her life' to her labrador Leo and her boyfriend Andrew Rayment, 27 . Miss Mellor's Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome had meant her heart began beating irregularly. This caused a cardiac arrest, where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers of 'fibrillates' instead. The heart stops pumping blood around the body, causing a person to lose consciousness and potentially die within minutes. Mr Rayment said he woke up to barking on January 2nd this year. He said: 'I was half asleep when Leo woke me up. 'I heard Joanna's breathing becoming erratic and I tried to wake her and tapped each side of her face, but she was unconscious so I called 999. 'My first thought was that I didn't want to waste the paramedics' time but when I was on the phone her breathing went from in and out to every few seconds. 'I tried not to panic and to stay focused. I kept thinking that the only chance she has relies on me doing the CPR properly.' Rescue crews from East Midlands Ambulance Service dashed to the scene in under 15 minutes before rushing her to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Paramedic Glenn Radford said: 'I've been on the job for 14 years and I've never seen anything like it. 'When people suffer cardiac arrests, quite often they are left with neurological problems. They don't usually make a 100 per cent recovery.'","Joanna Mellor went to sleep and suffered a potentially fatal cardiac arrest .

"California will run out of water in 12 months, according to a NASA scientist. The state only has one year of supply left in its reservoirs due to persistent drought and is also running out of backup groundwater, Jay Famiglietti, senior water scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, wrote. The drought means that total water storage in California, which has been in decline since 2002, has been sapped by the need to use the resource for farming, he said in the Los Angeles Times. Scroll down for video . Reservoirs in California such as Folsom Lake (pictured) in the state's north are now expected to run out of water in a year, according to NASA scientist Jay Famiglietti . The scientist suggested immediate water-rationing measures after a four year drought left reservoirs 34million acre-feet below normal last year . Since 2011 the state has been losing 12million acre-feet of water per year and the total amount of water in snow, rivers, groundwater and reservoirs was 34million acre-feet below normal in 2014. Famiglietti suggested immediate water-rationing measures, which are being considered in southern California, across the state. The use of groundwater for farming in the Central Valley has caused land to sink by one foot a year. Sprinklers and other landscaping accounts for 70 per cent of urban water use, according to the Sacramento Bee. Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency at the beginning of last year, though Californians only reduced their water usage by 9 per cent instead of a hoped-for 20 per cent. Beyond residents' consumpton, use of groundwater for farming in the Central Valley has caused land to sink by one foot a year. He also urged the acceleration of task forces and programs meant to ensure that California will have enough water in the future, which are currently slated to 'achieve sustainability' in 2042. The current drought in the western United States, which is entering its fourth year, is the worst in modern American history. Snowpacks in California mountains like the Sierra Nevadas, which the state relies to melt into water, have been near record lows this year. Scientists from NASA, Cornell University and Columbia University released research in February that said there could be worse droughts to come. Above, a water regulator looks at a plant irrigation system . Famiglietti said that efforts need to be accelerated before it's too late, because he'd 'like to live in a state that has a paddle so that it might also still have a creek'. Jay Famiglietti, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said he'd 'like to live in a state that has a paddle so that it might also still have a creek' Scientists from NASA, Cornell University and Columbia University released research in February that said there could be worse droughts to come. A 'Megadrought' that could last several decades and would be worse than any other such phenomenon in 1000 years is expected sometimes between 2050 and 2099, according to their research published in Science. The current dryness affects not only the West Coast, but also the rest of the country. California grows the majority of many fruits and vegetables for the US. Their produce makes up 69 per cent of carrots, 71 per cent of spinach, 99 per cent of artichokes and more than 90 per cent of broccoli, according to Slate. Famiglietti said that 'the public remains detached from discussions and decisions' about conserving water and urged them to take ownership of the crisis.","NASA's Jay Famiglietti urges acceleration of programs to save water .

"Arizona Coyotes radio analyst Nick Boynton has been placed on leave after biting a police officer as he was arrested during a fight at a casino, according to reports. The 36-year-old former NHL player is in police custody at Erie County Medical Center following the alleged incident at the Buffalo Creek Casino in Buffalo, New York on Wednesday night. He caused a disturbance at the casino and fought with Buffalo police officers assigned there to provide security, Buffalo Police Department spokesman Michael DeGeorge said. 'He was abusive to the staff at the casino, and when officers tried to take him into custody, he bit one of them on the finger,' a police source told the Buffalo News. Arrest: Nick Boynton, pictured playing for the Chicago Blackhawks in 2010, allegedly bit a police officer after he caused a disturbance in a casino on Wednesday night . The dad-of-four was arrested and will be charged with assault, criminal mischief and harassment. Boynton was in town for Thursday's Coyotes and Sabres game a few blocks away at the First Niagara Center, the Sabres' home ice. But it looks like he won't be commentating on the game as he was placed on a leave of absence by the team following the incident. Boynton joined the Coyotes' broadcast team in July 2014 after an 11-season career as a defenseman for six teams, including Arizona, skating in a total of 605 NHL games. Boynton, who now works as an analyst for the Arizona Coyotes, is pictured with his wife Jennifer . Scene: He was taken into custody following the incident at this casino in Buffalo, New York last night . He also played for the Chicago Blackhawks when the team won the Stanley Cup in 2010. The native of Nobleton, Ontario married reporter and Realtor Jen Patterson in 2012 and has four young children, including two from a previous relationship. Boynton, who was diagnosed with Type I diabetes at the age of 19, has also run 'Boynton Hock Camp' for youth hockey training in Vernon Hills, Illinois, according to his website.

"A couple who claim to be the world's first couple to have met online are celebrating 20 years together - after being among the first people to sign up to the first-ever internet dating site. Bill and Freddi Strauss, from San Fernando Valley, California, met on a primitive Match.com, a few weeks after it was launched in 1995, and married three years later. And now the loved-up couple are celebrating 20 years of being together. Bill and Freddi Strauss are now experts at 'selfies', but when they met, online dating was a new phenomenon and they had to ask friends to help them build an internet profile . Flashback: The couple on their wedding day after first getting together online . ‘We're definitely one of the first ever dates and we believe we're the first date that turned into a couple,' said 72-year-old Freddi. ‘When I first told my friends I was using the internet to find a boyfriend they were a bit anxious for me - because the internet itself was very new and online dating was unheard of! ‘But as soon as they met Bill they realised they didn't need to worry about anything.' Although today's online dating profiles are awash with dozens of perfect selfies, Freddi's profile didn't even have a picture - as she didn't know how to upload one. 'A friend had to help me set up the profile as the internet was very new,' said Freddi, a travel agent. Many adventures: Bill and Freddi enjoy a meal out, despite their first date in a restaurant not going to plan . The couple quickly fell in love after meeting online . ‘I just about managed to get the profile done but a picture was an ask too far! ‘He only had my personality and description to go on when I turned up for our first date.' After a week of messaging, the pair decided to start chatting on the phone and after another week decided to meet in person. A retired engineer, Bill said he believed their meeting was fate. 'I didn't know how I was going to get on with online dating - my picture was one of my better ones,' said the 76-year-old. ‘But as soon as I saw the lady walking in front of me I just knew it was Freddie. ‘I guess it was meant to be.’ Bill, determined to impress Freddi, chose a Chinese restaurant close to both of their homes and ordered the most expensive lobster dish on the menu. However, his idea of a romantic meal didn't go to plan when the bill came to more money than he had with him and Freddi had to chip in five dollars to cover the shortfall. 'It wasn't an impressive first date at all,' said Freddi, ‘But I wanted to go on a second date to make sure I got my five bucks back!’ Their next date didn't go any better after Freddi's perm went wrong and she tried to cancel their meeting scheduled for that weekend. When Bill said he didn't care what she looked like and arrived to pick her up anyway, Freddi opened the door with a paper bag complete with holes cut out for her eyes and mouth. Despite the awkward start, Freddi and Bill soon started seeing each other regularly and after 18 moths, Bill moved into Freddie's home, before they tied the knot 18 months later. The couple are celebrating 20 years together after meeting in California . Bill said he feel so luck to have met Freddi . The couple both had children from previous relationships and now dote on the seven grandchildren they share between them. 'Our wedding was charming,' said Freddi. 'It was in a restaurant and because we're Jewish we had a Huppa and lots of traditional elements. 'God only knows what would have happened if we hadn't had Match.com - I probably would have married someone boring from my Bridge club. 'At the time I just thought maybe it was time for me to get married so I started going out on dates and meeting people.’ Partners through time: Not only has the internet gone from strength to strength since 1995, so has Bill and Freddi's relationship . The couple now have seven grandchildren between them . 'I had been dating guys who were much younger but who acted like granddads so I decided to find someone my own age. 'I didn't really go out to bars and parties so I thought I would try Match.com . ""I was ready to give up and then he came along.. 'If I was advising women thinking about going online now, I'd have to warn them that there aren't that many great guys like Bill out there!' Bill added: 'I feel so lucky to have met Freddi. We got onto Match.com just at the right time. 'I know it doesn't work out for everyone, but it was perfect for us.' A spokesperson for Match.com said: ""In Match's 20-year history, we're so happy to have helped couples like Bill and Freddi find a long-lasting, meaningful relationship.

"A drought in the western United States has left water levels in the Colorado River basin far below their normal levels. Lake Powell, a reservoir at the Arizona-Utah border, is 45 per cent below its capacity, and the lack of water has left a 'bathtub ring' at the bottom of its majestic rock formations. The lake, from which the Colorado eventually snakes through Grand Canyon National Park, has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water in a recent drought. The river's basin has been experiencing the drought for eleven of the last 14 years, shrinking a reservoir that was one-fourth the size of Rhode Island when it was at 'full pool', according to National Geographic. Scroll down for video . Lake Powell, which is the country's second-largest reservoir when it is at 'full pool' capacity, now has a white bathtub ring in its canyons from dropping water levels . The Colorado provides water for Nevada, Arizona and California, the last of which has seen large areas in 'extreme' and 'exceptional' drought levels and is trying to restrict how much water residents use. Seven states and 40million people get water from different parts of the river's basin, which extends into the southern reaches of Wyoming. Many climate scientists think that the Southwest is also due for a megadrought this century that would far outlast the current phenomenon. Lake Mead, the reservoir next to Hoover Dam, shrunk to 39 per cent of its capacity last year and was at its lowest level since the dam was built in the 1930s. To help the other reserve keep a steady supply, Lake Powell will release 8.23 million acre-feet (2.68 trillion gallons) downstream over the course of this year. The release is estimated to lower the water level at Powell, the second largest reservoir in the country behind Mead, by another meter. It is in danger of seeing its surface elevation fall below 1,075 feet above sea level by September, which would be the lowest level on record, set in 2005, and increase the size of its bleached white ring. Minerals in the water turn the walls of the sandstone canyons white, according to the Weather Channel. Minerals in the Colorado River turned the sides of Lake Powell's canyons white before the water levels dropped and the discoloration could be seen . Lake Powell provides water to Nevada, Arizona, and California, which has been experiencing its own drought problems . The reservoir is now at 45 per cent capacity after losing water from drought for most of the past 14 years . Around 40million people get water from different parts of the Colorado River basin, and Lake Powell (pictured) used to be one-fourth the size of Rhode Island . Lake Powell has lost 4.4 trillion gallons of water this century, rapidly decreasing in size from 1999 to 2013 . Sections of extreme drought have hit many states of the southwestern United States, including Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and California . The Colorado River basin stretches from the southern reaches of Wyoming to southwestern states such as Arizona (pictured) Lake Powell is a major Arizona vacation spot and draws more than 2million visitors to the reservoir each year . Sections of Lake Powell that used to be under water, such as this are of Big Water, Utah, now stand dry and pebbles from the riverbed are exposed . Lake Powell will release trillions of gallons of water through Glen Canyon Dam (pictured) so that Lake Mead, next to Hoover Dam, will not dramatically lose water levels . The diminishing of the Colorado River has exposed vegetation from the riverbed, such as that on this section around Horseshoe Bend . Motorboats can still navigate on some stretches of the river, though paddle boats are necessary for other parts . Water lines are visible on a section of Lake Powell that used to be under water but has now been exposed by a drought . Not all areas sport the white bath tub ring from where water used to be, though areas such as this part of Big Water, Utah, are also dramatically diminished from their surging heydays . Lake Powell reached a record low of 3555 feet in 2005. Above, boaters tour the Cathedral in the Desert formations in 2007 .

"Barbara Bush, having changed her mind about her son's candidacy for president, now says that Jeb is Republicans' 'best chance of taking back the White House in 2016.' The matriarch of the Bush family endorsed her son's expected presidential campaign in a fundraising email for his Super PAC on Wednesday in which she also announced that she was starting the 'Run Jeb Run' fund. Two years ago, the former first lady tamped down rumors about her Jeb's rumored run, telling NBC, 'We've had enough Bushes.' But then, last month, after her son had already disclosed that he was exploring a bid, she indicated that she is now in favor of a third Bush presidency. Scroll down for video . Then-Gov. Jeb Bush is pictured here, sitting with him mom, former First Lady Barbara Bush, while watching election results in his hotel suite in Miami, Florida, the night he was reelected to Florida's highest office. He is now planning to run for president, following in the footsteps of his father, former president George H.W. Bush, who can be seen in the background of this photo, and older brother George W. Bush . Potential presidential candidate Jeb Bush answers questions at the Rioz Steakhouse Wednesday morning in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Barbara Bush, in an email sent sent through her son's political action group, said today that Jeb is Republicans' 'best chance of taking back the White House in 2016' At a dinner for their family foundation, Bush popped up on the big screens during Jeb's speech via a Skype call and said, 'Jeb, it's Mom. Listen, what do you mean, ""too many Bushes'?... I changed my mind!"" Jeb had been talking about the number of family members who work with the charity when his mother interrupted him. 'My mother not long ago said, ""There have been enough Bushes."" And it got me thinking, if we've had enough Bushes in one forum, do we have too many Bushes in the family literacy forum today?' he said, according to CNN. That's when his mother stepped in to say that her feelings had shifted. 'Hey, Mom,' he said back to her. 'Can I get that in writing?' 'I said our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America, if America needs you for as long as you can help. And yes, you can get it in writing and in public,' she told him. Jeb, who is known to be close with his mother, replied, 'I love you. You’re the greatest mother in the world.' A former Florida governor who has been talked about as a candidate for president for nearly as long as his brother George W. has been out office, is nearly all in to the 2016 race, with the exception of an official announcement. This month he visited consequential primary states Iowa and New Hampshire for the first time since leaving public office, and he is currently in South Carolina, another state that votes early in the nominating cycle. He is considered the favorite of establishment Republicans and is running neck-and-neck with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is quickly amassing conservative support, in surveys of right-leaning voters. In this 1988 photo, Vice President George H.W. Bush, left center, and U.S. Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, right center, proudly look on after accepting their party's nomination for President and Vice President respectively at that year's Republican National Convention. Bush's wife Barbara is pictured to their left. Asked two years ago about her son Jeb's rumored candidacy for president, Barbara said, 'We've had enough Bushes' In the email to backers of her son today, Barbara acknowledged, that 'when the idea of Jeb running for President first came up, I was hesitant.' 'You may have heard about that. 'When you see the pounding candidates, their spouses, and even their children take, what mother wouldn't be?' the former first lady and wife of former President George H.W. Bush, wrote in a message distributed by her son's Right to Rise PAC. She added: 'But our problems are so profound that America needs a leader who can renew the promise of this great nation.' 'Jeb is our best chance of taking back the White House in 2016, and I hope that you will join me in pushing him to run.' So far, her son has mostly raised money among high-dollar donors ahead of his expected announcement. This is one of his first asks from of the grassroots supporters he'll need to write him checks down the stretch, depending how long he stays in the race, and vote for him.","Matriarch of the Bush family endorsed her son's expected presidential campaign in a fundraising email for his Super PAC on Wednesday .

"A woman used forged documents to pretend to be a lawyer for a decade and was in line to be named partner of a firm when her fraud was discovered late last year, according to charges filed by the state attorney general's office. Kimberly Kitchen, 45, of James Creek, Pennsylvania, was charged on Thursday with forgery and unauthorized practice of law. State prosecutors contend Kitchen fooled BMZ Law in Huntingdon by forging a law license, bar exam results, an email showing she attended Duquesne University law school and a check for a state attorney registration fee. Kimberly Kitchen, 45, allegedly fooled BMZ Law (pictured) in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, by forging a law license, bar exam results, an email showing she attended Duquesne University law school and a check for a state attorney registration fee . Kitchen handled estate planning for more than 30 clients 'despite never having attended law school, nor being admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,' the attorney general said in a statement. Kitchen was, however, the past president of the Huntingdon County Bar Association, said her attorney, Caroline Roberto. 'She's an incredibly competent person and she worked very diligently and was devoted to the people she served in the community,' Roberto said. 'There are things about the charges we don't agree with so we're going to be fighting some of the charges,' Roberto said, though she wouldn't be specific. But Christopher Wencker, the current president of the county bar association, said he doesn't think the charges are severe enough. 'For a decade of that kind of behavior, those kind of charges are insufficient and don't represent the depth or level of betrayal that was shown,' Wencker said. The forgery charge is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison; the unauthorized practice charge is a third-degree misdemeanor, carrying up to a year in jail. Kitchen was charged on Thursday with forgery and unauthorized practice of law after pretending to be a lawyer for a decade (file photo) Wencker said the county bar plans to meet Tuesday to formulate a statement on behalf of the group. A representative of the law firm didn't immediately return a call seeing comment Friday. But in December, when the Huntingdon Daily News first reported on the case, the firm issued a statement saying they would be going through all her cases. 'Sadly, it would appear that our firm was the last, in a long line of professionals, to have been deceived by Ms. Kitchen into believing she was licensed to practice law,' the statement said. 'We are undertaking a thorough review of each and every file she may have handled.' It wasn't immediately clear where else Kitchen might have worked. Roberto wouldn't comment on whether any clients were harmed or complained about the services Kitchen rendered, except to repeat that Kitchen was 'incredibly competent'. She said Kitchen, who is married with no children, is no longer working anywhere. 'Since December, when she was asked not to practice again, she's just been waiting for this to be resolved,' Roberto said.","Kimberly Kitchen, 45, of James Creek, Pennsylvania, was charged on Thursday with forgery and unauthorized practice of law .

"This was the year we’d be wearing shoes that tied their own laces — or so the Back To The Future films predicted in the Eighties. While this may seem as fanciful now as it did then, 2015 does looks set to be the year of so-called ‘wearable technology’, clothing and accessories that could transform not only our wardrobes, but our health, too. Until now, wearable technology has largely taken the form of wristband trackers — such as the Fitbit (launched in 2008), 2011’s Jawbone and the much-hyped Apple Watch, due to go on sale on April 24. But now, manufacturers are developing everyday items of clothing and shoes that can monitor our vital signs, and even treat serious conditions. The latest innovations include a bra that could deliver life-saving breast cancer medication and socks that warn if you’re at risk of injury. Hi-tech: A bra contains technology which allows tiny ‘nano’ particles of a substance - for instance, a drug - to be embedded into a material . Even big brands are moving into the market — this year, the U.S. designer Ralph Lauren will launch a sports top that monitors heart rate, muscle movement and calories burnt. ‘So far, wearable technology in the context of well-being has been mainly about monitoring personal data,’ says Caroline Till, course leader in Material Futures at Central St Martins, University of the Arts London. ‘The question now is what do you do with the data once you have it? Is the information of value?’ This is where the latest technology comes in, with the focus on giving you feedback from the information collated. So in theory, ‘wearables’, as they’re known, will not only take your blood pressure reading, they’ll tell you if it’s dangerously high. ‘The holy grail of wearable technology is something that’s integrated seamlessly into something you wear or use already, so you don’t notice it’s there,’ says Caroline Till. This is now closer to being a reality because circuitry can be made small and light enough to be embedded in clothing. Another material technology, known as micro-encapsulation, allows tiny ‘nano’ particles of a substance — for instance, a drug — to be embedded into a material so it is gradually absorbed through the skin when worn. Here, we look at the latest ‘wearables’— some of which are already available, with others still being developed — that could transform our health . . . The Omsignal top has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing . BRA THAT DELIVERS CANCER DRUGS . The Foxleaf bra contains micro-encapsulated ‘bubbles’ of the drug Tamoxifen in soft, plastic inserts in the cups. The idea is that the body’s heat and moisture rub off the bubbles’ coating and the Tamoxifen, which blocks oestrogen to slow the growth of cancer cells, can be gradually absorbed through the skin throughout the day. The bra was developed by Sarah Da Costa, a Masters student at Central St Martins, London. It aims to provide a possible solution for thousands of women who find the side-effects of Tamoxifen intolerable. Delivering the drug locally means less has to be processed by the liver, potentially reducing side-effects such as hot flushes, cramps and nausea. There are now plans to run clinical trials to work out at what rate the drug would be absorbed. Da Costa’s next project is to see whether similar technology could be used to deliver dementia drug galantamine via bedding or nightwear. VEST TO HELP YOU BURN OFF CALORIES . NASA scientist Dr Wayne B Hayes has invented the Cold Shoulder vest, which he says boosts your body’s ability to burn calories. The vest, which can be kept in the freezer, has pockets for ice packs around the back and shoulders. The idea is that by wearing the vest your body has to burn more calories to stay warm — as much as an extra 500 calories a day, says Dr Hayes. From around £90 ($139.99) from cold-shoulder.com . Sun savvy: The Netatmo June bracelet has a sensor that measures UV light . T-SHIRT TO MONITOR YOUR HEART . Omsignal, the company working with Ralph Lauren to create a tech sports shirt, has a top already on sale that has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing. The sensors can also monitor the electrical activity of the heart. Fibres feed this information to a ‘black box’ — about the size of a credit card — attached to the shirt. The box sends the information to your mobile, with alerts from your phone telling you to breathe more, slow down or speed up. The heart and breathing rate data is also used to estimate how many calories you’re burning — thought to be much more accurate than standard fitness tracking wristbands which make calculations based on how much you’re moving. At the moment the garment has only been designed for men. A version for women is in development. Around £160 from omsignal.com . DRESS THAT GETS MUMS-TO-BE MOVING . It’s a wrap-dress, but not as you know it — maternity dresses designed by Blake Uretsky, a fashion student at Cornell University in the U.S., contain conductive silver fibres under the bust to monitor a pregnant woman’s heart rate, breathing, blood pressure and temperature, along with a device worn on the belt that can then communicate with a smartphone. The dress can then alert a mother-to-be if her readings suggest she might be over doing it — or not being active enough. Some research has suggested that women who are more active during pregnancy have fewer complications during both gestation and labour. The Lumo Lift brooch aims to improve your posture . BRACELET TO TELL YOU TO TOP UP SUN CREAM . Unlike conventional wristband trackers, the Netatmo June is designed to look like a piece of jewellery, with a multifaceted gem on a leather double-wrap strap. But the ‘gem’ is a sensor that measures UV light — the harmful invisible rays that cause sunburn and skin damage. The sensor transmits information on your sun exposure to an iPhone and, if it detects you’re reaching a harmful level, it will send you an alert. You can also tell it what factor sun cream — if any — you’re wearing, and it will remind you to re-apply it or recommend that you use a higher factor. £79, netatmo.com . BROOCH TO BANISH BACK PAIN . The Lumo Lift posture coach is a sensor about the size of two 50p pieces that aims to improve your posture. It’s worn just under your collar bone. There are decorative versions that can be pinned on your clothes like a brooch or tie pin or others that can be clipped out of sight around a bra strap or vest. You set the sensor when you start wearing it so it knows what your ‘good’ posture should be. To do this, you press a button on the device while you’re standing tall, with your shoulders back and relaxed, feet hip distance apart and weight evenly distributed, bottom and stomach pulled in. You can then programme it to vibrate every time it detects you’re slouching. Maintaining good posture can be a key step in preventing back pain, according to the British Chiropractic Association. Correct posture keeps your joints aligned, helping to avoid straining your muscles. Lumo Lift, £79.95 from store.apple.com/uk . Lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that give you directions . RUNNING SOCKS THAT CAN PREVENT INJURY . Sensoria’s smart running socks monitor the way your feet strike the ground, warning you if you are at risk of injury and also how to correct your stride. ‘Flaws in your gait are a common cause of injury,’ says physiotherapist Sammy Margo. The Sensoria socks detect how your foot lands, and conductive fibres then relay this information to a small clip-on device on the ankle. This sends information to your phone, which can issue real-time audio warnings and advice if needs be. From around £130 ($199), sensoriafitness.com . SHOES THAT STOP YOU GETTING LOST . Lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that not only counts your steps and estimates calories burnt, it also gives you directions so you can stick to a route. The shoes are based on ‘haptics’ — touch technology that gives you physical feedback from an electronic device, like a games console controller that vibrates if you crash a car in the game you’re playing. Once you’ve programmed your route into a mobile phone app, the shoes vibrate on either the left or the right to tell you how to reach your destination. Available to pre-order from around £100, lechal.com . AND FINALLY, THE BLOUSE THAT HUGS YOU . As seen on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week last autumn, the Hug Shirt, invented by London CuteCircuit, uses haptic technology to mimic the sensation of a cuddle. The shirt contains sensors and tiny motors to generate warmth and pressure that feel like a hug. The idea, the inventors say, is to allow friends to ‘send’ each other hugs even when they’re miles apart.","2015 looks set to be the year of 'wearable technology', experts say .

"The executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumuran would not stop Prime Minister Tony Abbott from holidaying in Bali. Many Australians have called for a boycott of the island paradise in anger at the imminent killings. The island hosts more than a million Australian tourists each year, including the prime minister. But Mr Abbott told WSFM's Jonesy and Amanda on Friday that he would not boycott Bali. 'I am one of those Australians who has been several times to Bali on holidays,' Mr Abbott said. 'I've got to say I love my time there.' Scroll down for video . Political unity: Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten (centre) have been united in their opposition to the death penalty, with the pair appearing at a vigil for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran on Thursday morning . Fighting for Chan and Sukumaran: The Prime Minister (pictured left, on the job, and right, in a swimming competition) has engaged in a fierce lobbying effort on behalf of the Australians. He told WSFM that he would continue to holiday to the island paradise of Bali in the future . Island paradise: More than a million Australians visit Bali each year, but the imminent execution of reformed prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran has sparked a movement calling for tourists to boycott the popular destination. Pictured above is an ocean temple at Pura Tanah Lot, Bali . Reformed ringleaders: Mercy campaigners have pointed to the success of Kerokoban Prison's rehabilitation program in changing the lives of Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right. Mr Sukumaran has become an accomplished artist and Mr Chan has been ordained as a priest . 'It's a beautiful island with friendly people. It's a magnificent place to stay. 'I hope over time that more Australians will travel to Indonesia. I hope over time more Indonesians will travel to Australia. 'The short answer is yes I would (still go to Bali). 'I would hate to think that our understandable dismay and disappointment and even anger at the prospect of these executions... would permanently blight the relationship, because it's too important to both our countries.' Mr Abbott provoked anger from Indonesian officials in February after he publicly reminded them the Federal Government had donated $1 billion of aid to the country following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The tsunami devastated the country's Aceh province and the Australian government deployed military personnel to assist in humanitarian relief operations. Mr Abbott's aid statement was dismissed by an Indonesian foreign ministry official - who told reporters 'no one responds well to threats'.

Indonesian police officers are pictured standing guard out the front of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Jakarta State Administrative Court rejected a lawsuit from Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers on February 24, 2015 . It also sparked a social media movement in Indonesia, 'Coin4Abbott', calling on the Indonesian government to return the funds to Australia. 'Take Back All Money & S**t You Gave Us!' one Twitter user said, posting a picture of a jar of coins. Mr Abbott said on Friday that he hoped to make more progress with Indonesia with private, rather than public conversations. He requested a phone conversation with Mr Widodo on Thursday but that has not gone ahead yet. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has lobbied her counterparts for an exchange of three Indonesian prisoners in Australia for Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. But the Australian Associated Press reported on Friday that Mr Widodo 'laughed' after being questioned by reporters about the issue.

"Spring officially starts this week and households up and down the country will no doubt been thinking about giving their homes a good dusting, de-cluttering and getting rid of any lingering winter blues. But this year, why not go a step further and give your finances a spring clean? It really could slash hundreds of pounds off your annual household expenditure and help you save more for the luxury items such as holidays and clothes. Here, Kalpana Fitzpatrick, financial journalist and founder of blog MummyMoneyMatters.com, reveals her top tips to help you cut the cost of living and become savvy savers. Scroll down for video . There are several things mums can do to spend less and save more this Spring, says Kalpana . 1) Go second hand for children’s goods . Ever wondered where the smart mums shop for their children's clothes and toys? Well, the savviest are heading for table-top sales boasting excellent-quality goods for bargain prices. Parenting charity NCT holds regular nearly-new sales offering clothes at knock-down prices - such as baby grows from as little as 50p for not one, but five. Toys - often in very good condition - cost as little as £2 and children's DVD are on offer from just £1. And it's not just baby bargains savvy shoppers will find - there is a great selection for children too. There's little point buying all-new clothes for little ones as they grow out of them so quickly. The NCT has strict quality guidelines for sellers, plus buyers can inspect the items before purchasing. For those who are good at haggling, you'll walk away with more bang for your buck. Check the NCT for details of locations and dates of these sales. They are held nationwide and throughout the year. 2) De-clutter and sell unwanted goods . Now is the time to go through your cupboards and get rid of anything you no longer need or use. To make a few extra pennies that could go towards pocket money for the kids, or spending money for your family holiday, why not consider selling these items? At NCT sales, table hire is around £20, but, if you have plenty of decent things on offer, you could walk away with hundreds of pounds. You can sell furniture - so for mothers with items like cots and even wardrobes, it's the perfect marketplace. Don’t worry about having to fit everything into your car. Instead, take pictures of any bulky goods to place on a noticeboard on the day. You’ll be surprised at just how popular these are. For non-child-related goods, try a boot sale. They start up in spring and run until October, with an entrance fee to pay. Just be prepared to get up early to bag a space! Check out CarBootSales for locations and dates. Car-boots sales are a great way to have a clear-out of unwanted goods and also pick up a little extra cash . 3) Buy school uniforms from the supermarket . School uniforms are expensive – but there are ways to cut costs. The first tip is to avoid buying items such as plain shirts, dresses and bottoms from uniform shops where the prices are significantly higher. For example, a plain polo shirt from a niche shop may set you back about £5 each, but a pack of two from the supermarket costs as little as £2.50 – that’s just £1.25 each. You could put the savings towards other expenses, such as school trips. Some school uniform items do have to be purchased via a uniform shop because a certain logo or style must be adhered to. If this is the case, and if you're looking to save some pennies, see if you can get them second-hand. Many schools will sell once-worn clothes, but you may have to ask. You could also ask other parents if they are willing to sell anything that their child has outgrown. 4) Use cashback sites . These aren't anything new, but if you're not already using a cashback site, it's the perfect way to easily save some money and earn rewards. They work by giving shoppers a percentage of their purchase total every time you shop online via a specific cashback site. Simply register for free, then click through to your chosen retailer, such as Mothercare or Argos, and then shop as normal. The purchase is tracked and the cashback site will give you back some money; rates can vary from as little as 1 per cent to as much as 10 per cent. Some stores also offer you a cash lump sum. And it's not just limited to retailers, you can also earn cashback for utilities (broadband, TV, phone), insurance and even days out. New Sky customers, for example, could get £151.50 cashback for TV and broadband packages via Topcashback, £30 cashback for using Uswitch via Quidco and 2 per cent back on Amazon purchases using Kidstart. You really could end up with hundreds of pounds back into your pocket - but only ever use reputable cashback sites. 5) Use Tesco Clubcard vouchers to pay for days out . If you’re collecting Tesco Clubcard points, then use your vouchers to pay for days out using Clubcard Boost. It’s tempting to stick them in your purse and pay for everyday groceries when you go shopping, but they are worth a lot more if you use Clubcard Boost – you could exchange them for up to four times the face value. Use Tesco Clubcard vouchers to pay for days out instead - these can be exchanged for cinema tickets . A £4.50 voucher is worth just £4.50 if you use it to pay for groceries, but if you boost it online, that will get you a day pass to a Sealife Centre where a child ticket otherwise costs around £20 – that’s a saving of more than 75 per cent. You could also use your vouchers to exchange them for cinema tickets or eating out. Take a look at Tesco to see the deals. 6) Plan your meals . For a family, food is a huge weekly cost. But it is also an area where you can easily save some money. As well as shopping smart and buying own-brand products where possible, the next thing to do is to plan your meals. Devise three or four and rotate them every week to ensure there is variety. But, this way, you won't get tempted by expensive treats while wandering around the supermarket - and it will ensure all food is used; rather than wasted or thrown away. Always go shopping with a list - and stick to it. Better still, do your shop online – that way you can avoid all those 'buy one get one free' or 'half price' deals, not to mention it will probably reduce stress and give you more quality time with your children. 7) There’s still time to make use of childcare vouchers . Childcare costs are rising faster than the rate of inflation. Recent research from the Family & Childcare Trust showed a 33 per cent increase in the past five years, and a report last week from single parent charity, Gingerbread, found half of single parents have had to borrow money from friends, family or banks to pay for childcare in the last two years. With costs so high, it’s important to make use of all the financial help you can get. If you are working and are not making use of childcare vouchers, then you should – you could save as much £933 a year, per parent, towards the costs of childminders, nurseries, play groups and after school care or clubs. Childcare vouchers are essentially salary sacrifice schemes and you make savings through tax. It is offered by employers, so talk to your HR department about it. The system is, however, changing in Autumn 2015, with a new tax-free childcare scheme being introduced, after which you will not be able to apply for childcare vouchers, but existing users will be able to continue using them if they want. Some parents will be better-off with the existing childcare voucher scheme, as the new system will not help you if you have children over the age of 12 for instance – so, it is a good idea to apply for childcare vouchers now and then choose what is better for you in the Autumn when the new scheme kicks in. Some parents may also be able to get tax credits, but childcare vouchers can affect the amount of tax credits you get, so check the Gov.uk calculator to find out whether you would be better-off.

"Junk food firms are targeting children with adverts for Haribo sweets and Coca-Cola on YouTube, an investigation has found. The adverts would breach the strict guidelines in place for television which ban them being screened close to children’s programs. But there are no rules in place for YouTube and they are being played before popular short films watched by up to five million children. Experts say that the adverts give children a subconscious craving and make them inclined to ‘grab the nearest sugary thing around.’ Vloggers’ sites such as Zoella's - followed by millions of girls on YouTube - are featuring adverts for products high in sugar like Coca-Cola and Haribo, and even gambling websites . An investigation found that video blogs - known as vlogs – popular with children aged 11 to 17 are being hijacked by 30 second adverts for junk food and online gambling sites. They are being played before popular films uploaded by a personality called Zoella, real name Zoe Suggs, a 24-year-old from Brighton. She records several films a week about what’s in her handbag, her thoughts on having babies and whether she should spend time with her best friend or boyfriend which are watched regularly by at least five million children and teenagers. Before watching the film, viewers are first played a 30 second advert which is chosen at random. Although some of these are for harmless products such as Dolmio pasta sauce or hair dye, others are for Haribo, Coca-Cola and for an online gambling website, according to the Independent newspaper. But a spokesman for YouTube said gambling adverts weren’t shown to children and teenagers as they could only be seen by viewers who had confirmed they were over 18. A third of children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school and the rates are amongst the worst in Western Europe. Although the watchdog Ofcom has enforced strict rules banning junk food adverts being screened close to children’s TV programs, they do not apply to YouTube. Campaigners are calling for the regulations to be toughed-up. Experts have warned of the dangers of advertising such products to young people, adding if they were broadcast on terrestrial children’s television, they would likely break Advertising Standards Authority rules . Professor Jason Halford, a health behaviour expert at the University of Liverpool, said: ‘Advertising does affect children in terms of what they purchase and reinforcing the brand. ‘But even beyond brand, our research has found it makes them grab the nearest sugary thing around, irrespective of their appetite.’ Christine Blower, chair of the National Union of Teachers said: ‘With approximately 30 per cent of UK children apparently either overweight or obese, it should be incumbent on the next Government to toughen the regulations so that children are not bombarded with junk food marketing when they are online.’ Graham MacGregor, chair of Action on Sugar said: ‘Regulations about online advertising need to mirror that of TV advertising.’ It is unclear the vloggers are aware of the products advertised before their posts and there was no response from their management companies when contacted by The Independent.","Adverts feature products high in sugar like Coca-Cola and Haribo .

"FIFA has confirmed the 2022 World Cup final in Qatar will take place on Sunday, December 18. It comes after a FIFA taskforce recommended last month the tournament should be switched from summer to winter to avoid the searing heat of the Gulf in June and July, where temperatures can exceed 40C. The decision to hold the first ever winter World Cup was taken more than four years after the most controversial award of a sporting event in history. Scroll down for video . Shock: FIFA President Sepp Blatter awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar in December 2, 2010 . Iron fist: Sepp Blatter, speaking to journalists today, confirmed the final will be on December 18, 2022 . Confirming the date for the 2022 World Cup final, Walter De Gregorio, FIFA's director of communications, said: 'This is for us an important step. 'Finally we know the end of the tournament. It's a Sunday and, by the way, it's the national day in Qatar, so it fits perfectly.' He added: 'You have enough time to do your Christmas shopping.' FIFA has indicated the 2022 tournament will also be shortened to 28 days, instead of the usual 32. The competition is likely to begin (featuring the hosts' Qatar) on November 21. The decision means the traditional and popular Boxing Day club matches will take place as usual – which will come as some comfort to the Premier League who have strongly opposed the switch. UEFA - the body that governs European football - had pushed for the final to be as late as December 23. Main stage: The Al-Rayyan stadium, in an artist impression, will hold the  Qatar 2022 World Cup final . The Qatar World Cup has been mired in controversy ever since the shock decision to stage the tournament in the desert kingdom which has no footballing history and a questionable human rights record. Sepp Blatter, FIFA's long-standing president, even admitted last year that staging the tournament in Qatar was a 'mistake' – justifying it by saying 'but one makes lots of mistakes in life'. Allegations of widespread corruption and collusion dogged the process from the outset. A report by investigator Michael Garcia into allegations of corruption remains secret, unpublished and subject to dispute between its author and FIFA. The idea of holding the prestigious tournament in winter has also proved controversial. When the decision to hold the competition in Qatar was first made, Blatter vowed: 'The basic conditions – not just for Qatar but for all the candidates – were the same. It means the FIFA World Cup is played in June and July.' But following major concerns about the scorching weather in the country, he made a U-turn saying it was 'not responsible' to play in the burning sun. Controversial: The FIFA president initially said the tournament would be in the summer, but backtracked . A report by investigator Michael Garcia into allegations of corruption remains secret and unpublished . This enraged the Premier League and other European leagues as it will cause huge upheaval to the football calendar. After learning of the decision of the FIFA taskforce last month, Premier league chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'I'm very disappointed, that's the word, on behalf of all the European leagues and particularly the European clubs who provide most of the players for this World Cup'. Then there has been the worldwide condemnation of the treatment of workers hired to build the infrastructure (the Qatar World Cup is set to cost an estimated £138billion – about 60 times more than the South Africa World Cup in 2010). Human rights groups have accused Qatar of failing to deal with the abuse of migrants, with almost 200 workers dying in the country and a significant number believed to have sustained injuries due to unsafe working practices. Campaigners also revealed how workers toiled for long hours for pitiful wages in unsafe and insanitary conditions. May 2022 European seasons (2021-22) end as usual . July Champions League qualifiers.

"Road developers have been ordered to move a giant rock along a new road - because it is believed to be an ancient elven church in Icelandic folklore. The formation has now been placed by the side of the route near similar rocks, just over a year after the issue hit international headlines when campaigners urged the highway project to be halted. Elf advocates feared the building of the direct route from the tip of the Alftanes peninsula to Gardabaer would disturb elf habitat, and claimed the area contains an elf church. Rocky road: Elf advocates feared the building of the direct route from the tip of the Alftanes peninsula to Gardabaer would disturb elf habitat and claimed the area contains an elf church . The project was stopped until the country’s supreme court ruled on a case brought by the Friends of Lava group, who cited both its environmental and cultural impact - including the bearing on elves. But while the building of the road will now go ahead, the rock has been spared and was transferred to its new location yesterday, reported the Morgunblaðið (‘Morning Paper’) newspaper. Hilmar Örn Hilmars­son, high chieftain of the Ásatrú pagan society, carried out what he called a sanctification ritual at the rock in 2009 - an event which was even supported by a former president. He said: ‘Tales and legends have spoken of this unusual rock, formed in the shape of a church, which stood in the middle of a well-travelled path for centuries and served to guide people.’ Workers had estimated that the two parts of the rock weighed 20 and 50 tonnes – and while they were correct about the latter, the former was in fact 37, resulting in a total weight of 87 tonnes. Ragnhildur Jonsdottir, a self-proclaimed 'seer', believes she can communicate with the creatures through telepathy, and said the loss of the rock would have been ‘terrible’ for elves and humans. Moved: While the building of the road in Iceland will now go ahead, the rock has been spared and was transferred to its new location yesterday (above) She told Morgunblaðið: ‘The elves told me that Ófeigskirkja had been used as a beacon guiding people through the lava, and the rock was right there, in the pathway of the new road. ‘I wrote to the Mayor of Garðabær on be­half of the elves. Ófeigskirkja will now be moved to a place near other elven abodes in harmony with the wishes of the elves.’ An Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration spokesman confirmed yesterday that Ms Jonsdottir was 'pleased with the arrangement and removal’ of the rock. Friends of Lava has regularly brought hundreds of people out to block bulldozers - and it is not the first time issues about 'Huldufolk' ('hidden folk') have affected planning decisions. They occur so often that the road and coastal administration has come up with a stock media response for elf inquiries. Location: The road is being built between the Alftanes peninsula to Gardabaer, south of the capital Reykjavik . It states in part that 'issues have been settled by delaying the construction project at a certain point while the elves living there have supposedly moved on'. A survey conducted by the University of Iceland eight years ago found that some 62 per cent of the 1,000 respondents thought it was at least possible that elves exist. Though many of the Friends of Lava are primarily motivated by environmental fears, they see the elf issue as part of a wider concern for the history and culture of the unique landscape. Andri Snaer Magnason, a well-known environmentalist, said his major concern was that the road would cut the lava field in two, among other things, destroying nesting sites. One of Iceland's most famous daughters, the singer Bjork, had no hesitation in responding when asked by US comedian and TV host Stephen Colbert if people in her country believed in elves. 'We do,' she said three years ago. 'It's sort of a relationship with nature, like with the rocks. (The elves) all live in the rocks, so you have to. It's all about respect, you know.'","Formation placed by side of Alftanes-Gardabaer route near similar rocks .

"Family members of three boys and their grandmother killed in a house fire the morning after Christmas now have hundreds of photos salvaged from the blaze to help preserve memories of their loved ones, thanks to the work of college students. About 260 photos, which were about the only items rescued from the December 26 fire in Washington Court House, Ohio, were painstakingly restored by art conservation undergraduates at the University of Delaware. Many of the photos were charred, covered in soot and stained by the water used to fight the blaze that took the lives of 60-year-old Terry Harris and her grandsons: Kenyon, 14, Broderick, 11, and Braylon, nine. Scroll down for video . University of Delaware Professor Debra Hess Norris, left, shows Ricky and Traci Harris some of the more than 300 family photographs that were cleaned, repaired and salvage by her students, during a press conference at The Warehouse Youth Center in Washington Court House, Ohio . The boys' father, Ricky Harris, told those gathered for the delivery of the photos that he was very grateful to have the photos that include ones of his sons and mother . But after a range of restoration techniques were applied, the images were revealed in their former glory. Police had said the boys wanted to spend Christmas night with their grandmother so she wouldn't be alone. The state fire marshal's office said Friday that the cause of the blaze hasn't been determined. The restored photos were delivered to the family Friday in a tear-filled gathering in their hometown about 75 miles north of Cincinnati.

'It is hard to see the photos, but it was always hard to look at old photos even when they were here because of the reminder of the time I had already lost with my boys and mom,' he told the Washington Court House Record Herald, saying he can't help but lament all the good times they had gone by. Debra Hess Norris, chairwoman of the University of Delaware's art conservation department and a photograph conservation professor, delivered the photos to the family. She told The Associated Press in a telephone interview afterward that it was an emotional day and an honor to meet the family after working so long on their photographs.

"We're all guilty of putting an Instagram filter or two on our pictures from time to time to try and make ourselves look better. But would you go so far as to slim yourself down in a picture? Well, some celebrities seem to be. From supermodel Miranda Kerr to pop princess Britney Spears it appears some of our favourite stars have been using photo editing tools to make themselves appear thinner. Scroll down for video . Are celebrities like Lauren Goodger slimming down their social media photographs? The reality star certainly looked smoother in her holiday Instagram snaps . In these pictures of Britney Spears, which were taken on the same day in November, she looks considerably slimmed down in the picture on the right which was posted to her Instagram . Even our favourite reality TV stars have gotten in on the not-very-real act of cheating their way slim, according to Heat. Stars such as Charlotte Crosby and Lauren Goodger have previously posted pictures to the social networking site where they look considerably smaller than in paparazzi pictures of them taken on the same day. Of course, people like Beyonce and Kim Kardashian are no strangers to being accused of altering their photographs. These two photos were taken just two days apart whilst Charlotte holidayed in Perth in February, in the picture on the left she looks rounder than she does in her Instagram snap on the right . Holly Hagan has lost a lot of weight over the last year, however, she looked like her waist was slimmer in this picture posted to Instagram (right) around the same time that she attended the NTAs (left) When Kim took a trip to the Versace house in March 2014 she faced criticism for the picture on the right, in which she appeared to have slimmed her waist and hips . Some users like Lauren Goodger, who posted this picture before attending the Clothes Show Live last year, may have used filters to smooth out their pictures . Even though she is already incredibly slim when Miranda Kerr attended a Michael Kors event in Japan last year she raised eyebrows for this Instagram snap in which it looked like she had slimmed down her waist . Jennifer Lopez has beautiful skin already but it looks as though she used a filter to make it completely flawless in this picture taken as she promoted The Boy Next Door in January . Beyonce is no stranger to  controversy, she has previously been accused of slimming down her pictures and in this snap, taken whilst she was holidaying in the South of France, it looked like her waist was slimmer . This week's Heat is out now . When singer Beyonce posted photographs of her summer holiday to Instagram last year she was accused of slimming down both her waist and legs. And when Kim took a trip to the Versace house last year the picture she posted to the social networking site made her look thinner than those taken of her by the photographers waiting outside. They say the camera never lies, but some seem to be telling a few fibs. Here are some more stars that might have been given a helping hand. In a lot of these pictures the difference between the paparazzi photographs and the stars Instagram snaps is clear to see. For example in a picture posted by Jennifer Lopez in January, whilst she was promoting The Boy Next Door, she posted a picture which looked like it had been heavily filtered. Instagram first became popular a few years ago after initially being launched in 2010. On the app, which you download to your phone and tablet, you can take photos and then edit them or filter them to change their appearance. Stars such as Kim Kardashian are a huge fans of the social network, it was even once reported that she has a special assistant whose job it is to edit her Instagram pictures for her.","Stars such as Britney Spears appear to look thinner in Instagram snaps .

"The former home of first lady Betty Ford has been destroyed in an early morning fire in Ohio. Fire officials in Maumee  say the home once occupied by Ford and her first husband, William Warren, was destroyed in a fire that began early Saturday around 3am. The Blade in Toledo reports Ford and Warren lived in the house in 1942 and 1943 while she modeled and sold merchandise at a department store. The couple divorced after five years of marriage and Betty went on to marry future president Gerald Ford in 1948. She died in 2011. Destroyed: The home of former First Lady Betty Ford was burned down in a blaze that started early Saturday in Maumee, Ohio . Before: Betty Ford lived in the home with her first husband, William Warren, in the 1940s . The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but the fire chief says investigators believe it began in the basement. The chief says the fire engulfed the roof and floors, making the home a total loss. No occupants were inside. 'It’ll be torn down, unfortunately. It’s a historic home in Maumee,' Maumee Fire Chief Brandon Loboschefski said. A homeowner at the scene of the fire said that it was an investment property, and that they were carrying out renovations on the home. Neighbor Bert Trochelman told the Blade that the house had been unoccupied for years despite having several owners. He says there were workers on Friday cutting trees at the property.

The  all-terrain Saxon could be seen trying and failing to get up and over a mound of earth in the war-torn country while a Russian-made amphibious patrol car completed the same task untroubled.

About 20 of the troop carriers were sent to the Ukrainian government by a private company under a 2013 deal which predated the current conflict . Last month, the former head of the British Army, General Sir Richard Dannatt slammed the decision to send dozens of the redundant British vehicles to the Ukraine claiming they were 'useless'. He said in an interview: 'They are quite useless, semi-armoured lorries that should be nowhere near anyone's front line. 'To suggest that the UK is making a significant gesture of support by supplying vehicles which we took out of service ten years ago, because we deemed them unsafe, seems bizarre at best and downright dangerous at worst.'

"A 66-year-old man told his wife that he feared hospital staff were 'trying to kill him' a day before they put him on a 'do not resuscitate' notice without the consent of his family, an inquest has heard. Michael Richardson, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, died at James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk,  after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow said. The great-grandfather, who died in October 2013, had been ill for several years with a lung condition which caused his breathing to stop but had been given more than a year to live. Heartbroken: Michael Richardson died at James Paget University Hospital after medics 'played God' with his life, his widow, Janet (pictured with her late husband) said told an inquest today. Right, Mr Richardson . Giving evidence at an inquest, his widow, Janet, said her husband had tried to discharge himself the day before his death after becoming concerned about the levels of oxygen he was being given. Speaking at the inquest in Norfolk, she said: 'He said, ""I can't breathe, take me home - I can't stand it any more. They're trying to kill me"". 'I said, ""I love you"", and then he said he loved me too. That was the last time I saw him alive. 'I wish I'd bundled him up and taken him home because at least if he was going to die, he was going to die with some dignity.' The 66-year-old accused medics of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family. The inquest heard the family, who had recently moved to Norfolk from Deal, Kent, only learned of the notice when they picked up Mr Richardson's death certificate from the hospital four days after he died. Janet Richardson (centre, with a photo of Mr Richardson) with daughters Jocelin Taylor (left) and Antonia Richardson (right). The widow claimed she only learned of the DNR order four days after her husband's death . Asked by assistant coroner David Osborne if she had given consent for this, Mrs Richardson said: 'No, nothing at all.' She added: 'I visited the hospital twice a day.  There would have been loads of opportunities for staff to talk to me. If he had been asked about the DNR notice, he would have said no, I know that. 'He used to say, ""some life is better than no life, you're a long time dead"". He was well aware he would die at some point, just not that quickly.' Mr Richardson, who was born in Islington, London, was diagnosed with the lung-scarring condition pulmonary fibrosis  in 2008 and received oxygen therapy at home. On October 24 2013, his condition deteriorated and his family called an ambulance which took him to the hospital. Mrs Richardson said he had been moved between various wards and when she visited him he 'seemed worse than when he went in'. Although his medical notes correctly identified pulmonary fibrosis as his main condition, he was initially treated for emphysema, Mrs Richardson said. When she pointed this out, doctors increased his oxygen levels. She also described how her husband had been left to lie on soiled sheets and was not being regularly washed. Care: Mrs Richardson accused medics at James Paget University Hospital of playing God with his life after discovering a do not resuscitate (DNR) notice had been placed on him without the consent of the family . Nurse Louise Curtis described how staff had initially rushed to resuscitate Mr Richardson after an emergency alarm was activated. But as they tried to save his life, a colleague checked his notes and pointed out the DNR notice so they stopped these efforts. She added that staffing levels that day had been 'unusually low' with herself and two agency nurses responsible for 27 patients. Normally the ward would have been staffed by four or five nurses.","Michael Richardson, 66, died at James Paget University Hospital in 2013 .

"Evidence: This is a picture of the stolen Buddha statue containing the remains of meditating monk Zhanggong Liuquan and who villagers believe is currently in Holland . Three-hundreds Chinese villagers have signed a petition demanding the return of a 1,000-year-old relic containing a mummified monk. They believe that the Buddha statue on display in Holland is the same that was stolen from Spring Village, Fujian, in 1995, the People's Daily Online reports. Now they are calling on Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, to hand back their 'ancestral patriarch', Buddhist Zhanggong Liuquan. The letter states: 'In our hearts he is not a cultural display item to be placed in a museum but a living Buddha that is respected and revered by us all. 'This is a tradition that is deeply important to our way of life. He has looked over us for over 1000 years and is a testament to our historical and cultural heritage.' Locals say Zhanggong Liuquan did many good things for villagers such as curing illnesses free of charge. When he died, people made his body a statue before the body rotted, and then they placed the body in the memorial hall of the village ever since. The Buddhist has become a spiritual sustenance for locals. The statue was first displayed in Drents Museum in the Netherlands in 2014, causing the Cultural Relics Bureau to launch an investigation. Scroll down for video . They found photographs and historical records that supported the claim that it in fact belonged to a temple in the village. A Buddha statue (left) containing a mummified monk (right) was actually stolen from a village temple twenty years ago, Chinese experts believe . The private owner, who wants to stay anonymous, bought the relic in 1996 at a European market. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after he took the statue to the museum in the Netherlands to be restored. According to various Chinese media, the Dutch collector said he is willing to return the Buddha statue if it is proved to be the one stolen from Fujian. The mummified remains were discovered at the end of February after a private owner took the statue to Drents Museum at the Meander Medical Centre in the Netherlands for restoration. Above, the museum completes a CT scan . Erik Bruijn, an Buddhism expert, determined the mummy dated back to the 11th or 12th century and was Buddhist master Liuquan. Above, a scientist examines the base of the statue . The remains had been due to be put on display at the Hungarian Natural History Museum until May 2015. But they have now been pulled after people at Drents museum, which completed the CT scan and endoscopy, requested they were no longer used. The villagers now hope that the issue can be raised during the visit of the Dutch prime minister to China, paving the way for it to be repatriated to its rightful home.","Villagers say relic is their 'ancestral patriarch' who gives spiritual guidance .

"The woman who inspired The Beatles' song Dear Prudence was Robert Durst's mistress until days before his wife went missing. Prudence Farrow, sister to Mia, had her name etched into cultural history at the age of 19 when she inspired John Lennon to write her a song at an Indian ashram. But lesser-known is her affair with the alleged killer Durst who was arrested this month and charged with the 2000 murder of his friend, Susan Berman. Durst, 71, was sensationally acquitted of the 2001 murder of neighbor Morris Black and has long been suspected of killing his first wife, Kathie, and then murdering long-time friend Susan Berman. According to the New York Post, Farrow and her husband Albert Bruns, to whom she remains married, were living in a New York City property owned by Robert Durst. Scroll down for video . Prudence Farrow (far left) was 19 when she attended the same Indian ashram as The Beatles and was so immersed in her meditation tent that John Lennon sang a song to her - which became Dear Prudence . A decade later she was widely known to be Robert Durst's mistress. The alleged killer (pictured) was arrested on March 14 and charged with murder after a docu-series about his life screened on HBO . They married in the late 1960s but from 1980 to 1982, Farrow kept up a widely talked-about affair with Durst, according to a number of reports. At one point, the Post notes, a 34-year-old Farrow called his with Kathie in an attempt to convince her to file for divorce. It was a dark chapter more than a decade after she attended the same meditation retreat as John, George, Paul and Ringo, where she became an inspiration. In an attempt to reach enlightenment, Farrow refused to come out of her meditation tent. Eventually, the story goes, John Lennon went over and sang the first semblance of Dear Prudence - 'won't you come out to play'. The ditty became the second track on the band's acclaimed White Album. Robert Durst and his first wife, Kathleen, who went missing in 1982. She has never been found. Farrow allegedly called Kathleen two months prior to her disappearance asking her to leave Durst . Durst was acquitted of murder in 2001. He is now on suicide watch as he awaits trial in Louisiana . Farrow, whose mother Maureen O'Sullivan was Jane in Tarzan, later recalled how deeply immersed she was in the ashram. But she refuses to touch on the allegations surrounding Durst. He was arrested in New Orleans on March 14 a day before the final episode of the HBO documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, in which he was shockingly caught on tape saying 'I killed them all,' at the end. Police believe he was preparing to flee the country as he was found in a hotel room with a latex mask, false ID, a loaded Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver with one spent shell casing and $42,000 in cash. A small amount of marijuana was also discovered. He is now on suicide watch as he awaits trial in Louisiana on gun and drug possession charges and extradition to California to face a murder trial in the Berman case. Farrow is now a meditation teacher and author.","Prudence Farrow was 19 when she was at an Indian ashram with Beatles .

"The self-styled ‘captain’ of a replica German U-boat could face prison after he admitted swindling the taxman out of more than £1million. Captain Birdseye lookalike Richard Williams, 56, spent £50,000 kitting out the vessel, which he named U-8047, with naval artefacts, a periscope and dummy torpedoes. His vessel was moored as a floating visitor attraction at Clarence Dock in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when it was raided by Customs officers. Captain Birdseye? Richard Williams faces jail after admitting avoiding paying more than £1million in taxman . His replica German U-boat was moored at Clarence Dock in Leeds, when it was raided by Customs officers . Now, the self-confessed maritime history enthusiast - who has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain in his boat - is facing prison after admitting to avoiding more than £1million in taxes. An investigation by HM Revenue and Customs dating back to 2012 found Williams and his former partner Laurel Howarth had set up a number of companies in Lancashire. They ostensibly sold disability equipment to care homes and the NHS, but evidence gathered by investigators showed minimal genuine sales actually took place. Despite this, the pair filed false tax returns and invoices for more than £1million. The self-confessed maritime history enthusiast has admitted spending £50,000 kitting out the vessel . The 56-year-old spent the money on naval artefacts, a periscope and dummy torpedoes for the vessel . The 'captain' has toured the waterways of Northern Ireland and northern Britain self-made barge, named U-8047 . Both Williams, of Blackpool, Lancashire, and Howarth, 28, formerly of the same address, hijacked the identities of friends and associates in an attempt to hide the fraud. Williams, also known as Stephen Howarth, was charged under the naval title and a series of other aliases he is claimed to have used - after the raid on his self-made barge in January 2012. In May 2011, Williams spoke to the Mail while touring around the Liverpool waterways dressed in full German submarine commander regalia. He told reporters he was a former mobility scooter salesman and had spent more than £50,000 building the U-boat. He also revealed that the boat had been subject to attack from passers-by who thought that he was a Nazi.

Despite this, the filed false tax returns and invoices for more than £1million . Sandra Smith, assistant director of criminal investigation at HMRC, said: ‘Their attempts to extort money from the public purse were brazen and the pair went to great lengths to try and cover their tracks.’ The pair appeared at Manchester Crown Court yesterday having admitted to several charges of fraud. Williams pleaded guilty to three counts of cheating the public revenue and one of having an article used for fraud. Howarth has pleaded guilty to three counts of furnishing false returns. They spoke only to confirm their names before the case was adjourned until April in order for reports to be prepared.","Richard Williams, 56, spent £50,000 kitting out the vessel he named U-8047 .

"A group of Avant-garde light designers in Melbourne are about to take an apartment tower and transform it into a beautiful canvas that can tell you more about the weather than looking up at the sky. Thirty-five 'fins' run up and down the 40-story structure that hold 250,000 diffused LED's. Bruce Ramus, creative director of the project, said every half hour the building will communicate the next day's weather forecast, while during the remaining time it will be like a 'light house' communicating the 'feel' of the weather through light. Scroll down for video . The building will communicate the next day's weather forecast as well as reflecting the current 'feel' of the weather . 250,000 LED bulbs are responsible for the flickering lights that can be programmed to look like rain or wind . 'Essentially, if the weather changes, so will the lights,' he told Daily Mail Australia. After spending eight years living in Melbourne Mr Ramus said he noticed Melburnians had a peculiar obsession with the weather and thought it could be possible to 'bring light to a community' in a way that articulates what it actually feels like to be there. During the day it will appear to be a normal building but as the sun goes down and the city is plunged into darkness, you will really see the effects of the lights. 'There's a lot of movement available to this lighting system so if it ever gets windy down in the Docklands, the lights will move directionally with the wind. Every half hour, tomorrows weather forecast will wrap around the building . 'The movement isnt physical but the way we can program the lights means there will be a sense of gentle but apparent movement,' he said. He explained that by experimenting with the lights programming he can take a cool blue and introduce a shadow that can make it appear as if the building is moving, as rain would. The light show will be based off weather data sent through by the Bureau of Meteorology. Don't expect the building to look like the weather forecast app on your phone though as Mr Ramus wants the building to echo more than the temperature. 'It's not necessarily about what the light does but how it makes you feel.' 'We really want to explore how a cool change feels, or the breaking sun feels,' he added. Visionary: Mr Ramus wants architecture to reflect nature and humanity instead of the static concrete jungle we see today . Mr Ramus said light is a language everyone can understand because we don't understand it through our brains, but instead feel and understand it through our bodies. 'When you see a blue light, you might not be able to describe it but you get how it feels. Light is a language we don't have to think about,' he added. Mr Ramus said he wanted to bring a feeling of movement that's engaging so buildings can start to relate to people and reflect humanity. 'You get it out there in nature all the time. There are subtle movements in trees or the ocean. Then when we go to cities, it is just static chunks of concrete and glass. I would prefer they reflect us and the natural elements we are from.' The Lend Lease building is expected to be completed in early 2017 however Mr Ramus said, if all goes to plan, the lights should be up and running next year.","A Melbourne building will light up to reflect the current weather .

"A London-based property agency is promising to find those seeking a house-share the perfect flatmate, with just two small conditions woven into their contracts; they must be young...and they must be rich. The owner of Capital Living, based in the city's South-West, Adam Goff, describes his unique flat-sharing process as 'a selective living community for people who want to meet new people' which might translate as 'hooking you up with posh flatmates, but only if you're posh yourself'. Indeed Goff, 30, offers more than just a room in one of his 22 properties, mostly Victorian terraces in places such as Clapham, Balham and Fulham. A room to rent with 'cool friends' as part of the package: Adam Goff, 30, founder of Capital Living aims to hook up 'young and rich' professionals in his flatshares across South West London . Do you come here often? All of the Capital Living properties come with open-plan kitchens to encourage flatmates to chat more freely . For an average flat-fee of £1,050 a month, tenants can rest assured that their fellow flat-sharers will be somewhere between the ages of 21 to 39 with a flourishing career, often in the City, and a definite predisposition for partying. Those who have seen the lives of London's richest youngsters in hit television show Made in Chelsea are looking for something similar but don't always know how to get it, says Goff. He told the Times newspaper: 'I don’t think you have to be posh to deal with us, but young and rich is probably a fair assessment.' The owner describes the set-up as a 'social experience' and says young professionals in London often need 'someone to sit and watch TV with, go for a beer with, have a takeaway with' when they get home from a hard day at the office. Each property comes with a gas barbecue and a communal kitchen space. The company treats potential tenants - or 'members' as they call them - as if they were looking for a membership at an exclusive club such as Soho House with couples banned for fear of killing a flat's sociable atmosphere. They face an interview process at the company's Clapham offices to see whether they 'would fit with our community'. Welcome to the community! Capital Living founder Adam Goff regularly throws parties for new tenants. The photo above shows 'members' during a night out at London's Kensington Roof Gardens . A cartoon on the company's website tells the story of how Mr Goff was inspired to start his flat-share company by a miserable, friendless experience when he first moved to London from Birmingham . Going solo: Couples are banned from renting rooms in the houses for fear they'll dampen the party mood . Parties, often a landlord's worst nightmare, are actively encouraged with new tenants, often who've never lived in London before, invited to the get-togethers. A recent night out saw Goff, his three-strong team of employees and a raft of their tenants enjoying the charms of West End nightclub Mahiki, a favourite with Prince Harry. Does he not worry about the potential for damage? He tells FEMAIL: 'We take a security deposit from our members, in much the same way a letting agent would. 'The reality is that our members are earning their own money and therefore understand the value of money and respect our property and importantly each other. The nirvana of London living for twentysomethings? Flats come with modular sofas, communal kitchens and a gas barbecue in the properties' gardens . Chloe Smith has lived in Capital Living properties for two years and says they are good value . Chloe Smith, 25, works in publishing and has lived in Capital Living properties for two years. Originally from Poole in Dorset, Chloe   says that she was cynical about the 'flat-fee rent' at first but was soon won over. Currently sharing a flat with three others in Balham, she says she loves the fact that the company houses like-minded people together. 'I spotted the ad on the website Spareroom.co.uk and thought it might be a scam at first...it sounded too good to be true. 'Flat-hunting in London is a nightmare so I went for it and actually it's been brilliant. I actually think the rent is great value because lots of things are included that you'd probably pay extra for elsewhere. 'I've met some really good friends, a couple who will probably be friends for life and I even introduced my flatmate to a friend and they're now dating. 'Every house-share has annoying people but so far, bar one guy who left pretty quickly, I've liked everyone that I've lived with.' 'In fact, this is a large reason why people choose to live in our community. Of course there is the occasional house party but there is little chance of things getting out of hand because everyone has work on Monday morning and if there is a bit of mess the house goes back to normal after a good clean from our cleaning team!' Goff says that a lonely experience when he first moved to the city following a university course in Birmingham prompted him to start the company with £16,000 in savings. Although the flat-fee service is around £300 more expensive than your average room rental in, say, Clapham, it's a room that comes with a built-in social life plus a weekly cleaner and boring domestic essentials such as dishwasher tablets. One such tenant who says the agency is a perfect fit is Robert Hart. Living in leafy Balham with three flatmates, the investment banker totally buys into the 'social living' idea and used the company to find not just a place to live but an instant social circle. 'I moved to London from Worcestershire,' he says '...and I wanted to broaden my social circle.' He describes the experience so far as having a 'built-in social life'. Although Goff's tenants are almost all at the beginning or mid-way through what promises to be a glittering career, he's less accepting of 'trust-funders'. 'Young people need to earn an honest crust,' he says, although he's not averse to fretful parents paying the rent while their offspring find their way in the big smoke. Goff says they've had no real problems with unruly tenants to date with expectations at the interview process 'high'. He says: 'In six years we have never had to evict anyone, have we asked people to leave or not allowed them to renew? Sure, but not for anything to write home about. 'Our members are professionals and have too much going for them to do anything that would risk their careers.'

"He walked away from chart toppers One Direction because, in his own words, he wanted to be a regular 22-year-old. But on Saturday afternoon Zayn Malik confirmed persistent rumours that he has teamed up with hit producer Naughty Boy during an apparent break at a London recording studio.

"Girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour – not for their ability – according to a major study (file picture) Girls are being over-praised and given higher marks at school for their good behaviour – not for their ability – according to a major study. And this is making life more difficult for them when they enter the jobs market, where rewards are primarily based on what they know, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It said girls are much more likely than boys to be model pupils. Their diligence and obedience in the classroom is often ‘rewarded’ with higher marks, while many boys are ‘punished’ with poor marks for being disruptive. It may mean marks reflect good or bad attitudes to studying, but not necessarily aptitude. The OECD warned that girls who may do better in the short run at school could be ‘penalised’ in the labour market later on. It called on teachers to review their own ‘gender biases’ and consider whether marking girls up was really helping them. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director for education and skills, said that even when girls and boys do similarly well in reading and maths tests, girls get better marks. Teenagers with a strong belief in their abilities are more likely to be successful in Britain than in any other country, the study also showed. Those youngsters who were self confident scored higher in maths and science tests, according to analysis by the OECD. And although the pattern is replicated across the world, the effect is more marked in the UK compared to any other country. Meanwhile the research also showed that even though girls outperform boys overall in schools, they are still lagging behing when it comes to maths and science. The report warned: 'What emerges from these anayses is particularly worrying. 'Even many high-achieving girls have low levels of confidnece in their ability to solve science and mathematics problems and express high levels of anxiety towards mathematics.' ‘Maybe in the short run, you get a better school certificate,’ he said. ‘In the long run, the world is going to penalise you because the labour market doesn’t pay you for your school marks, it pays you for what you can do.’ Teachers consistently give better results to girls than boys, even when they perform similarly in the international Pisa tests, which are run by the OECD. The study, based on data from tests taken by 15-year-olds in maths, reading and science, looked at gender differences in education. It said: ‘Girls’ better marks may reflect that they tend to be “better students” than boys: they tend to do what is expected of them, thanks to better self-regulation skills, and they are more driven to excel in school.’ Children who play computer games regularly do better than their peers at school, the OECD research also suggests. It found that those who played one-player games in moderation performed better in core subjects than those who never played. It said many games ‘incorporate good learning principles’ and ‘hone problem-solving skills’.

"A British couple on holiday in Goa were left with just 10p after their £2,000 spending money was stolen from their hotel's safe. Dominique Pattrick, 29 and her husband Brett, 31, had been advised by staff at their three star hotel to store their valuables in a safety deposit box housed near the reception, but just four days into their trip it was raided. The padlock on the secure locker had not been tampered with but all their money, stored in two lockers, was missing. When they asked to inspect the hotel's CCTV, staff told the couple there were no cameras in the the safety deposit room as they feared it would be an 'invasion or privacy' for guests. Dominique Pattrick, 29, and her husband, Brett, 31, were left with just 10p to their name after £2,000 was stolen from their hotel's safety deposit box . The money went missing just four days into the couples sunshine break in the three star hotel in the popular  resort . Bosses at the Silver Sand Hotel in Candolim, then landed them with a bill of £13 for using the locker. Police in Goa suspect the money was stolen by a rogue member of staff at the hotel using a duplicate skeleton key. Mr and Mrs Pattrick, from Bury, Greater Manchester were forced to ring home to get their bank to activate their credit cards so they could finance the rest of the two week trip which was booked through Thomsons Holidays. Now they are only be able to reclaim £250 due to a clause in their travel insurance policy. Mrs Pattrick, an NHS therapist said: 'It was bad enough that the money went missing from the safety deposit box but to then charge us for using it was bare faced cheek. 'We were left with just a few rupees worth around ten pence and we had to ring home to unlock our credit cards to see us through. On arrival at the hotel the couple were advised to store their valuables in a locker located at the reception . 'The terrible thing was people were trying to make out that no money went missing at all. 'Goa used to be a special place and we got married there but I would never go back now.' The couple were holidaying with friends when trouble occurred on the fourth day of last month's trip. There were no CCTV camera in the secure locker room . Mrs Pattrick whose husband works as a mechanical engineer said: 'The hotel and Thomsons themselves suggested we did not keep valuables in the room and instead use the locker at reception and we assumed that was good advice. 'The money was kept in two wallets inside the locked deposit box along with a watch and four passports and the idea was to get small amounts of money every few days. It was a total shock to see the cash had gone. 'The safety deposit box was not tampered with and the lock was still intact as was left accordingly. Both wallets had even left zipped up as we left them. The only items not missing were our passports, watch and credit cards. 'We alerted the hotel and the police but we couldn't believe it when we heard there was no CCTV cameras in the area of the safety deposit boxes. The manager said there were no cameras in the safety deposit box room because he did not want guest to complain about invasion of privacy. 'It is pretty obvious what happened but they wouldn't accept responsibility for what happened to us. The manager said that the money would have been taken during the night because there were too many people around during the day and he went about calling the night receptionist and night porter to attend the police station for questioning. The police said the money was most likely stolen by a duplicate key.' A holiday rep from Thomsons logged a complaint but warned the Pattricks hotel staff doubted their allegations a rogue employee had taken the missing money. The group later moved to the nearby Marinha Dourada in Arpora. The couple had previously got married in Goa, but have said they would never return after the experience . Mrs Pattrick said her holiday was 'ruined' and she spent the whole break 'crying' as a result of the theft . Mrs Pattrick said: 'It was being implied we had stolen our own money or that the money was never in the safety deposit box to begin with. We were extremely distressed by what she was saying. 'We felt alone and unsupported from the hotel management and Thomson's reps. We just felt we could no longer stay at the hotel and the manager stated ' it was probably for the best we didn't stay at the hotel. 'Nothing was done to help us other than us requesting to move hotel to a lower star rating than we had paid for. The holiday was ruined. Lots of distress and upset was caused and we only had enough money to buy food and drink after the theft. 'Our money was stolen whilst it was in possession of the hotel and they had the timerity to charged us for it. This holiday was nothing short of a nightmare and we felt very much alone and isolated. I couldn't even tell my parents about it. All I did that holiday was cry.' A report by the Calangute police said: 'The unknown employee ie: receptionist and room boy of Silver Sand Hotel committed theft of 2000 pounds from the safe locker by using duplicate key.' A spokesman for Thomsons said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of the group's complaint. As soon as we were made aware of their reported loss our holiday advisors in resort did everything that they could to assist, including helping them to secure a police report for their insurance claim. 'We would like to reassure customers that incidents of this type are extremely rare and also take the opportunity to remind customers of the importance of taking out a travel insurance policy when booking their holiday.'","Dominique Pattrick and husband Brett were on holiday in Goa, India .

"The Talk co-host Julie Chen spent years living with the shame that her maternal grandfather was a rich playboy and a polygamist, but she was moved to learn that he also selflessly risked his life during World War II and used his wealth to fund a school in the village where he had grown up. On last night's episode of the TLC series Who Do You Think You Are?, the show traveled to China for the first time as Julie uncovered the mystery behind her later grandfather Lou Gaw Tong's 'improper upbringing' and was led to her family's ancestral home where she met a distant relative that she didn't even know she had. 'My impression of my grandfather before I set out on this journey was I just thought of him as this big successful business man - this rich playboy guy - but now I respect him much more than I ever did,' the 45-year-old mom said of her mother's father, who died before she was born.

Selfless act: The 45-year-old met with Dr Andres Rodriguez at the Singapore Annkway Association, where she learned that her grandfather Lou Gaw Tong risked his life for the Chinese resistance during World War II . At the start of the episode Julie explained that only knew that her grandfather had a dramatic 'rags to riches story' and many wives. Lou had made his money by opening grocery stores and later investing in a shipping company, essentially building himself an empire. He had nine wives, six of who bore him children. 'The stories I heard he liked to live large,' she said. 'I think he was someone who indulged in everything and anything.' Julie, who is married to Leslie Moonves, the President and CEO of CBS Corporation, said she was inspired to learn more about her family after the birth of their five-year-old son Charlie. 'Five years ago when my son was born it was like a revival of me trying to get back in touch with my Chinese roots,' she said. 'It's important for me to have it back in my life, so I could put it into my sons life.' Julie first traveled to the National Library of Singapor where she met with Jason Lim, historian from the University of Wollongong. During her time with Jason, it was revealed that that her grandfather was described as having an 'improper childhood' - without any explanation as to what that meant. She also learned that Lou had relocated to Rangoon, now Yangon in Myanmar, Burma, as a child and later moved to Singapore after World War II. Living legacy: Julie can be seen happily meeting with the children who attend the school that her grandfather had founded in 1937 . Family history: The Talk co-host also met with the school's vice principal, who revealed that her great-grandfather was a government official . He was described as philanthropist, which was something Julie admitted that she had never heard about him before. After discovering that he was a member of the Singapore Annkway Association, she headed to the organization's headquarters in order to speak with historian Dr Andres Rodriguez and learn more about her relative. At the meeting, Dr Rodriguez told Julie that Lou would bravely travel to some of the most dangerous places to be during the war. As a part of the Chinese resistance, he risked his life by taking trucks of ammunition into Japanese occupied territory. 'I feel fortunate; I already feel like I've hit the jackpot,' she said. 'To see a document with your grandfather's name with a detailed account of what his role was during World War II... How many people get to say they have that?' She added: 'I have a new found respect for my grandfather.' Julie's next top was to the village in Anxi County where her grandfather was born to visit the Anshan School he had founded. Long-lost relative: Julie met her grandfather's niece Ke Yuchai, who is actually her cousin once removed, during a trip to her ancestral home . Amazing talk: Julie was pictured speaking to Ke Yuchai with the help of a translator at her family's home in rural China . During her travels, she wondered if the school would be run down or if it was even still functioning. 'Wow, this is way more modern than I thought it would be,' she said when she arrived at her destination. The school's vice principal showed Julie her grandfather's name on a plaque outside of the building, which currently has 856 students. Julie was proud to learn that they all knew who were grandfather was. Because the school was about to publish a book about its history, the administrators were able to tell Julie that her family's ancestral home was still standing. 'I am so impressed at what my grandfather created in 1937,' she told the cameras. 'Seeing a big picture of him on the wall where these young school children are getting an education because of him just warmed up my soul.' She continued: 'I was very surprised to hear that my great-grandfather had this idea that education would empower people because I have never heard one word about him.' When Julie headed to her family's home in rural China she met her grandfather's niece Ke Yuchai, her cousin once removed, and discovered that her great grandfather was a highly-educated government official. Coming together: During this meeting, Julie learned that her great-grandfather was the equivalent of the head of the US Department of Education, but was left with nothing after his job was no longer deemed necessary . Monumental trip: Julie smiled by the water during her trip to China. She later said it was a 'great privilege' to learn her family history . She was still confused as to why her grandfather was said to have had an improper childhood when it appeared that he had a privileged one. It was later revealed that her great-grandfather, Lou Gaw Tong's father, Lou Rulin, was the equivalent of the head of the US Department of Education and was appointed by the Emperor to give the Imperial Examination to young scholars. But when the Qin Dynasty abolished the exam, he was left jobless with no other career options to fall back on. He died when Julie's grandfather was young, forcing him to enter the workforce when he was just 13 years old. 'It makes sense now that my grandfather had to make his own way in the world,' she said noting that she now had a much clearer picture of her family's history. For the last stop on her trip, Julie, Ke Yuchai and her other distant relatives traveled to her great-grandfather's tomb where they prayed and made an offering in his honor. 'It's a real privilege to be able to say I have been here and take this back to my parents, my siblings and my son,' she said. 'It's very special. It's an amazing family history.'","The Talk co-host's grandfather died before she was born, however she was still ashamed about his 'improper upbringing'

"Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone planned to kill herself with her sister Wendy in a suicide pact - but got cold feet at the last second and called a friend for help, according to police. Police told TMZ that both Jill and her sister Wendy, who was deaf and partially blind, made the decision to kill themselves along with their three dogs. Jill was arrested last week for murder, but then later released without charge. She was pictured on Friday walking to her lawyer's office wearing large dark sunglasses that covered her eyes. Jill, 52, allegedly set up a way to asphyxiate she and her sister in their garage with carbon monoxide but Jill became scared, called a friend, and the friend called 911, say law enforcement.

Former Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone who was charged with the murder of her sister, Wendy, before being acquitted earlier this week visits her lawyer's office on Friday . When paramedics arrived Wendy was dead. Jill was suffering from severe carbon monoxide poisoning. She was arrested for murder but was later released after the District Attorney sent her case back to the LAPD for further investigation. Jill in tears as she returned to the San Fernando Valley home where her sister died for the first time on Thursday. The TV producer hid behind sunglasses and a baseball cap as a friend drove her to the house she had shared with her sister, whose death by asphyxiation is being treated as a murder by police. The 52-year-old was visibly shaken as she approached the home, and she could be seen wiping her eyes after undergoing a particularly traumatic week. Jill had initially been charged with Wendy’s murder, but the Los Angeles District Attorney dropped the charges and she was released on Wednesday afternoon. Painful: Hollywood producer Jill Blackstone was in tears as she returned to the San Fernando Valley home on where her sister was murdered for the first time on Thursday evening .

Dog's died: Jill was an animal activist and there were three dogs found dead in the garage with her sister Wendy and it is believed the sisters planned on killing the animals during their suicide . However, many questions remain over her partially blind and deaf sister’s death. Wendy was found on Saturday in the home’s garage, asphyxiated by carbon monoxide gas. Also found at the scene was a handwritten suicide note, which police determined had been written by Jill. She was treated in hospital for effects of gas inhalation for two days before being discharged, at which time she was arrested. House of horrors: The San Fernando Valley home where Jill Blackstone lived with her sister Wendy . Earlier, a police spokesperson emphasized Wendy’s death is still being treated as a murder. LAPD officer Drake Madison told Daily Mail Online this is 'an ongoing murder investigation'. 'Jill Blackstone was arrested on Saturday but the District Attorney dropped the charges and she is no longer in custody. The investigation is still active and the police are looking for a murderer,' he added. Asked if the police could re-arrest Jill, officer Madison said he had no further information to give at this time. Neighbors have speculated the sisters – who ran the Thumping Tails Animal Rescue Center together out of their home – had entered into a suicide pact and police later voiced the same opinion. Freed: Jill Blackstone painfully returns to the scene of the crime where her sister Wendy and their three dogs died in the garage from inhaling smoke and carbon monoxide . Ongoing investigation: Police say the murder investigation is ongoing and that is possible that Jill could be re-arrested . Stephanie Cohen, 60, who lives across the street from the sisters said: ‘The police were here for 12 to 14 hours on Saturday. We were told they were investigating a double suicide, an attempt, and one of the people died.’ Numerous signs are posted on the property saying it is marked for demolition. Stephanie added: ‘They were having a hard time finding a new home because the sister that died was very ill - she couldn’t see, she couldn’t hear, she was housebound, she was very ill. So she needed to find a house that could accommodate her sister with the illness and the dogs. Evidently the pressure was intense on them, but nobody expected this to happen.’ As a producer, Jill has worked on shows including Jerry Springer, Sally Jessy Raphael, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Dr. Drew On Call, The Real, and The Osbournes.

"It's well accepted that the bars preferred by backpackers offer cheap drinks and the chance to meet like-minded future Facebook friends, but Fremantle Prison YHA is offering up a whole new experience. Western Australia's only World Heritage-listed building has been transformed into a youth hostel where worldly travellers can spend a night behind bars in the cells previously occupied by hardened criminals. Bookings open this week ahead of the opening of the hostel following a renovation of the famous institution's Women's Prison which took nine months. Bookings open this week for the Fremantle Prison YHA, a youth hostel in Western Australia's only World Heritage-listed building . Perfectly manicured lawns have replaced the dirt-covered yard that prisoners would have used for exercise in the former jail . A combination of new and old is found at the Fremantle Prison's new short-term accommodation . The Fremantle Prison's Women's division has been transformed from a place for incarceration to a haven for young travellers . YHA spokeswoman Emily Abbott says the launch of the hostel will be the culmination on five years of planning for a project that almost didn't get off the ground but that it is now ‘one of the most unique accommodation options in the country’. The north-western complex of the prison was built in the 1850s and originally served as the cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry but the closure of Perth Gaol meant a place was needed to keep female prisoners. They were transferred to Fremantle and the wing was secured by an extra wall to keep them in, with varying results. And as Western Australia’s criminals increased with the population, the division was further extended until it was rendered redundant by the building of the specialist Bandyup Women's Prison in 1970. The entire prison was closed in 1991 and its historic status has since been confirmed and honoured by Unesco, a blessing and a curse as far as the hostel is concerned. Inspection time at the cells will take on a whole new meaning when the Fremantle Prison YHA opens soon . A double bunk fits perfectly in this rather luxurious cell formerly occupied by law-breaking women . Hangings, floggings and some famous escapes once took place in the prison soon to be filled with smiling faces . The Fremantle Prison's cookhouse before being devoted to women has extensive stainless steel food preparation facilities . ‘The status as a World Heritage site added many challenges to the development, which was shelved a number of times before finally receiving approval in April 2014,' Abbott says. Building approval was officially given the green light the following month. The prison itself was built by convicts between 1851 and 1859, and was consequently referred to as the Convict Establishment. It remained a prison for 136 years until it closed, with the Women's Prison part of the property used as education facilities by TAFE School of Art and Design from 1993 to 2009. Fremantle Prison was built by convicts from 1851-1859 and the majority of original features have been preserved throughout the facility . Reminders of the history of the prison, from past inmates to renowned escapees, are found throughout the halls . A tribute of sorts on the wall honouring Estelle Williams, an escapee who climbed onto the roof and then perimeter wall to get out in 1931 . A recreation of a  typical cell that would have been home to a Fremantle inmate around 1855 . The Fremantle Prison's entire complex serves as a popular and award-winning tourist attraction in its own right . Only a small overhaul was needed - and allowed due to the heritage listing's restrictions - to turn the prison into short-term accommodation which Abbott says is 'as prison-like as it is comfortable'. The walls, floors, windows and bars in some case retain the feeling of a place where you could be locked in with the key thrown away, but additional facilities have also been added to bring the hostel in line with its competitors. For those who don't like the idea of being behind bars, the Victorian-style guards’ cottages outside the front gates are a more luxurious option. The women once locked away in this wing would have usually ‘offended the good order’ of society, with the most common offences including 'vagrancy, loitering in public places, drunkenness, obscenity, soliciting, running a brothel, being idle or having no visible means of support'.","Fremantle Prison is Western Australia's only World Heritage-listed building .

"As the jury in the Jodi Arias trial reached an impasse last week, prosecutors and fellow jurors attempted to remove a holdout on the panel who was the only obstacle in the way of securing a death sentence against the convicted murderer. A court document released Tuesday by the judge in the case reveals the behind-the-scenes wrangling in the jury room as Arias' fate hung in the balance. Jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago. 'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying. Scroll down for video . A court document released Tuesday by the Judge Sherry Stephens (above) reveals the behind-the-scenes wrangling in the jury room as Arias' fate hung in the balance . All but one juror voted to sentence convicted killer Arias (above) to death . A court on Tuesday also announced it was launching an internal investigation into how the identities of Arias jurors were revealed online just hours after the trial ended as Arizona law prohibits the public release of a juror's identity, though many of the Arias panel members agreed to speak with reporters after the trial ended. The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing. 'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement released Tuesday. Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, said the leaks won't change the outcome of the case, noting that mistrial decisions can't be appealed. Arias was convicted of murder in Alexander's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. A new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question. Arias was charged with killing her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander . The one juror who voted against the death penalty admitted to seeing the Lifetime film about the case (above) A mistrial was declared Thursday after five days of deliberations, removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for Arias. The judge is scheduled to decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years. Most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. Judge Sherry Stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors, including the holdout, who said she wasn't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial. Stephens said the holdout had disclosed, before being picked as a juror, that she had seen the Lifetime movie about the Arias case, but never watched it all the way through. The judge said the holdout juror didn't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie. The judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her Facebook page another film that Arias found influential. And the case's chief investigator said the holdout, who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from Facebook, had liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The judge noted that it would take two weeks to get records from Facebook to determine whether the holdout had clicked on news feeds on her page.","A court document released Tuesday reveals that jurors and the prosecution in the Jodi Arias case wanted one juror removed from the proceedings .

"A North Carolina man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six to 10 years in prison on Wednesday for handcuffing an 11-year-old boy by his ankle to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as punishment. Former Emergency Room nurse Dorian Harper entered the plea to three felonies, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and maiming without malice. His plea came a day after a jury was seated in the case. 'Yes, sir,' Harper, 58, said when the trial judge asked if he was guilty. Dorian Harper (left) pleaded guilty on Wednesday to handcuffing his girlfriend Wanda Larson's (right) foster son, 11, to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as a punishment . Harper rejected prosecutors' plea deal Monday, saying he wanted the trial to go on. He and his girlfriend, 58-year-old Wanda Larson, were arrested after a sheriff's deputy found the boy in November 2013. 'This is a very serious case, with very serious implications for Mr. Harper,' Judge Brad Long told the jury Tuesday. Larson was the boy's guardian and a Department of Social Services supervisor in Union County. Larson faces similar charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Authorities said they think Harper tied the dead chicken around the boy's neck as punishment for killing one of the chickens on the 5-acre farm where they lived. The indictment against the couple said the boy had been subject to abuse that also included being chained to a piece of railroad track in his room. Harper cut the boy's face with a knife and used an electric wire to burn his face, according to the indictment. The chicken: Dorian Harper is guilty of chaining his 11-year-old foster son to the porch with this chicken tied around his neck as a punishment . It also said the boy once broke his wrist trying to escape. Four other children — ages 7 to 14, all adopted by Larson — were removed from the home after Harper and Larson were arrested. They also had one 20-year-old adopted son. After his arrest,  Harper  lost his job as an emergency room nurse and Larson lost her county job working for social services. After the incident in the 2013, the 20-year-old, who didn't want to be named, said his adopted parents Wanda Larson and Dorian Harper provided a 'loving and caring home' but the boy has severe psychological issues, including a history of being cruel to animals. He said his parents' punishment, though he didn't condone it, was a last ditch attempt to control the child's behavior and protect the rest of the household. Everyone says this is some sweet innocent kid when in actuality, he is not. He has been to counseling, he is on numerous heavy medications, but nothing has worked,' the brother told KHOU in 2013. The brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to 'shame the child.' 'There has to be something going on, between that child and that chicken,' he said. 'He either, one, didn't feed it and it died, or two, either he was out there harassing the chicken. He may have killed the chicken. This child has been known to be cruel to animals.' He said the controversial discipline was his father's doing, as his mother, who would have put a stop to it, wasn't home at the time. The brother explained the 11-year-old, who had lived at the home since he was six, was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem, not because he was being mistreated. 'He would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer, let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw,' the man, who moved out of the home two years ago, when he turned 18, told KHOU. The home: Police and neighbors described the family's home as being covered in feces with such a pungent smell it 'takes your breath away' 'He has severe psychological issues.' 'He was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then, throw the lunch box away and say he didn't have lunch for the day.' Union County Sheriff deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment. But the brother insisted his parents cared for the children. 'Everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused, that is not accurate. You ask all four of the children, they will say they lived in a loving and caring home,' he said. The account contradicts claims from the 11-year-old's relatives who say they have tried for years to get DSS to look into the allegations of abuse. Union County Sheriff Animal Services were at the house early this week gathering the property's remaining animals, including an estimated 75 fowl (chicken, ducks, guineas and peacock) three horses, three donkeys, two llamas, eight dogs and a hog. It was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away. Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'. Disturbing: Larson, a former child services worker, lived at this property with four adopted children and the 11-year-old who was the only foster child . Another neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'. 'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn't know where he lived,' she said. The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich. 'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said. He told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.' Her daughter called 911 and a sheriff's deputy came out, spoke with the boy, made a phone call, then told him she'd take him home. 'He didn't refuse. He just went with her.' The neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn't been missing more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home. 'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.' Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'. 'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,' he said. Chance finding: Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to this porch . 'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.' All the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza. Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch. He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'","Dorian Harper pleaded guilty on Wednesday to to handcuffing his foster son, 11, to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck .

However, many of the changes in the books are so tiny they are easy to miss at first glance and Ladybird book enthusiasts have enjoyed spotting and commenting on them. 'The pictures from the 1964 books had quite a retro feel even at that time, which is why they were changed just ten years later,' said Helen. 'Britain changed a lot during the Sixties and Seventies as there was more awareness of sexual discrimination and people became more safety conscious and the books started to look quite dated. 'Parents and teachers wrote in to complain and many of the books were given a subtle makeover to bring them up to date.' One of the most popular set of  'before and after' pictures on Helen’s Twitter page shows Mummy and Daddy wrapping up Christmas presents. Domestic bliss as Jane quietly reads, but in a later version (right) the children argue . Peter and Jane originally looked onto fields (left) but later the view changed to reflect more housing . The children were helped onto the bus in early editions by a bus conductor but catch it themselves a few years later in a new bus with no-one to help them on it . In the 1960s, Mummy is wrapping the present and Daddy is just watching, but in the later version daddy is pictured enthusiastically holding a pink ribbon and taking part. 'The artwork is almost identical, but there is a very tiny difference and it shows that the role of dad has started to change,' said Helen. 'There is another photo called The Picnic in which Daddy is shown dressed in a suit and looking very uncomfortable, but by the 70s he is dressed down and joining in.' Other pictures were altered as parents became more safety conscious. A life jacket has been drawn on to a little boy in a dinghy, dogs are put on leads and a pavement is drawn alongside an ice cream van, instead of showing children running into the road. 'Another illustration, The Car Journey, shows Peter and Jane both sitting in the front of the car with their daddy in the 1960s, but a decade later, seatbelts have been added and Peter is now on the back seat,' added Helen. 'In another drawing, the children are shown running to a stream to try out their new boat, but in the later pictures an adult is now with them to keep them safe and the water has been made more shallow.' A shopkeeper weighs the sweets for the children (left) but he was later removed and the children helped themselves as the number of supermarkets increased . Jane throws to Peter in an earlier version of the story (left) but later she is in jeans and batting too . More sketches show how the world had become more urban by the 1970s. A drawing of Peter and Jane watching a sunset out of their window shows a view of the countryside in the early work, but this is later replaced by an urban sprawl. Even a trip to the sweet shop is brought up to date with scales and a shopkeeper in the first picture and a self-service approach by the 1970s. Jane is also no longer seen feeding a sweet to the dog inside the store due to stricter thoughts on health and safety. Peter and Jane are also given modern makeovers in the new pictures, with Jane’s crisp white dress replaced by scruffy jeans. Their roles become less stereotypical as the books evolve, with Jane finally allowed to use a cricket bat and jump over a cardboard box. You have to look carefully, but the dog is now on a lead in the later version on the right . Seatbelts have been added in the picture, right, but safety wasn't such a big issue in the earlier version . Jane helpfully holds the tent for Peter (left) but they both get stuck in later (right) 'Many of the early pictures show Peter and Jane playing nicely together, but in the later ones they are seen arguing and behaving a bit more like a typical brother and sister,' she added. Ladybird also decided to introduce more ethnic characters into its books as racial awareness increased. The station guard is given darker skin and a little boy with darker skin is positioned in the railway carriage. Helen added: 'You can also see the role of women evolving, with mum being helped down from the train in a 1960's picture, but being allowed to step down on her own in the later one, even with shopping bags.' Jane is wearing a dress and pushing a pram (left) but is seen wearing jeans and rollerskating by the 1970s . Helen, who has been collecting Ladybird books for 15 years, said people like looking at the books because it takes them back to their childhood. 'I think the pictures offer pause for thought and transport them back in time, they pack an emotional punch,' she added. 'Many of the early Peter and Jane books had a big impact on people’s lives because they were the first books they ever read in school. “I was brought up reading the 1964 books and I loved them because they were very idyllic, I was less keen on the later books because they were too much like real life.' Ladybird Books, which originally printed its titles in a 56-page format, is celebrating its centenary this year. Subtle changes: In the 1960s (left) the children ran into the road to get an ice cream but a pavement was later added to reflect improved safety expectations . Running free near the water (left) but an adult is later added to indicate the children were supervised (right) Left, Peter and Jane chat to the train driver in the story where Daddy helped Mummy disembark from the train but in a later version the duo are stopped from running onto the platform (right) Jane wears a dress and looks at dolls in a toy shop (left) but to reflect a change in attitude to gender stereotyping she is later shown in jeans and looking at go-karts . Jane is jumping for joy, but on the left it's over a skipping rope wearing a pretty dress and later she jumped over a box wearing trousers . The children enjoy a train ride but in a later version of the same story a boy with darker skin is added to the picture to reflect a growing awareness of cultural diversity .","Peter and Jane books were a childhood staple for children in 60s and 70s .

"A tour guide in the Scottish Highlands has captured the amazing moment a meteor burned up in the atmosphere in a stunning image. His long-exposure shot of Loch Ness shows the shooting star streaking across the sky. And the event is so bright that it casts its light across the water. Scroll down for video . John Alasdair Macdonald captured the image from Drumnadrochit on the west coast of Loch Ness in Scotland. His 30-second long exposure shot (shown) was taken with a Sony RX100. He said that it was just ‘sheer dumb luck' that he managed to get the photo . The photographer was John Alasdair Macdonald, a tour guide in the Scottish Highlands from Drumnadrochit on the west shore of Loch Ness, who runs the website called The Hebridean Explorer. Mr Macdonald captured the 30-second long image using a Sony RX100 compact camera at about 9pm on Sunday. And he said that it was just ‘sheer dumb luck’ that he managed to get the photo. An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt. A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system. A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up. This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere. If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite. Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets. For example, if Earth passes through the detail of a comet, much of the debris burns up in the atmosphere, forming a meteor shower. Mr Macdonald, 42, wanted to take pictures of the night to advertise the area for his business. The father-of-three, who lives in Drumnadrochit, near Inverness, said: ‘I’ve never seen a shooting star before, I couldn’t believe it. I quickly checked to see if my camera had picked it up, and it had. My wife called it sheer dumb luck. ‘I wasn’t out looking for it, it was completely unexpected. It was a total fluke.’ Nick Howes, a professional astronomer, told MailOnline that automatic triggering systems can be used to detect the bright motion of a meteor and ‘start the cameras rolling’ if others want to attempt to replicate the photo. ‘This one is, however, very aesthetically pleasing,’ he added. Also of interest are the colours in the water in the photo, which are likely due to the particular scattering of light. Eagle-eyed viewers might notice the colours of the Irish flag in the water, very apt considering it is St Patrick’s Day tomorrow. The was taken near Drumnadrochit on the west shore of Loch Ness, shown here. Mr Macdonald, 42, wanted to take pictures of the night to advertise the area for his business . The meteor was probably the size of a basketball and burned up in the atmosphere before it hit the ground. Hundreds of meteors enter Earth's atmosphere every day (illustration shown) A meteor like this is unlikely to very large, but the speed at which they enter the atmosphere produces the amazing shooting star. ‘In terms of size, it’s hard to tell with no scale reference, but a fireball this size could typically come from an object about the size of a baseball to basketball,’ said Mr Howes. Hundreds of meteors enter Earth’s atmosphere every day, but very few - if any - make it to the surface as meteorites. However, some experts have warned that we need to make more of an effort to track incoming asteroids, as they can cause damage - such as the Chelyabinsk meteor in Russia on 15 February 2013, which seemingly came out of nowhere but injured hundreds when it exploded near the ground.","John Alasdair Macdonald captured the image from Drumnadrochit .

"This is the moment a diner tried to get out of paying for his £7.25 Valentine's Day buffet meal for one by releasing his pet rat into the restaurant. Christopher Baker, 28, ordered the meal from the Borneo Bistro in Sunderland and sat down to eat alone, before pulling the pet rodent from his pocket, releasing it onto the floor and demanding a refund. Embarrassed waiters apologised and handed over the £7.25 but when pest control examined the creature they found it had the appearance of a domestic pet, and had recently 'had a haircut'. This is the moment diner Christopher Baker, 28, (pictured left) tried to get out of paying for his £7.25 Valentine's Day buffet meal for one by releasing his pet rat into the restaurant . Baker (left) admitted fraud by false representation, and was ordered to pay the restaurant the £7.25 back in compensation, but angry owner Kevin Smith (right) says Baker has caused him 'nothing but grief' Baker ordered the meal from the Borneo Bistro in Sunderland (pictured) and sat down to eat alone, before pulling the pet rodent from his pocket, releasing it onto the floor and demanding a refund . The pet rat released into the restaurant. Pest controllers said it appeared to be tame, and had recently had its fur trimmed . Bistro owner Kevin Smith then checked the restaurant's CCTV and spotted Baker producing the rat and putting it on the floor. Baker, of Houghton, Sunderland later admitted fraud by false representation, and was ordered to pay the restaurant the £7.25 back in compensation, as well as a £60 victim surcharge. 'On February 14 - Valentine's Day - Mr Baker has attended the restaurant, ordered a buffet for one and a bottle of water,' Lee Poppett, prosecuting, told Sunderland Magistrates' Court. 'He picked his food up and found a seat at a table on his own at the back of the restaurant. 'At shortly before 4pm he suddenly jumps up and shouts 'It's a rat. I'm not eating here, I want my money back'. 'Mr Smith perhaps smelled a rat at this particular point and he retrieved the rat from the floor. CCTV footage from the restaurant shows the moment Baker (pictured left) pulls the rat from his pocket . The footage shows Baker get money out of his pocket - then appear to change his mind and get the rat out . Baker retrieved the rat from his pocket as a family sitting nearby moved away from their table . 'He waited until a family moved from the table next to him and retrieved what appeared to be a rat from his pocket and dropped it on the floor. He then jumped out of his seat. 'He then claimed that whilst he's been eating, the rat has bitten his finger. He asked for his money back. 'It was a black and white rat, very calm. It did not appear to be wild at all. Acorn Pest Control attended and they said it appeared to be a pet. 'Mr Smith viewed the CCTV and saw the defendant fiddling in his pocket.' Baker then puts the rat on the floor and leaps out of his chair to the astonishment of fellow diners . The court was told that Baker had claimed that as he ate, the rat bit him on the finger . Baker was seen jumping up and shouting: 'It's a rat. I'm not eating here, I want my money back' The footage shows Baker get money out of his pocket - then appear to change his mind and get the rat out instead. He then puts it on the floor and leaps out of his chair and backs away to the astonishment of fellow diners. They then see the rat and jump up themselves and most head towards the door of the bistro looking horrified. Within minutes every customer is on their feet while staff try and catch Baker's pet. Baker was later arrested and told police that he had bought the rat from a pet shop as a gift for his daughter, before placing it in his pocket and heading to the restaurant. Willie Johnstone, defending, said: 'We do deal with some unusual cases from time to time. 'Christopher, on that day, had been drinking heavily and unfortunately he decided to buy a rat for his daughter by way of a present. A fellow customer points out the rat to a member of restaurant staff inside the bistro . 'Unfortunately, he then decided to go for a meal. He sat down and ate his meal. When he had finished the meal, he took the rat out. He is very remorseful for his behaviour.' In a victim statement read out in court, Mr Smith said the potential damage to his business's reputation could have been 'catastrophic', and that Baker could have ruined the future of the restaurant that he had spent seven years building up. As well as being ordered to pay the victim surcharge and compensation, Baker was sentenced to a 12-month community order with supervision. He was also banned from going to the restaurant for a year. Chairman of the bench, Derek Moss, said: 'This is a very serious matter as what you have done here could in a split-second have ruined this man's business, which he has worked for years to build up a reputation for.' Speaking after the case, Mr Smith branded Baker 'scum', and said he deserved to be punished. The 47-year-old said: 'He is just the scum of the earth. He could have destroyed the reputation I have built up over seven years. 'I was devastated. I thought 'that's it my business is gone'. I didn't sleep that night. 'People like him deserve the death penalty.' 'As far as I'm concerned, he shouldn't be in our society. He is no use to anybody and he's caused nothing but grief. 'I find it unbelievable that someone could be willing to go to those lengths for a free meal.'","Christopher Baker, 28, ordered meal from Borneo Bistro in Sunderland .

"An eye test that has improved the performance of British Olympic stars and elite rugby players is helping transform children's reading skills, experts claim. The £189 test – a more advanced form of a high street eye exam – has already boosted the concentration of champion skier Chemmy Alcott by recommending she wear pink-tinted goggles to reduce glare while hurtling 80mph down the slopes. Experts also say they have improved reaction times of members of the English women's lacrosse team. Now parents claim that children taking the test are improving their reading speeds – and performing better at school. An eye test that has improved the performance of British skier Chemmy Alcott (pictured) is helping transform children's reading skills . Those behind the test say it identifies people suffering from 'visual stress', which means their eyes are over-sensitive to black and white and words appear to swim on the page. It is thought this happens because cells in the area of the brain responsible for vision get over-excited by the pattern and work too fast, causing text to become distorted. Studies suggest as many as one in four has this problem. However, most are unaware they are affected and the condition is not picked up during a routine visit to an optician. Children with the sensitivity are said to lose concentration easily because they struggle to focus on text, and can fail to perform well at school despite being bright. Experts at Vision in Learning, the company behind the test, say many can be helped by using colour-tinted glasses or a transparent sheet of coloured plastic which can be laid on top of textbooks. Colour is thought to 'calm' the cells so that the image becomes stabilised. But the colour each person needs to correct the problem is different – and scientists are unable to explain why. Charlie Raynes, 14, was lagging behind his twin sister at school but after taking the test passed his 11-plus . Charlie Raynes, 14, from Colchester, was lagging behind his twin sister Annabel at school and was regularly placed bottom of the class. After taking the test, he passed his 11-plus. His mother Paula said: 'Charlie would say text would move around and he couldn't focus. He lost confidence and was very unhappy at school. When we took him to do this test, an orange colour was placed over the text and it was a eureka moment. Suddenly he could read.' The test takes place in the company's offices in Braintree, Essex, but other opticians offering it can be found via the Society for Coloured Lens prescribers. Chemmy Alcott, 32, who competed as part of Team GB in four Winter Olympics, did the test after suffering from snow-blindness. She said: 'I was skiing with a yellow-tinted lens, but the test found that my eyes had to work less hard with a pink lens. 'You put your lens down just before you start to race, and it had been taking my eyes a few minutes to adjust. With the pink, it was immediate.' Harlequins rugby team and Ipswich Town Football Club have also used the test. Members of England's women's lacrosse team improved reaction times by up to two seconds on a test that involved hitting a number of random flashing lights. Vision in Learning founder Gavin Rebello said: 'The transformation with the coloured filters is often incredible. It can be the first time a parent has heard their child read properly. There can be tears in the room.'","Advanced eye test has boosted the concentration of skier Chemmy Alcott .

"A team from a Spanish university . has discovered what Egyptian  authorities are calling the . world's oldest evidence of breast cancer in the 4,200-year-old . skeleton of an adult woman. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the . woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed . 'an extraordinary deterioration'. 'The study of her remains shows the typical destructive . damage provoked by the extension of a breast cancer as a . metastasis,' he said in a statement on Tuesday. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed'an extraordinary deterioration'. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. Despite being one of the world's leading causes of death . today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records . compared to other diseases - which has given rise to the idea . that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to . people living for longer. 'The team from University of Jaen has confirmed that the woman lived at the end of the 6th Dynasty (2200 BCE) and was part of the élite of the southernmost town of Egypt, Elephantine,' the statement said. 'The virulence of the disease impeded her to carry out any kind of labor, but she was treated and taken care during a long period until her death. ' The University of Jaen began the archaeological excavations in Qubbet el-Hawa in 2008 and their major goal is to reconstruct the life and funerary rituals of the governors of Elephantine and their families who lived between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen saidthe Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town. But the finding, along with evidence reported last year by . British researchers of metastatic cancer in a 3,000-year-old . skeleton found in a tomb in modern Sudan, suggests cancer was . around in the Nile Valley in ancient times. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said . the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the . country's southernmost town.

The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town (pictured) Other analysis - including examination of the last food found in the stomachs of three horses buried in her tomb - allowed Dr Polesmak to formulate an intriguing account of this woman's final months alive . Last year a unique MRI scan on a 2,500 year old mummified Siberian 'princess' has revealed she died after suffering from acute breast cancer. Preserved in ice in an elaborate grave in the Altai Mountains, the ancient woman - famous for her remarkable tattoos - took cannabis to dull the ravages of her illnesses, experts have also discovered. Dug from her permafrost burial chamber on the high Ukok Plateau in 1993, analysis of her remains earlier highlighted sophisticated tattoos of 'great artistry' of fantastical creatures, while in her tomb was also found clothing and headdresses, a make-up bag, and a stash of cannabis, enabling experts to build a detailed picture of her life and looks. Separately from the MRI, academics also conclude she was a virgin who lived a deliberately 'celibate' life.","Woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, country's most southern town .

"BBC Director-General Tony Hall has said he will 'gather the facts' and make a decision 'based on a whale raft of things' regarding Jeremy Clarkson's future at the corporation. Clarkson was suspended from Top Gear last week following an alleged altercation with producer Oisin Tymon. In a Q&A session at the Enders Analysis conference in London today, the first two questions directed to Lord Hall related to Clarkson. Scroll down for video . Lord Hall, Director-General of the BBC, last week described himself as a 'fan' of Top Gear presenter Clarkson . He began: 'I thought for one glorious moment, you know ...' (that he might not get a Clarkson question), a joke that drew laughs. 'The most important thing is to gather the facts around you and not listen to all the speculation and let me tell you I will gather the facts and make my decision based on a whole raft of things.' Business Insider then asked him whether it was healthy to keep staff on board who might be punching their colleagues. 'You should gather the facts from the people concerned before you make your decision and that's exactly what I'm doing,' Hall said, to more laughter. It is believed Clarkson has the support of Lord Hall and only last week he described himself as a 'fan' of the Top Gear boss. He also intervened to overrule Director of BBC television Danny Cohen last year, who was said to have wanted to take disciplinary action against the presenter in the wake of his mumbled use of the 'N-word' in a Top Gear outtake. Jeremy Clarkson was spotted leaving his west London home today in a leather jacket and dark sunglasses . The row between Clarkson and Tymon was said to have taken place because no hot food was laid on for the presenter following a day's filming in North Yorkshire. Mr Tymon did not file a formal complaint and it is understood Clarkson reported the incident himself. Writing in his column in the Sun newspaper, Clarkson appeared to hint that he was close to quitting, calling himself a 'dinosaur' and adding: 'These big imposing creatures have no place in a world which has moved on.' An online petition to reinstate Clarkson has reached more than 950,000 signatures. Media watchdog Ofcom said it had received more than 100 complaints about Top Gear being replaced on BBC Two with a Red Arrows documentary on Sunday, March 15. The critic AA Gill voiced his support for Clarkson in his Sunday Times column, calling the investigation into the row 'preposterous and ponderous', and praised Clarkson as hard-working. The controversial presenter was suspended from Top Gear last week following an alleged altercation with producer Oisin Tymon . The BBC has now launched an inquiry into what happened and Ken MacQuarrie, the senior BBC executive entrusted with sorting out the awkward affair, is believed to be in London and starting work. Clarkson's contract runs out in March, and it is not clear whether it will be renewed, or whether Clarkson himself will opt to leave the BBC. Top Gear has been taken off air while the investigation is carried out. Clarkson is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and all three men's contracts expire three days later. The BBC declined to comment on whether Clarkson's suspension, if it were still in force, would cover an appearance on a separate show. The news comes as the racing driver who was the first Stig on Top Gear has said that the BBC show would lose its 'fire' without the embattled Clarkson. Perry McCarthy, who was the show's resident racing driver between 2002 to 2003, said Top Gear without Clarkson simply 'won't work'. Elsewhere today, in a separate investigation, Clarkson was cleared of racism after the BBC ruled his use of the term 'pikey' in a Top Gear episode in February 2014 was not designed to offend gypsies and travellers.","Tony Hall will 'gather the facts' before deciding on Clarkson's future .

"A father shot dead his girlfriend and her two children before setting their home on fire, authorities have said. Corey LaValley, 32, was arrested on Tuesday for the murders of 33-year-old Debra Sheppard, his 10-year-old son Corey LaValley Jr., and Sheppard's daughter, 13-year-old Emma McComber. He is accused of shooting the trio dead at their mobile home in Dorr, Michigan on Monday before returning to the home and setting it alight on Tuesday at around 1pm. Police found LaValley at a relative's home later that evening and took him into custody without incident. He has been charged with open murder, arson and using a firearm during a felony. 'Killer': Corey LaValley, left, allegedly shot dead his girlfriend Debra Sheppard, right, and her two children on Monday before returning to their Michigan mobile home on Tuesday and setting it alight . Murdered: LaValley allegedly killed his 10-year-old son, Corey Jr, left, and his girlfriend's 13-year-old daughter, Emma McComber, from a previous relationship. Her dad said he had feared for his daughter's safety . LaValley was being held by the Allegan County sheriff's office. On Thursday afternoon, he was arraigned via video link. 'We did receive information that for us established probable cause that Corey LaValley, who is the father of one of the people we believe to be deceased, was involved in ultimately the criminal act that caused this,' Allegan County Undersheriff Frank Baker told Fox17 on Wednesday. Police told the channel that LaValley and Sheppard had been in a relationship, and neighbors told Newschannel 3 that they would often hear the couple arguing. Authorities have not released a motive for the murders but family members said LaValley had a history of violence. Records show he also had a history of arrests dating back to 2001. Devastated: Emma's father, William McComber, hugs his mother-in-law at his home in Lowell, Michigan, a day after he learned that his 13-year-old daughter, her mother and brother had been murdered . Burned down: The family's mobile in Dorr, Michigan was destroyed by a fire on Tuesday afternoon . The 13-year-old girl's father, William McComber, 36, said he had been worried for his daughter's safety. He claimed he had filed for custody of his daughter but a judge denied his request. The last time he saw her was November, he said. 'I want people to know this isn't just ""guy snaps one day, freaks out, and kills his girlfriend and kids"". This is years of building up to this, years of warning signs nobody took me seriously about.' He added: 'It's one thing to lose someone in an accident, but when I think about it and knowing the fact that my daughter was shot, intentionally… it wasn't even accidental.' On a GoFundMe page for the girl, William McComber said: 'She was loved by everyone who was lucky enough to know her.' Records show that LaValley has previously been arrested for misdemeanor assault, retail fraud and disturbing the peace in charges dating back to 2001. The family has set up GoFundMe accounts to raise money for the three funerals. Visit here for the page for the family and here for a separate page for Emma.

"Billions of stars in our galaxy have between one and three planets which could potentially support life. Astronomers came to the conclusion after calculating the chances of planets orbiting in the 'Goldilocks zone'. This is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet's surface, and for alien life to exist. The illustration shows the habitable zone for different types of stars.  The green area is the habitable zone (HZ), where liquid water can exist on a planet’s surface. The red area is too hot for liquid water on the planetary surface and the blue area is too cold for liquid water on the planetary surface . 'According to the statistics and the indications we have, a good share of the planets in the habitable zone will be solid planets where there might be liquid water and where life could exist,' said Steffen Kjaer Jacobsen, from the University of Copenhagen. The findings are based on data from the American space agency Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which has confirmed the existence of around 1,000 planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way. It has also identified an estimated 3,000 other candidate worlds. Many of the stars have solar systems of two to six planets, but scientists believe there could be more that remain undiscovered by Kepler, which is best suited to finding large planets in relatively close orbits. To estimate the positions of the 'hidden' planets, the researchers updated a 250-year-old mathematical concept called the Titius-Bode law. Pictured are exoplanetary systems where the previously known planets are marked with blue dots, while the red dots show the planets predicted by the Titius-Bode law on the composition of planetary systems. 124 planetary systems in the survey – based on data from the Kepler satellite, fit with this formula . The law, which inferred the existence of Uranus before it was seen, states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system. The Titius-Bode law was formulated around 1770 and correctly calculated the position of Uranus before it was even discovered. The law states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system. So the ratio between the orbital period of the first and second planet is the same as the ratio between the second and the third planet and so on. This means if you know how long it takes for some of the planets to orbit around a star, you can calculate how long it takes for the other planets to orbit and can calculate their position in the planetary system. You can also calculate if a planet is 'missing' in the sequence. Because of this, if you know how long it takes some planets to circle a star, you can work out the time taken for other planets to orbit and fix their positions in the planetary system. You can also calculate if a planet is missing in the sequence. 'We decided to use this method to calculate the potential planetary positions in 151 planetary systems, where the Kepler satellite had found between three and six planets,' said Mr Jacobsen. 'In 124 of the planetary systems, the Titius-Bode law fit with the position of the planets. 'Using T-B's law we tried to predict where there could be more planets further out in the planetary systems. 'But we only made calculations for planets where there is a good chance that you can see them with the Kepler satellite.' In this way, the scientists predicted a total of 228 planets in the 151 systems and concluded that each system should have an average of one to three planets in the habitable zone. Extrapolating further, this suggested that there could be billions of stars in the Milky Way with habitable zone planets where surface water and life could exist. The scientists, whose findings appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, have made a shortlist of 77 'hidden' planets. They say these planets have a good chance of being spotted as they pass in front of their parent stars . Light curves of the some of the planets orbiting the star Kepler-62. The dip in the light curve occurs when the planet moves in front of the host star, thereby dimming the light of the star. The dip in the light curve is proportional to the size of the planet. The Kepler satellite observes exoplanets by measuring the light curve of a star. When a planet moves in front of the star there is a small dip in brightness. If this little dip in brightness occurs regularly, there might be a planet orbiting the star and obscuring its light .","Astronomers used an improved version of a 250-year old equation .
It helped predict a total of 228 planets in the 151 planetary systems .
They believe there are one to three planets in the habitable zone of each .
Extending equation to the entire Milky Way means there are more habitable worlds in existence than previously believed ."
"With their silver hair and kind smiles, Christine Smith, Sheila Henderson and June Senior look like three normal grandmothers, enjoying a quiet drink and a chat. But their innocent looks bely a wilder reality and when the trio, who are aged between 61 and 64, travel abroad on one of their regular grannies’ trips, all thoughts of a quiet life are left behind. Instead of enjoying quiet days out with their grandchildren, fancy dress, colourful cocktails and Spanish party spots are the order of the day for the three Barnsley pensioners. Scroll down for video . Party grans: Sheila Henderson (left), Christine Smith (centre) and June Senior (right) all love to party . Dressing up: Fancy dress is a favourite with all three grannies who often dress as pop stars . Indeed, June, a former barmaid, has been dubbed 'the tearaway' by her friends thanks to her penchant for zipping between bars, cleavage proudly on show, on her mobility scooter. Now the trio are to appear on a new documentary called OAPs Behaving Badly, a Channel 5 series that follows the nation’s craziest pensioners. The trio's party plans swung into action as soon as they retired, with Christine and Sheila joining June in Tenerife for a huge party to mark her retirement. The riotous trip to the Spanish holiday island included nights out wearing comedy wigs and boobs, plastic penis noses, and flirtations with much younger male holidaymakers. Innocent: June, seen here in an everyday ensemble, likes to zip between bars on her mobility scooter . Getting ready: Although the trio like to go out in Barnsley, they save their biggest parties for holidays . Unusual look: Christine (far right) says she wore a prostitute's outfit for her son's 40th birthday party . 'On holiday no man is ever safe because I can guarantee I always feel somebody’s bottom or something else,' explained Christine, a grandmother of three. ;My behaviour is a bit erotic sometimes. If I’ve had a drink especially.' But husband Tony, 67, doesn’t mind being left behind or his wife’s flirty behaviour and indulges in several solo weeks in Spain himself. According to Christine, ‘What happens in Tenerife, stay in Tenerife’, with all three ladies happy to make the most of their time abroad. 'When I went to Tenerife for my son’s 40th I got dressed up as a hooker,' reveals Christine, admitting she got into trouble with a local woman, who thought she was a rival escort invading her patch. Leading the charge: Christine is the ringleader and says 'no man is safe' when she is out and about . Propping up the bar: The trio have long been fans of wild all-night parties . Apologies: June says the trio often have to apologise when they return to bars following a booze-fuelled night . Just as excitable is June who rides a mobility scooter as a result of having had 10 leg operations. Not that she has any plans to slow down. 'When she gets on that scooter, you’ve got to watch out because you’re never safe,' says Christine. 'She can be a tearaway when she gets speeding on that scooter.' But despite her tearaway nickname, June says Christine is the wildest of the group. 'Once we’ve been somewhere, we’re never forgotten. 'We go back for the second time and we have to apologise for what Christine’s done the first time.'","Christine Smith, 64, is one of a new breed of partying grandmothers .

'Now this is what we get in return, shame and embarrassment.' He continued: 'If only you didn't reject God and His teachings in your life you could have been strong enough to stay from evil and scums that surrounds you. Stay away.' In further messages, perhaps in response to Tyler's Tumblr post, his father went on: 'Take out your post from social media. 'You embarrass me from all the people I knew. 'I'm going to puke. Whatever you do it reflects on me. People will ridicule me, insult me, and I might turn out to be a criminal. I have enough of all this bulls***.'

"This is the moment a four-year-old girl is caught red-faced - literally - after delving into her mother's make-up bag. But instead of lipstick, little Emma Meaux from Abbeville, Louisiana, tries to claim the red stain all over her lips is ChapStick. Video shows her then pulling a range of comical facial expressions as her mother, Mandy, continues to interrogate her. 'That's not ChapStick. That's mommy's lipstick. Where did you get it?' Mandy says. Uh-oh: This is the moment a four-year-old girl is caught red-faced - literally - after delving into her mother's make-up bag . Innocent until proven guilty: But instead of lipstick, little Emma Meaux from Abbeville, Louisiana, claims the red stain all over her lips is actually ChapStick . Knowing that she's been busted, Emma admits that she did delve into 'mommy's make up'. 'And did mommy tell you not to play in the make-up?' her elder replies. Emma responds with a nod 'yes'. She then proceeds to rub her lips together in embarrassment and asks her mother to remove the stain. She says that she doesn't like the deep plum color. It's not the first time Emma has been caught getting up to mischief. Last summer, she was filmed as she denied eating a chocolate donut and blamed the missing treat on her twin brother Ben. However, the chocolate frosting all over her lips served as proof her guilt. Doting parents: Mandy and her husband Brody struggled for years to conceive Emma and her twin brother Ben, the siblings were born eight weeks premature and spent a month in the Neonatal intensive care unit . The youngster's mother Mandy previously spoke to DailyMail.com about the twins, and unexpectedly revealed that Ben is usually the trouble-maker. 'Ben is definitely the more mischievous of the two, which is why the video was funny to my friends and family,' she explains. 'It was completely out of character for Emma.' Mandy and her husband Brody struggled for seven years to conceive the twins, who were born eight weeks premature and spent a month in the Neonatal intensive care unit. 'That experience is the reason we try to enjoy all the moments, the good and the bad,' Mandy says.

'But we also waited a very long time to become parents and because of that we try to enjoy the moments that are funny as well,' she explains.

"While scientists have theories about how fish first crawled onto land and breathed air, it's a mystery as to how vertebrates evolved tongues instead of feeding using suction. But now, a slow-motion video of mudskippers eating shrimp may help reveal the evolutionary secret. It shows the creatures, which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground, taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue, allowing them to swallow food on land. Scroll down for video . A slow-motion video of mudskippers feeding may help reveal an evolutionary secret. It shows the creatures, which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground (pictured in a stock image) taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue, allowing them to swallow food on land . Experts believe the finding may shed light on how terrestrial tetrapods - four-legged vertebrates - with tongues evolved from fish between 400 and 250 million years ago. When underwater, mudskippers suck water containing food particles into their mouths, which are swallowed when they reach the back of their throats, New Scientist reported. However, this method doesn’t work on land, so terrestrial vertebrates evolved tongues to move the food to the back of the throat. A team of researchers led by Krijn Michel at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, captured slow-motion X-ray footage (shown) of Atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water . The video revealed that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish (stock image left) with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians such as nexts (right), meaning they could reveal a missing evolutionary link . Mudskippers are members of the gobies family, which is one of the largest fish families comprising more than 2,000 species. They are completely amphibious that can use their pectoral fins to walk on land. They appear to move in a series of 'skips' and can use their muscular bodied to catapult themselves two feet (60cm) in the air. Mudskippers are uniquely adapted to intertidal habitats, meaning that they don't have to hide in rock pools or retreat when the tide goes out. They feed out of water and even fight to defend their territories. The creatures breathe through their skin and the lining of their mouth and throat, but this only works when mudskippers are wet, limiting them to humid and watery habitats. Enlarged gill chambers enable them to retain a bubble of air and they close tightly when the animal is out of water to keep gills moist. A team of researchers led by Krijn Michel at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, captured slow-motion X-ray footage of Atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water. They found that it takes the gelatinous creatures less than half a second to pounce and eat. By watching the video, which was slowed down 50 times, the experts were able to see that the mudskippers carry water in their mouths. They spit it forward to grab the shrimp and then suck it back into their mouths quickly,to mimic the action of a tongue. The team also placed food on an absorbent surface and found that the mudskippers could still grab the food using their unusual technique, but had problems swallowing it. The scientists worked out that mudskippers move the hyoid bone in the floor of their mouth upwards, before they attempt to gulp down food. Their finding is reported in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences and is the opposite of what fish do underwater. However, it closely resembles the feeding habits of newts, which have tongues. This means that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians, so they could reveal a missing evolutionary link. Dr Michel said: ‘This could be an in-between, from which a fleshy tongue could have evolved. ‘This has never been considered a possibility, until now.","Slow motion video captured by University of Antwerp researchers shows mudskippers eat on land with the help of a glob of water .

"Aptamil is investigating a complaint that some of its baby milk is linked to 11-week-old Roman, pictured with his mother Laura Stevens, getting food poisoning . Aptamil is investigating a complaint that some of its baby milk might be linked to an 11-week-old boy getting food poisoning. Laura Stevens found 50p-sized blood spots in her son Roman's nappy and took him to the doctors. He was sent to hospital where he remained for a week with constant diarrhoea and a temperature. Doctors said he had a campylobacter infection but could not give a source. Miss Stevens, a first-time mum, said the only food she had given her son was Aptamil milk powder - but the company's initial quality checks have come back clear. The 30-year-old, from Swindon, Wiltshire, said: 'Roman's tests came back and showed he had food poisoning. 'I was gobsmacked, his insides had swollen from the food poisoning and the blood was the bacteria trying to get out of his little body.' The insurance worker said Roman was left lethargic and pale while he was in hospital. The strain of bacteria is commonly found in meat and poultry. While Aptamil is investigating she has stopped giving Roman the product and switched to a different milk product. Miss Stevens, who lives with Roman's dad Luke Embling, also 30, added: 'As a first-time mum, I started panicking when I saw the fresh blood, it didn't stop for nearly a week and the diarrhoea was constant. 'I was terrified he was bleeding internally or I'd done something wrong in pregnancy. I didn't know what to do.' Aptamil confirmed it is investigating and said it had not had any other complaints. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of this complaint and are concerned to hear that Roman had been unwell. Miss Stevens, who lives with Roman's dad Luke Embling (left), said the only food she had given her son was Aptamil milk powder - but the company's initial quality checks have come back clear .

'We have checked our production records and know that all of the quality checks were carried out. We have not received any other similar complaints. 'We are happy to help with any independent investigation but have not yet been contacted.' Public Health England said it had not been asked to investigate but were aware of a confirmed case of campylobacter in a young child in the Swindon area. A spokesman said: 'Most infections are sporadic and it is difficult to trace it back to the exact source. 'Microbiological testing would have to be carried out to confirm it was the same strain that linked the patient and the implicated food. 'Without this, there is no way of confirming an association to a particular product.'","Laura Stevens, 30, found blood spots in her son Roman's nappy .

His last tweet, on Wednesday March 18, read: 'Good morning everybody! Lovely day! Love you all x.' Today, Chris's Loserville director, Elliot Davis, told WhatsOnStage that his early fame could have triggered the illness. 'He was a super talented guy, so naturally gifted. He just had something that the nation saw and it catapulted him to early fame, which perhaps caused problems,' he said. Allan Dodgeon, who managed Chris for a year from 2013, added that he was in 'complete shock'. He said: 'He was an outstanding talent and it was a pleasure to work with him.

"What's for dinner? How about leftover cartilage of skate with herring-head tartar sauce, cured tuna blood line aioli or a meat loaf of offal and slightly past-its-prime cow usually reserved for dogs? Those and two dozen other dishes using scraps and usually ignored bits comprise the menu at chef Dan Barber's WastEDny, a pop-up project at one of his Blue Hill restaurants in New York intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste. The farm-to-table guru, a multiple James Beard Award winner and author of The Third Plate: Field Notes on the Future of Food didn't have a hard sell on his hands when he invited 20 of his heavy hitter chef friends to join him in turning out $15 a la carte plates made from day-old bread, bruised beets, brine from the olive bin and the peels of pineapples. Among the chefs backing the concept are Mario Batali, Dominique Ansel and Alain Ducasse, with each taking it in turn to take the lead. Grub's up: In this Thursday, March 19, 2015 photo, a waiter serves a couple at WastED in New York - the menu includes dishes using scraps and other ignored bits . Diners haven't been put off by the idea of 'dumpster dining' and there is currently a waitlist for WastEDny. The final sitting will take place on March 31 and there is no word if a repeat session will occur. Even Barber's tabletops and cocktails tell the story. The restaurateur had his Manhattan tables redone with tops from agricultural byproducts and mushroom mycelium for his two-and-a-half week pop-up. His boilermaker libation included flat beer syrup and spent coffee grounds with the bourbon. Using such waste, of course, has been part of rustic cuisines around the world for centuries. And chefs like Barber, who has a second restaurant on a farm north of the city, are far more efficient than they're given credit for. But in the U.S., the land of abundant fast food, grocery aisles piled with perfect produce and home refrigerators stuffed with food never eaten, the distribution system has been deemed broken by activists in a waste movement more firmly taking root. 'Really, the larger issue is how do we create a culture of eating that utilizes the entirety of the food system. 'To do that we need chefs and restaurants to start the conversation,' Barber said during a recent busy night of service at WastEDny, capitalized to emphasis his hope of educating the unenlightened. Fine-dining restaurants are just a fraction in the food waste equation, however. About 40per cent of food grown for human consumption in the U.S. is tossed, cramming landfills, and about a third of such food globally never makes it into human mouths. Dinner is server: Fried skate wing cartilage with smoked whitefish head tartar sauce . Novel idea: Chef (above) Dan Barber's WastEDny, a pop-up project at one of his Blue Hill restaurants in New York, is intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste . With nearly one billion people starving or food insecure around the world, much of the waste is generated by U.S. households and farms themselves, said Jonathan Bloom, an activist in Durham, North Carolina, and author of American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Nearly Half of Its Food (and What We Can Do About It). 'It's a system that is not serving anyone particularly well,' Bloom said, noting that waste is scattered throughout the distribution chain. 'We have an obesity crisis on a global scale in addition to a hunger crisis, the scale of which we've never seen before, and at the same time we're overproducing, taxing our planet to an unnecessary and dangerous amount.' Barber sees his pop-up as an extension of his 'third plate' philosophy that challenges Americans to radically rethink what is acceptable and unacceptable to eat while becoming better stewards of the land. 'In America we come with this blessed landscape, this Garden of Eden ... with incredible soils, temperate climate, predictable rainfall, and we produce a ton of food. 'And because of that we were never forced into the kind of negotiations that suck up waste,' he said. That goes a long way in explaining the 'wasted special' served up by one of Barber's guest chefs, Bill Telepan of the Upper West Side restaurant Telepan. He fashioned his plate of tuna on a bed of salvaged radish greens, incorporating them into a pesto, slicing the radish into the dish and using the usually tossed blood line of the fish in an aioli. Chefs are trained to carve out the blood line and tuna overall is a good example of customer preference driving waste, he said. 'People look for that certain ruby red part of the tuna. They're not interested in paying top dollar for a piece on the side that may not look as beautiful but still is just as tasty,' said Telepan, hoping to sneak his WastED dish onto the menu of his own restaurant. 'I just won't call it blood line.' A rainbow of color: Ingredients used in the dishes at WastED are laid out in the kitchen . Team work: Dan Barber, center and Bill Telepan prepare one of the dishes served at WastED . Grant Baldwin wouldn't mind. He and his wife live in Vancouver, British Columbia, and filmed themselves living on discarded and culled food for six months for their documentary Just Eat It. They did their share of dumpster diving - heading to unlocked bins of wholesalers for the best finds - and they came up with some treasures: cartons of eggs with plenty of time left on expiration, boxes of pricey chocolate bars tossed because they did not have the requisite English-French labeling required in Canada, and a mountain of packaged hummus still in containers but perfectly edible. 'The whole reason that we did the project was to prove the food was good,' Baldwin said. 'Everybody talks about how 40per cent of food is wasted, but to see it in the bins is another thing. 'Eating from dumpsters is not a good lifestyle for anyone. It's a terrible lifestyle. The point is the food shouldn't be in the bins to begin with.' Advocates like Baldwin, Barber and Bloom applaud the higher visibility in recent years of sustainable farming techniques, as well as locavores who prefer eating food grown close to home. Enough for all: Chef Bill Telepan serves a taste of cured tuna blood line aioli to the waitstaff . But Baldwin thinks rigid standards for date labels on packaged foods serve to muddle the edibility issue, wrongly convincing people that perfectly good food is no longer safe to eat. And appearance remains a huge stumbling block in the processing and packaging of food, with retailers demanding exacting uniform standards that have growers and middlemen tossing 20 to 70per cent of shipments in some cases. Michael Muzyk knows that first-hand. He's the president of Baldor Specialty Foods, a distributor and processor of produce in the South Bronx serving high-end hotels and restaurants like those of Barber and Telepan. He signed on to supply WastEDny, providing the peels of pineapples, for instance, for a dessert served with candied mango skin and an ice cream flavored with lime leaves. Baldor - as a middleman - has made strides in re-purposing his own food waste, using natural enzymes to dehydrate byproduct before it hits landfills. The company is also a major contributor to City Harvest, which feeds the hungry in New York City using rescued food. 'Will there be 100 chefs tomorrow saying I want to follow Dan Barber's lead? I hope so,' he said. 'I hope so.'","Dan Barber's WastEDny, a pop-up project at one of his Blue Hill restaurants in New York is intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste .

"Jailed: Connor King, 18, went on a violent rampage after drunkenly staggering out of a family wedding . A teenager who grinned for his mugshot after staggering drunk out of a family wedding to carry out a 'terrifying' crime spree involving burglary and sexual assault has been jailed for five and a half years. Connor King, 18, went on a rampage after the reception, breaking into a flat in Folkestone, Kent, where two women and a baby were sleeping. He woke the women and demanded alcohol but when they refused he threatened to kill them and they had to lock themselves in a bedroom. King then went into a second bedroom and attacked a man while he was sleeping, punching him in the head up to 30 times before sexually assaulting him. Canterbury Crown Court heard he then demanded money, picked up a screwdriver and threatened to stab him. When his victim refused he hurled a TV at him. He then assaulted another neighbour who had heard the women's screams and stole a gold sovereign ring, a wallet, a mobile phone and USB cable. King then went next door where he woke a couple and their young child as he climbed out a window to escape, telling them: 'I am going to a party'. Police arrived to find the teenager standing on a window ledge 25ft from the ground before he climbed down and shouted: 'I'm a terrorist'. King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years. Judge Heather Norton told him: 'You embarked on a course of conduct that night which must have been terrifying for everybody involved.' Not smiling anymore: King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault at Canterbury Crown Court and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years . Phil Rowley, defending, said King was drunk and had no recollection of the night. He said King had been used to help carry out burglaries since he was five. Detective Constable Neil Moore said: 'It was clear he was heavily intoxicated and decided, in what was a truly bizarre set of circumstances, to hunt out more alcohol. 'It must have been truly terrifying for those involved and the sentence imposed reflects the severity of the crime.'","Connor King, 18, broke into flat in Kent after family wedding reception .

"When the first astronauts land on Mars, they will not use a conventional parachute or heat shield that has been used before. Instead, upon impacting the upper Martian atmosphere, a large inflatable saucer-shaped structure will slow their progress. This is the low density supersonic decelerator (LDSD) and, in June, Nasa will perform the latest test of this groundbreaking technology - a vital next step in the journey to Mars. Scroll down for a video from last year's test . In June, the vehicle will be sent into near-space from the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii, to test its re-entry capabilities into Earth's atmosphere . Tomorrow at 9am to 10am PDT (5pm to 6pm GMT), Nasa will perform a spin test of the vehicle at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California before transporting it to Hawaii. The event will be streamed live on Ustream, and viewers will be able to ask questions on Twitter using the #AskNasa hashtag. Ultimately, the vehicle will be sent into near-space from the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii, in June. The LDSD is unique in its design, using a donut-shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag. When attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at Mach 3.5 it will be capable of slowing it down to Mach 2, where a regular parachute can then deploy. Last June, to simulate the Martian atmosphere on Earth, the LDSD was lifted to a height of 23 miles (37km) by a high-altitude balloon. A small rocket then launched it 11 miles (18km) higher. As this point the LDSD inflated around a larger saucer-shaped object, bringing it safely back to land in open water. ‘The LDSD crosscutting demonstration mission will test breakthrough technologies that will enable large payloads to be safely landed on the surface of Mars, or other planetary bodies with atmospheres, including Earth,’ Nasa said in a statement. ‘The technologies will not only enable landing of larger payloads on Mars, but also allow access to much more of the planet's surface by enabling landings at higher-altitude sites.’ Esessentially parachute, the LDSD is large - 15ft (4.6 metres) wide and weighing 7,000lbs (3.200kg) - in order to cope with the atmosphere of Mars. Earth has a reasonably thick atmosphere, so we can parachute relatively easily to the surface. But the Martian atmosphere is much thinner, so parachutes need to be much larger in order to create sufficient drag to land safely. The system is designed to land large vehicles on the surface of Mars. The main structural body of the second flight test vehicle in Nasa's LDSD project is seen during its assembly in a cleanroom at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The flight test for this vehicle is planned in June of this year. It will eventually be used to take humans to the surface of Mars . A successful test took place in June 2014, shown, when the LDSD successfully re-entered part of Earth's atmosphere. It showed that while some aspects of the vehicle worked, others - like its parachutes - needed further development following the test . The Curiosity rover, for example, needed an innovative landing method due to its size but this technology wasn’t ready yet. Instead, to land the rover on the surface Nasa developed a landing mechanism that used rockets known as the ‘sky crane’. The LDSD, however, is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than Curiosity, such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves. There will be four tests of the LDSD in total before mission managers decide whether to employ it on future Mars missions. The tests are taking place over the Hawaiian island of Kauai in June. In a test last year, in June 2014, the vehicle was partially successful - although a parachute was torn apart when it deployed, owing to the high forces. Moment of truth: The parachute is shown here unfurling on the right. The balloon on the left was used to pull the 200lb (90kg) parachute from its sturdy canister . The LDSD, shown, is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than Curiosity, such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves . Carried as payload during the shakeout flight were two technologies scheduled to be tested next year aboard this same type of test vehicle. The Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD) is a large, doughnut-shaped air brake that deployed during the flight, helping slow the vehicle from 3.8 to two times the speed of sound. The second, the Supersonic Disksail Parachute, is the largest supersonic parachute ever flown. It has more than double the area of the parachute which was used for the Mars Science Laboratory mission that carried the Curiosity rover to the surface of Mars. 'A good test is one where there are no surprises but a great test is one where you are able to learn new things, and that is certainly what we have in this case,' said Ian Clark, principal investigator for LDSD at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, after the test. And Nasa will be hoping to learn just as much on their latest attempt at using the LDSD.","Nasa will fly its new heat shield from Hawaii in a couple of months .

"Greece is threatening to seize property, land and businesses belonging to Germany if Berlin does not agree to compensate it for the Nazi occupation of the Second World War. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has demanded Germany pay more than £112billion in reparations. He said previous payments did not cover demands for destroyed infrastructure, compensation for war crimes and the return of a forced loan to the Nazis. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who says that Germany owes his country compensation worth hundreds of billions of euros due to the Nazi occupation during the Second World War . In an emotive address to his parliament he spoke of his government pursuing its ‘duty to history’ and the people who ‘fought and gave their lives to defeat Nazism’. Germany angrily dismissed the demands yesterday, saying it had paid reparations to Greece. A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel said the issue had been ‘legally and politically resolved’ at that time and during the talks which led to German reunification in 1990. But Greek politicians upped the ante with justice minister Nikos Paraskevoloulos saying he was ready to back a High Court ruling from 2000 allowing Athens to seize German-owned property to compensate the victims of a Nazi massacre of 218 Greek civilians in the village of Distomo. The ruling about German assets can only be backed by a justice minister and his predecessors have always baulked at doing so. It relates to a specific atrocity in the village in which Nazi forces went on a two-hour rampage butchering men, women and children in what they said was retaliation for an attack on them by resistance forces. Meanwhile in Germany there were claims of a wider ranging plan to take German assets. Spiegel magazine yesterday reported that it had learned of a plan to seize German property and assets if the reparations demand was dismissed. However, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured, has said there is no reason to hold talks with Greece on the issue . It claimed this would involve the seizure of the Goethe Institute, Germany’s flagship cultural organisation abroad, as well as businesses and assets of German firms. Resentment about the four-year Nazi occupation of Greece in which some 250,000 people were killed, is long-standing. But it has been revived by the painful austerity measures imposed by the Eurozone since 2010 under the terms of the £175billion international rescue package. Greek media have depicted Mrs Merkel and her finance ministers in Nazi uniforms. And the first act of new prime minister Mr Tsipras was to lay a wreath at the site where 200 Greek communists were shot by the Nazis. Mr Tsipras told parliament – during a debate on Tuesday about the creation of a reparations committee – that he would not abandon Greece’s ‘irrevocable demands’ for compensation, and that his government would ‘work so that all of the unfulfilled obligations to Greece and the Greek people are met’. Syriza, the most Left-wing government ever to be elected in Europe, ran for office on a platform of rejecting the austerity measures and spending their way out of crisis. But it has since had to back down on a number of its pledges after being forced to agree further reforms in return for extending the bailout until June. The German finance ministry said there would be no negotiation over the war-time debts. The demand comes amid a standoff between Athens and the EU over renegotiating Greek debt because of the euro crisis .","Greece has threatened Germany saying it will seize its property and land .

"A top health insurance expert with the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday that she doesn't know what portion of Americans who have left the ranks of the uninsured did it by buying policies on Obamacare exchanges. In a conference call for reporters, Office of Health Reform director Dr. Meena Seshamani boasted about new Gallup survey data that indicates 'the uninsured rate dropped from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent' between the beginning of Obamacare's open enrollment and March 4, 2015 . That's less than a 35 per cent dent in the uninsured ranks. President Barack Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on the promise of a medical insurance law 'that will cover every American.' And the 'reduction in the uninsured,' Seshamani said, 'could be through any of a number of avenues.' UNDERPERFORMING? HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell presides over an Obamacare system that has managed so far to change the status of barely one-third of America's uninsured . TAX BITE FOR MANY: Portions of about 4.5 million Obamacare insurance subsidies will have to be paid back this year . She listed a few, beginning with new coverage from empoyers – including among people who changed jobs – along with Medicaid and 'the individual market outside the [Obamacare] marketplace.' The question of how many American consumers have gained medical insurance through Obamacare marketplaces themselves has become a sticking point in the ongoing political battle over the controversial law. HHS reported Monday that '14.1 million adults gained health insurance coverage since the beginning of open enrollment in October, 2013.' Another 2.3 million 'young adults' under age 26 gained coverage through their parents' policies, an option that wasn't available to them previously. HHS Office of Health Reform director Dr. Meena Seshamani touted new Obamacare numbers but wouldn't say how many people have become insured specifically because of the law's marketplaces . But CBO estimates in January held that Medicaid, a taxpayer-funded benefit for the poor, enrolled more than 7 million new customers in the same period – nearly 43 per cent of the total HHS listed in Monday's report. The congressional bean-counting agency's latest estimates hold that the Affordable Care Act will cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years to administer and fund with subsidies. That's about $3,770 for every American man, woman and child. Monday's numbers came from HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, which analyzed data collected through March 14 from a Gallup-Healthways 'Well-Being Index' survey. Dr. Richard Frank, the Office of Health Reform's assistant director for planning and evaluation, told reporters Monday that HHS has no idea how low it will be able to drive the uninsured rate, notwithstanding the president's campaign pledges. 'It's important to recognize that we're in entirely new territory here. ... We're treading new areas and we're just starting to understand more completely who we've brought in and who is left uncovered,' Frank said. Obamacare customers who receive government subsidies got some unrelated bad news last month with the revelation that more than half of them will have to give some of that money back when they file their tax returns. Research published by the tax preparation firm H&R Block found that typical subsidized Obamacare users owe $530 each because their subsidiies were calculated based on their 2012 income – and they earned more in 2014. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Feb. 9 that nearly 6.5 million people who live in the 37 states covered by its HealthCare.gov website would qualify for abn Obamacare tax credit this year since htey can't afford to pay the full price for medical insurance. That means nationwide more than 4.5 million will see part of their April 15 refunds shaved away, according to a Daily Mail Online analysis.","Uninsured rate has dropped from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent since October 2013 when Obamacare open-enrollment started .

"For the first time women are to get an advanced blood test to detect Down’s syndrome and other abnormalities in unborn babies on the NHS. The non-invasive IONA test examines DNA in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders. It will be offered at in London through the NHS and privately. The non-invasive IONA test examines DNA in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders . Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad for processing. It is one of several non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) examinations that promise greater accuracy for women at high risk of having a Down’s baby. Eventually such NIPT tests will be routinely used to reassure all pregnant women. Current screening for Down’s on the NHS consists of the less-accurate ‘combined’ test, which uses ultrasound to measure the amount of fluid at the back of the baby’s neck at 11 weeks, as well as a blood test. Professor Basky Thilaganathan, consultant obstetrician at St George’s, said the new test was the first to be regulated under the EU’s health and safety standards. He said: ‘Too many pregnant women have been through the anxiety and discomfort of invasive procedures after receiving false positive results [women wrongly identified as being at risk] from the combined test – the IONA test gives us the accuracy and reliability to reduce this number significantly.’ Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad . A study by the UK National Screening Committee to check whether NIPT should be offered routinely on the NHS is underway, involving five hospitals, and is due to report later this year. Trials of another NIPT test offering expectant mothers 99 per cent accuracy in screening for Down’s syndrome are being run by Great Ormond Street Hospital. NIPT has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the combined test. This means fewer women will undergo unnecessary invasive follow-up procedures which are stressful and carry a small risk of miscarriage. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha – the makers of the IONA test, said: ‘We recognised the limitations in the current standard of prenatal screening and the huge unmet medical need for a regulated test.’","Non-invasive IONA test examines foetus DNA in cells in mother's blood .

"A young German woman has been killed fighting alongside Kurdish forces against the Islamic State in northeast Syria, a monitoring group has reported. Ivana Hoffmann, 19, died on Saturday while fighting with the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) near the Syrian town of Tel Tamr, YPG spokesman Nawaf Khalil said. Hoffmann, a member of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP) in Turkey, joined YPG fighters about six months ago, according to a statement released by the MLKP. Hoffmann, born in Germany to South African parents, is the third Westerner - and the first female foreign fighter - known to be killed fighting with Kurdish forces against the Islamic State group. Her death comes after former British soldier Konstandinos Erik Scurfield and Australian Ashley Johnston died in clashes elsewhere in Hasakeh in the last two weeks. Scroll down for video . 'Fought to the last bullet': German fighter Ivana Hoffmann, a member of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP) in Turkey has been killed fighting alongside Kurdish forces against the Islamic State . At least 40 Kurdish fighters and ISIS jihadists have been killed in the battle for Tal Tamr, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said earlier on Sunday. The MLKP party statement referred to Hoffmann by her nom de guerre, Avashin Tekoshin, and said she died in pre-dawn clashes with Islamic State militants on March 7. 'Our comrade Avashin had been at the front using her weapons to resist the bloody onslaught of the ISIS gang against the Assyrian villages in Tel Tamr for days,' the statement said. 'During these clashes, dozens of gang members were killed. Our comrade Avashin fought to the last bullet together with the fighters of the YPG.' Relatives mourn at a mass funeral  for 30 YPG fighters killed in clashes with ISIS which led to the liberation of Tal Hamis and Tal Barak, located close to the city of Qamishli in Syria . The Kurdish fighters died along with a former British soldier in battles with ISIS in an area southwest of the town of Tal Hamis, which Kurdish fighters seized from ISIS last week . Relatives and well-wishers mourn at a mass funeral held for thirty YPG fighters  in Tal Hamis, Syria . The party statement did not mention how many other MLKP loyalists have travelled to Syria to fight the Islamic State group. German authorities say some 650 people have travelled from Germany to Syria and Iraq, to join Islamist groups. But they haven't said how many are estimated to have joined Kurdish or Christian groups opposing ISIS. The head of Germany's military intelligence agency, Christof Gramm, told daily Die Welt in an interview published Monday that about 20 former German soldiers had traveled to the conflict zone. A young German woman has been killed fighting alongside female Kurdish Pershmerga forces against the Islamic State in northeast Syria, according to a monitoring group (file picture) Volatile: Reports of the German's death come after former British soldier Konstandinos Erik Scurfield and Australian Ashley Johnston also died in clashes elsewhere in Hasakeh province in the last two weeks . A video posted early Monday morning on a Facebook page paying tribute Hoffmann shows a woman with her face covered by a scarf holding a weapon and speaking German. She refers to Daesh, the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group, and to Rojava, a Kurdish word that denotes the now largely autonomous areas in north and north-eastern Syria run by Kurds. 'Behind us is the territory of Daesh. We've been here for a week. For one week we've been holding our base to defend the Rojava revolution. 'I decided to come to Rojava because they are fighting for humanity here, for rights and for internationalism that the MLKP represents. 'We are here as the MLKP to fight for freedom. Rojava is the beginning. Rojava is hope,' she said. A German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Sawsan Chebli, said she was unaware of reports about Hoffmann's death. News of the German woman's death, which was not immediately confirmed by Berlin, came on International Women's Day. Former Royal Marine Konstandinos Erik Scurfield (above) become the first Briton to die fighting ISIS when he was killed in Syria earlier this month . Women account for around 35 per cent of the fighting force of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), numbering around 7,000, and receive the same training as their male comrades. Mr Scurfield, a former Royal Marine, was the first Briton to be killed fighting ISIS after he was hit by mortar fire near the Syrian city of Qamishli. Last week, it was reported that his Facebook messages revealed his frustration at the lack of discipline displayed by the Kurdish fighters. His posts and messages give a glimpse of day-to-day life for those fighting ISIS, advises interested friends on how to join up and reveals the Kurdish fighters lack of discipline, but huge determination. He also spoke of his fear that the Kurds would tell his mother he had gone to Syria. The messages, published by The Sun, said he began looking for a way to get out to Syria to join up with the YPG at least a month before he arrived in Syria. He was recruited by the Lions of Rojava and by November 3 had clear plans in place for reaching their base in Syria. On December 6, using a Facebook account set up under a fake name so his friends could keep in touch, he messaged to say he has arrived safely in Syria, and met up with two other foreign fighters. But his parents still apparently had no idea where he was - with Mr Scurfield, of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, revealing on December 15: 'I've heard about the authorities threatening to tell my parents! 'It is thought the 25-year-old told his friends he was going to do humanitarian work in the war-torn country last year after being 'horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS'. It is unclear what Mr Scurfield told his parents, archaeologists Chris and Vicci. Eventually, it seems the Royal Marines did take matters into their own hands, informing his parents sometime between Christmas and January 5. In his final Facebook post, Mr Scurfield, who was an expert in battlefield medicine, revealed: 'The Corps told my mum and I think she's taken it pretty well, I might even think she is a little bit proud.' The messages and posts also give an idea of what foreign fighters heading for Syria to fight with the YPG can expect. Mr Scurfield (pictured kneeling, centre) revealed foreign fighters frustration with the Kurds lack of discipline, but also recorded how impressed he was with their attitude . Mr Scurfield revealed 'quite a lot of Westerners' pack up and leave after a short time, disappointed by the Kruds' 'skills and drills'. But Mr Scurfield was impressed by the attitude of the Kurdish fighters - who are the only troops on the ground fighting . 'The Kurds don't do stuff like us but they never drip about going on patrol,' he wrote. Mr Scurfield's messages also reveal he was waiting for fighting to intensify once more, which would happen in February and March, after the winter came to an end. But then there is silence from the former soldier, and nothing more is thought to have been heard by friends, who were told this week he died on Monday was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. Friends, both in the UK and Syria, have paid tribute to him since. Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now fighting in Syria, wrote: 'Words cannot describe how honored I have been to fight at your side Sehid Kemal (Konstandinos Erik Scurfield). 'We were together from his first day here and you couldn't ask for a more disciplined warrior.'","Ivana Hoffmann, 19, died in battle for Kurdish-held Syrian town of Tel Tamr .

"A woman who was driven to lose weight after her ex-boyfriend began dating a slimmer colleague has lost 10 stone - and won back her ex. Stephanie Nicks, 28, from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, used to weigh a hefty 20st 9lb, gorging on sausage and bacon sandwiches for breakfast, and family sized Doritos as a late-night snack. But she was left horrified when she split up with her boyfriend, care worker Larry Nicks, 30, and he began dating a slimmer woman. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Nicks, 28, went from 20st 9lb to 11st 1lb and had shed around 10 stone in total . 28-year-old Stephanie Nicks went on to lose an astonishing 10 stone and went down nine dress sizes . Determined to win him back, the size 28 account manager vowed to ditch the flab and has since shed an astonishing 10st. Stephanie is now a slinky size 10, and the couple, having reunited, are happily married. Stephanie said: 'My diet was terrible. I'd scoff on kebabs and McDonald's takeaways, followed by crisps and chocolate. 'Over the years, my weight ballooned. I couldn't find any clothes to fit me and I was really self-conscious. 'Larry had always told me that he loved me no matter how big I was, but then we split and he started dating someone much smaller. That's when I realised just how much I had let myself go. 'I knew I couldn't keep eating myself into an early grave.' Stephanie had struggled with her weight since the age of 11, when she started comfort-eating after her best friend moved to a different school. She began dating Larry at the age of 16, and the two became engaged in 2007 after he proposed on a romantic trip to Kenya for her 21st birthday. Stephanie described Larry dating a slimmer woman after their break-up as 'an extra kick in the teeth'. After joining Weight Watchers, she hit her target  a month before the wedding and walked down the aisle at 11st . Stephanie was overjoyed at the weight loss but embarrassed by the loose skin on her stomach . After  years of hiding her body after losing weight, Stephanie can now wear the clothes she's always dreamed . But years of overeating saw her weight soar to 20st 9lb and Stephanie's confidence plummeted. After a series of arguments, the couple split in late 2008. Shortly afterwards, Larry began dating another woman. Stephanie said: 'It was bad enough that he'd started seeing someone else, but knowing she was skinnier than me was an extra kick in the teeth. 'I have to admit that I was a bit jealous, and it made me think more about the way I looked.' The couple reconciled soon after and Stephanie used her new sense of determination to join her local Weight Watchers group. She said: 'I wanted to keep Larry interested, but more importantly improve my health and confidence.' Throwing out all of the junk food from her cupboards, she filled her fridge with fresh fruit and vegetables. And instead of driving, she began to walk everywhere. Within weeks, she began to notice a difference and the couple excitedly set a date for their wedding. After Stephanie and Larry got engaged, she saw her weight soar to 20st 9lb and her confidence plummet . The 28-year-old, pictured before her weight loss, had struggled with her size since the age of 11 and lived on a diet of kebabs and McDonald's takeaways . More ambitious than ever, Stephanie also picked out her wedding dress. The only catch was that it was a size 10 - nine dresses smaller than her size at the time. Stephanie said: 'It was a challenge, but it was all the motivation I needed to have the wedding of my dreams. 'As the big day approached, I became more and more nervous about fitting into my dress. 'But I kept up the healthy eating and exercise - there was no way I was going to be a fat bride.' Stephanie hit her target weight a month before the wedding and walked down the aisle at 11st 1lb and a size 10 in September 2012. But under her dress, she was hiding an embarrassing secret: a huge sack of loose skin on her stomach. Unable to flaunt her slinky new figure in fitted dresses and skinny jeans, Stephanie instead resorted to tucking her belly into leggings and oversized hoodies. Stephanie said: 'It was hideous. I'd worked really hard for my body, but I had to hide it away by dressing like an old lady. Stephanie, pictured with her mum at her wedding, hit her target weight a month before she tied the knot . 'As well as being unsightly, my jelly belly caused itchy sores and even got in the way in the bedroom. 'In fact I hated it so much, I nicknamed it 'Flabby Abby'!' After two years of hiding her body, Stephanie spoke to her GP and he referred her to a surgeon, who granted Stephanie an operation to remove the skin on the NHS in October 2014. Stephanie said: 'The day of the operation was nerve-wracking, so to calm me down, Larry and I took bets on how much Flabby Abby would weigh. 'Both of us got a shock when doctors told us she'd weighed in at an impressive 11lb.' BREAKFAST: Sausage and bacon sandwich, two hash browns, lashings of ketchup . LUNCH: Cheese and coleslaw sandwich . DINNER: Kebab, followed by a McDonald's . SNACKS: Family-sized Doritos, chocolate . BREAKFAST: Weetabix, soya milk, banana . LUNCH: Chicken and feta salad with fat-free dressing . DINNER: Chicken wrap . SNACKS: Apples, grapes . Over the next few weeks, Stephanie's stomach continued to heal and she could finally wear the clothes she had always dreamed of. Now a confident size 10 at 10st 9lb, Stephanie says she has never felt better. She said: 'I am so much more confident now. Larry even jokes that he's got a new wife because I'm so much more outgoing. 'Looking back, I can't believe I ever let my weight get so out of control. I'll never go back to being that big again.'","Stephanie Nicks, from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, used to weight 20st 9lb .

"While having a baby is a joyous time for families, nine months of pregnancy followed by the sleepless nights, the challenges of breast feeding and hormonal changes have their own effect on new mums. As the Duchess of Cambridge prepares to have her second child next month, she’ll no doubt be prepared for any post-birth eventuality. But just in case, we’ve helped prepare a shopping list of must-have products that have been tried and tested by from other A-list mothers including Jessica Alba, Kim Kardashian, Kate Hudson and Gwyneth Paltrow. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of Cambridge is now preparing for the arrival of her second child, thought to be due on April 25 . KIM KARDASHIAN'S STRETCH MARK SOLUTION . They're the silvery streaks caused when skin is suddenly stretched either during a growth spurt or weight gain and are the bane of many pregnant women's lives. Kim Kardashian has long been a fan of Bio-Oil, £8.95, a mixture of calendula, lavender, rosemary oils and vitamins A and E, that claims to soften skin to prevent the marks and also reduce the appearance of stretch marks after pregnancy. She said: 'It [Bio-Oil] prevents wrinkles around my eyes and stretch marks over my body.' For best results the makers of Bio-Oil, recommend that it's applied twice daily for at least three months . Reality TV star Kim Kardashian West apparently loves Bio-Oil, £8.95, for preventing stretch marks on her body . For best results Bio-Oil, which includes vitamin A and E, should be applied twice daily for at least three months . KATE HUDSON'S HAIR SUPPLEMENT . Post-natal hair loss is an issue for many new mothers. This is because pregnancy hormones stop womens’ usual daily hair-shedding, giving the appearance of extra-thick hair. But once the hormones return to normal about three to six months after birth, the extra hair finally falls out. Although many mums fear they're going bald, in fact their hair is returning to normal in a process that can take up to a year. Kate Hudson noticed her hair was thinning after having both her children Ryder, aged 11, and Bingham, now three. She told Redbook magazine in 2012: ‘When I had [first son] Ryder, I was 24 and didn’t really experience any changes to my hair or skin. But with my second child, I got acne, all my hair fell out after he was born, and I definitely had to work out to drop the weight. No pregnancy is easy to bounce back from.’ But her stylist David Badaii credits the supplement Viviscal for restoring her tousled locks to their full thickness. Viviscal, £49.95 one month supply, contains an amino acid called AminoMar C, discovered by a Scandinavian dermatologist who was studying the Inuit population of Greenland and noticed their thick, healthy hair, which he linked to the protein now used in the capsules to boost hair growth. Like many new mothers, actress Kate Hudson experienced post-partum hair loss and thinning after having both of her children, Ryder, aged 11, and son of Muse frontman Matthew Bellamy, Bingham, now aged 3 . JESSICA ALBA'S MUM-TUM GIRDLE . While 'waist training' by wearing a structured corset for several hours a day to cinch in your waist has recently become a celebrity craze, Jessica Alba swore by a similar practice after giving birth to her two daughters Honor, seven, and Haven, four. It's thought that compression from the girdle helps the uterus to return to normal size. Also, during pregnancy the muscle that runs down the centre of the stomach separates and it's thought that the corsets can help push them back together again more quickly. The Fantastic Four star said: 'I wore a double corset day and night for three months. It was brutal; it’s not for everyone. It was sweaty, but worth it.' Jessica has said that after having both of her children, she started wearing her corset immediately, until the 'loosely-goosey' feeling had disappeared. Jessica Alba revealed that she wore a post-partum girdle for two to three months to get rid of her 'mum-tum' Post-natal corsets promise to hold stomachs in place and support backs after birth . GWYNETH PALTROW'S NATURAL BODY OIL . Gwyneth Paltrow might have landed herself in hot water for many of the extreme health recommendations featured on her website Goop, but her top pregnancy tip appears to be less controversial. Talking about how she fended off stretch marks while pregnant with her two children, Moses, eight, and Apple, 14, the actress says she slathered herself with sweet almond oil. She wrote on Goop: 'Use copious amounts of sweet almond oil on your belly, thighs, and breasts. 'Apply the oil in an infinity symbol or figure eight pattern around your breasts to help stimulate lymphatic drainage and relieve any chest ache or discomfort.' Gwyneth Paltrow suggests applying Sweet Almond Oil to your belly, thighs and breasts to help stretching skin . MOLLY SIMS' BREAST MILK BOOSTER . The American model has recently given birth to her first child Scarlet May Stuber and hasn't wasted any time in dishing out tips for other mothers. Writing on her website mollysims.com, the model consulted a lactation consultant to advise on the problem of low milk supply. She wrote: 'Most treatment plans for low milk supply call for increased caloric intake, plenty of fluids, and herbal supplements such as fenugreek or goat’s rue.' Available at most health food shops, the herbal supplements are both widely recognised as ancient remedies used by women to increase breast milk supply.

"Martin Harper has unexpectedly backed pheasant shooting, causing outrage among the group's supporters . As Britain’s leading bird charity, you might expect the RSPB to oppose pheasant shooting. But one of its bosses has unexpectedly backed the practice, causing outrage among supporters of the group. Some threatened to cancel their membership while others spoke of their ‘disappointment’. The row began when Martin Harper, conservation director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, wrote a blog saying the charity supported ‘progressive’ shoots  as they were good for the countryside. Mr Harper wrote: ‘Yes, we condemn wildlife crime including any persecution of protected birds of prey. ‘And yes, we continue to work with the police to end illegal killing which remains prevalent in the uplands, threatening the future of hen harrier, and still occurs on some lowland estates. ‘But, the contribution progressive shoots can make to supporting threatened wildlife is significant, and we are delighted to help them further.’ Defending his view on the topic, Mr Harper went on to write: ‘This isn’t a contradiction. We simply do whatever nature needs and will work with anyone that wants to help wildlife.’ He added that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows. Twitter users reacted angrily, with one writing: ‘After 30+ years, I think it’s time to cancel our membership!! #itsall-aboutmoney.’ Lee Clements wrote: ‘Very disappointed to learn that @Natures_Voice “has always been neutral on the ethics of shooting birds.”’ But the British Association for Shooting and Conservation praised the RSPB for putting ‘long-term conservation goals before short-term politicised campaigning’. In 2008, the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) estimated that 40 million gamebirds were bred to be shot each year in Britain. The figure includes pheasants and partridges and is now believed to be higher still. The RSPB estimates the total to be 50million. In a report on the industry released in 2008, Defra stated that they had welfare concerns surrounding the shooting of game. The report addresses the ‘extent and duration of confinement of semi-wild species, sometimes within systems offering a barren, restricting environment.’ The RSPB boss said that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows. But Twitter users reacted angrily to the comments . You do not need a licence to hunt pheasants or grouse in the UK but a firearms or shotgun certificate is required. The pheasant shooting season runs from October to February each year. It is illegal to shoot the birds outside of that time frame. In an interview with The Observer, Mr Harper added that is was too simplistic to say that the RSPB is ‘anti-shooting’. He said: ‘It’s more sophisticated than that. We are ready to work with landowners and farmers to look after farmland wildlife. ‘We are not an animal welfare organisation. Our primary interest is stopping common species becoming rare.’ Spokesman Simon Clarke told The Observer: ‘When organisations are prepared to put evidence before opinion and long-term conservation goals before short-term politicised campaigning, then there is much common ground to be found.’ Stuart Housden, a director at the RSPB, said: ‘This is what we have been saying for a hundred years. There is nothing new. ‘The RSPB was set up 1904 and has been consistently neutral on the ethics of field sports. We are not allowed to be in support of field sports, nor are we allowed to be against them. ‘We are always firm on wildlife crimes and other bad practises such as the destruction of wildlife habitats. We will condemn bad practice and if it is illegal practice we are very effective in combating it. ‘What we are simply saying is that there are people who are doing some good things and what we are trying to do is give praise where it is due and criticise those who do bad things. ‘Sixty per cent of UK wildlife is in decline. Nature needs friends who will invest in wildlife in a sensitive and thoughtful way. ‘We would like to see more people go the extra mile to give nature a home on their farms.’","Martin Harper said ‘progressive’ shoots were good for the countryside .

"A couple accused of claiming £42,500 in benefits while sending their children to a top private school and living in a £1,950 a month house were cleared today. Judge William Hart threw out the case against Leslie and Sarah Grant because  the Department of Work and Pensions lost letters written by Mr Grant that would have supported his case. The 67-year-old from Cheltenham insisted he had written to the DWP notifying them of a change in his financial circumstances. During the trial the Government department denied ever receiving these letters but in evidence yesterday Tracey Tye, a DWP investigator, conceded there was a computer record of letters being received from him. Cleared: Sarah and Leslie Grant were accused of claiming £42,000 of benefits while getting an income from businesses and £50,000 in the bank - but the DWP lost a series of important letters, collapsing the case . She said they could not be accessed to check their contents because they had been ‘archived’ and were not longer retrievable. Judge Hart ruled that because the prosecution was unable to produce the letters to show whether they contained what Mr Grant alleged it would be unsafe to leave the case to the jury. He directed the jury to find the couple not guilty of defrauding the DWP between 2009 and 2011. The couple had been accused of falsely claiming £42,500, consisting of £19,000 of pension benefit, £19,000 of housing benefit and £4,500 of council tax benefit to fund their lifestyle. Sarah Grant, also received a £40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband Leslie, 67, were claiming benefits, Gloucester Crown Court heard. Mr and Mrs Grant say they were penniless as a number of businesses went bust and needed state support. This was received while Mrs Grant got money from her mum, there was income from the pair's businesses and business account were being used for personal expenditure, it was said. Prosecutors also say they had around £50,000 in the bank, but today a second forensic accountant told the court she felt that the Grants had no income entering their bank accounts. Mr Grant, 67, had been receiving pension credit since November 2007, despite running his wife's companies, Hadleigh Partnership, Hadleigh Development and Sarafino Ltd, prosecutors claim. Funds were used to sent their children to Dean Close School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and to pay for expensive child care and high rent. Investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £1,950 a month rent with just £775 a month housing allowance. Mrs Grant was questioned by benefit officials in May 2010 and said that her parents had paid the rent shortfalls and school fees. Top private school: The Grants' children attended £32,000-a-year Dean Close School in Cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits, the court heard . The couple, from Cheltenham, claim that the firms they were involved in at the time were in liquidation. On Wednesday a forensic accountant told the court that after analysing the pair's bank accounts it was clear they had more than £48,000 available to them. Neil Ward explained that between them the pair had four bank accounts and his job was to analyse the accounts to decide what was 'personal' income and what related to the business. He told the jury that he assessed each payment made and even went through nine ring binders full of receipts to try and ascertain where cash had been spent. In his report he also asked: 'What is income? Luxury items such as school fees, extravagant holidays, expensive purchases, nice clothes, could all mean an income. 'If you're spending on these things there must be a source to do it'. He told that £40,000 of that had come from Mrs Grant's mother. The defence argued that it therefore counted as a gift, but when prosecutor, Tara Wolfe, asked the witness: 'would a gift of £40,000 be eligible for pension credit?' he responded: 'I believe so'. Mr and Mrs Grant both deny falsely claiming pension credits and housing and council tax benefit without declaring they had other income. But defence witness Helen Gregory- a forensic accountant - said the couple were clearly struggling with money as a number of their businesses went under. She explained how Sarafinos Ltd, a coffee shop opened in Folkestone and Birmingham, was hoped to become a chain but it collapsed shortly after opening. Instead the pair opened a restaurant called The Courtyard in Cheltenham. The couple also opened D'Altos, a company aimed at running fast food outlets which ran for just two months. The couple's building companies, Hadleigh Partnership and Hadleigh Development also went into liquidation. Hearing: Judge William Hart threw out the case at Gloucester Crown Court (above) after a DWP blunder . Mrs Gregory also argued that the £40,000 given to Sarah Grant by her mother was clearly a loan and did not count as income. She said: 'They were struggling. They were doing their best to make things work. They had a number of businesses and they had become accustomed to a certain lifestyle. 'Their businesses went under but they were trying to maintain that level of living. 'It took them about a year to try and get back on their feet financially. 'I don't believe they were receiving any income. I understood the money to be a short term loan from Mrs Grant's mother to get her back on her feet.'","Sarah and Leslie Grant are on trial for alleged £42,000 benefit fraud .

"The parents of a 19-year-old Clemson University student who died last year after falling from a highway bridge during a pre-dawn fraternity run sued the university, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and three of its members for $50 million on Monday. Tucker Hipps' body was found by police last September beneath a highway bridge over a lake near the Clemson, South Carolina campus when he didn't return from the run with other fraternity pledges. The two civil suits, which seek $25 million each, allege that Hipps died as a result of a confrontation with a fraternity member over breakfast food he was told to bring that morning. Lawsuitl: Cynthia and Gary Hipps filed two $25M suits in South Carolina Monday, one against their son's fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon and three members and one against the school he attended when he died after falling off a highway bridge during a pre-dawn run with his fraternity brothers . Tragic: The two civil suits allege that Hipps died as a result of a confrontation with a fraternity member over breakfast food he was told to bring that morning . Hipps sent a text message that he didn't have enough money for the order of '30 McDonald's biscuits, 30 McDonald's hash browns and two gallons of chocolate milk,' but a fraternity brother confronted him on the bridge over the order, court records show. Hipps then went over the railing of the bridge into shallow water in Lake Hartwell head first, the lawsuits said, adding that a fraternity member shone a flashlight into the dark water below but took no further action to locate the student. Clemson University, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and the fraternity members could not be immediately reached for comment. It was not clear whether the defendants had retained attorneys. A spokeswoman for the university told the Greenville News that the school was aware of the legal action, but would not comment on pending litigation. The lawsuit suggests Hipp was pressured to jump off this bridge bridge into shallow waters of Lake Hartwell after he failed to follow a senior frat brother's orders . The son of U.S. Rep. John Carney, D-Del., is one of five defendants in two lawsuits seeking at least $50 million stemming from the death of a Clemson University fraternity pledge. In addition to Samuel Quillen Carney, the lawsuits name two other fraternity members, as well as the university and the fraternity. Defendant: Samuel Quillen Carney, the son of U.S. Rep. John Carney, D-Del., was named in the suit . 'No one - certainly no parent - can feel anything but sympathy for this family's grief and anger,' John Carney and his wife, Tracey Quillen Carney, said in a statement released by his office on Tuesday. 'We have faith that those trusted with investigative and legal authority will act based on facts.' 'Our advice to Sam since the tragedy in September has been to tell the truth and remember that any detail might help,' the statement said. 'That continues to be our message to him. The lawsuits, one brought by Hipps' estate and a wrongful death suit brought by his parents, say fraternity brothers ordered Hipps to bring biscuits, hash browns and 2 gallons of chocolate milk to the fraternity before the run but he said he didn't have enough money. One of the fraternity brothers confronted Hipps about not bringing the food, the suit said, later adding, 'Tucker went over the railing of the bridge into shallow waters of Lake Hartwell head first.' In addition to the $25 million in actual damages, the lawsuits seek unspecified punitive damages and ask for a jury trial.

Hipps sent a text message that he didn't have enough money for the order of '30 McDonald's biscuits, 30 McDonald's hash browns and two gallons of chocolate milk,' but a fraternity brother confronted him on the bridge over the order, court records show . The suits said the fraternity had a long tradition of 'requiring, pressuring, encouraging and forcing' pledge members to jump off bridges over the lake and swim to shore. Hipps was not under the influence of any substances, according to a toxicology report. He died of blunt force trauma from a head-first fall onto rocks in shallow water, a coroner's report showed. The lawsuits contend his death was caused by the gross negligence and recklessness of the defendants, including two other fraternity members who had organized the run. Hipps' death sparked rampant speculation at the time by students on social media that hazing was involved, but police said a preliminary investigation did not indicate a role for hazing. The Oconee County Sheriff's Office said this month its case remained open. The university suspended all activities of its 24 fraternities shortly after Hipps' body was found. Hipps then went over the railing of the bridge into shallow water in Lake Hartwell head first, the lawsuits said, adding that a fraternity member shone a flashlight into the dark water below but took no further action to locate the student .","Cynthia and Gary Hipps filed two $25M suits in South Carolina Monday, one against Sigma Phi Epsilon and three members and one against the school .

"The discredited Liverpool Care Pathway is still being used in some hospitals despite having been scrapped, a Commons report will reveal. A cancer charity warns that despite an NHS ban, the controversial end-of-life programme is still in use under ‘a different name’. The report comes as police are investigating the death of a second ‘healthy’ pensioner at a hospital in Cheshire. The family of Margaret ‘Nellie’ Smart, 93, lodged a formal complaint against Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, saying they were convinced the mother of 12 died after being dehydrated. A new report has warned that hospitals are still using the discredited treatment method, file photograph . Nurses told MPs that some hospitals have merely ‘tweaked’ the end-of-life protocol and given it another title – meaning the ‘abuse’ suffered by some frail and vulnerable patients under the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) may still be happening. The Royal College of Nursing said its members had ‘not seen a significant difference’ in the way care is delivered in England since the pathway was withdrawn last year. In a report out tomorrow, MPs on the Commons Health Select Committee are set to urge hospitals to review their procedures to ensure the LCP is not used. They are expected to say that, in far too many cases, it is unclear whether proper discussions have been held with patients and their families. They are also set to call for social care for the terminally ill to be free, to ensure people are not forced to suffer bad deaths because of money worries. An initial police inquiry into the death of an elderly patient has now been expanded after Mrs Smart’s family complained about alleged neglect at the same hospital. She died after the NHS ban on the controversial pathway was imposed. Her family believe that the great-grandmother would still be alive if she had not been admitted to Warrington General Hospital for checks following a suspected minor stroke. The Liverpool Care Pathway sees patients sedated, denied food and water and then allowed to die . The Mail uncovered the cruel 'Death Pathway' on July 16, 2013 . The trust is already being investigated after Angela Johnson, the daughter of 85-year-old Alice Johnson who died on the LCP shortly before its abolition, made an almost identical complaint weeks earlier. The LCP involves the withdrawal of life-saving treatment. Patients are sedated and most are denied food and fluids. They typically die within 29 hours. Critics said it was a way of hastening death, and – following pressure from the Daily Mail – it was phased out following the Neuberger review two years ago, which found some patients were so dehydrated they were forced to suck on hospital sponges. No hospital was meant to be using the pathway from summer last year. They were instead given a set of five care ‘priorities’ by the Department of Health. But in written evidence to the Commons inquiry, the charity Macmillan Cancer Support said: ‘Some areas have worked well to develop [new] guidance ... other areas, however, are still using the Liverpool Care Pathway by a different name.’ Labour MP Rosie Cooper said that if the pathway was still in use, how can we know whether the ‘abuses, misunderstandings and lack of education isn’t going on under our noses now?’ Macmillan told the MPs too many doctors and nurses do not know how to talk to patients and their families about death.","A cancer charity claims the NHS is using a controversial 'Death Pathway'

"International observers trying to monitor the ceasefire in the Ukraine are being led on an impossible game of 'hide and seek' that could shatter the peace deal. Both pro-Russian rebels and government troops have been accused of concealing weapons  from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) which could threaten the treaty. Under the agreement heavy artillery should have been pulled back from the front line, but just last week the opposing forces were seen to be breaking the deal. International observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) look at an armoured vehicle of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) The inspection by the international observers took place in 100km easts of Donetsk . Yesterday eye-witnesses saw two rebel controlled tanks  pushing forward and days earlier Ukraine troops were seen transporting a tank and a large calibre gun close to the battlefront. In a bid to monitor the fragile ceasefire the OSCE has asked to know how many weapons each side has and where they are being stored. Armed with cameras and clipboards the international observers have been driving around eastern Ukraine looking for rocket launchers and artillery. 'Some information has been provided from both sides, but we still need substantial information,' said Michael Bociurkiw, the OSCE mission spokesman. It is unclear to what extent the OSCE teams are able to decide on their own where to inspect. The monitors are also regularly complaining that they are not being allowed to travel through Ukraine freely. Sometimes they are made to wait at checkpoints, forcing delays, while in more extreme cases they are blocked entirely from reaching their destination. Mr Bociurkiw said even a short wait violates the verification process. 'Any delays are unacceptable in our books,' he said. This week a group of inspectors travelled from Donetsk to Novoamvrosiivske, a village near the Russian border, to visit a cement factory in the rebel controlled territory. Here they scrutinized dozens of tanks, rocket launchers and howitzers taking photographs and making notes. As they made there way back fresh tracks could be seen indictating that a convoy of heavy machinery had passed through while the inspectors were engaged elsewhere. In a bid to monitor the fragile ceasefire the OSCE has asked to know how many weapons each side has and where they are being store . Journalists in the Ukraine who followed the tracks found two tanks in a multi-vehicle convoy that included truck-pulled cannons and troop carriers full of rebel fighters. Two days earlier a Ukraine solider had boasted that a cease-fire busting cannon was being taken towards the front line. Ukrainian military officials have at times conceded that they are refraining from a complete withdrawal of heavy weapons, citing what they say is rebel reluctance to do the same. 'We will not withdraw all our weapons, as we have no confirmation that the same is being done by the enemy,' military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters earlier this month. 'It would be wrong and criminal to leave our troops without any cover.' Armed with cameras and clipboards that international observers have been driving around eastern Ukraine looking for rocket launchers and artillery . And Ukrainian authorities say artillery fire continues in sporadic clashes along the front line. Donetsk region police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said a resident of Avdiivka was killed yesterday after a shell struck a home in the town. In addition, neither side is willing to agree that tanks fall under the weapons to be withdrawn, although the cease-fire clearly envisions their removal. The conflict in the Ukraine has already left more than 6,000 dead in a year .","Pro-Russian rebels and Ukraine troops accused of concealing weapons .

"One of the men expelled from Tanzania with Jihadi John is a close associate of ‘the Goebbels of Islamic State’, responsible for horrific videos of beheadings. Mohammed Emwazi was with German national Marcel Schrodl when they were stopped at the airport in Dar es Salaam in 2009. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that German intelligence has linked Schrodl to Denis Cuspert – the rapper whose role making videos for IS has been likened to that of Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Emwazi (left) has been linked to Denis Cuspert (right), a  rapper responsible for the production of propaganda videos for ISIS . A grab from a video shows Emwazi (circled) leading the execution of 15 prisoners in Syria . Cuspert, who was a rapper under the name Deso Dogg, has appeared in an IS beheading video, holding up the severed head of a victim. It is believed he may also have produced the sickening footage of Emwazi murdering British and US prisoners with a knife. German authorities have linked him to Schrodl, one of the most dangerous Islamists on their radar, who they classify as ‘prone to violence’. Although he claims to have turned his back on fanaticism, Schrodl is believed to have forged links with Somali terror group Al Shabaab, an Al Qaeda affiliate. When a Mail on Sunday reporter spoke to Schrodl at his home in Dusseldorf about his links to jihadism, he said: ‘I don’t have anything to do with that any more.’ Some time later, outside the door of his seedy fourth-floor flat, he appeared flanked by two heavies, who made it plain that it was time for our reporter to leave. But his denials conflict with information from German intelligence agencies which regard him as a ‘person of interest’ in the ongoing fight against IS. Cuspert, who was a rapper under the name Deso Dogg, has appeared in an IS beheading video, holding up the severed head of a victim . Emwazi was expelled from Tanzania with one of Cuspert's associates in 2009. Cuspert (right) has been likened to the Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels. Emwazi, Islamic convert Schrodl and Londoner Ali Adorus were stopped by the Tanzanian authorities at Dar es Salaam airport as they arrived for what they had claimed was an innocent safari holiday. Emwazi’s apologists have claimed the men’s detention – ‘on orders from MI6’ – as the first step on his road to radicalisation. Yet The Mail on Sunday has established that the supposedly strict Muslims were held not because of their political affiliations, but due to their drunken and violent behaviour on a Dutch KLM flight from Amsterdam to Dar es Salaam, according to the Tanzanian government. Schrodl is connected with some of the vilest figures in the radical Islamic network, most notably fellow convert Cuspert. German intelligence sources say both men were radicalised by Mohammed Mahmoud, the Austrian-born leader of banned Islamist group Millatu Ibrahim. In September 2013, Schrodl was stopped returning to Germany after a flight from Cairo. A search revealed a secret compartment in his jacket containing a false French driving licence and identity card. In October last year, he was sentenced to a five-month suspended jail sentence. Adorus, 33, a father-of-one from East London, is in an Ethiopian jail on terrorism offences.","Mohammed Emwazi  expelled from Tanzania with German Marcel Schrodl .

"Police were called to a Church of England primary school after parents allegedly threatened to stab each other in front of young children. The group of mothers and father were seen screaming at each other in the brawl at St John's C of E primary school in Dorking, Surrey. They were then heard to make the alleged death threats by a mother who was dropping off her terrified children. Police were called toSt Johns C of E primary school in Dorking,Surrey after parents threatened to stab each other in front of young children . One mother, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said: 'They were shouting and screaming at each other, with bad language and threatening to stab and kill each other.' Surrey Police confirmed it had received reports of 'an altercation' at the school just before 9am on Wednesday. A spokesman said today: 'Officers attended and the matter is being investigated. No arrests have been made at this stage.' But the witness, who was not involved in the fracas,  said it's not the first time police have been called  to the school over parents' fighting. 'It's disgusting....it's a primary school, this should not be going on,' the mother added. 'I don't want to send my kid there in that environment, and I am not the only parent that has complained, but I can't get him in any other school as they are all full. 'I don't want him subjected to it. But if I take him out we will be done for absences. 'Sooner or later someone is going to get hurt. It's beyond unbelievable what happens. Surrey Police confirmed it had received reports of 'an altercation' at the school just before 9am on Wednesday. 'The police will soon have to start being there for morning drop-offs. Enough is enough, kids are picking up bad behaviour. 'It's not the school's fault, but it is their fault for not acting. It's not them, it's parents, but it's going on in school premises in front of children. 'These parents were threatening to kill each other in front of their kids and other people's children.' St Johns C of E has denied violence involving parents is a regular occurrence, and claims 'only one other incident in the past few months has involved police'. A spokesman said Wednesday morning's incident happened outside the school gates, not in the playground, and was 'a private matter'. He added 'It is completely unacceptable behaviour by parents, and I am concerned that other parents and children witnessed it. 'This incident is being dealt with by the police, because the issues over which the argument took place were private issues, happening outside the school. 'We are liaising with the police, and assisting them where possible to make sure that this does not happen again. 'I am very sorry that this has happened, and I am also very keen to make sure that the school environment is kept safe for everyone, particularly the children.' The school was put into special measures in February 2013 and became an academy in November 2013, sponsored by the Guildford Diocese. St John's has 164 children on roll and last month it received a 'satisfactory' report following its Statutory Inspection of Anglican and Methodist Schools report. - Did you witness this incident?

"An extraordinary collection of photographs and mementos chronicling the affair of a German businessman and his secretary in the late 1960s and 1970s has gone on show in New York. The memorabilia was discovered in a briefcase three decades after the affair took place, abandoned in a German apartment and later sold at auction. In a dangerous move for an adulterer, businessman Günter K kept a meticulous account of his relationship with a 24-year-old woman known as Margret S who was also married. An extraordinary collection of photographs and mementos chronicling the affair of a German businessman called Günter and his secretary Margret (pictured) in the late 1960s and 1970s has gone on show in New York . The contents of the case, which are on display at the exhibition Margret: Chronicle of an Affair – May 1969 to December 1970, included hundreds of pictures of Margret in various places and poses: sitting at a typewriter at the office, travelling or in hotel rooms, undressing, changing, or getting dressed. Günter kept ticket stubs, contraceptive packets and even locks of his lover's hair. The typed notes and diary entries from the Cologne businessman, who seemed to have an eye for detail way ahead of his time, reveal that he was 39 when the affair began in May 1969. The pair started their affair while on business trips and eventually escalated to them playing husband and wife in Günter’s store building, where Margret prepares light meals and they watch television together. she also gets dressed up in the clothes her love buys for her.

Susanne Zander is director of  the Gallery Susanne Zander / Delmes & Zander in Cologne and Berlin, Germany, which own the Margret collection. She said: 'It seems clear that he was obsessed with the process of documenting and collecting. Presumably because he wanted to control both Margret and the situation. 'Somehow he was very 'German', writing down everything in a very correct and precise way – even if what he recorded was deeply personal and often emotional fraught. 'You get a sense of him trying not to lose control of the situation through his obsessive cataloging and archiving. The exhibition Margret: Chronicle of an Affair – May 1969 to December 1970, includes hundreds of pictures of Margret in various poses .

Blogger Messynessychic observed how the pictures reveal the transformation of Margret from, 'a shy, simple, mousy-haired girl to a modern, sophisticated woman with a fiery red high-maintenance beehive do.' The relationship appears to come to an end just before Christmas in 1970 when reports and photographs of Margret begin to break off. According to Günter’s notes, she tells him that 'after Christmas the f***ing will be over and you will not dance at two weddings anymore.' The letters and journals entries provide a porthole into the behaviour of men and women in the 1960s and 70s. The typed notes and diary entries from the Cologne businessman, who seemed to have an eye for detail way ahead of his time, reveal that he was 39 when the affair began in May 1969 . Over the course of the affair Margret seems to transform from a shy girl to a feisty, independent woman complete with a fiery red beehive . Ms Zander said: 'The images tell us about the fashions, styles, and culture of the times but also about the unfolding sexual revolution of the era (1969/1970): even bourgeois Gunter seems to be participating in this social revolution. 'The archive also tells us a lot about the dynamics between men and women at the time: he is older, her boss, wealthy; she is his secretary, younger, pretty, full of cliches. 'Their affair took place at the beginning of the era of women's lib etc. but its clear that the dynamics between Gunter and Margret were far from equal.' The relationship appears to come to an end just before Christmas in 1970 when reports and photographs of Margret begin to break off . According to Günter’s notes, she tells him that 'after Christmas the f***ing will be over and you will not dance at two weddings anymore. The extensive collection of several hundred images is considered to be one of the most detailed collections of memories ever to have been discovered. Ms Zander said : 'The mixture of writings, artifacts, and photographs is, I imagine, extremely rare. 'It is unlikely that another such collection exists. 'Even in our current times of social media – its seems unlikely that anyone has documented a private affair to such an obsessive degree. Which makes this collection of photographs, writings and artifacts from the late 1960s /early 1970s all the more unusual. 'The quality of the photographs is amazing, even if it’s clear that were made by an amateur, albeit evidently gifted, photographer. Both Margret and Gunter are believed to be dead. Ms Zander added: 'Margret is also beautiful and a compelling character. 'Their story is amazing and it is also a document of the time: you get a real sense of the time and place based solely on why Gunter decide to record.' ‘Margret’ is presented in parallel to the exhibition ‘System and Vision’ organized by Delmes & Zander at David Zwirner, New York.

"It could mean the end of scrabbling for your credit card - and your hpone. China's Internet tycoon Jack Ma, founder of giant online merchant Alibaba, gave a glimpse of the future when he demonstrated a new e-payment system using facial recognition at the CeBIT IT fair in Germany. Criss-crossing the stage in the style of a Silicon Valley pioneer late Sunday, Ma showed off the technology that uses facial recognition from a smartphone camera selfie as a digital signature. The founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma, speaks during the official opening of the CeBIT technology fair in Hanover, Germany on March 15, 2015 ©Tobias Schwarz (AFP) Cards are linked to Google Wallet, and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using a phone's contactless NFC chip . Google Wallet is a free mobile payment and digital wallet that securely stores a user's credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and offers. Cards are linked to the  wallet, and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using contactless NFC chips. Developers can currently use this API to add 'Buy with Google' buttons to apps, which Android Pay would effectively supersede if it works as expected. 'I want to take this opportunity to demonstrate a small innovative product that we designed,' Ma said. He used the technology to buy a gift for the mayor of Hannover — a souvenir stamp dating back to one of the city's trade fairs in 1948 — found on Alibaba, of course. 'Using online payments to buy things is always a big headache,' he said. 'You forget your password, you worry about security. 'Today we'll show you a new technology, how in the future people will buy things online.' On a smartphone he pressed a 'buy' button, which triggered a face-recognition routine. Ma, a former teacher, is known for thinking big, and at this week's CeBIT he was the keynote speaker, addressing an audience that included German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Like many other companies from the event's official partner country China, Alibaba -- flush with cash from a massive stock listing -- is looking beyond the borders of its huge domestic market of 1.2 billion people, to the world. Ma enthused that, while the industrial revolution freed workers from hard labour, the digital 'revolution... liberates the strength of the human brain'. 'It's not the technology that can change the world, it's the dreams behind the technology that change the world,' the 50-year-old told the audience, adding that his dream was to help small enterprises sell on a global market. Ma has not hidden his global ambitions and has cited as his models global companies such as Wal-Mart, IBM and Microsoft. In January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said his target was two billion Alibaba users worldwide, compared to 334 million 'active buyers' in December, and a global version of Taobao, the sales site that cemented his dominance in China. Some observers think Alibaba could one day rival the US online giants eBay and Amazon, or just buy them. 'Many people think that's a road that they may pursue, since it would be so expensive to build their own brand (in the US),' said Zia Daniell Wigder, vice-president of Forrester Research. 'Simply making a name for yourself in a market where the leaders have been established for a long time is going to be difficult. 'It is more likely that Alibaba conquers emerging markets with still nascent online trade while prudently strengthening its presence in developed countries.' The head of German IT industry group BITKOM, Dieter Kempf, said about Alibaba that 'the success is impressive, even if it is in large part because suppliers face a very large, hungry Chinese market'. Asked whether it could become a true global player, he said: 'I think we will have to see. Someone who can operate successfully in a large domestic market is not necessarily a good exporter... it really depends on the individual solutions.' The Chinese giant has already launched an online auction site in the US, called 11main, challenged Amazon in the field of cloud computing with a service called Aliyun, and invested $200 million (188 million euros) in Snapchat, a photo-sharing application. Bryan Wang, Beijing-based analyst for the consultancy Forrester Research, said it was an early attempt by Alibaba to try to 'understand digital consumers on a worldwide scale, outside of China'. Last September, the Hangzhou-based group raised a massive $25 billion on the New York stock market, although the share price has since fallen below the listing price. Founded in 1999, Alibaba has based its success on Taobao -- 'look for treasure' in Mandarin -- and Tmall, a gigantic virtual mall that has become so dominant that even Amazon has opened up shop there. Like Google, Alibaba capitalises on the analysis of user data. It does not charge commission to individuals but derives its profits from advertising options it offers to improve their visibility. The volume of annual trade carried on its platforms, still mostly within China, exceeds that of eBay and Amazon combined. Alibaba operates its own online payment system Alipay, and has received approval from Beijing to open a private bank. It also offers a navigation system, an online tour operator, and a music streaming service, among other things. 'Alibaba is not only an e-commerce platform, it is the largest digital ecosystem in China,' said Wang. 'Wherever you are in China, Alibaba actually knows your behaviour.' But Alibaba still faces other challenges -- it has been accused of not doing enough to eliminate counterfeits sold on its platforms. If Alibaba wants to internationalise, said Kitty Fok, analyst at the consultancy IDC, 'the number one concern is that people buy something that's actually worth their money.'","Systems could take on Apple Pay and Google Wallet .

"The Germanwings flight that crashed in the French Alps came down less than a mile from an almost identical air disaster more than 60 years ago when 44 people were killed. The fate of the Airbus A320, which appeared to drop out of the sky yesterday over the village of Barcelonette, appears to mirror that of Air France flight 178 which crashed close by in 1953. The aircraft, a Lockheed L-749A Constellation, was coming into land at Nice airport, when it crashed into the side of Mont Le Cimet, close to Barcelonette. Scroll down for video . A map showing the close proximity of an Air France crash in 1953 to that of the Germanwings disaster yesterday in the French Alps . According to accident investigators at the time, the service was en-route to Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, from Paris with stops in Nice, Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan and India. However, the plane encountered stormy weather over the French Alps with residents in the small village of Fours St. Laurent reporting seeing the aircraft crash into the mountainside and burst into flames. When rescue teams reached the scene the next day, there were no survivors, with all 35 passengers and nine crew members killed. Among those that died was French violinist Jacques Thibaud.

A similar model crashed in the French Alps in 1953 less than a mile from the doomed Germanwings aircraft yesterday . Famous French violinist Jacques Thibaud, who was killed in the Air France crash in September 1953 . Investigators then put the cause of the crash was down to 'controlled flight into terrain'. This means that an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the ground, a mountain, water, or an obstacle, with the pilots generally unaware of the danger until it is too late. Yesterday's crash in almost the exact same spot, all 144 passengers, including six crew members were killed on the flight en route from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. The majority of the passengers were Spanish and German with 16 children from the same school in Haltern near Dusseldorf losing their lives. A French Gendarmerie helicopter flies over the snow covered French Alps during a search and rescue operation. The crash site is less than a mile from the 1953 disaster . It has been claimed that the doomed Germanwings plane may have crashed because the windscreen cracked, causing a sudden drop in oxygen that rendered the pilots unconscious. Reports circulating on professional pilot forums suggested the black box on the Airbus A320 had been analysed and revealed that a 'structural failure' was responsible for the disaster. It is thought the windscreen gave way, incapacitating the pilots and leaving them unable to send out a distress call. Rescue helicopters have today resumed the search for debris and bodies at the crash site. As with the crash 60 years ago, there are no survivors . Today, search operations resumed at first light this morning in near-freezing conditions for debris and bodies at the crash site.

"Working from home has become a way of life for many employees. But when your home is 4,000 miles from the voters who put you in office, questions are going to be asked. Brian Riley insists he'll still be able to represent the people of Hadleigh in Suffolk when he moves to Raleigh in North Carolina. And, despite being an ocean and a four-hour time difference away, the 71-year-old will be entitled to keep claiming his annual allowance of £10,274. The former banker, whose daughter is Sky Sports News presenter Kate Riley, is under pressure from leaders at Tory-run Suffolk council to quit before March 20 so that a by-election can coincide with the May 7 general election. Jet-setter: Tory councillor Brian Riley (centre) will soon be moving to North Carolina but says he can still represent his constituents in Hadleigh, Suffolk from across the Atlantic Ocean . Round trip: Despite being an ocean and a four-hour time difference away, the 71-year-old will be entitled to keep claiming his annual allowance of £10,274 . But he is legally entitled to hold the seat until the next county council election in 2017 as long as he attends a meeting every six months. Candidates must live in the UK to stand. Despite having had the Conservative whip withdrawn by furious colleagues on Tuesday, Mr Riley has refused to back down. He claims modern technology and regular trips to the UK will allow him to stay in touch with his constituents. 'I am moving to the USA but I shall be coming back to the UK every six or seven weeks to keep up with my council work,' said Mr Riley, whose wife Alice, 66, is American. 'We are in the 21st century with emails and Skype and there are plenty of ways of keeping in touch with people in Hadleigh. It isn't a case of gathering around the parish pump any more.' He confirmed he would resign his other seat – on Babergh district council – because it involved 'nitty gritty issues' but would be able to continue as a county councillor because the role was 'more strategic'. Mr Riley even said he would have time to help the campaign to get Hillary Clinton to the White House. The presidential election takes place next year – meaning he will have even less time for his constituents if the former first lady is chosen as candidate for the Democrats. Councillor: The former banker (pictured) is legally entitled to hold the seat until the next county council election in 2017 as long as he attends a meeting every six months . Tory leader Mark Bee yesterday said his colleague had caused outrage. 'If a councillor moves out of the county it looks like an awkward relationship but it beggars belief to be in the United States,' he said. 'We don't think it represents the spirit of being a locally elected representative.' Labour opposition leader Sandy Martin said the situation was 'completely bonkers'. He added: 'It is all very well saying he will use Skype but a lot of people don't like talking over the phone or by computer.' John O'Connell of the TaxPayers' Alliance said the case highlighted the need to introduce a recall mechanism to allow voters to kick out absent councillors. 'They hand over hard-earned money to their councillors and rightly expect to get their money's worth when it comes to democratic representation,' he added. Mr Riley, who worked for 28 years at Standard Chartered bank before becoming a business consultant, has been summoned to a meeting with Mr Bee where he is expected to come under pressure to resign. In August last year a Liberal Democrat councillor triggered uproar by taking a £180,000-a-year job in Saudi Arabia, 4,000 miles from his ward in Hampshire, which paid a £13,000 allowance.","Brian Riley represents Hadleigh in Suffolk but is moving to United States .

"A couple laundered £63,000 of drug money and blew the cash on luxury goods, gadgets - and  a pet monkey. Daniel Lawrence, 33, and Renata Flores, 45, were investigated by police after bank staff noticed a number of suspicious cash deposits. Photos on Lawrence's open Facebook profile capture the couple cutting their wedding cake and also show his pet monkey, believed to be a marmoset, sat in a specially-made wooden shelter in a garden. Convicted: Daniel Lawrence, of Penzance, was sent to prison for laundering around £63,000 of drug money, while his partner Renata Flores received a suspended sentence . Extravagance: As well as splashing out on luxury perfume and kitchen applicances, Lawrence also kept a pet monkey, believed to be this marmoset . An investigation revealed that Flores had nearly £12,000 of unexplained bank credits and her daughter Daisy, 24, had received £30,000 in cash into two accounts - despite being on benefits. Her 19-year-old sister, Emily Flores' account also had a total of £22,000 of unidentified cash deposits paid into it. The court heard Lawrence, who did not have his own bank account, and Flores had laundered money from the sale of illicit drugs to buy luxury home goods including a Smeg fridge and a range cooker. Officers also found extensive ranges of expensive perfumes at their home - and discovered Lawrence had a pet monkey. Caught out: The court heard Lawrence and Flores (pictured) had laundered money from the sale of illicit drugs to buy luxury home goods including a Smeg fridge and a range cooker . Jailing Lawrence for three years, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark, QC, said: 'It is crystal clear to the court that you were making large sums of money out of the illegal supply of drugs. 'In order to divert attention from yourself, you agreed, through Renata Flores and her two daughters, for the money that you were making to be laundered through bank accounts in the names of Renata, Daisy and Emily.' Flores was sentenced to 20 months suspended for two years and 120 hours unpaid work after Judge Clark said she must have known 'at least something' of the scheme and had involved her daughters. She had previously claimed to accept no responsibility whatsoever for the crime. Prosecuting at Truro Crown Court, Joanna Martin, said police started investigating the family after a suspicious activity report from the Halifax. She said: 'As well as cash deposits there was also further evidence of expensive items at the home address.' An investigation revealed that Flores (pictured above with Lawrence) had nearly £12,000 of unexplained bank credits while sister's account also had a total of £22,000 of unidentified cash deposits paid into it . The pair from Penzance, Cornwall, pleaded guilty to converting approximately £63,000 in criminal cash between March 1, 2007 and March 10, 2013. Lawrence also admitted being in possession of the Class A drug morphine and the Class B drug cannabis on May 21, 2013, at an earlier hearing. He pleaded not guilty to being in possession of the morphine with intent to supply it to another on the same date. Daisy and Emily Flores both denied converting criminal property and the pleas were accepted by the prosecution and not guilty verdicts were recorded. Robin Smith, defending Lawrence said that after some rehabilitation treatment he had managed to remain drug free. He said: 'He seems to have turned things around during the currency of this case.' Brian Fitzherbert, defending Flores, said she was valued at the soup kitchen where she volunteered said that her 'leek and potato soup was second to none' and she was the most valuable person in her team. The couple pleaded guilty at Truro Crown Court in Cornwall (above) and Lawrence was sentenced to three years behind bars .","Daniel Lawrence, 33, and Renata Flores, 45, of Cornwall, both convicted .

"John Bilardi is paralysed with an unbearable sense of guilt as he tries to make any sense of what would possess his son, now known as Jihadi Jake, to volunteer to sacrifice his own young life for the Islamic State. On the surface Jake Bilardi was far from what is perceived as a stereotypical recruit for an extremist Islamic group: a white boy from suburban Australia who, as the youngest of six children, had an atheist upbringing. However, even his father admits you didn't have to dig too deep to see that his 18 year-old son was a troubled soul and now he will live with a life of immense regret. Scroll down for video . Jake Bilardi's father John (pictured left) has spoken to 60 Minutes about his son's decision to join an extremist Islamic group . Although no one could have foreseen that the loner, who turned his back on the real world, was living a secret second life locked away in his bedroom in Melbourne on the internet for the past 18 months as he slowly but surely assumed his new persona as Abu Abdullah al-Australi. The painfully shy boy had never been happier after converting to Muslim and regularly attending mosques but his new lifestyle choice did not end there as he flew to the Middle East in December which ultimately cost him his life  in a failed suicide mission in Iraq last week. His father struggled to find any words to describe his pain and overwhelming sense of guilt when he spoke to 60 Minutes reporter Michael Usher which airs on Sunday night. 'He is at a complete loss to try to understand any of it - he's trying to put the picture together now on not a lot of information at all to be honest - he is learning as much as anyone else is learning in the public forum,' Usher told Daily Mail Australia. John finds it even more difficult to comprehend that his son had plans to orchestrate what would have been a deliberate act of mass murder right in his very own city where he had lived his whole life. Jake's father shared pictures and cards with the programme, showing a Happy Father's Day cars with the words 'I Love You' written inside . Jake's father admitted to 60 Minutes reporter Michael Usher (pictured right) that you didn't have to dig very far to realise that the 18-year-old was a very troubled soul . 'He can barely talk about it all he struggles for words with the fact that his son had plan B which was to commit a major act of terror in Melbourne and had begun buying the chemicals for the bombs before he disappeared out of Australia,' Usher said. As the youngest of six children, Jake had an atheist upbringing . 'That atrocity John can not understand at all - the family are desperately trying to now go back and understand who Jake was because he wasn't the kid they thought he was and tragically all of the warning signs were there of a kid in trouble.' When Usher suggested there were clear warning signs that his son had issues, John agreed saying: 'yes they were and I'm so sorry I didn't do anything about it.' 'He said he was at times very difficult emotionally - even as a little boy,' Usher said. 'He also said ""I'm sorry I wish i could have done more to understand my son and stop him"" and he's finding it very hard to grieve because he's feeling so much guilt,' Usher said. ISIS leaked a photograph of 18-year-old Australian Jake Bilardi (pictured) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it . To add to Jake's complexities, his mother died from cancer in 2012 and was then looked after by his five older siblings as his parents had divorced years earlier. His father described his son as an 'extremely shy' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings. He said he felt he should have known about the full extent of his son's bullying. 'I wish I could understand more of what went on,' he told Usher. But John also feels that his son was brainwashed and believes that he was a 'soft target for' the Islamic recruiters. Bilardi (pictured, left) in a school photo from Year 10 - the year he converted to Islam, according to school friends, and  wearing a Chelsea Football Club shirt (pictured right) Jake Bilardi's father feels a deep regret that he didn't address his son's issues when he was a child . His former fellow pupils also described Jake as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets and spoke seriously all of time about Middle Eastern politics. Although it was unusual that the child from an atheist background converted to Muslim there was nothing to suggest that he was acting radically in his public life but online he was in active contact with Islamic State recruiters. Jake organised to get a passport and told his family he wanted to work at a charity in Uganda. 'He went online from writing about his love of soccer and wanting to buy a dog to children allowed to join the jihad and I cant wait for my pilgrimage to Mecca in December,' Usher said. The last time John ever saw his son was when he asked for his birth certificate in order to get a passport and said he seemed uncharacteristically 'upbeat'. 'He said he was articulate and clear and seemed happy and in fact in the last communications he seemed very content and he said to his dad ""I feel comfort being a Muslim and I feel comfort in Islam"", Usher said. 'John was optimistic that his son was on a good path that after the divorce and feeling alienated he thought that his son had found some happiness and peace.' However, these feelings were short-lived as John had a growing concern for his son's welfare by the last time he ever heard from Jake again in the form of a Facebook message when was in the Middle East. Footage of Jake being bullied at school - his former school mates described him as as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets . The last time his father saw Jake he was uncharacteristically 'upbeat' 'The message was pretty veiled other than to say that he was in the region and had some intent,' Usher said. John was understandably panicked but couldn't find a lot of places to turn to get help and was at a great loss at what to do. 'In fact even at that point, there was still some disbelieving that maybe this was just some great romantic notion of Jake's and he was off some ridiculous journey,' Usher said. 'Then he couldn't contact him and had no further communication from him and John learned of his son's death as it appeared in the media last week.'

"Heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life, research found . Heart attack victims can enjoy a healthy recovery if they look on the bright side of life, research found. Pessimists who grumble through life were twice as likely to suffer another heart attack, require surgery or even die, compared with more cheerful patients. That is according to a group of scientists at University College London who spent four years studying the mental attitudes of 369 patients admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks. While it is widely known that optimism is linked to better heart health, this is the first study to look at the impact of a patient’s attitude after suffering a heart attack. The team said their findings could be linked to physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic, such as smoking and healthy eating. Smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina, with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking. And this study showed that half of the most pessimistic patients who smoked were still smoking on year after going into hospital. By contrast, 85 per cent of optimistic smokers kicked the habit entirely. Positive patients are also more likely to aid their recovery by eating more fruit and vegetables after their incident – some 40 per cent of them ate the recommended five-a-day, compared with just 20 per cent of pessimists. However, the study did find that optimistic patients were no more likely to do more exercise than pessimists. Lead author of the research, Professor Steptoe, said: ‘Our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board, like quitting smoking and eating more healthily – this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack. In the UK, 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease, the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina . ‘Our findings could be used to identify pessimistic patients and encourage them to make the necessary changes to their lifestyle that can ultimately lead to better health.’ Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation, added: ‘Suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll, which we know can lead to depression, further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack. ‘If you’re living with a heart condition and struggling to cope, we would urge you to contact your GP who can put you in touch with the necessary support.’ Depression has also been linked to poor outcomes for heart patients. These findings discovered that pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina. The experts hope their study will help identify the patients most at risk of suffering serious health complications in the years after recovering from heart problems. In the UK, 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease, the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina. The study was published in Psychosomatic Medicine.","Scientists at UCL spent 4 years studying mental attitudes of heart patients .

"A Mexican man who needs a double heart and liver transplant has been granted a 90-day humanitarian pass by the United States Department of Homeland Security. The DHS-approved document grants the 20-year-old man a temporary stay in the US to seek medical treatment. The 'humanitarian parole' can be renewed while Chua is in the US if he is accepted for the double transplant as the wait for organs could take a long time. Jose Chua Lopez (left) and his mother, Myra Lopez (right) announced the good news in Hermosillo, Mexico . Chua was born with only one ventricle in his heart, causing problems with blood reaching the vital organ . Chua, who plans to seek treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, was twice denied a tourist visa and relatives and his doctor say his life is in danger. Mayra Lopez, Chua's mother, said: 'I don't have words to express my gratitude to everyone who has prayed for us and have helped us find a solution.' Chua was born with only one ventricle in his heart, causing circulation problems that mean blood reaches only one of the four chambers. His liver has also been damaged. The cost of Chua's diagnosis in the US is expected to be $13,000, plus travel and lodging expenses. His family has resorted to raffles, selling food and accepting donations to raise the funds. The double transplant itself could cost as much as $2million. Consejo de Latinos Unidos, which helps uninsured people get access to medical care, assisted with getting the 90-day pass.

'They will evaluate if it is possible to operate, and in the case that it is, he will have to wait and live near the hospital until the organs arrive. 'It could be months or years of waiting.' Forbes said the cost of Chua's treatment and diagnosis would be negotiated with the hospital.

"A teenager used a fake Facebook profile to lure the love rival who fell pregnant by her boyfriend to an empty property where she attacked her so viciously that she broke her eye socket. Abigail Moody flew into a jealous rage and brutally attacked Melissa Benhamou after finding out she had slept with her partner Sam Bridge, Worcester Crown Court heard. Moody, a former care worker, pretended to be Mr Bridge on Facebook to lure the victim to her flat in Bromsgrove, on November 17 last year. Abigail Moody (left) flew into a jealous rage and brutally attacked Melissa Benhamou (right) after finding out she had slept with her partner Sam Bridge, Worcester Crown Court heard . Moody, a former care worker, pretended to be Mr Bridge (pictured with Moody) on Facebook to lure the victim to her flat in Bromsgrove, on November 17 last year . But when Miss Benhamou arrived, the 19-year-old grabbed her hair, and kicked and punched her to the ground. She smacked her the young woman's head against a radiator, fracturing her eye socket - before Moody chastised her victim for getting blood on her trainers. Worcester Crown Court heard she also insulted her Pakistani heritage before leaving her in a pool of blood. Abigail Moody has been given 18 months in a young offender's institute after the attack . Moody, from Bromsgrove, was yesterday sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders institution after admitting racially aggravated grievous bodily harm. Sentencing, Judge Robert Juckes QC, said: 'This matter was a well planned, carefully thought out assault on a girl. 'It was a vicious attack, accompanied by racial abuse.' Prosecutor Peter Grice said the two women had been friends until April 2012, when Moody assaulted Miss Benhamou because she had slept with her boyfriend. In April last year, she slept with Moody's boyfriend once again and became pregnant before miscarrying the baby weeks later. Mr Grice told the court that Miss Benhamou was contacted on Facebook by a profile in the name of the unfaithful boyfriend - but it was Moody posing as him. She tricked her former friend into going to an address and Moody even arranged for a taxi to bring her there. On arrival, Miss Benhamou was sent a message telling her the door was open and to walk straight in. But, in the corridor outside the flat, Moody 'lay in ambush' and grabbed her by the hair before dragging her inside. She racially abused her and stamped on Miss Benhamou's phone after she knocked it to the ground. The court was told Miss Benhamou slept with Moody's boyfriend twice, falling pregnant the second time, before miscarrying the baby a few weeks later . Miss Benhamou was lured to a flat in Bromsgrove after Moody pretended to be her boyfriend on Facebook. Once there she was attacked, leaving her with injuries to her eye (right) Mr Grice said: 'The defendant repeatedly punched her victim, causing the victim to hit her head against a radiator.' Moody then accused Miss Benhamou of getting blood on her trainers and said: 'You slept with my man - you got pregnant with his kid.' Eventually the victim, who suffered a fractured eye socket, a possible blood clot in her eye, bruising and a chipped tooth, went to a nearby food outlet to get help. John Lynch, defending, said it was a 'nasty assault' and Moody had given a full and frank account of it to police. After the case, Miss Benhamou, 23, said she was left with life-changing injuries at the hands of her former best friend. Miss Benhamou, 23, said she was left with life-changing injuries at the hands of her former best friend who tricked her on Facebook pretending to be lover Sam, 24 . Moody, from Bromsgrove, was yesterday sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders institution after admitting racially aggravated grievous bodily harm . The health care assistant added: 'It was so terrifying. The first thing I remember seeing was a fist in my eye. 'I didn't know who was punching me at first. 'I thought it was Sam, but when she spoke I knew immediately it was Abi. 'She was calling me a p**i and just kept hitting me and hitting me. 'You see things like this on soaps, but you never think it will happen to you. 'After the attack I went into shock. 'I had a metal plate put in my face because the bone under my eye was completely destroyed. Moody (left) wasfriends with Miss Benhamou (right) until April 2012, when the attack happened, the jury heard . 'My face is still numb to this day because she damaged the nerve. It still hurts even now. 'I can't believe my friend could do that to me. I was devastated. We used to live together and were really close. 'She was messaging me on Facebook pretending to be Sam. 'She was saying come on over I'm not with Abi anymore and I really want to see you. 'I caved too easily and went along to see him. They weren't flirty messages or anything like that but I went along in the end. I wish to this day I hadn't. 'I have nothing to do with Sam anymore. He thought he was a bit of a player. We both knew him and I regret what happened but I just want to move on with my life now. 'I'm glad she has been jailed because I have been left with life-changing injuries.

"Taking a stance: Openly-gay Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate . Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken out against two new laws in Indiana and Arkansas which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on 'religious liberty'. Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways. He added that, as a Baptist, he supports religious freedom, but said: 'I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.' Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He wrote: 'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. 'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation. 'These bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.' He also addressed legislation in Texas that 'would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.' He said such bills 'rationalize injustice' by 'pretending to defend' religious freedom, which actually eroding the freedoms of others. Cook drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against. He says America's 'days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company. He added: 'Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.' Scroll down for video . Marching: Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to hold a rally against the new law, which forbids the government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs . As well as opposing the Indiana law, in a tweet he called for Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto a similar bill, HB1228, which has passed through the senate and is waiting to be rubber-stamped by the Republican. HB1228 is also named the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and uses the same wording as the Indiana legislation. The Indiana bill forbids the state or local government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs unless that burden is 'essential' to further a 'compelling' government interest, and is the 'least restrictive' means of achieving that aim. It allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them, and if the court rules in their favor, allows reparations, including compensation payouts. Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest. It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony. Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993. But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue . It will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes 'substantial', but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it, mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate. Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, with musician Miley Cyrus, and actors Ashton Kutcher, James Van Der Beek and George Takei all speaking out against it. The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination. Hillary Clinton also messaged to her three million Twitter followers saying that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love' following the bill's passing on Thursday. Businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation, threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest. Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement. Salesforce.com founder and CEO Marc Benioff also announced on Twitter that he would no longer send employees or customers to Indiana. Proud: Cook said that, being born a Baptist, he supported religion, but added: 'I was never taught that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate' (Cook pictured centre at gay pride parade in San Francisco) Making a statement: Cook previously expressed opposition to the new laws in Indiana and Arkansas on his Twitter page . Cook's op-ed came after thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to rally against the law, waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as 'no hate in our state'. Since the law passed, Republican Senator Mike Pence has robustly defended it, saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against 'government overreach'. He also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law, which is due to take effect in July, telling This Week with George Stephanopoulos, that 'the law will stick.' Pence said there was a 'tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding' surrounding the legislation, forms of which are already enshrined in law in 20 other states. Pence told the Indy Star he will support legislation to 'clarify' the controversial law, and expects it to go before the General Assembly this week. While he did not discuss the wording of the new bill, he has previously said the intention of the law is to block government intervention in matters of conscience, rather than allowing people to discriminate against others.","Tim Cook, 54, condemned religious freedom law in Indiana and Arkansas .

"A 17-year-old who was kept in hospital and forced to have chemotherapy but is now in remission has revealed she has not been allowed to speak to her mom since beginning her treatment. Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but did not want to receive the recommended treatment. But in January a court decided that she must have the chemotherapy at Connecticut Children's Medical Center - she was not able to make the decision as she is not legally mature enough. Cassandra Fortin, a 17-year-old who was forced to have chemotherapy against her will is now in remission, according to sources close to her case (file photo) Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but did not want to receive the recommended treatment (file photo) Since then she has been kept in hospital for treatment. Cassandra spoke to NBC via Facebook chat from the hospital this week, . She had to submit a list of people  to officials with the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF), which has temporary custody of the teen who were allowed to visit her. 'The problem is I've given tons of names of people to be verified, [but] it just doesn't happen,' Cassandra wrote in an interview conducted via Facebook chat. 'I have not been allowed to see or talk to my mom since New Years, DCF is working on allowing visitation to start. 'My boyfriend has not been verified to come see me ... For the most part I don't get many visitors.' She told the news outlet that now the treatment is taking effect that the guard has been removed from her outside her door, but she is only allowed to visit the cafeteria if she's escorted by a nurse, patient care assistant or child-welfare official. She said that she missed fresh air, but she was trying to stay positive. Cassandra insisted that she never wanted to die and that she was prepared to try chemotherapy but only after exploring other 'alternative' methods first. On Sunday the Department of Children and Families Commissioner Joette Katz said in a statement released: 'We are very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. 'We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life .' Doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival, but without it there was a near-certainty of death within two years. Her mother Jackie Fortin said: 'She has always - even years ago - said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body' Cassandra underwent chemotherapy at the Connecticut Children's Medical Centre (pictured) Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. Several other states recognize the 'mature minor doctrine', but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition. She will have to wait until she turns 18 in September before she can make her own medical decisions. Cassandra was diagnosed in September and after initial surgery failed, she was given two rounds of chemotherapy. She then asked for treatment to be stopped and, in order to avoid further trips to hospital, ran away from home. Her mother Jackie Fortin supported her choice but the DCF claimed custody of the girl and took the case to court. 'It's a question of fundamental constitutional rights-- the right to have a say over what happens to your body-- and the right to say to the government 'you can't control what happens to my body,' Cassandra's mother's attorney, Michael S. Taylor, told Fox CT. Her mother told NBC Connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want 'poison' in her body. 'She has always—even years ago—said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body,' Ms Fortin explained. She was then returned to Connecticut Children's Medical Center to start chemotherapy. 'CCMC reported to the Department of Children and Families that I was not giving medical attention to my daughter,' said Ms Fortin. Writing for the Hartford Courant, Cassandra said: 'This experience has been a continuous nightmare. 'I want the right to make my medical decisions. 'It's disgusting that I'm fighting for a right that I and anyone in my situation should already have. 'This is my life and my body, not DCF's and not the state's. I am a human — I should be able to decide if I do or don't want chemotherapy. 'Whether I live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone's choice but mine.' She added: 'I believe there's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that I am willing to look for and explore. 'Not that it would cure the cancer but it may help it.'","Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, ordered to undergo chemotherapy .

"Sex workers are sharing photos of themselves on social media as they fight back against claims that most escorts are forced into the industry and lead lives of abuse. The hashtag #FacesOfProstitution started trending on Twitter  with sex workers from Australia and across the world using social media to share positive stories from their industry. It comes after Mamamia published a blog post from Christian group Exodus Cry last week that claimed the 1990 film Pretty Woman  lured women into the sex industry by 'leading them to believe that prostitution was glamorous and romantic'. Scroll down for video . Sydney sex worker Tilly Lawless started the hashtag #FacesOfProstitution on social media at the weekend by posting this photo to share positive stories from the industry . The blog post suggested 75 per cent of female sex workers had been raped, 95 per cent were physically abused and 68 per cent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. It also questioned how many sex workers had been deceived by Pretty Woman, the iconic movie that starred Julia Roberts as a warm-hearted prostitute and Richard Gere as a lonely millionaire businessman who fall in love. The post said the movie, which has regained prominence around the 25th anniversary of its release last week, deceived women into leading lives of 'abuse, trauma and slavery'. Sydney sex worker Tilly Lawless took to social media at the weekend to hit back at the article and #FacesOfProstitution quickly gained momentum. Carmen Sandiego, a touring escort, was among those to hit back at a blog post that claimed the 1990 film Pretty Woman lured women into the sex industry . Christian Vega, a sex worker from Tasmania, shared support for the hashtag saying he looked nothing like Julia Roberts - referencing the character she played in Pretty Woman . Lucie Bee, who has been in the industry for five years, says she wasn't forced into the industry, but admitted some were . 'Mamamia published an article that says that Julia Roberts' 'toothy smile is not the true face of prostitution' because all sex workers are drug addled victims,' she wrote alongside a photo of herself. 'There is no singular story or person to represent the varied and complex experiences of all sex workers, but here is one face of prostitution amongst a myriad.' Jackie Parker, a sex worker from Griffith in NSW, posted a photo of herself with a volunteer badge on Twitter saying: 'They make me prostitute and volunteer for aged care! This madness has to stop! Save me! She told news.com.au she had worked as an escort for 14 years and hadn't met anyone who was forced into the industry. 'The peple who are doing it tough make up a small percentage — that is not the norm for sex work in Australia,' she said. 'If you look at the faces of the women on the Twitter hashtag, we're all smiling. Implying we are victims is condescending and makes us feel like we don't have a voice. It makes me feel like I'm not living the right stereotype and it's really harmful.' Jackie Parker, a sex worker from Griffith in NSW, posted a photo of herself with a volunteer badge on Twitter saying: 'They make me prostitute and volunteer for aged care! This madness has to stop! Save me! Jane Green described the message behind the blog post as 'hate speech' as she shared the #FacesOfProstitution hashtag . Lucie Bee, who has been in the industry for five years, says she wasn't forced into the industry, but admitted some were. 'I chose to get started and I chose to continue. I worked in an establishment initially, an erotic massage parlour in Canberra, followed by nude modelling, porn and then escorting,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's probably weird for a lot of people to consider that there's a 'journey' that you can take in this industry, much the same as working your way through any industry or career, but I've had one.' 'There's a huge stigma against sex workers in Australia. Pop culture generally feeds them the image of the down trodden, broken woman in sex work, which I'm not saying isn't a situation for some, but it's certainly not the situation for all. 'The fact that #FacesOfProstitution is trending makes me so happy. It's this massive symbol of unity amongst the industry, sex workers are feeling like they have a chance to stand up and be represented.'

A film crew from the Spanish newspaper 20 Minutos filmed him receiving a serious phone call this morning . In a hastily-arranged press conference, he said: 'I profoundly regret this very sad accident. We are going to do all we can.' Meanwhile Spain's King and Queen abandoned a planned three-day visit to France after a brief meeting with French president Francois Hollande this morning. King Felipe VI and his wife Letizia had been due to begin a state visit to Paris today in a trip intended to strengthen links between the two countries. President Hollande welcomed the King and Queen to the Elysee Palace in Paris this morning, on what was due to be an occasion of celebration. During their visit, the Spanish royals were due to open an exhibition of the works of Spanish painter Diego Velazquez at the Grand Palais. They were then planning to go at the City Hall to open a garden in honour of Spanish fighters in the Second World War, before King Felipe was due to speak at the National Assembly. Instead, there was hushed mood when the meeting took place as both French and Spanish heads of state started to hear updates of what had happened in the Alps. King Felipe VI of Spain and his wife Letizia met France's President Hollande shortly after the crash emerged . The royal couple had been due to start a three-day state visit to Paris, but the trip was abandoned today . The King struggled to contain his emotion as news of the tragedy began to filter through to Paris . President Hollande said: 'We must feel grief, because this is a tragedy that happened on our soil. 'I want to make sure that there have been no other consequences as the accident happened in a very difficult area to access, and I do not know yet if there were houses nearby. I intend to find out if there were other consequences of the accident. 'We will know in the next few hours. In the meantime, we must show support.' He added: 'I will discuss the incident with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish King Felipe VI, who is visiting us today. As we wait, our first feeling should be one of solidarity.' Germanwings said it was thought that 63 of the passengers on board were Germans, while reports from Spain suggest that around 45 Spaniards may have been on the flight. It is believed two babies and 16 children from the same German school are also among the dead. In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: 'We still don't know much beyond the bare information on the flight, and there should be no speculation on the cause of the crash.' The King and Queen looked shaken, appearing just minutes after it emerged 45 Spaniards had been killed . President Hollande said: 'We must feel grief, because this is a tragedy that happened on our soil' The couple said they would be returning to Spain and plan to re-arrange the visit for another occasion . The Airbus A320, with 144 passengers and six crew on board was being operated by German low-fare airline Germanwings on a flight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf. Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said the aircraft began descending again shortly after it reached its cruising height, having taken off from Barcelona at about 10am local time. This descent lasted eight minutes, he told reporters in Cologne. Radar and air traffic control contact broke off at 10.53am. In Britain, David Cameron's official spokesman said the Prime Minister had been informed of the crash and 'would wish to express how his thoughts are very much with the families and friends of all of those aboard'. He added that the Foreign Office was making inquiries about whether any British nationals were on board, but had no information at this stage. He said UK air accident investigators would offer any assistance requested by French or German authorities. King Felipe was due to speak at the French National Assembly and open an art exhibition during the visit . France rolled out the red carpet for Felipe, who arrived in Paris for his first state visit since taking the throne .

"It's usually cats getting their backs scratched. But one paws-on feline from Bonita, California, decided to repay the favor with his own 'ultimate meow-ssage.' Banks the cat was filmed as he caressed a woman's back and shoulders. 'How does it feel?' a man asks as the therapy session takes place. 'Fantastic!' the woman exclaims with a grin on her face. To reach all the right spots, Banks hopped up on to a kitchen counter, with his customer stood in front. He then proceeded to paw-rub away. The animal was previously listed for adoption by the San Diego Department of Animal Services. However, he now appears to have gone to a good home.

"With a perfect blend of plump fruit and  spices they are the sophisticated treat of the British Easter - just as delicious as chocolate eggs, but  a little more grown up. And one bakery is set to make more than 40 million hot cross buns in the run up to the holiday - enough to stretch 372 miles from Sheffield to Nazareth in Israel if placed end-to-end. Gunstones Bakery, which produces one third of the nation's hot cross buns, said the run-up to Easter is the busiest week of the year. A staggering 30  tonnes of flour and 20 tonnes of fruit will be used by the Sheffield bakery to produce a quarter of a million buns every day - which are then sold by M&S. Gunstones Bakery in Sheffield (pictures) produces one third of the nation's hot cross buns for M&S . It has been forced to open a new multi-million pound production line just to cope with the huge increase in demand for the seasonal treat . Gunstones has even been forced to open a new multi-million pound production line just to cope with the huge increase in demand. Bakery Production Manager, Richard Johnson, said: 'This year we're making the biggest range ever for M&S, new flavoured buns include berries and cherries, golden syrup and ginger, Bramley apple, a healthy option, and, for the chocoholics, we now make a chocolate hot cross bun - that's my personal favourite! 'If all of our Easter hot cross buns were laid end-to-end, they'd stretch from our bakery near Sheffield to Nazereth. 'This is the busiest week of the year at Gunstones, with buns making their way through giant ovens, proving machines and then making their way along a labyrinth of conveyor belts that crisscross the whole bakery.

A staggering 30 tonnes of flour and 20 tonnes of fruit will be used by the bakery to produce a quarter of a million buns every day . Traditionally eaten on Good Friday – with noon marking the end of Lent – the sweet buns mark the arrival of the long Easter weekend . 'At one end of the new production area a giant device resembling a helter-skelter, brings hot cross buns from a conveyor belt near the ceiling, spiralling down sixteen tiers where they are cooled by giant fans before reaching the packaging area below.' Traditionally eaten on Good Friday – with noon marking the end of Lent – the sweet buns mark the arrival of the long Easter weekend. They are said to date back to the 12th Century but were first mentioned in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1733.

"More than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail, including jihadist Choukri Ellekhlifi who fled to Syria while on bail for a spate of violent muggings in London . More than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail, damning figures have revealed. In the last three years, 13 suspects allowed to walk free for other offences were arrested for breaching anti-terror laws. The figures, obtained by MailOnline, also show the shocking scale of offences committed by suspects on bail, with one crime every five minutes. It is likely that the 13 terrorists were allowed to walk free after committing minor crimes before then being caught endangering national security, legal experts say. The staggering figures, released by the Ministry of Justice under Freedom of Information laws, show that nearly 350,000 offences were committed on bail in the last three years. This equates to one offence every five minutes - sparking yet more fears about the state of Britain's justice system. The statistics raise further questions over the monitoring of terror suspects, such as  jihadist Choukri Ellekhlifi, who fled to Syria in 2012 while he was on bail for a spate of violent muggings in London. Ellekhlifi, 22, threatened victims with a Taser-style high-voltage stun gun and forced them to hand over valuables including designer watches and mobile phones, but fled the country before he could face trial. He is believed to have been two years below Mohammed Emwazi - revealed last week to be Jihadi John - at Quintin Kynaston school in north west London and was killed in 2013 near the city of Aleppo. Emwazi was himself on a terror watch list when he travelled to Syria and the Government has admitted that hundreds of ISIS extremists 'slipped through the net' and were not properly monitored by the security services. The figures also make for a chilling comparison to Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, who was on bail in Australia when he took 17 hostages captive in a cafe before killing two. Tory MP Nick de Bois, a member of the Commons Justice Committee, said: 'Any hint that someone may be involved in terrorism and who is facing criminal charges must be remanded in prison - no ifs no buts. 'We have to accept that bail conditions are not tough enough, leaving those with criminal intent to wander our streets. 'If courts are not going to remand defendants in jail then we should at least place them under 24-hour house arrest using electronic tagging to keep them at home rather than free to commit crime.' Ellekhlifi (right) was killed near Aleppo in 2013 alongside Mohammed el-Araj, from west London (left) Magistrates have been under mounting pressure in recent years to remand fewer suspects into custody to ease the burden on over-stretched prisons. Joseph Kotrie-Monson, criminal defence lawyer at Mary Monson Solicitors, said: 'People who have gone on to commit terror offences while on bail would not have been on bail for terror offences or anything in the same category of seriousness. 'If there was any clue to the court granting bail that there was a risk of something of this nature, bail would not have been granted. 'There's a presumption that bail must be sought in all cases except the most serious. The idea of someone having their liberty taken away on suspicion of a minor offence is seen as unconstitutional.' David Green, director of the think-tank Civitas, said: 'The impression the Government is giving is that they are trying to save money by reducing the prison population by giving bail. 'There are many reasons for not giving bail, but often they are very simply ignored by the courts. 'Magistrates, who are possibly under pressure to keep the prison population down, are endangering public safety for the sake of a few pounds.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We have already changed the law to allow prosecutors to challenge a Crown Court bail decision where they feel a potentially dangerous prisoner could be bailed. 'The overwhelming majority of people bailed do not re-offend and they are often given strict conditions such as tags and curfews.' Jane Clough was murdered by her ex-boyfriend Jonathan Vass while he was on bail for raping her . The shock terror figures come just weeks after it was revealed that one in nine victims of murder or manslaughter were killed by someone on bail. John Clough, the father of 26-year-old Jane Clough who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend Jonathan Vass while he was on bail for raping her, said the sheer scale of offences showed change was needed. Mr Clough, who runs the Justice for Jane campaign, said: 'Victims' rights of safety should come ahead of suspects' liberties. 'I don't think the courts take bail seriously enough. Judges should be held accountable and there should be consequences for poor decisions.' In just one year, there were 57 unlawful killings – more than one a week – by suspects allowed to walk free while awaiting trial for other crimes. Offenders on bail also committed an average of two rapes a week and a sex assault on a child almost every two days. In one case a girl of 16 was raped by a pervert who was on bail following an attack on another teenager. Critics said the figures proved that too many dangerous criminals were being released until their trial date – despite the risk to the community. Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘These shocking figures indicate how important it is that our judges remember that before granting a suspect bail they consider the risk posed to the general public, including children. This is a truly terrible toll.’ There were 125 rapes by those on bail from June 2011 to June 2012, with this figure falling to 101 and 81 in the two following years. The number of sex offences against children by those on bail stands at 134 in the last year the MoJ could provide figures for, falling from 182 three years ago. Meanwhile more than 22,000 violent crimes were committed on bail in the last three years. The figures include the appalling case of Patrick Sallabank, a jobless misfit, who was out on bail for the alleged rape of a girl of 16 when he raped a second teenager in October 2013. He was handed an 18-year jail sentence at Hull Crown Court last February.","More than a dozen offenders committed terrorism while they were on bail .

Spot the difference: Jesse Nagy, 26, from Detroit has scored a burgeoning fan base after slipping into a princess gown for his young niece Izzy . Nagy said that his four-year-old niece Izzy was nervous to wear her princess gown in public so he decided to put her at ease by wearing a matching outfit. He apparently borrowed a prom dress from a similar-sized friend for the evening. The duo then ventured out together to a movie theater in Florence, Alabama, garnering a range of confused looks from passers-by. An employee at the cinema even shared a photo of Nagy and Izzy on Reddit where it received more than one million views.

One fan wrote: 'From a mom that has a son your age . . . it warms my heart what you did.' Another joked:  'Welcome to being the most wanted man in America.' Nagy told ABC News he will continue taking Izzy out on their special dates even if it involves dressing up. 'If it’s going to make her happy, I'll do it, I don’t care.' He added that the princess dressing stunt  got him more publicity in three hours than his five years of professional acting put together.","Jesse Nagy said that his four-year-old niece Izzy was nervous to wear her princess gown in public so he decided to wear a matching outfit .

"An 'outstanding' hospital doctor has been jailed for six months after he supplied meow meow and date-rape drugs to a university polo club president who  choked to death on a sock after a night out. Dr James Morgan, 29, gave the cocktail of drugs to trained huntsman James Steen, after inviting him and two other friends back to his home in Rugby, Warwickshire, at the end of the night. The doctor, who had only met Mr Steen that night, gave the 23-year-old media student class B drug Mephedrone and class C drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), one of the most common date-rape drugs. Jailed: Dr James Morgan, 29 (left), from Rugby, Warwickshire, has been jailed for six months for supplying date-rape drugs and meow meow to 23-year-old James Steen (right), who died after choking on a sock . 'Talented': The trained huntsman (pictured), who was President of the Polo Society at Newcastle University, had gone back to Morgan's house following a night out with him and two other friends . But the court heard how the student, from Poyntzpass, near Newry, Northern Ireland, had a fetish for sniffing socks and later suffocated to death after partially swallowing one. Jailing him at Warkwick Crown Court, a judge told Morgan that his career had been left in tatters for committing the 'terrible dereliction of duty'. Judge Sylvia de Bertodano added that, as a doctor, Morgan should have lived up to his 'position of authority'  - and known more than anyone that drugs 'ruin lives'. She said: 'It's tragic cases like this which reinforce the message courts send out when they sentence for the supply of drugs, that drugs of whatever class ruin lives. 'You, better than anyone, should know that. You are not only a doctor, you are an outstanding one. So as well as taking James's life, you have ruined your own life. Your career, which you worked so hard to build, is in jeopardy.' She added: 'As a doctor, even in a social context, you were in a position of authority. He had taken a great deal more of the class C drug than any of the other three of you. 'Allowing that to happen was a terrible dereliction of your duty. 'The message has to go out that if someone, in particular a doctor, supplies a non-drug-user with illegal drugs and they die as a result, they must go to prison.' Tragic: Judge Sylvia de Bertodano said Mr Steen's 'tragic' death sent out the message that 'drugs or whatever class ruin lives'. She also offered her sympathies to Mr Steen's family, saying: 'You are going to have to work very hard to rebuild your life - but that is something James Steen will never be able to do. 'James Steen was a young man on the very threshold of life. He had everything to live for. Nothing you can do, and I can do today can reconcile his family to their loss.' Morgan, who worked as registrar at Coventry's University Hospital, met Mr Steen through his partner Simon Chapman and his friend John Deptford. Mr Deptford, who played for Northampton Outlaws Rugby Club, had befriended Mr Steen online and stayed with him when he visited Newcastle. 'Threshold of life': She added that Morgan had committed a 'terrible dereliction of duty' by allowing Mr Steen (pictured) to take drugs, despite him being a doctor 'in a position of authority' Promising: The student (left and right), from Poyntzpass, near Newry, Northern Ireland, was a keen skier and was studying media, communications and cultural studies at Newcastle University . The student, who was a keen skier, lived in Newcastle while studying media, communications and cultural studies at the university. The court heard Mr Steen had travelled to Rugby for a meal with Mr Deptford, Mr Chapman and Morgan. The four men went to the Steam Turbine pub in the town and had a meal before moving on to another pub. Prosecutor Lal Amarasinghe told the court they all went back to Morgan's Victorian terraced home, where he got a bottle of 'poppers' which was passed round to sniff. He said: 'Mr Deptford, who had been quite drunk, could not recall anything else until waking up and realising he and the other three were all naked and Mr Steen was lying on the floor. 'Everything to live for': The night before his death he travelled down to Rugby for a meal with Mr Deptford - who had befriended Steen online - Mr Chapman and Morgan. The four men later went back to Morgan's home . 'Realising something was wrong, he pinched him to try to get a reaction, but without any response, and immediately called to Morgan who examined the student. 'An ambulance was called, and as they waited they tried to resuscitate Mr Steen but realised his airway was blocked. 'Mr Deptford, who knew Mr Steen had a fetish for sniffing socks and putting them in his mouth, found he had a sock blocking his throat, and pulled it out. Paramedics then arrived, but Mr Steen was already beyond help.' Morgan was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder. That was later reduced to supplying drugs. The court heard how police found traces of Mephedrone, a synthetic stimulant, on a chopping board and a bottle which had contained GBL, which can be an anaesthetic and hypnotic agent, in the property. In large amounts it can cause respiratory failure. Spirit: After his death, Mr Steen's parents said their son had been a 'kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a generous spirit' The court heard Mr Steen died of respiratory failure as a result of a blockage of his airway, although the drugs were said to be a ‘direct contributor’ to that. Christopher Millington QC, defending, said: 'This was a talented student, and the consequence of his death has caused terrible grief to his family. 'This case is tragic in many ways. At the heart of it is the death of a talented student, and in the dock to face the consequences is a gifted doctor. 'The case is complicated by this fact: as we understand it, the cause of death was asphyxiation. 'What the deceased had done was put a sock in his mouth which, according to Mr Deptford, he had partially swallowed. Nobody knew it was there until after his death. Probe: After an ambulance was called to his home, Morgan was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder. Pictured: Police guarding the property in Rugby following Mr Steen's death . Forensics: Police found traces of Mephedrone on a chopping board and a bottle which had contained GBL. Pictured: Forensic teams gathering evidence in the wake of Mr Steen's death . 'The role the drug played is that it increased the risk of asphyxiation. It was not the direct cause of death.' He added that the consequences of jailing Morgan would be to deprive the public 'of the services of a gifted doctor.' He said there was a 'stand-out reference' from Dr Belinda Stanley, a member of the GMC's disciplinary tribunal, who described Morgan as 'among the best she has ever worked with.' Mr Millington added: 'The sad fact is that having devoted so many years of his life to becoming a doctor, he has put his career in jeopardy because of the irresponsibility he displayed during that social gathering. 'That is something he will have to live with, together with the guilt and feeling of responsibility over the death of the deceased.' After Mr Steen's death, his family described the young man as 'kind, caring and very talented'. In a statement released through police, they said: 'James enriched our lives, and the lives of others, in so many ways. 'He was a kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a generous spirit. He touched everyone he met with his positivity and his sense of humour. 'We are devastated by James' untimely death, but we are comforted by knowing how much he was loved and admired by his family, friends and university colleagues. 'We are immensely proud of our son, and all he achieved and the significant mark he made during his brief time on this earth.'","Dr James Morgan gave cocktail of drugs to trained huntsman James Steen .

Ten's website continues to promote the series, saying: 'The elite taskforce is responsible for policing everything from bikie gangs and street violence to drug heists and organised crime.' 'Led by Superintendent Jim Keogh, the unit offers the community a permanent police presence on the Gold Coast.' 'Superintendent Jim Keogh said: ""Officers are committed to restoring public confidence by focusing on public disorder and street violence through high visibility policing. 'Officers will respond to incidents requiring a priority response. Should the matter involve a protracted investigation, specialist units will be utilised as necessary,' he said. The second series, narrated by actor Samuel Johnson, returns to screens on Tuesday night (from 7.30pm) which much of the content derived from the December and January holiday periods on the Gold Coast. Since it was first formed in September of 2013, Jim Keogh has overseen the task-force, growing from a team of  50 to double that size with the majority of whom were hand-picked by him. A former member says it is not right to call then 'the elite' One of the stars of the Gold Coast Cops show on Network Ten, Senior Constable Kristee ""K Rock' La Rocca . The problem for the RAP squad, which was set up to tackle the state's tougher anti-bikie laws, is that members of the new government front-bench have openly criticised the decision by the the previous Newman Government to allow unfettered access to the unit by Ten cameras. Privately, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is also believed to have concerns about the team and the vision made available by the crack police squad on the Gold Coast. What is abundantly clear though, is the displeasure of rank and file, who have labelled their colleagues 'show-boaters'. Leading to further speculation it will be shut down is that RAP Commander, Superintendent Jim Keogh, is due to return to duties in Brisbane. It's believed the squad members will now be absorbed back into the general police population and the 3-year lease on the high-tech set-up at Varsity Lakes allowed to run out. The RAP crew is not particularly well liked in their home state because of the hype and publicity they have been receiving, since the show first went to air. One colleague, who also works the Surfers Paradise beat, told Daily Mail Australia: 'What they are doing and have done is not widely respected, they're glorified actors and this is a serious business. Two of the stars of the show, Supt Jim Keogh and Sgt Carla Sara, who is affectionately known as the 'Pocket Rocket'. She moved from Bondi to the Gold Coast and is now a team leader . 'What's worse is they are not the sole reason things are getting cleaned up on the coast, it's the rank and file, to be honest. 'They think they are the best or toughest or something but they're pretty ineffective, despite what the Super might say and the figures they quote.' And a former member of the RAP team actually agrees with the criticism. 'The promotion of it was the problem because in the first couple of episodes they called the team the elite, and I think they still do, so I can understand why some of the others got their noses out of joint,' one source said. 'To term it ""elite"" when it wasn't right made it them against us sort of feeling, they should never have used elite. 'They were mostly just young kids that after their first year, got a station for three years and the bosses went through and picked the ones they thought were good workers. 'Yes, there was that sort of picking and choosing, but not elite.' The crew, hand-picked by Supt Keogh, has been run out of a new technology hub on the Gold Coast. A current member of the RAP team dismissed claims they were ineffective. 'Mate, I have been bombarded by everyone wanting to know why are being disbanded and I have no idea,' he said. 'People have asked why would they do this when the Gold Coast is as clean and safe as it has ever been. 'It looks like we are on borrowed time, I don't know why.' And the numbers back up those claims. Almost 4500 arrests have been made since its inception in 2013, on the back of more than 400 raids. Daily Mail Australia understands all members of the team will be placed under the control of the Gold Coast Police District, when Inspector Shane Holmes, like Keogh, is also expected to return to Brisbane. 'It's a good squad, we were formed to clean up the streets of the Gold Coast and we have but there are political games at play.' Even the production company has not committed to a third season. The Palaszczuk Government, for its part, denies it has anything to do with decisions about the future of RAP. Inspector Shane Holmes (left) is the Operations Co-ordinator for the Rapid Action Patrol Group, while Constable Daniel Lees (right) has been quote in promos as saying 'the main thing I don’t like about bikies is they’re bullies. And I’ve never liked bullies' Minister for Police, Fire & Emergency Services, Jo-Ann Miller did not exactly give the group a ringing endorsement when asked if it would be disbanded. 'The Palaszczuk Government supports Gold Coast police 100 per cent in their effort to keep the community safe,' she said. 'The Rapid Action and Patrol Group is not being dismantled by this government. I don’t have a view about where individual officers should be based. 'That is, rightly, a matter solely for the Commissioner,' she said. Daily Mail Australia is still awaiting an official response from Queensland Police. However, an email sent to members of the RAP group has been obtained by Daily Mail Australia, which attempted to hose down the speculation. 'I am aware that there has been considerable discussion about the future of the group, I have had lengthy discussions (with senior officials) who insist there will be no deviation from the current plan.'","Doubts about the future of Network Ten's much-hyped Gold Coast Cops show as the crack police squad faces the axe .

"Viewers deserted the BBC in their millions and complained in their thousands after replacing Top Gear with a documentary about the Red Arrows. The BBC cancelled last night's show and replaced it with the flying programme which pulled in just one million viewers -  a fraction of the five million normally attracted to the popular motoring show. Red Arrows: Inside The Bubble was first broadcast last year and its repeat attracted just 6 per cent of viewers. Show presenter Jeremy Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last week after allegedly shouting at Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon. One report claims he split his junior colleague's lip with a punch. Clarkson was seen leaving his west London home today shortly before 2pm but simply told waiting reporters that he was 'off for lunch with a friend.' The presenter was later seen walking side-by-side with an unnamed woman. Scroll down for video . Viewers have deserted the BBC in their millions after its decision to postpone the remaining episodes of Top Gear sparking thousands of complaints and suspend Jeremy Clarkson. He is pictured outside his London home today . The presenter told waiting reporters that he was off to have 'lunch with a friend' as he left his home . Clarkson, 54, will this week be questioned by the BBC's official inquiry into the row over a steak dinner that resulted in his suspension . The presenter was later seen walking side-by-side through London with an unnamed woman (pictured) As he prepares for a quizzing which could result in him being sacked, he is apparently being supported by a woman once rumoured to be his mistress. Blonde events organiser Phillipa Sage was photographed driving away from his flat in Holland Park, west London, yesterday afternoon, and returned a few hours later. Clarkson was accused of having an affair with her in 2011, and was pictured kissing her on holiday in Greece in 2013. He has recently split from his wife of 21 years, Frances. The corporation has refused to say how many viewers have contacted it about its decision to suspend Clarkson and postpone the remaining episodes but it is believed to be in the thousands. Communications watchdog Ofcom said it had received more than 100 complaints, with a spokesman saying it will take no action as it 'can only assess a breach of the broadcasting code if a show has actually aired'. The BBC's inquiry into Clarkson's Top Gear 'fracas' has started - less than a week since it announced the presenter was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisiin Tymon after filming for the show during a row over a hot meal at a hotel. Ken MacQuarrie, the senior BBC executive tasked with sorting out what is becoming an increasing embarrassment for the corporation, is believed to be in London and starting work. But sources close to the investigation say it is impossible to put a deadline on its work until it hears from the two men central to the inquiry - Clarkson and Tymon. A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC's position is the one we set out in a statement last week. We have an investigation led by Ken MacQuarrie to establish the facts and people should wait for the outcome of that.' Clarkson is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected early this week. All three men's contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs, which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant. Around 30,000 tickets ranging from between £38 to £104 have already been sold, and Clarkson fans have been desperate to know whether he will be appearing. The 54-year-old, driving a black Mercedes AMG, was asked by reporters if he was on his way to meet with BBC bosses. But the presenter, wearing a brown blazer and white shirt, said: 'I'm going for lunch with a friend' A relaxed Clarkson said nothing about his upcoming disciplinary hearing as he left his flat in west London today . Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Ms Sage in 2011 and is apparently being supported by the woman once rumoured to be his mistress . The controversial presenter has appeared at every Top Gear Live event the BBC has run, while co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond only appear at some shows. BBC worldwide said all forthcoming shows are set to run as scheduled - but would not be drawn on whether Clarkson would definitely appear. The controversy took a further twist this weekend when victims of Jimmy Savile denounced comparisons of the support shown to Clarkson to the widespread protection offered to the dead paedophile presenter as 'upsetting' and 'totally offensive'. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last week after allegedly shouting at Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) A senior figure at the BBC was reported as suggesting Clarkson is able to behave as he wishes because of his celebrated position and support from powerful friends, including Prime Minister David Cameron. The Mail On Sunday revealed the BBC chief compared the support for Clarkson to the way sex offender Savile was defended. The reported comments drew a furious response from victims of the former Radio 1 DJ. Liz Dux, a lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which is representing 169 of Savile's alleged victims, said such comparisons upset victims. She said: 'Many of Savile's victims find a direct parallel between these issues to be upsetting and highly inappropriate. 'One victim said that while both have celebrity status, to suggest other similarities is totally offensive. 'Nevertheless, they want the lessons from Savile learned, whereby fame and celebrity must never be an excuse to overlook wrongdoing.' The BBC boss also added it was 'common knowledge' that Clarkson has 'personal issues', saying they would advise him to take one of two courses of action - 'to try to play it down - or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change'. A friend of Clarkson said the presenter had called BBC bosses to apologise over the fracas in an attempt to draw a line under the matter. Writing in the Sunday Times, AA Gill said the investigation into the row was 'preposterous and ponderous', and praised him as hard-working. A lawyer for Mr Tymon said his client 'intends to await the outcome of the BBC investigation and will make no comment until that investigation is complete'.","Popular motoring show regularly commands a five million strong audience .

"We've all been there. Faced with Netflix or the gym, we reach for the remote while promising to work out tomorrow. But what if we could see what the impact of our actions today would have on the future? That's what one London-based company is hoping to find out with its concept Apple Watch face, Life Clock, which counts down the minutes to your death. Rehabstudio's design, which has been created with the Apple Watch in mind, adds time to your life for healthful activity and subtracts time when you give in to bad habits . The user’s Apple HealthKit data is taken into the phone app, which then converts the user’s activities into time. This is then displayed on the Apple Watch. The app can then make recommendations that can improve the user’s health and help them live longer, whether it be eating better, exercising or seeing friends and loved ones. The goal of the app is simple: to Make Life Better. The app combines different data sets to recommend healthy lifestyle choices. Rehabstudio's design, which has been created with the Apple Watch in mind, adds time to your life for healthful activity and subtracts time when you give in to bad habits. The idea came to Rehabstudio owner Tom Le Bree following the announcement for the Apple Watch. 'We saw an opportunity,' Le Bree told Wired. 'We thought, 'OK, if time is really a human construct, how can we play with it?'' While Apple says there will be nine official faces available when the watch launches next month, none are unusual in the way their approach time. Le Bree started thinking about a concept called temporal discounting which is the idea that you can discount the future in favour of the present. 'Tomorrow, I'm the guy that goes to the gym, quits smoking, and stops eating fatty foods. But today I'm going to have one last cigarette,' Le Bree says. The app works by linking up with a user’s Apple HealthKit data, which then converts the user’s activities into time. This is then displayed on the Apple Watch. It can then make recommendations that can improve the user’s health and help them live longer, whether it be eating better, exercising or seeing friends and loved ones. Apple hasn't yet said if it will allow owners to use third party faces with the watch.In the meantime, Rehabstudio plans to continue working on the project. It is also considering creating a version for Android Wear. Pictured is Apple CEO Tim Cook talking about the Apple Watch Edition . For instance, if you only got five hours sleep, Life Clock subtracts 26 minutes and recommends you sleep sleep the recommended eight hours a night. While he admits the science isn't accurate, Le Bree said that by reminding us of the future, Apple Watch could help make healthier decisions. Apple Watch was revealed last week and comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all models are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. This isn't the first time that someone has come up with the concept of a watch that counts down to your death. Last year, a Swedish inventor unveiled a watch that apparently calculates a person's life expectancy - and even counts down to the time they will die. Dubbed the 'death watch', Tikker was created by Fredrik Colting. But far from being morbid, Mr Colting calls it 'The Happiness Watch' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left. To set up Tikker, the wearer fills out a questionnaire by entering information about their medical history, including allergies or illnesses. They are also asked whether they drink or smoke and if there are any instances of cancer, diabetes and other diseases in their family. Wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do, as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score. Their age is deducted from the results to predict a death date and the Tikker - which also works as a regular watch - begins the countdown. rowdfunding campaign, the gadget is available to buy online £49.99 ($70). Connecting to the iPhone, the Apple Watch is designed as a wrist device for messaging and calls and for a variety of health tracking applications. 'With the built in speaker and microphone you can receive calls on your watch. I have been wanting to do this since I was five years old,' Cook said. The watch is also integrated with Apple Pay's mobile wallet, and can be used to view pictures and monitor news, and also connect to social media. It can use other apps ranging from Uber ride-sharing to music to home automation. Apple, however, hasn't yet said if it will allow owners to use third party faces with the watch. In the meantime, Rehabstudio plans to continue working on the project and may create a version for Android Wear.","The concept face has been created by London-based Rehabstudio .

"A serving Ferguson police officer revealed that he broke down in tears after he read the Department of Justice report which condemned his force and said: ‘I just close my eyes and wish it wasn’t like that’. The officer said that his colleagues were ‘good cops’ and that they were ‘hurting’ just like the rest of the community. In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Online he said they were all standing behind embattled Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson but were fearful they would lose their jobs if the department was shut down. He said: ‘People who don’t know me see me and then they hate me. That’s not fair....I’m not going to hate people because they are venting. ‘It’s tough but I still have to get to work. ‘I have to take it because they are venting and we have to let them vent, but I will protect this city, I will protect Ferguson’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Condemned: A Justice Department report accused Ferguson police of disproportionately targeting black people. But a serving officer from the force said: 'We are not bad cops.' Concern: Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder focused the report on relations between police and citizens . Central figures: The shooting of Michael Brown (left) by Officer Darren Wilson (right) in August created a firestorm over policing in Ferguson and beyond. Totemic: The image of Officer Darren Wilson standing beside the body of Michael Brown became central to the controversy which surrounded the case . The officer spoke out as the family of Michael Brown said they would file a wrongful death lawsuit over their son’s death. The 18-year-old was shot dead by former Ferguson officer Darren Wilson last August in a killing which sparked widespread looting across the city. The landmark Department of Justice report that was commissioned as a result painted a devastating portrait of a police force which unfairly targeted blacks for traffic stops and arrests. One Ferguson city employee has been fired and two are under investigation but Wilson did not face charges. Critics however have called for the entire Ferguson police force to be disbanded and shut down. As he released the report Attorney General Eric Holder said that the conclusions were 'searing'. He said that in Ferguson a 'deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and residents'. He said Ferguson was: 'A community where this harm frequently appears to stem, at least in part, from racial bias – both implicit and explicit. And a community where all of these conditions, unlawful practices, and constitutional violations have not only severely undermined the public trust, eroded police legitimacy, and made local residents less safe – but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under assault and under siege by those charged to serve and protect them' If Brown's family win their civil lawsuit they could get a payout or the city of Ferguson could reach a settlement before it goes to trial. Wrong gesture: A protester makes the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture which became the hallmark of the protests. But the official report said that Michael Brown did not use the words or the gesture. Violence: The decision of the grand jury not to indict Darren Wilson was followed by rioting, arson and looting . However another finding of the Department of Justice report was the Brown did not have his hands up when Wilson shot him, a finding which Holder confirmed. 'Hands up, don't shoot' became the mantra of the protest movement after some witnesses said that they saw Brown with his arms raised. Speaking to Daily Mail Online, the Ferguson police officer said the report misrepresented not just the force, but the city. 'The report is hard to read, but that’s not me,' he said. ‘I am good with the people, the community. We have good officers. Do they write more tickets than some people? Maybe. But they are good officers. ‘This hurts, it really does. When you read it, you read it as a city as a whole. You read it like everybody is like that, but not everybody is like that.’ The statistics in the report are scathing: whilst Ferguson is 67 per cent black, just three of the 53 officers on their police force are non-white, or six per cent. Unending protest: Demonstrators marched on the headquarters of Pine Lawn police in Missouri, close to Ferguson. It has also been criticized over its conduct. Suing: Michael Brown's parents - Lesley McSpadden, his mother and Michael Brown Snr, his father, are set to take their son's death to court in a wrongful death suit . Defended: The officer defending his colleagues -  one of whom is pictured above during the protests in the aftermath of the decision not to charge Michael Brown - said: 'We are good cops.' The 67 per cent of African Americans in Ferguson account for 93 per cent of arrests made from 2012-2014. African-American drivers were two times as likely as whites to be searched during traffic stops but 26 per cent less likely to be found in possession of drugs. Among the most shocking revelations from the report were racist emails sent by Ferguson city officials in which they made jokes about president Obama. One questioned his suitability for the job because ‘what black man holds a steady job for four years’. When asked about the emails, the officer said he was ‘stunned’ to read them but that he had not received any such messages himself in the past. Another issue raised in the report was how black residents were disproportionately targeted for traffic tickets which contributes to the expected court revenue of $2.4 million this year. According to the report residents are seen ‘less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue,’ The officer said: ‘There are guys who write a lot of tickets, yeah, but I don’t think it was any different from other departments.

He tells them to move to the sidewalk . 12.01-12.04pm Wilson has given conflicting accounts of the events leading up to him shooting Brown dead. Initially he claimed not to have heard the convenience store robbery call or the description of Brown and Johnson put out following it. Later he claimed to have doubled back on the youths having realized they fitted the description . 4.00pm Brown’s body remains on the street for nearly four hours while hundreds gather to protest the shooting .

Eric Holder publishes report of investigation into policing in Ferguson and the details of the Michael Brown case which he had ordered under civil rights legislation. ‘Look at Pine Lawn which is bringing in $1.6 million - is there a problem there?’ The actual figure is $1.8 million - as of June 2013 the Pine Lawn Municipal Court had issued 23,457 arrest warrants, or 7.3 per resident, the Washington Post has reported. The officer said that in the wake of the report the mood on the street had been hostile. He said: ‘When we get to some of these calls people are yelling profanities...they are filming us and that didn’t happen before. He added: ‘The biggest thing that hurts is how the community feels, what are they feeling. That’s very important to me. ‘Sometimes I just sit there and cry. ‘We need to open a dialogue with people. ‘Officers need to go on diversity courses. What I would like to see is that that the community sits with us. ‘Instead of yelling at us we need to start from the beginning and work our way up. We need to bridge the gap. We need to get back to community orientated policing. ‘The community need to know that if they call me I will protect them.’ The only public comment from Ferguson officials has been a brief statement from the city’s mayor James Knowles, who refused to answer questions. The officer however said that as far as the cops went, he had their backing. He said: ‘We have to stand by chief Jackson. He’s our chief. He’s our leader. I think everybody is standing behind him. 'He’s been there for us. The mayor too.’","Serving officer is first member of department to speak out after scathing report by Department of Justice investigators .

"Ed Miliband was branded the SNP's poodle yesterday – as Alex Salmond boasted he would install the Labour leader in No10. In a second pink champagne-fuelled interview in consecutive days, the former SNP leader pledged to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' if the election produces a hung parliament. Mr Salmond said the SNP would back Labour regardless of any formal deal, but said his party would make 'progressive amendments' to the Budget and other legislation – code for higher taxes and Left-wing policies. The Prime Minister seized on the comments in the Commons, describing Mr Miliband as 'Alex Salmond's poodle'. Scroll down for video . Controversial: In a 'champagne-fuelled interview', former SNP leader Alex Salmond (pictured) pledged to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' if the election produces a hung parliament . Lap dog: Prime Minister David Cameron seized on the comments in the Commons, describing Labour Leader Ed Miliband (pictured) as 'Alex Salmond's poodle' 'As far as I can see, Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note,' he said. 'And the ransom note is very clear. It says higher borrowing, uncontrolled immigration, unfettered welfare, higher taxes and weaker defence. 'That's what is being demanded and the British people have only one way of saying no to this appalling hostage situation – and that is to vote Conservative on May 7.' Mr Salmond's latest intervention also appeared to irritate the SNP's new leader Nicola Sturgeon. As her predecessor stole her limelight again, Scotland's First Minister attempted to stamp her authority on the party, insisting: 'I'm the leader of the SNP.' In an interview with the Spectator magazine – during which he guzzled pink champagne for a second consecutive day – Mr Salmond said his MPs would vote to kick out the Tories whether they secure concessions from Labour or not. 'The SNP approach to a Cameron minority government will be to bring it down,' he said. In an interview with the New Statesman the previous day, Mr Salmond again ordered a bottle of pink champagne, ostensibly to celebrate the publication of his book on last year's referendum campaign. On the offensive: Mr Cameron said: 'As far as I can see, Alex Salmond has taken the entire Labour Party hostage and today we have got the ransom note' Not amused: Mr Salmond's latest interview also appeared to irritate the SNP's new leader Nicola Sturgeon (left), who declared 'I'm the leader of the SNP' in a bid to reassert her authority . Mr Salmond, who also revealed that he 'identifies' with Nelson Mandela, said the SNP would join forces with Labour to vote down any Queen's Speech put forward by a minority Conservative government. The SNP is riding high in the polls and experts predict the party could win as many as 50 of Scotland's 59 seats, making it potentially the third biggest party at Westminster. Labour will 'redistribute' hundreds of millions of pounds from England to Scotland if it wins the election, the party's leader north of the border boasted yesterday. Jim Murphy pledged in a speech in the City of London to use money raided from the pensions of better-off workers in England to pay for a 'jobs guarantee' for young people in Scotland, and higher bursaries for Scottish students. Mr Murphy has already angered voters in England by boasting that he will use the proceeds of a mansion tax in the South East to pay for an extra 1,000 nurses in Scotland. A Scottish Labour source said that, unlike the SNP, it could promise to raise taxes in England and spend them in Scotland. 'This announcement means two of Scottish Labour's first three election pledges will be funded by money raised from the more prosperous parts of the UK.' Mr Salmond, who is expected to return to Westminster as an MP in May in the hope of being kingmaker, said the party that holds the balance of power 'holds the power'. The Conservatives are set to make the threat of a Labour/SNP government a major campaign issue in England. The party has already mocked up a poster showing a tiny Mr Miliband in Mr Salmond's pocket. And sources point out that the SNP has previously set out a string of ruinously high demands, including £180billion of extra borrowing, ditching Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent, increased immigration and billions more in benefits. Labour yesterday seized on Mr Salmond's admission that the SNP will back the party in government even if it cannot get a formal deal. Tom Harris, MP for Glasgow South, said Mr Salmond has 'dispensed with his last bargaining point'. 'They have nothing to offer us and they have no threats to make that are remotely realistic.' Labour's Scottish leader Jim Murphy described Mr Salmond as 'David Cameron's little helper'. In an interview with LBC radio, he conceded that the opinion polls are 'bloody awful for Labour'. A YouGov poll revealed that Miss Sturgeon is the most popular party leader. It gave her an approval rating of plus five. Mr Cameron was minus five, Mr Miliband minus 39 and Nick Clegg minus 47.","Salmond made comments during 'champagne-fuelled' Spectator interview .

Hundreds of sightseers also visited the dock hoping to catch a glimpse of the huge boat. Here civilians watch as it departs from Yokohama Base, south of Tokyo .

Japan's constitution, known as the Peace Constitution, is most famous for the renunciation of the right to wage war. It was drawn up under the Allied occupation which followed the Second World War and was intended to replace Japan's previous militaristic and absolute monarchy system with liberal democracy. Japan was responsible for drawing the U.S. into the war after it launched a surprise attack on the U.S naval base Pearl Harbor in 1941. The attack was intended as a preventive action to keep the U.S. from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia, which included overseas territories of the UK, Netherlands, and the United States. The conflict escalated massively when the U.S dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. This led to the surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945 and brought the hostilities of World War II to a close. Japan's constitution was enacted on May 3, 1947. Hiroshima was left devastated (pictured) after the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the city, ending the war and leading to the 'Peace Constitution'","Japan's navy has officially taken control of biggest warship the country has owned since the Second World War .

"A hiker has revealed the toll a 2,650-mile trek had on his body by snapping a selfie mile-by-mile. Andy Davidhazy, 47, from Texas, embarked on the mighty Pacific Crest Trail in 2013 and spent five-and-a-half months zigzagging his way from Mexico to Canada. During his journey he lost 50lbs as he walked his way through five pairs of shoes. His complexion also got all the more rugged as he experienced undulating temperatures, weather, and terrain. This week, after compiling all of his selfies together, he released time-lapse video of his expedition with the footage offering a fascinating glimpse into the grueling challenge he embraced. Scroll down for video .

Bearded man: His complexion also got all the more rugged as he experienced undulating temperatures, weather, and terrain . At the starting point Davidhazy appears slightly chubby-cheeked with his hair neatly cut. But as the miles go on, the stubble begins to grow and Davidhazy's face gets increasingly gaunter. At one point he appears with a full beard and in another shot he seems to have a touch of sunburn. The selfies also reveal several of Davidhazy's must-have items. In almost all of the images a water bottle appears attached to his rucksack strap. In hotter climates, the hat and sunglasses come out and in rainier climates an anorak comes into play. In some scenes other trekkers are seen lurking in the background but for the most-part Davidhazy appears alone. In a bid to keep his sanity, it appears Davidhazy listened to music as in several selfies headphones are seen plugged into his ears. Davidhazy said that he actually completed the Pacific Crest Trail in two stages as snow prevented him from doing it in one go. He stopped at mile 2,424 and took a detour leading him back around to a trailhead.

'And I now love seeing so many wonderful faces popping up in pictures in unexpected places.' Davidhazy kept track of where he was using paper maps, a mobile app with GPS and a watch. After a while, he found a mile generally took him 18 to 22 minutes to hike. During his mammoth walk, Davidhazy said he encountered one wolf, five black bears, dozens of rattlesnakes and countless creepy crawlies. He now plans to make a feature film documenting his life-changing trip, called Lost or Found. Summing up the voyage he said: 'It was the hardest simple thing I could think of.'
