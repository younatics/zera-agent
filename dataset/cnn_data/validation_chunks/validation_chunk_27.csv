"Courtney Lawes couldn’t understand what all the fuss was about. Asked by a French journalist to explain the ‘story’ of his sledgehammer tackle on Jules Plisson, the England lock was non-plussed. ‘There’s not much of a story really,’ he said, in reference to the incident at Twickenham last Saturday. ‘That’s just what I do.’ England lock Courtney Lawes made a trademark hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson . Lawes certainly made sure that ‘Le Crunch’ lived up to its billing, but France were incensed. Two days later, it emerged that they had cited the Northampton player, but the match commissioner was satisfied that the officials, led by referee Nigel Owens, had been right to take no action. This episode generated enormous interest and debate, and served to highlight an issue that rugby is currently faced with; how to find the balance between embracing its extreme physicality, or fretting about it. Footage of Lawes levelling his opponent – complete with countless replays – was prominently displayed on the RBS Six Nations website and, as of Thursday, it had received in excess of 963,000 'hits' (an appropriate term in this case) on YouTube. There is no doubt that monster collisions are part of the game’s box-office appeal. The sight of huge men smashing each other and accepting the punishment with minimal complaint is one factor that sets the sport apart from most others. But officials are also wary about being seen to glorify brutality, even when it falls within the laws. Concussion remains a hot topic. The threat of legal intervention hangs heavy. Scrum sequences have been amended in the quest for greater safety. Rucking – in terms of vigorous use of feet – has been outlawed. Punch-ups are a fading phenomenon. A crusade against so-called dangerous tackling continues; so aerial contests for the ball have become a grey area of unrest and confusion. The French players and public were incensed with the monster hit in Six Nations clash . In the age of ‘super slo-mo’ replays, acts of aggression such as the one by Lawes appear worse or more impressive than in real-time, depending on your viewpoint. Frame by frame, the size and force of modern rugby is being laid bare, and the powers-that-be worry about parents of the next generation of players taking fright and directing their children towards other sports. As severe injuries occur with alarming frequency, the constant gaze of countless cameras means there is no hiding from the fact that this is a tough game, with inherent risks. But in different ways, it was ever thus. This is not an activity played in cotton wool. Bravery is a pre-requisite. Rugby cannot be fully sanitised for mass consumption, or it will lose its warrior soul. Australian rugby has been rocked by a homophobia controversy, which could have profound ramifications. During a Super 15 clash between the Waratahs and Brumbies in Sydney last weekend, the visitors’ vice-captain, David Pocock, twice complained to referee Craig Joubert about homophobic abuse by an opponent. Days later, the Waratahs’ flanker, Jacques Potgeiter, was fined and apologised for using inappropriate language. David Pocock twice complained to referee Craig Joubert about homophobic abuse . The episode has divided opinion Down Under, with many acclaiming Pocock – a staunch supporter of gay rights – for taking a stand, while others have complained that the issue should not have been so publicly exposed. The esteemed openside has captained his country before and could do so again at the World Cup, but there is a suspicion that he may have removed himself from the running, with one commentator saying: ‘He’ll pay for it. It will mean that he never captain the Wallabies again.’ The man who will make that call, Australia coach Michael Cheika, also happens to be coach of the Waratahs, but he is adamant the saga will not harm Pocock’s leadership prospects. Meanwhile, there are fears of a possible split between Waratahs and Brumbies contingents in the Wallaby camp. Messy – very messy. Waratahs flanker Jacques Potgeiter (centre) apologised for using inappropriate language . Fresh from the success of their young team, led by the outstanding England prospect, Maro Itoje, in last Sunday’s LV Cup Final, Saracens are hoping to mark the return of the Aviva Premiership this weekend by beating their own world record for a club rugby attendance. Advance ticket sales have passed the current record figure of 83,889, for Saturday's showdown with London rivals Harlequins at Wembley. However, while that fixture provides the glamorous backdrop, Leicester’s encounter with Exeter at Welford Road has the most significance in terms of the league table. The Chiefs are second but sit just two points ahead of the fifth-placed Tigers, and Saturday's match will be a fascinating test of the Devon club’s credentials as genuine title challengers. Saracens prepare for Saturday's Premiership encounter against Harlequins at Wembley . There must be something about playing prop for England that unleashes the inner performing artist in otherwise quiet, even shy characters. After the victory over France at Twickenham, Leicester’s Dan Cole delivered a stirring rendition of ‘Singing in the Rain’ in front of a large audience, to mark his 50th Test cap. A video of his animated efforts has become a sensation on the internet. Cole is following in a proud recent tradition. Alex Corbisiero is a much-lauded rapper, who is known for his improvised lyrics, to herald famous victories. Andrew Sheridan combined being England’s scrum destroyer-in-chief for several years with producing country and western albums, while Matt Stevens appeared on celebrity X-factor, to showcase his crooning quality. Last Word . Six days on from ‘Super Saturday’, after taking stock, the conclusion is unchanged; that it was the greatest day of drama in the long history of the championship, and the magnitude of the events was felt far beyond rugby’s usual constituencies. At the peak, during England v France, the BBC reported viewing figures just shy of 10 million. This follows the revelation that the Six Nations board will consider switching to pay-TV after the current rights deal expires in 2017. Such a move would be utter lunacy. Tournament organisers and the unions must recognise that the wide exposure delivered by a terrestrial broadcaster is worth far more than whatever large sums are on offer. The likes of Sky and BT Sport provide superb coverage, but this annual surge of public interest is priceless for rugby. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the championship’s epic finale, this column would recognise the merit of a bonus-point scheme, providing an extra five points were awarded for a Grand Slam. And as for a Player of the Championship nomination, look no further than Paul O’Connell – colossal captain of triumphant Ireland.","Courtney Lawes' trademark hit on Jules Plisson incensed the French .

"Michael van Gerwen produced a stunning performance to thrash fellow Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld in week eight of the Premier League in Dublin. The world No 1 notched up his sixth win in eight games to remain unbeaten in the tournament with a dominant 7-2 victory at the 3 Arena. Van Gerwen, who averaged 108.71, raced into a 3-0 lead and also won the last three legs of the match to maintain his place at the top of the standings. 'It was a fantastic performance,' Van Gerwen told PDC.tv. 'We both played really well and the only disappointing thing for me in the game was the nine-darter!

Michael v.Gerwen 7-2 Raymond v.Barneveld . Phil Taylor 7-4 Kim Huybrechts . 'The trebles are going in really well and that's more important than the double 12 and the nine-darter. I'm playing fantastic darts, and even though I can play better I am happy with this.' The defeat leaves Van Barneveld in elimination danger next week as he sits third from bottom in the table. Adrian Lewis, meanwhile, remained in the bottom two after he was beaten 7-2 by Dave Chisnall in the first match of the evening. 'I didn't happen for me tonight,' said Lewis. 'Double top let me down on a few occasions and double five pulled me out of the bag a couple of times, and it's difficult to deal with.' Dave Chisnall started the night in Ireland with a 7-2 win over Adrian Lewis . Chisnall said: 'I'm happy with that. Adrian wasn't at his best and he missed a few doubles, but I capitalised on that - sometimes you need a bit of luck and timing, and today I had both of those. 'I've not played my best darts in the last couple of weeks but I put it right this week. I was confident that I could get the win and I managed to get the victory. 'I've done everything right in preparation and it paid off because once I got into the lead I didn't look back, and I can't wait for Manchester next week now.' There were no such problems for Phil Taylor, though, as he beat bottom placed Belgian Kim Huybrechts 7-4. Phil Taylor beat bottom placed Kim Huybrechts 7-4 at the 3 Arena in Dublin . Taylor said: 'Kim played pretty well and his finishing was good but he let me in when he missed that 100. It was nip and tuck so I'm happy to have come out with the win. 'It was a tough game but I enjoyed it. I had a 104 average this week and won and a 115 average last week and lost, which doesn't make sense, but that's the game now and there were a lot of nerves on this week. 'I can relax next week now but I'm really looking forward to playing Dave Chisnall in Manchester.'

"The weather and conditions could hardly have been more different, but Andy Murray continued on from his Davis Cup thrashing of Donald Young earlier this month. Having beaten the world No 44 earlier this month indoors in Glasgow, he did so again outside in the steaming humidity of the Miami Open to reach the third round. Murray emerged the 6-4, 6-2 winner after an hour and 22 minutes and was left awaiting either Colombia's Santiago Giraldo or Dutchman Robin Haase. Andy Murray cruised past American Donald Young during the second round of the Miami Open . The British No 1 won in straight sets in the soaring heat as he booked his place in the next round . Murray was largely untroubled by Young who struggled to force the Scot into unforced errors . It was a comprehensive enough performance, although there was the odd lapse of concentration against a player whose own level tends to undulate sharply. Murray raced to a 4-0 lead but was cut back to 5-4 as he briefly struggled with his movement. In these heavy and windy conditions he was too solid for the American left hander and ultimately cruised through after having to fend off break points in the fourth game of the second set. Murray said after the match that he was pleased with his performance and, in particular, the way he handled the windy conditions. Murray and Young shake hands after the straight sets win to put the Scot into the third round . Murray, who now plays hard hitting Colombian baseliner Santiago Giraldo, said afterwards: ' I've played well against him the last couple of times. 'Obviously today was a very different match to Davis Cup; completely different conditions, the tactics that you go into the match with completely change because of the weather and the wind. The heat was okay. The wind obviously cooled you down a little bit when you were at the end changes. Sometimes it can be ridiculously hot, and that makes managing the points and your emotions important. So I just tried to play smart, and it worked.'

"Darren Fletcher revealed the prospect of captaining Scotland to victory again got him through some 'tough times'. The midfielder fought back after being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago but after a lengthy lay-off struggled to keep his place in the national team and at Manchester United. However, the 31-year-old is enjoying a new lease of life at West Brom after joining the Baggies in the winter transfer window and Gordon Strachan asked him to lead out the Scots in Wednesday night's 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland at Hampden Park, as recent skipper Scott Brown was rested. Darren Fletcher brings the ball under control during Scotland's 1-0 win over Northern Ireland . 'It was great to be back,' said Fletcher. 'You are representing your country, you are captain, you win a game at home against Northern Ireland, it is things you thought about doing when you were going through tough times. 'It was a while since I played at Hampden, I was thinking that driving in. But I really enjoyed it and the pitch was really good as well. 'Scott wasn't starting so it was my turn to step up and be captain. I have said before, I am what I am now on and captain or not, I am going to be exactly the same. 'We have a lot of leaders in that dressing room which is important. 'There is competition for places which is great. It means I have to step up my performance when I play. 'It is great for the manager and great for the squad that we are all pushing each other and performing well. Fletcher wins a challenge against former Manchester United team-mate Jonny Evans . 'I feel great. I feel stronger with every 90 minutes and I am seeing improvement all the time so hopefully there is more to come as well.' The match served as a warm-up for Scotland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Group D minnows Gibraltar at the national stadium on Sunday and it took a late Christophe Berra header to separate the teams. The Scots are all but certain to move on to 10 points after five fixtures against UEFA's newest member but Fletcher is too long in the tooth to go overboard about qualification hopes. Since making his debut under Berti Vogts in a friendly against Norway in 2003, Scotland have failed six times to qualify for a major finals. He said: 'We have great confidence in ourselves and in the group but I have been in this position before with Scotland and we have not managed to see it over the line. 'Everything we have done up until now has been great but the hard work is still to come. Fletcher was thrilled to be back captaining his country after a long absence . 'You have to keep reiterating that. We have an important match on Sunday. 'Win that and that takes us into the qualifier in June (away to Republic of Ireland) which is going to be an important game but there is still a lot of work to do.' 'We have put ourselves in a great position but the hard work begins now and let's see it out.' Fletcher believes patience on and off the pitch will be key against a Gibraltar side who, after failing to score a goal, far less win a point, in four games, will have damage limitation on their minds. He said: 'Hopefully the fans are patient with us when we are trying to play our football and break teams down. 'They were against Northern Ireland and it is important that they help us as much as they can.","Scotland beat Northern Ireland 1-0 at Hampden Park on Wednesday night .

Brianna DeJesus, 20, had cut Shakiel Brown, 23, out of her life after she discovered that he had been unfaithful, allegedly impregnating another young woman. In response, Brown, of Orlando, Florida, posted two explicit 'revenge porn' videos on Twitter and Instagram and tried to sell the clips to several gossip websites. Brianna DeJesus, 20, was subjected to a 'revenge porn' attack by her ex-boyfriend, who posted explicit videos of her on social media which she had not consented to being filmed . Although 'revenge porn' - spreading explicit material of a former partner with the intent to cause hurt - is not illegal in Florida, Brown was arrested as Miss DeJesus had not consented to being filmed. Brown has been charged with one felony count of video voyeurism, and has been released on a $3,500 bail. The couple had been dating for just under one year when Miss DeJesus broke it off earlier this year following claims of infidelity, the Orlando Sentiel reports. Upon hearing that Brown had made another woman pregnant, Miss DeJesus blocked his telephone number and refused to speak to him. On bail: Shakiel Brown, 23, has been charged with one felony count of video voyeurism . Shortly afterwards, the videos appeared on social media. Miss DeJesus, who also appeared on 16 and Pregnant, says she had no idea that she was being filmed, although the sex itself was consensual. She told police she was unaware the videos existed until they appeared on Brown's Twitter and Instagram  accounts this month. 'All my friends were talking about it so I went to see for myself,' Miss DeJesus, of Orlando, told the newspaper. 'He really posted all those videos of me on there... I was hurt and shocked. Miss DeJesus also discovered that Brown had tried to sell the 'revenge porn' to several gossip sites, including TMZ, as his email account was still connected to her computer. The email, which Miss DeJesus's mother published on her Twitter, reads: 'I have some very interesting videos I know would be a hit.... 'I have videos of (DeJesus) doing some pretty naughty things, if you guys are interested get back to me as soon as possible,' said an email sent from Brown's email address. 'That's probably what hurt the most,' Miss DeJesus said. 'Why would you try to use my name to make money off of something so private?' Brown admitted to posting the videos and the explicit material has since been removed from social media.

"The Taliban have reportedly captured an former US military base in the western Afghan province of Farah. The news was released through a 16 minute video, in which dozens of Taliban fighters are shown being driven into the fortified base. The white flag of the Taliban is also shown being unfurled by one of the militants whilst another scene shows one of the group's leaders making a lengthy speech in Pashto. The white flags of the Taliban can be seen being unfurled over the buildings as the fighters swarm into the former US military base. A senior Taliban leader is shown making a speech, declaring that the military base had been liberated by the Taliban. The video shows footage of  well-built fortitications of the former US base, once used to tackle the local trade in heroin in Farah province. The Taliban's exaggerated report ignores the fact that the base had not been used by NATO forces for over a year. American troops have not been operating from Bakwa base since March 2013. Multiple convoys of white estate cars are shown being driven into the compound, parking inside the fort walls. Fighters dressed in traditional Afghan dress and armed with machine guns can be seen getting out of the cars and gathering outside Bakwa district's headquarters building.

"Chris Ramsey feels he was right to take his Queens Park Rangers players to Dubai for warm-weather training and is adamant the trip was not a holiday. The relegation-threatened Barclays Premier League club stayed in the luxury five-star Meydan Hotel as they took advantage of a weekend off due to Tottenham Hotspur’s Capital One Cup final by travelling to the United Arab Emirates for a five-day break. Ramsey set ground rules ahead of the training camp at the plush Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex but allowed his players time off to visit Dubai’s Meydan Racecourse to wind down. QPR boss Chris Ramsey spoke to the media ahead of Wednesday's Premier League match against Arsenal . The Hoops head coach was adamant that his decision to take his players to Dubai was 'the right thing to do' QPR welcome Champions League-chasing Arsenal to Loftus Road on Wednesday having won just one of their last nine Premier League matches following their latest defeat against Hull City on February 21. Yet Ramsey feels his team are better equipped to fight relegation to the Championship following their time spent in Dubai. ‘Whatever happens, at that time I feel it was the right thing to do, whether things work out positively or not,’ Ramsey said. ‘I still believe that it was the right thing to do for the players so we could actually sit down, have a few meetings, and have a chat, and see where we’re headed. ‘We worked on a few things. No rocket science. The players knew what they were out there for. One of the things we wanted to avoid was people thinking that this was a reward for something. It’s not a reward. It’s not a holiday. It’s a training camp. ‘If we could have had the training camp down the road it would have been more convenient. We set down ground rules, we knew what we were going there for.’ Ramsey will be without suspended captain Joey Barton after he was sent off for shoving Hull’s Alex Bruce before aiming to hit Tom Huddlestone in the groin less than a fortnight ago. The QPR manager does not want Barton to stop being himself but reminded the 32-year-old there are limits. ‘We’ve sat down and had a chat, and he realises that he could have probably dealt with the situation slightly different,’ Ramsey added. ‘The thing is there are players that do have disciplinary records. I would not want to stop him from being that fiery character that he is, but obviously we know there are boundaries.’ Nedum Onuoha, Mauricio Isla and Sandro have returned to training following injuries and are in contention to face Arsenal.

"Arsene Wenger has revealed how he scrapped the exit strategy drawn up for Francis Coquelin after a rapid mid-season transformation by the French midfielder. In less than three months, Coquelin has gone from an Arsenal outcast on loan at Charlton to a player of such vital importance that he has been equipped with a protective mask which will enable him to play despite a broken nose against Queen's Park Rangers on Wednesday. 'It has been a surprise to everybody,' said Wenger. 'I told him at the start of the season to give absolutely everything until Christmas and then we would sit down together and see where we were. Francis Coquelin stretches prior to Arsenal's training session ahead of their match against QPR . Coquelin almost went on loan to QPR at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on . 'In myself, I thought if he doesn't play at all until Christmas, there was only six months contract to go and I would let him go somewhere else. You let the boy go. You don't leave him completely out of the squad for six more months.' Coquelin almost joined QPR in August but a proposed one-year loan collapsed on deadline day and two months later he was loaned to Charlton in the Championship, only to be recalled early because Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini were struggling with injuries and poor form. 'He wasn't happy when I called him back,' said Wenger. 'He thought I had just called him back as cover.' Coquelin made his first Arsenal start for nearly two years at West Ham on December 28 and has been ever-present in the Barclays Premier League since. Last month, the 23-year-old signed a new contract tying him to Arsenal until 2018. Coquelin has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he's injured . Arsene Wenger admitted he had expected to release Coquelin at the end of the season . Wenger is criticised for his loyalty and patience with developing players, but this is a triumph for that policy and a reminder that some players take longer than others to mature. 'He has analysed well what he is good at,' said Wenger. 'Defending in midfield. He was in between the playmaking position and the box-to-box player and he is not that. He is a sitting player who can win the ball. 'He has restricted his game to that and you make success in life with what you're good at. You don't have all the qualities but you have to express what you're good at and he's good at that. I think he can do that job. He is doing it now. 'He is respectful, focused and open. He has a strong personality, he speaks his mind but doesn't complain. Let's not forget, he has been world champion with the Under 21s. But you have to climb from a youth prospect to a regular player in a top team and that's not easy. He's doing it now.' Coquelin broke his nose against Everton on Sunday but trained on Tuesday and has the mask ready if required at Loftus Road. Coquelin's stint in the first team has earned him a new long-term contract with the Gunners . The Frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot Mathieu Flamini in the pecking order . 'He knows it's an opportunity for him,' said Wenger. 'Sometimes when you wait for such a long time to get your chance and you get it, the more you have suffered, the more you enjoy it. The human being is a strange animal. 'He has gone through a lot of doubt, questioning himself, at many times being discouraged that he doesn't get a chance. Now that he has a chance he doesn't want to let it slip away. He is a winner and he wants to win. That's why he is so committed.' Arteta, despite nagging injury problems, will extend his contract for one more year and Flamini has another year on his deal, while Arsenal remain linked with Lars Bender, Christoph Kramer and Morgan Schneiderlin. 'You cannot want to play at a big club and have no competition,' said Wenger. 'It's impossible. Competition is part of our job.'","Francis Coquelin recently signed a new contract with Arsenal .

"An unruly wind swirled around Haifa on Friday, whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the Mediterranean flying. It seemed a fittingly uncomfortable Middle Eastern welcome for Wales ahead of what promises to be a match of feverish tenor and great significance. Here in the Holy Land, Wales want to take a step closer to their long-sought grail: qualification for a major tournament. Not since the 1958 World Cup have they been to a finals competition. Wales midfielder Gareth Bale stretches during a training session in Israel on Friday . WALES (probable, 5-3-1-1): Hennessey; Gunter, Collins, Williams, Davies, Taylor; Ramsey, Allen, Ledley; Bale; Vokes. ISRAEL (probable, 4-3-3): Marciano; Dgani, Ben Haim I, Tibi, Ben Harush; Yeini, Natcho, Refaelov; Ben Haim II, Zahavi, Damari. Israel host Chris Coleman’s team in an encounter that could go some way to defining both sides’ aspirations of reaching Euro 2016. It is first against second in Group B. Coleman took his players through their final paces in the freshly-built Sammy Ofer Stadium, which will this evening be filled with around 30,000 fanatical Israel supporters, as well as 900 from Wales. Those travelling fans have not seen their side beaten in this campaign, two wins and two draws, the last point in Belgium a hugely encouraging display and result. Israel have three wins from three, and beat Bosnia 3-0 in their last home game. Bale holds off his team-mates in training as Wales hope to maintain their unbeaten start in Group B . This is an opportunity that needs to be seized by Wales, though. Victory would crystalise the promise shown so far and catapult the finals in France nearer into view. Defeat would undermine that promise to the same extent. Coleman is aware of the importance of this tie, calling it Wales’ biggest since the Euro 2004 play-off against Russia. He hopes to be saying the same when Belgium come to Cardiff in June, but that can only be the case with a positive result here. The Wales manager has twice been involved in campaigns that came close but failed, at either end of his Wales playing career. In 1993 a missed spot-kick against Romania proved decisive, in 2003 it was an inability to score past Russia over two legs. Coleman spoke passionately of these memories as he explained his mentality heading into this crucial game. ‘I was part of a couple of great Welsh sides that never did it,’ he said. ‘I enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever. Wales captain Ashley Williams (left) shares a joke with Gareth Bale (right) in training on Friday . ‘We have a good current group, we are going in the right direction but we have been here before. One foot in the door does not get you there. I do not want to play things down, we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about. But we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go.’ His opposition manager Eli Guttman was in jovial mood, making sarcastic remarks about calling Cristiano Ronaldo for advice and insisting Gareth Bale must be worth his £86million fee because Real Madrid paid it. Coleman struck a different chord. ‘I feel focused,’ he said. ‘I am looking forward to it. We have had a real good week of preparation. I am nervous, excited. Any manager who says he is relaxed is telling you a lie. ‘All we can do is focus on performance and the plan. That has been the secret of our success so far.’ Having Bale in your midst must provide a comfort blanket, even amid extreme criticism of his form emanating from Madrid. The 25-year-old loves playing for his country, where he is among long-term friends. No-one belts out the national anthem louder. Wales boss Chris Coleman is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in Haifa on Saturday . He has not scored in three internationals, but dragged Wales to victory in Andorra in the opening game of this campaign to set the tone, scoring a retaken free-kick nine minutes from time. Bale is likely to start in a free role behind the striker with a 5-3-2 formation mooted. But Israel will start right back Orel Dgani for the first time and Coleman said he would explore Bale’s position as the match took shape. ‘If there is a weakness to be exploited then of course you look at it,’ he said. ‘We’ve changed tactically during a match before.’ It is not all about Bale. Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams are elite players operating in the Premier League. Williams will win his 50th cap. There is youth, but experience. Coleman acknowledged Israel’s potency in attack, with RB Leipzig’s Omer Damari leading the line looking to add to his five goals in qualification, level with Danny Welbeck. No player has more. Tal Ben Haim, once of Chelsea, Manchester City and Bolton, is the most recognisable name in Israel’s line-up. He wears the armband and is predicting an even louder noise at the Sammy Ofer than the one that stunned Bosnia. ‘I know British football but it will not make it easier for me,’ he said. ‘In the last game all the players spoke about the crowd and we expect against Wales the atmosphere will be even better.’","It's first against second as Israel host Wales in Euro 2016 quaifier .

"While Harry Kane was scoring on his debut for England, Alvaro Morata was scoring on his first start for Spain to give the reigning European Champions a 1-0 win over Ukraine. The former Real Madrid striker, who nearly joined Kane at Spurs as part as the deal that took Gareth Bale to Spain, settled the match in the first half in what was a largely unconvincing performance from Vicente del Bosque’s team. Franco Baldini wanted Morata to move to north London but he ended up staying in Madrid before moving to Juventus last summer. His goals have helped them into the last eight of the Champions League and he took that form with him into this Group C qualifier. Alvaro Morata opened the scoring for Spain as his looped effort evades the gloves of Andriy Pyatov . Morata beats Ukraine defender Yevhen Khacheridi to loft the ball into the back of the net . Spain: Casillas; Juanfran, Pique, Ramos, Alba (Bernat 79); Busquets, Koke, Iniesta (Cazorla 74); Silva, Isco, Morata (Pedro 65) Subs not used: Albiol, Bartra, Fabregas, De Gea, Carvajal, Juanmi, Mario Suarez, Asenjo, Vitolo . Scorer(s): Morata 28 . Booked: Ramos . Manager: Vicente del Bosque . Ukraine: Pyatov; Fedetskyi, Khacheridi, Kucher, Shevchuk; Tymoshchuk, Stepanenko (Garmash 76); Konoplyanka, Rotan, Yarmolenko; Zozulya (Kravets 32, Budkivskiy 91) Subs not used: Boyko, Husyev, Morozyuk, Bezus, Rakitskiy, Oliynyk, Burda, Rybka, Rybalka . Booked: Fedetskyi, Kravets, Kucher . Manager: Mykhaylo Fomenko . Referee: Cuneyt Cakır . Playing instead of the injured Diego Costa he converted a Koke pass on 28 minutes but Spain failed to find the second and still look a long way from the form they showed when they won the Euros three years ago. They also lost Jordi Alba to a groin injury in the second half. La Roja applied all the early pressure but Isco and Morata sent their first shots wide and David Silva missed the target with a diving header 12 yards out from an Isco cross. Ukraine looked dangerous on the coutner attack in the first 20 minutes and Artem Fedetsky sent a wayward volley wide of Iker Casillas’ goal from a corner. From the edge of the area Ruslan Rotan also went close, but again Spain’s goalkeeper was able to watch the ball go wide. Spain attacked with more quality than the visitors and just before the half hour they were in front when Andres Iniesta found Koke and his first time ball sent Morata through. He held off the last defender and when Ukraine keeper Andrei Pyatov went to ground early he lofted the ball over him to score. Spain then enjoyed their best spell. Silva tested Pyatov with another shot and Iniesta began to lead Ukraine a merry dance in midfield. On the day that Xavi showed up in Qatar to sign a three-year contract Spain could easily have been reminded of how much they miss him. Pyatov looks back in despair as Spain take the lead at the Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán . Morata celebrates his first international goal on his third cap for Vicente del Bosque's side . But his Barcelona team-mate was running the midfield until the break. They could have gone in at half time 2-0 up but Sergio Ramos' header from Silva’s free-kick came back off the frame of the goal. Encouraged by Spain’s narrow lead Ukraine had their chances at the start of the second half with Casillas saving Rotan’s free-kick. The keeper then gave Dnipro’s Rotan another chance kicking the ball straight to him but then parried his shot. The Juventus striker is congratulated by his team-mates as Spain made their first-half dominance pay . Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta controls the ball as Artem Fedetskiy closes in to make a challenge . That was typical of the sloppiness that had crept into Spain’s play at the start of the second period. They needed the second goal – it might have come when Iniesta fed Morata but his shot was closer to the corner flag than Pyatov’s goal and that was the last thing he did before being replaced by Pedro. At least he had his debut goal. It was still far too easy to reach the edge of Spain’s penalty area and they were saved by Ukraine not being able to make the most of arriving there – Rotan again shot straight at Casillas after meeting Yevhen Konoplianka’s cross. Manchester City midfielder David Silva is halted in his tracks by two Ukraine defenders . Real Madrid playmaker Isco evades the outstretched leg of Ukraine forward Taras Stepanenko . Spain continued to over-elaborate at one end and leave too much space at the other and when Jordi Alba went off holding his groin with 12 minutes left even Barcelona supporters were worried. They played out the final minutes to take the three points and they stay second behind Slovakia but Del Bosque will not need telling there is work to be done if they are to retain their crown in France next summer. Iker Casillas kept his place in the Spain goal despite the imperious form of David de Gea this season .

The lack of activity on their behalf may come as a surprise given recent form. Jones, 23, and Smalling, 25, formed a resolute centre-back pairing in United's 3-0 home victory over Tottenham and 2-1 defeat of Liverpool at Anfield - regarded as the club's best performances under Louis van Gaal. Their confident outings alongside each other have reignited long-held hopes that they could form a long-term partnership at the heart of United's defence for years to come. But it would appear the club is in no rush to tie up their futures. The pair are two of a number of high-profile players whose contracts expire at the same time including goalkeeper David de Gea, converted wingback Ashley Young and striker Robin van Persie. Both Jones and Smalling were billed as being the centre back pairing for club and country for years to come . Chris Smalling has attracted interest from Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . Smalling, who cost United £10m when he signed from Fulham in 2010, is a long-term target of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The Frenchman tried to sign the Greenwich-born centre-half when he left Craven Cottage and repeated his attempts last summer. Should United be willing to listen to offers this summer Smalling may well find himself heading back to the capital. Jones, for whom United paid Blackburn Rovers £17m in 2011, was hailed as a future great by Sir Alex Ferguson who added that he could become one of the best players in the club's history. Smalling is part of the England team preparing to face Lithuania and Italy . Jones is also part of the England squad for the international double header . Like Smalling, his cause has not been helped by injuries and inconsistency. The pair have started five games together for United as a centre-half combination and the club have won all five matches, conceding just two goals. United have been extensively linked with Dortmund defender Mats Hummels, however Sportsmail understands some at the club harbour concerns over the Germany international's apparent lack of pace. Hummels, 26, is likely to cost around £36m however, Van Gaal has been promised significant funds to again strengthen his squad. United are also trailing Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte. The 20-year-old Frenchman fits the bill, although the Basque club will demand a release fee of £30m.","Phil Jones and Chris Smailling's contracts expire next summer .

"Kell Brook is determined to complete his remarkable journey from 'game over' to home city glory when he puts his IBF welterweight title on the line for the first time in Sheffield on Saturday night. The 28-year-old will take to the ring against Romanian Jo Jo Dan less than six months after a horrific machete attack in Tenerife which left him fighting for his life with blood pouring from a 12-inch wound. And having fought his way up through the city's sports halls and leisure centres to finally top the bill in front of an expected crowd of more than 10,000, Brook admitted his biggest battle might be to stop his emotions getting the better of him. Kell Brook poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his match with title challenger Jo Jo Dan . Brook will defend his IBF welterweight title against Dan in his home city of Sheffield on Saturday night . Brook is set to compete less than six months after a horrific stab attack nearly left him dead in Tenerife . Dan poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his title match with IBF welterweight champion Brook . Brook's attack left him with a 12-inch wound on his thigh and he has shown great strength to recover . Brook said: 'When I was laid in hospital with my leg tied up it felt like I was at the bottom of my ocean and I remember when it first happened my whole life flashed before my eyes. 'I thought, 'this is game over for me now', but I remember getting to the hospital and being wheeled out and feeling the fresh air and seeing the birds flying about and thinking 'I'm here, I'm alive'. 'I think when you've been that close to death it definitely changes you. 'It is going to be hard going from the leisure centres to packing out the Arena, but I was born to do this and I believe I perform better under pressure. 'It took me a long time to get this belt and with what I've had to go through there is no way on this earth Jo Jo Dan is taking it off me. I've kept everyone waiting and they are in for a real treat.' Brook took the title from previous holder Shawn Porter in California in August and knows victory over Dan could pave the way to much more lucrative bouts in the 147lbs division. While his stated aim of sealing a showdown with the winner of the May super-fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao may be over-ambitious, plenty of other potential money-spinning bouts remain. Brook claimed the IBF welterweight title in 2014 when he defeated the previous holder Shawn Porter (left) Brook and Dan square up with one another ahead of their IBF title match in Sheffield on Saturday . Brook has also expressed an interest in facing Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in the near future . And while Brook is right not to under-estimate his Canada-based opponent, it is hard to see how the 33-year-old Dan is likely to pose much of a threat. His record is a solid enough 34-2 with 18 stoppage wins, but his two losses came on his only two previous forays anywhere near top class, both against Turkish opponent Selcuk Aydin in 2010 and 2011. Brook added: 'You can never look past any opponent and you never know what is going to happen - you have to take every fight and every day at a time. 'If you are asking me if I want to fight Mayweather or Pacquiao, of course I do. I'm the world champion and I'm leading the way and I've got to look for the higher profile fights. 'It is a piping hot division and it just makes it all the better that I'm the world champ and you've got all these other top fighters who want what I've got.'

"Alexis Sanchez has made a blistering start to life at Arsenal, racking up 18 goals, 10 assists and countless plaudits in his first few months in England. The Chilean's work-rate, creativity and finishing mean he's a firm favourite with fans at the Emirates Stadium as well as one of the first names on Arsene Wenger's team sheet. But his form has tailed off in recent weeks, with Sanchez failing to find the net in February, and the former Barcelona star has now gone seven games without a goal. Alexis Sanchez has been suffering a bit of a drought since Mesut Ozil returned to fitness . Sanchez has not scored a goal for Arsenal in his last seven games, providing just one assist in that time . The Gunners forward has been vital to their form this season, but does not look at his best at the moment . A hamstring injury, which ruled Sanchez out of games against Aston Villa and Tottenham, seemed to stall his season, but there are also concerns about the 26-year-old's role in the team since the return from injury of Mesut Ozil. Gunners fans had hoped that when Ozil and Sanchez, Arsenal's two most expensive players ever, played together, Wenger's side would find another gear. But it appears the two struggle to play together. Sanchez has not scored a goal with Ozil on the pitch since October 1, and the Gunners win percentage with their two stars playing together is worryingly far lower than when one is absent. While results have picked up since the German's return from injury, the impact on Sanchez's performances is a concern. The Chilean's barren spell has coincided with Ozil's comeback, and a move away from the central role in which he was excelling. Sanchez celebrates scoring against Stoke City in early January, his last goal for the club . The Chilean has scored 18 times since his move from Barcelona, but none since January 11 . Sanchez celebrates after scoring against Manchester City, but he generally struggles when Ozil plays . In the World Cup-winning playmaker's absence, Sanchez had been operating as Arsenal's No 10, with a license to drift all over the pitch and run at the defence. But Ozil has slotted into that role, with great effect, shunting Arsenal's best player this season out to the left wing. The effect has been devastating to Sanchez's game. In his first 30 appearances for Arsenal he created 74 chances, at a rate of almost two and a half per game. In his last seven, he averages around one and a half a game, with only one assist. It is a similar story with his shooting. His goalless run is the result of having just 13 shots in seven games, of which only five have been on target. Sanchez celebrates with Santi Cazorla, who has recently moved to a deep midfield role, to great effect . Sanchez has hit the buffers after storming start to his career in north London . Ozil has been in superb form since coming back from injury and slotting into the No 10 role . Ozil's playmaking, including both assists in a win over Everton, has spurred Arsenal onto a winning run . In fact he has managed a shot on target every 102 minutes, a poor return compared with the rest of the season, where he had worked the goalkeeper every 57 minutes. It is not just Sanchez's position that has changed with Ozil's return, but also the shape of the team. During Sanchez's best run of scoring form this season, when he notched six times in four games during October and November, the Gunners had two recognised central midfielders in the side. Early in the season that was usually Mathieu Flamini or Mikel Arteta in the holding role alongside Aaron Ramsey or Jack Wilshere, but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky and of course the emerging Francis Coquelin have all been involved more recently. This gave Sanchez a platform, whether from the wing or a more central position, to focus on attacking. He always works hard off the ball, but he needed to worry less about his positioning defensively. Francis Coquelin's emergence as a quality holding midfielder has allowed Arsenal to change their system . Arsene Wenger has played Ozil in the middle, leaving Sanchez to help out in a lightweight midfield . Wenger needs to find a way of getting his two stars to play well together as Arsenal push for a top-four finish . Since Ozil returned, Santi Cazorla has moved into a deep-lying midfield role to glorious effect, freeing up Ozil to drift around the midfield picking his passing. Both men have benefited, and the Gunners have won seven of their last eight league games. But it has meant that Sanchez has had to be more disciplined, tracking back to help out in a light-weight midfield, and spending more time defending than when he was the main man. For now, it is a system that appears to be working - while Sanchez's stats falter, Arsenal have been in decent form since Ozil's return, the aberration against Monaco aside. But with the race for Champions League football hotting up, Wenger will want to start getting the best out of his superstar again, alongside - rather than instead of - Ozil.","Alexis Sanchez has not scored a goal for seven games .

"It's Hot or Not time again as Riath Al-Samarrai reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. Radamel Falcao bagged a brace for Colombia on Thursday night, but his double against minnows Bahrain is unlikely to rescue his Manchester United career. WHAT'S HOT . RADAMEL FALCAO .

"Facebook has removed the personal account of a 12-year-old Georgia boy who posted a viral video last week in support of Rudy Giuliani's comments that President Obama 'doesn't love America'. Republican C.J.Pearson found out the price of his new found fame on Friday morning when a friend told him it had been deactivated for 'suspicious activity'. Fearing his video, which was watched by more than 1.4 million people, may have been the cause, Pearson hit out at the social media giant, accusing them of quelling any dissent towards Obama. Dumped: C. J. Pearson (seen here in a picture from his public page on Facebook) had his personal page deactivated after the social media giant became aware of his age . The first sign that something had gone awry came on Friday morning when Pearson informed his followers on his public page he had lost his personal account. 'I am having my Editor, Alan Davidson post on my behalf on this page while Facebook continues to lock me out,' wrote the Columbia Middle School student according to Fox. 'The 1st amendment is obviously not a big concern to the powers that be at Facebook, but we will continue to fight back!' Demanding a response from Facebook, they duly replied and gave him a cast-iron reason why they banned his page - he is 12. Indeed, it is explicitly stated in Facebook's terms and conditions that no one under the age of 13 can have an account. Drawing attention to yourself: CJ Pearson, a 12-year-old from Georgia, posted a viral video backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments criticizing President Obama's love for America . In a statement, Facebook said they were alerted to the fact that Pearson is 12 by a member of the public and acted accordingly. 'You have to be 13 to have a Facebook account. This is a requirement, not a suggestion. He was locked out because he lied about his age, not because of the content,' replied a Facebook representative. Pearson however, is not having that. 'I would consider that complete malarkey,' said Pearson to Fox DC. 'Because in all honesty, there are many many people younger than me who have a Facebook account.' 'I will not stop here,' he added to FOX 5. 'You cannot silence a voice that deserves to be heard. And I will continue to make as many accounts as possible.' Pearson made a number of media appearances over the weekend to draw attention to his plight. 'Time and time again, Facebook has shut down many conservative accounts after they decide to speak up,' Pearson said on Fox & Friends Sunday. Defense: Giuliani wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he didn't want to question Obama's motives or heart . Attacked: Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that President Barack Obama did not love his country like a commander in chief should . 'When a person decides to speak up, their voice shouldn’t be hindered because of someone disagreeing.' Last week, Giuliani may have come under fire for saying that President Barack Obama does not love America at a fundraising dinner for Governor Scott Walker, but he found a backer in Pearson. He told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - that 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.' Democrats, the White House, and even members of the GOP have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician, who was a Presidential contender in 2008. After the tide of criticism, middle school student CJ Pearson made a YouTube video agreeing with Giuliani, in which he said that the commander in chief had a 'downright hate for the American values our country holds'. The video, posted last Saturday on his channel, has garnered more than 1.4m views as of Monday night. A 'public figure' page for the student says he has 'considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8, supporting John McCain in his 2008 Presidential Campaign'. He said in his video that if Obama really loved America he would call Islamic State 'what it really is, an assault on Christianity' The student added that the president, who has ordered airstrikes on ISIS and asked for approval to send limited ground troops, was 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'. For his part, Giuliani has said that he stands by his controversial comments made last month. However, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he 'didn’t intend to question President Obama’s motives or the content of his heart'.","C.J Pearson had his Facebook account pulled after viral video backing Rudy Giuliani .

"Debbie Jevans shocked rugby by resigning as chief executive of England’s World Cup organising committee less than six months before the tournament, citing personal reasons. Her walk-out was unexpected although she is understood to have had an uneasy relationship with people in rugby since her arrival in October 2012. Previously director of sport at the London Olympics, she transformed England Rugby 2015. Debbie Jevans poses with the Wiliam Webb Ellis trophy during a World Cup media event in November 2012 . It is believed Jevans was exasperated with the old-boy network at the top of the Rugby Football Union, once described as ‘57 old farts’ by former England captain Will Carling, who had begun lining up to take credit for delivering a tournament that had been her ‘baby’. The RFU’s plans for ‘the glorification of the uninvolved’ by taking back ownership of the tournament had upset Jevans, who is Sport England’s deputy chairman and on the Football League board. RFU finance chief Stephen Brown is the new ER 2015 managing director alongside chairman Andy Cosslett, who said: 'On behalf of the ER2015 Board I would like to extend our enormous appreciation for all that Debbie has brought to the role. Jevans was previously director of Olympic sport for the London 2012 Games . 'Her legacy will be seen during and after the tournament is delivered, with a sporting event that I fully believe will be both memorable and inspiring, creating a step change in interest and participation for the game in this country.' World Rugby chairman Bernard Lapasset added: 'On behalf of World Rugby I would like to thank Debbie for her vision, dedication and leadership in implementing everything we need for an exceptional Rugby World Cup and wish her all the best for the future. We are confident that Rugby World Cup 2015 will be the biggest and best to date.'","Jevans had been at the helm of the Rugby World Cup Organising Committee since October 2012 .

"Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of winning what Louis van Gaal dubbed England’s Rat Race. Five ambitious clubs are locked in a scramble for two Champions League places behind Chelsea and Manchester City and it could prove more tense and exciting than the Barclays Premier League title race itself. Adding to the sense of theatre is the fact that those who do not join Europe’s elite next season must swallow an estimated £30million in lost revenue and the prospect of a campaign in the largely unloved Europa League. Arsene Wenger will ask his team to target the 72-point barrier to be sure of securing a top four finish . Louis van Gaal said that he believed Wenger's estimation of the necessary points total . ‘The best way is to look forward and go as fast as you can,’ said Arsenal manager Wenger. ‘You can see the quality of the teams behind us. Seventy-two points might be enough. ‘People have finished in the top four with 67 points, but if you look at this year, we have 51 points, so it will be in the 70s. It is a tough run-in, similar to last year.’ Arsenal finished fourth last year with 79 points, well clear of Everton in fifth with 72. It is the proximity of the challengers which has generated an upward trend in recent years. When Everton came fourth in 2005, they had 61 points ahead of Liverpool in fifth with 58. In each of the past two years, however, the team finishing fifth has collected 72 points. Van Gaal acknowledged Wenger’s years of expertise in the area. ‘I want to believe him,’ said the Manchester United boss. ‘It is a rat race. It is going into the last week.’ Arsenal have not given up hope of catching City to finish second, but there is a nine-point gap to Chelsea who have a game in hand and are threatening to ease clear at the top. Wenger said: ‘We are nowhere near close to being in the title race. We are too far from Chelsea to say that we are in the title race, but you never know what can happen. ‘Why should Manchester City give up for the title? They did it before from eight points behind. Without speculating on the weaknesses of any team, we want to be consistent and do as well as we can.’ World Cup winner Mesut Ozil has been in impressive form for Arsenal since returning from injury . ARSENAL . Suffered a Euro wobble but form is strong in the Premier League, winning six of seven since defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day, after which Wenger switched goalkeepers. Attention is spread over three competitions, although maybe not for long. They trail Monaco 1-3 in the Champions League and go to Manchester United in the FA Cup. They are awash with goals, have key players fit and options to make changes, especially up front. Also experienced top-four finishers, with an eye still on catching Manchester City. Top 7 games to play: 3. Prediction: 76pts. Wayne Rooney has returned to an attacking role since Robin van Persie's injury and has performed well there . MANCHESTER UNITED . Results are holding up despite scratchy performances and the misfortune of Robin van Persie’s injury has moved Wayne Rooney back up front which may prove serendipitous. But they are vulnerable at the back and face difficult fixtures, with five of the top seven to play and trips to Crystal Palace, Everton and Newcastle. Away form is poor, with 16 points on the road this season — the worst in top half barring West Ham. Fixtures offer a chance to take points from rivals, but more likely a problem with form so sluggish. Should at least be fresh, having only played 32 games in all competitions. Top 7 games: 5. Prediction: 71pts. Liverpool have been in formidable form since the turn of the year and recently beat Manchester City . LIVERPOOL . Finishing with an impressive late run after a dreadful start. Helped by a settled system, the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of others encouraged by the marginalisation of Mario Balotelli and, to a lesser extent, Steven Gerrard. They boast the best form in the Premier League since the turn of the year and have proved capable against big rivals in the recent past. They also have arguably the gentlest fixtures and no more Europe, but finish with awkward away games at Chelsea and Stoke. No sign of fatigue but Burnley is their 45th game of the season. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 73pts. Morgan Schneiderlin has impressed for Southampton this season as the Saints surprised everyone . SOUTHAMPTON . Scoring goals has proved the big problem for manager Ronald Koeman since the end of January, as if opponents have started to show them respect as a team chasing Champions League qualification and are plotting to stop them. Perhaps this, together with increased expectations, is catching up with them after a brilliant start. Injuries have nibbled away at key elements of a squad which cannot boast the same depth as others pursuing the Champions League. The dream faded during February, a month when Saints scored once in five games, but they have no distractions as they attempt to finish with a flourish. Top 7 games: 3. Prediction: 61pts. Harry Kane has been in superb form for Tottenham this season, scoring 24 goals so far in all competitions . TOTTENHAM . In a mini-slump after five without a win in all competitions and bruised by a Europa League exit and Wembley defeat inside three days. Can they be revived and refocused after a gruelling season of 45 games to date? There are 12 more to go, including seven tricky away fixtures. It is a character test for a young team which has key players such as Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Eric Dier completing their first full Premier League campaign.

"Australia captain Michael Clarke will retire from one-day internationals following Sunday's World Cup final against New Zealand. The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference in Melbourne ahead of the match against the Black Caps. 'I think it's the right time for me and the Australian cricket team,' read a report on www.cricket.com.au, Cricket Australia's official news outlet. Michael Clarke shakes hands with New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum ahead of Sunday's final . The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference on Saturday morning . 'I don't think it's reasonable to expect I'll be fit and healthy and available for the next World Cup, so I think it's the right time.' Clarke has played 244 ODIs for his country since making his debut in 2003, scoring 7907 runs at an average of 44.42, and was made captain when Ricky Ponting stood down following the 2011 World Cup. 'I know I've made the right decision,' he said. 'I told my team-mates 10 minutes ago. I told the selectors and (Cricket Australia boss) James Sutherland about an hour ago.' Shortly after Clarke made his announcement, Cricket Australia chief executive Sutherland released a statement thanking the batsman for his service. Clarke, who will continue to play at Test level, is pictured playing a shit in the nets ahead of Sunday's match . Clarke, pictured with team-mate Shane Watson, will lead Australia against England in the Ashes later this year . 'Michael informed me and his team-mates of his decision earlier today,' it read. 'We congratulate him on a wonderful career in one-day international cricket. 'From the time that he burst onto the scene as an exciting 21-year old way back in January 2003, he was always destined for great things. 'While his decision comes as something of a surprise, Michael leaves one-day cricket on his own terms, aiming to finish on an absolute high, in front of a packed MCG as a possible World Cup-winning captain. That's very special. 'Regardless of the result, he will leave the one-day international game as one our greats. We thank him for his wonderful contribution to one-day cricket and look forward to his continued leadership at Test level.' Clarke appeared in good spirits as he prepared for his final one-day international match on Sunday . Clarke will lead Australia in England this summer as they look to defend the Ashes they won with a whitewash in 2014 and he admitted that a desire to prolong his Test career was behind his decision. 'That's obviously a priority for me to continue to be successful in the Test format,' he said. 'By walking away from one-day cricket it probably gives me my best opportunity. 'I don't feel bad about saying I feel that Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. 'I love that challenge. I see it as the pinnacle. I feel like I've still got a lot to offer the Australian Test team as captain.' Clarke made his ODI debut 12 years ago and has scored almost 8,000 runs for his country . Speculation will now mount over who will replace Clarke at the helm with George Bailey and Steve Smith the two most likely candidates. Bailey has led the 50-over team in Clarke's absence due to back and hamstring injuries recently but Steve Smith was handed the Test reins during the recent series win over India.

"Paul Murray will serve as interim Rangers chairman while Dave King seeks to satisfy the stock market and SFA he is a fit and proper person. King will arrive in Glasgow Thursday for Friday’s general meeting, predicting a ‘landslide’ victory for his new regime over the outgoing old board. In a statement on Wednesday, however, the Castlemilk-born businessman revealed plans to install key ally Murray as chairman while he spends time convincing regulatory authorities his 41 tax convictions in South Africa should be no barrier to a Rangers boardroom return. King also announced he will not stand to become a director until he has ticked all necessary boxes. Paul Murray (second from the left) will serve as interim Rangers chairman while Dave King waits approval . King (centre) needs to prove to the stock market and the SFA that he is a 'fit and proper person' Shares in Rangers were suspended on Wednesday after the club’s nominated stock market advisors WH Ireland resigned. King now has 30 days to undergo the due diligence required to appoint a replacement Nomad and restore the club’s AIM listing. ‘An important issue that was repeatedly (and correctly) raised by the previous board is the need for the regulators to be given time to complete the necessary due diligence on myself — given my intended role as Chairman of the company,’ said King. ‘However, engagement with the regulators can only commence at the specific request of the company and that process can only be initiated on conclusion of the general meeting. ‘It is important that I lead by example following my commitment to transparency and accountability. I will therefore delay acceptance of my appointment as director until the regulators have completed due process. Paul Murray has agreed to act as interim Chairman of the company until this process has been concluded. Additional board appointments will be announced in the near future.’ David Somers (left) resigned from Rangers on Monday and fans want Derek Llambias (right) to go too . Supporters want fiace director Barry Leach (second from the right) to resign as well . Adopting a conciliatory tone before seeking to convince the SFA’s professional game board of his fit and proper status, King added: ‘The club must also take this opportunity to re-build relationships with the football community in Scotland. This will be to the benefit of the club and Scottish football as a whole.’ There was a less conciliatory tone towards WH Ireland after the NOMAD resigned on Wednesday. Without a nominated advisor, Rangers shares cannot trade on the AIM Stock Market and so were duly suspended. The move will do nothing to prevent the staging of Friday's General Meeting, where King is now certain to oust Mike Ashley’s placemen Derek Llambias and Barry Leach from the Ibrox board before installing Murray and John Gilligan in their place. Rounding on WH Ireland and their representative Paul Shackleton, King said: ‘It is blatantly dishonest to suggest that my imminent appointment to the board was of concern to them. Dave King has won his battle for control of Rangers and also wants to rid the club of Llambias and Leach . King has all but completed his takeover of Rangers after a two-year battle for control of the club . ‘Fortunately, the general meeting is not affected by the suspension. The new board will proceed to ensure that the listing is resumed as soon as possible. ‘I ask that all who attend the general meeting on Friday do so with the calmness and the dignity that is befitting of this great club.’ Finance expert Neil Patey believes the suspension of Rangers shares is only an issue if King fails to name a new NOMAD within 30 days. In Wednesday’s statement, the Johannesburg chairman of Micromega Holdings repeated his claim that he already has one lined up. And Patey said: ‘Nothing is going to happen now until the new board is sorted out, whoever that is. ‘The new board will then have to satisfy a Nomad to take on the Rangers appointment. ‘You would imagine, given Dave King’s stated intention to get rid of the existing Nomad, that he will have done his homework and will have another one lined up. ‘From his perspective, he will hopefully have someone ready to step in and take up that role. ‘If he has not lined up someone he has a month to sort it out. ‘So in principle the suspension of shares is not a huge issue unless he has not lined someone up and all the Nomads turn around and say: “Sorry, Mr King has 41 convictions in South Africa”. ‘It could get to the point where, if he doesn’t step away from the board, the shares would be permanently suspended but I think that would be pretty unlikely.’","Paul Murray will serve as a placeholder chairman at Rangers .

"Tourism Thailand’s latest effort to lure holidaymakers to its idyllic beaches and ancient temples may have backfired after a marketing campaign featured a creepy ‘stalker’ video. The Southeast Asian country’s tourism board released the short film, titled ‘Love en Route’, which tries to tell a cute love story involving a lovesick American tourist who tracks down a young Thai woman through her Instagram photos. But the clumsy 16-minute video, released along with a five-minute trailer, has been criticised and received negative reviews from those within the travel industry. Tourism Thailand's short film features a lovesick American man (left) who follows a young Thai woman . The video tells the story of a US tourist who takes a solo trip to Thailand 'to heal a broken heart' Produced by Thailand’s tourism ministry and the National Federations of Thai Film Associations, the video is intended as a love letter to the country’s sights, sounds and culture while encouraging visitors to share their photos with their social media friends. It features an American man who takes a solo trip to Thailand ‘to heal a broken heart’, and a Thai woman who is travelling in remembrance of her sister. Various scenes show him looking longingly out of his hotel room window – after travelling halfway around the world – and vowing to find the young woman as he scrolls through her Instagram photos. ‘It would be nice for us to meet and maybe become friends,’ the man said. With the story told from both perspectives, the man eventually tracks down his internet obsession. The man takes a liking to the woman after following her on Instagram, and vows to track her down . After their first encounter the woman is unsure at first, but they eventually tour Thailand together . She initially resists his advances as he attempts to pursue a friendship, but she eventually gives in and they spend time touring Thailand together. But as his holiday comes to an end it’s time for an awkward goodbye at the airport, where the man explains his feelings and is met with silence. After the young woman walks away, she realises her travel companion may be her ‘destiny’ after all, and posts a photo of the pair on Instagram. While the man is trying to mend a broken heart, the woman is travelling in remembrance of her sister . One scene shows the woman telling the camera, which an elephant holds in its trunk, she is falling in love . There is awkward silence after the man explains how he feels shortly before he boards his flight home . It’s not the first time Thailand’s tourism ministry has been slammed for one of its marketing gimmicks. Last year the tourism authority offered tourists a chance to win a luxury holiday and free plastic surgery. It said the ‘extreme makeover’ winners would be selected after a panel of medical experts judged photos and written submissions. The contest was open to non-Thai women aged 25 to 45.","Tourism Thailand released the video to promote country's sights, culture .

The competition is held every two years, but will take place in Singapore for the first time since its inception in 2003, coinciding with the country's 50th anniversary celebrations. Arsenal and Stoke will be making their debut appearances in the tournament - which is the only Premier League-affiliated competition to take place outside England - while Everton are competing for the first time since 2005. Arsenal will head to Singapore to compete in their first ever Asia Trophy before the start of next season . Manchester City won the last Asia Trophy, beating Sunderland in  Hong Kong in July 2013 . Completing the line-up of teams will be a Singapore Select XI, and Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore spoke of his excitement at taking the Premier League brand to a new location.

"With Benfica holding a fragile 1-0 lead over Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League, it was not the time for any  player from the Portuguese side to try anything flamboyant in front of goal. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Romario Balde did when he seized control of a penalty for his side. Instead of lashing the ball into a corner and hoping his accuracy beat the dive of the goalkeeper, he tried to chip the ball down the middle and into the goal - a panenka penalty kick. Romario Balde chips a penalty at goal in Benfica's UEFA Youth League game against Shakhtar Donetsk . Balde's contact with the ball was so light it only trickled to goal, despite the goalkeeper diving the wrong way . The goalkeeper had enough time to get to his feet and  save the attempt, so minimal was Balde's contact . As the ball was stopped inches in front of the goal line, Balde reacts to his error for Benfica . Balde wa substituted and his Benfica side  drew to Shakhtar 1-1 before losing the game on penalties . The skill is named after Antonin Panenka's penalty at Euro 1976 for Czechoslovakia against Germany but Balde lacked all of the conviction that made Panenka's kick famous. His kick was so feeble and light that the Shakhtar goalkeeper had enough time to dive the wrong way, regain his balance and  claim the ball before it trickled over the line. And things did not get any better for Balde or Benfica. Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo famously scored a panenka penalty against England at Euro 2012 . He was substituted, Benfica ended up drawing 1-1 before crashing out of the competition - on penalties. The panenka has been replicated by the likes of Andrea Pirlo and Zinedine Zidane, but Balde is unlikely to want to try it in an important game any time soon.","Romario Balde missed a panenka penalty for Benfica's youth team .

"Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez fired Barcelona to the top of La Liga by scoring five of their six goals at the Nou Camp on Sunday. Suarez scored the first and last goals in the 6-1 win. 'He is giving us more and more with every week that passes’ said Luis Enrique. Messi scored a 12-minute second-half hat-trick to take him level with Cristiano Ronaldo for 30 league goals this season. It was also a record breaking 24th La Liga hat-trick taking him one clear of the Portuguese and setting a new domestic record.

Bookings: Tito, Trashorras, Aquino . Sent off: Tito . Rayo Vallecano are more used to lunchtime kick-offs than Barcelona but Suarez had no problems with the early start as he put the home side ahead after just six minutes. He received the ball from Xavi having sprung Rayo’s adventurous offside trap and, with the outside of his right boot, spun a shot past the advancing Cristian Alvarez. It was one of his best goals since joining the club, and it was also his ninth since the turn of the year. Barcelona should then have wrapped up the three points in the next 20 minutes but were wasteful in front of goal and unfortunate with a penalty decision that went against them. First Suarez was sent racing away once again as Rayo persisted with a suicidal high defensive line but his cross to Pedro was cut out by a recovering defender. The former Liverpool striker then went through on Alvarez but was bundled down from behind by Abdoulaye Ba only for the referee to wave play on. Pedro was next to go close went put through by Messi but his effort was saved by Alvarez who was helping to keep Rayo in the game. He was also spending a lot of time sweeping up outside his area. The visiting manager Paco Jemez had said before the game that losing by seven would be the same as losing by a single goal and his attacking tactics were keeping him to his word. Rayo had their chances too. Trashorras in particular tested Claudio Bravo from open play and from a free-kick after Javier Mascherano had fouled on the edge of the area and been booked for his trouble. Barcelona could not extend their lead before the break but they came close just before the half time whistle with what would have been one of the goals of the season. Suarez lofted a pass over the top of Rayo’s defensive line to Messi and flicked it first time over the goalkeeper but just wide of the target. If Jemez spent the break convincing his players they get back into the game the belief was undone within five minutes of the restart. Xavi took a corner, Jordi Alba headed it on to a post and when it came back down in the six-yard box Pique forced it over the line.

Suarez and Messi celebrate together as they ran riot against a Rayo Vallecano side that had no answer . Barcelona moved top of La Liga with a 6-1 win over Real Madrid at the Nou Camp on Sunday lunchtime . Rayo were 3-0 down, and a man down, before the hour mark. Full-back Tito had been booked in the first half and when he grappled Suarez to ground inside the area the referee pointed to the spot and pulled out a second yellow and then the red. It was Messi’s first spot-kick since having his penalty saved by Joe Hart at the Etihad. He seemed to wait an age before steering it to the keeper’s right and seeing it comfortably saved. There was a let-off to come however with the referee deciding it needed to be taken again. At the second attempt he put it to the keeper’s left and this time the ball  nestled in the corner. The roof was coming down on Rayo now and Messi soon made it 4-0 turning in a Suarez pass. Alvarez then saved the Barcelona number ten’s free-kick to deny him a hat-trick. He wasn’t denied for long however. On minute 63 substitute Rafinha sent the ball out to Alba and he crossed for Messi to quick-step around the last defender and convert for his third goal of the game, his 30th of the season and his 24th La Liga hat-trick –no one has ever scored more. Alves was sent off for bringing down Alberto Bueno. He looked to get the ball before the player but the referee pointed to the spot and the former Real Madrid youngster scored the penalty. There was still time for Suarez to get his second of the game. He raced clear of Rayo’s still stubbornly high line but played in Messi instead of finishing himself and watched as the pass just run away from his team-mate. Messi repaid the favour when he slipped Suarez through and with seconds of normal time remaining he made it six.

"A youth football coach used his job to groom boys by inviting them to matches and sending them naked photographs on social media. Kane Hutchison, 25, was found guilty of inciting two teenage boys to engage in sexual activity on the internet. The abuse came to light after the mothers of the two boys, aged 13 and 14, recognised Hutchison, from Gateshead, following a conviction last year. In August 2014, he was jailed for three years for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy after offering to take him to watch a football match. He invited a youngster to attend an away match between Gateshead and Macclesfield last April and asked him to stay at his house so they could get an 'early start.' Hutchison forced the boy to share a bed and then molested him. The boy told his mother and he was arrested, hiding in the loft, and prosecuted. The latest conviction relates to a series of offences, between the summers of 2013-14. The first victim knew Hutchison played for a football club in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and was looking into joining the same club. Predator: Football coach Kane Huctchison pictured outside court and showing his love of football (right). He was convicted of inciting two teenage boys to engage in sexual activity in Gateshead . Hutchison made contact with the boy on Facebook, where he was advertising for players, and they began to communicate. Prosecutor Alec Burns said: 'From the defendant's point of view the communication became more and more sexual. 'He told him he could earn money making pornographic films, he said £350 an hour. He asked (the boy) to send pictures of himself.' The boy told police Hutchison had communicated with him on 'face tag' and appeared on his computer screen via a webcam committing a sex act on himself. He encouraged the victim to do the same and made him swap intimate pictures. Hutchison also tried to meet the youngster in a car park, the court heard. Hutchison targeted another boy, aged 14, in a similar way between April and August last year. He lied about his age and started asking the youngster to meet him, offering him £20 to do so. He also sent him intimate pictures of himself on Facebook and Snapchat and encouraged him to do the same. It came to light when the boy's mother  recognised him as one of her son's Facebook friends. Hutchison denied two counts of sexual assault but was found guilty after a trial. He can now be identified after a reporting ban was lifted. Nick Lane, defending, said Hutchison had already had his FA licence, to teach children, revoked. At the time of his arrest, he was working for a football magazine, he said. 'He is a man who in the past has done considerable charity work and good work for the community,' he said. 'In 2013 he was part of a team raising money for Help for Heroes who over the course of 24 hours visited 20 Premier League grounds as a way of raising funds for that charity. 'He has used his football contacts in the past to organise a charity match for testicular cancer. 'He has also in the past used his sporting skills working with adults with learning difficulties to encourage them to participate in sport.' The trial heard Hutchison had been 'struggling with his sexuality' at the time and has been on a sex offender programme in prison. Sentence was adjourned  until next month although Judge John Evans warned it would be a custodial sentence. He said: 'Having been convicted of these offences I'm going to adjourn sentence now for a pre-sentence report to address the issue of dangerousness. 'You know only a custodial sentence can follow in relation to these matters.'","Abuse came to light after mothers recognised his picture on Facebook .

"Celtic have turned up the heat ahead of a potentially-fraught League Cup final by slamming the SFA’s decision to let Dundee United midfielder Calum Butcher play in Sunday’s Hampden showpiece. The Englishman escaped a red card after referee Craig Thomson sent off team-mate Paul Paton instead in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final. That decision will be the subject of an appeal tribunal on Wednesday, when Celtic will also challenge the red administered to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday. Celtic have slammed the SFA’s decision to let Dundee United's Calum Butcher play in the League Cup final . Celtic will challenge the red shown to defender Virgil van Dijk following his clash with Butcher last Sunday . United’s Nadir Ciftci – already banned from the Hampden showpiece – faces a further two-match suspension for violent conduct after kicking out at Parkhead skipper Scott Brown. But Celtic are furious that Butcher will be free to play in the final, even if Paton is found to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice. A club statement read: ‘It seems completely illogical and fundamentally unfair that, in an incident where mistaken identity has been claimed, the Dundee United player now identified as being involved appears to have no case to answer – and would be available to play in the League Cup Final and the Scottish Cup replay between the teams – while Celtic’s player (van Dijk) may potentially miss both of those matches. ‘Celtic and Virgil van Dijk maintain their position that no red-card offence was committed by Virgil. Virgil will appear at Hampden to put his case on Thursday and we will fully support him in this appeal.’ United refused to comment publicly on Tuesday night, but are privately furious at some of Celtic’s comments. Brown, meanwhile, has escaped retrospective punishment for his tackle on Ciftci. The United striker lashed out in retaliation at the Scotland midfielder before van Dijk and United’s Paton were controversially dismissed by Thomson on the advice of assistant Graham Chambers. Celtic's Scott Brown  accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head . There will be no SFA action against Tannadice winger Aiden Connolly, however, despite claims by Celtic the youngster dived to win a penalty in the Scottish Cup stalemate. Expressing relief that Brown has been cleared to play on Sunday, team-mate Stefan Johansen said the SFA had reached the right decision in that regard. ‘I saw the tackle from Broony,’ said the Norwegian. ‘It was just a tackle and everything else was just a lot of players around it. ‘He would have been a big loss - but I didn’t think that was going to happen. He is the captain and means a lot to the team. We could see how important he is to the team when he was out at the start of the season. He’s a great player and a fantastic captain. He gives it out but he takes it back. That is part of his game. It’s not only him in this league who makes hard tackles.’ The failure to penalise Brown’s challenge was blamed by United boss Jackie McNamara for sparking the incident which saw Ciftci lash out with his boot. Offered a fast-track two-match ban by the SFA compliance officer, Ciftci has until 3pm today to respond to the complaint. If he declines, a Fast Track Tribunal will convene tomorrow. Failure to win his appeal would see the striker miss the Scottish Cup replay with Celtic and the subsequent Premiership clash between the sides. Despite rising tensions, Johansen believes the League Cup final will not go the same way as the Scottish Cup tie – which was the first of what will now be four games between the teams in a short period. ‘It was a weird game, with three red cards and two penalties,’ he said. ‘It affects the game, of course, but I think it will be different this time. I don’ t think what happened on Sunday will affect the final. It’s a new game and a trophy is at stake for the winners. ‘I am just focusing on ourselves. If we go out and play the way we can then we have a great chance.’","Celtic will challenge Virgil van Dijk red card following Calum Butcher clash .

It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for £100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle. He then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq. Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.","Shocking video understood to feature a victim named Ahmed Muhammad .

"The police in Valencia tweeted this week that they would be investigating the ‘crime’ of Vicente del Bosque not having picked enough Valencia players in his 23-man squad. They later tweeted that the World Cup winning coach was ‘beyond reproach’ and ‘thanks to everyone for their sense of humour’. Some had not seen the funny side of the forces of law and order spending time tweeting about the national team but others were too busy agreeing to criticize the tweet. Valencia could easily have had striker Paco Alcacer, midfielder Dani Parejo and defender Jose Gaya in the squad. Likewise Spain’s Premier League contingent could point to Juan Mata, Cesar Azpilicueta and West Ham goalkeeper Adrian as unlucky absentees. Spain's squad trains at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium in Seville ahead of their game against Ukraine . Vicente del Bosque will be hoping to build a new golden generation after Spain's World Cup nightmare . Del Bosque takes training on Thursday ahead of their clash with Ukraine in Group C of Euro 2016 qualifying . Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta in action on the pitch in Seville ahead of the match . The strength of a squad can always be judged by the quality of players that don’t make it and the controversy about this squad selection shows just how Spain’s options should make them optimistic ahead of France 2016. The hangover from their dismal group exit at the last World Cup still hangs over the team but Del Bosque has been at pains to remind everyone this week that they remain European Champions and go to France next year to defend their title. Against Ukraine Iker Casilas looks set to keep his place but David De Gea’s time will come sooner rather than later. In front of the goalkeeper, Spain’s defence tonight against Ukraine brings together Gerard Pique – enjoying his best season for several years – and Sergio Ramos. At full-back Atletico Madrid right-back Juanfran will play on one side and Barcelona’s Jordi Alba on the other side. All four are in the final stages of the Champions League – something that is true of the entire expected XI. Del Bosque has players playing regularly at the highest level for their clubs. Spain's players stand to attention during their training session in Sevill . Iker Casillas is set to retain his place in goal despite a string of mixed displays for club and country . But Casillas is coming under increased pressure at international level from David de Gea (right) (Left-right) David Silva, Vitolo, Santi Cazorla and Alvaro Morata in training for Spain . In the centre of midfield he will pick two from the trio Sergio Busquets, Mario Suarez and Koke. The Atletico Madrid pair could play together if Busquets is still considered not to be 100 per cent having only returned from an ankle injury at the weekend. The three behind the striker are expected to be Andres Iniesta, Isco and Pedro, and in-form Juventus striker Alvaro Morata should lead the line. In the expected XI only Koke, Mario Suarez and Juanfran have not already won the European Cup. And the strength in depth is evident with Cesc Fabregas, David Silva and Santi Cazorla all pushing for a starting berth too. Add to these names, those of the injured Diego Costa, and long term absentees Victor Valdes, Javi Martinez and Thiago, who will return as soon as they start playing for their clubs again and the squad still looks stronger than any other in Europe with the possible exception of the World Champions Germany – no wonder Del Bosque is calling for optimism. If there is a problem it may be the lack of a prolific scorer in Costa’s absence – with 13 goals Manchester City’s Silva is this group’s top scorer but the goals can come from anywhere including the back four, and there is even talk of Del Bosque eventually recalling David Villa so he can win the three remaining caps to take him to 100. Silva is currently Spain's top goal scorer at club level this season in the absence of Diego Costa . Spain forward Alvaro Morata could lead the line on Friday after his good form with Juventus . Sergio Ramos (left) and Cesc Fabregas (right) in training at Sevilla's stadium . Ramos is set to feature in the game just over 10 years after he made his debut for Spain as an 18-year-old . All that remains is to move to the top of the group currently led by Slovakia and to reignite the fire in the supporters who are still having nightmares about the defeat to Holland in Brazil. Spain have never lost at Sevilla’s Sanchez Pizjuan in 24 games played there but on Friday morning were still trying to sell the last 12,000 tickets of the 45,000 on sale for the game. The match will be especially important for defender Ramos who goes back to his home city one day after he clocked up ten years since his first appearance for Spain in a friendly against China aged 18. In that decade, Spain have never lost a competitive home game. He was part of one golden generation – and wants to be part of another. Steady evolution is Del Bosque’s watchword. ‘We kept a solid group of the players that brought us success in the past,’ he said on Thursday. ‘And we have new blood too. If we bring a player in, it’s because we believe in him. It’s not because we are experimenting’.","Spain face Ukraine in Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night in Seville .

"The big challenge for Mauricio Pochettino now is to ensure his first season as Tottenham manager doesn’t fade into obscurity. There looks little danger of that on the evidence of Wednesday night’s win over Swansea. Last week was one to forget following Spurs’ Europa League exit to Fiorentina and Capital One Cup final defeat by Chelsea. Tottenham winger Andros Townsend celebrates after firing home the third goal against Swansea City . Mason’s goal was his first in the Premier League and came in his 20th league game of the season. Pochettino now must concentrate on qualifying for next season’s Champions League; that, after all, was his brief upon taking the job. And his players refused to sulk after their Wembley heartache as goals from Nacer Chadli, Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend secured a vital win, though they were forced to endure a late Swansea rally. ‘We have a group of players whose mentality is to fight until the end of the season,’ said Pochettino. ‘I think in Florence and in the final we deserved more, but we have shown we are alive and growing.’ In front of a procession of Spurs legends, including Alan Mullery, Pat Jennings and Ossie Ardiles, there was a minute’s applause for Tottenham legend Dave Mackay, who passed away this week.

Tottenham and Swansea players join in a minute's applause for legend Mackay, who died on Monday evening . Mackay won the FA Cup with Tottenham three times, in 1961, 1962 and 1967 . The sombre mood carried into the game. But with an outside chance of a top-four finish, Spurs tried to breathe life into their season in the seventh minute when Chadli sent a neat volley past Lukasz Fabianski from Danny Rose’s cross. Finally, there was noise emanating from White Hart Lane. That was quickly replaced by a stunned silence after eyes clocked Gomis, all alone, collapsed in the centre circle. Both sets of medical staff sprinted on to attend to the stricken striker. Gomis received five minutes of treatment. Gradually the worried expressions lifted, a clear sign that this wasn’t as serious an incident as that of Fabrice Muamba’s cardiac arrest at White Hart Lane three years ago. The incident only added to the subdued atmosphere, and when Ki Sung-yueng converted from a tight angle in the 18th minute, the decibel levels — but for a small corner of visiting fans — dropped further. Spurs supporters needn’t have worried, though, as Mason and Townsend scored before the hour. They were, though, forced to endure a hairy final five minutes after Gylfi Sigurdsson smashed home a volley in the 88th minute to set up a grandstand finish. And Hugo Lloris produced a breathtaking save deep into three minutes of stoppage time to ensure Spurs returned to winning ways.

"Martin O'Neill has admitted there are still places up for grabs in his Republic of Ireland team for Sunday's Euro 2016 showdown with Poland. The 63-year-old Ireland boss has spent the last week keeping his fingers crossed over a series of injury doubts, all the while considering options to plug potential gaps in his starting line-up. Everton midfielder Darron Gibson, who would have been in contention for Sunday's qualifier at the Aviva Stadium, has already returned to his club after admitting defeat in his battle against a groin problem, although O'Neill received better news on Friday when full-back Stephen Ward and winger James McClean were both able to train in Malahide. Martin O'Neill has admitted there are still places up for grabs in his Republic of Ireland team . Republic of Ireland's Stephen Quinn and Kevin Doyle during the training session at Gannon Park . However, the team will not be named until the day of the game, and that means there is still time for men to force their way into his plans. O'Neill said: 'I think there are positions up for grabs, like there have always been since I have come here, and I think any international manager would probably tell you exactly the same. 'He's got an idea that he can formulate a couple of weeks beforehand, but the first time that you really consider it is when you have players at your disposal for the week of the game. 'Of course, we have had one or two players who for one reason or another, generally through injury, haven't really been available for the start of the week, so then you have to formulate different ideas, different plans for the players that you think might participate in the game. 'But overall, there have always been positions up for grabs here.' Ward and McClean have both been struggling with ankle problems and while the Wigan winger has been a regular member of the starting XI under O'Neill, it is perhaps the absence of Burnley left-back Ward which would cause him the greater consternation. Marc Wilson can and has played at full-back, although has more recently been employed as a central defender by his country, while Ciaran Clark is also left-sided and could play in both positions. Goalkeeper Shay Given (right) trains alongside fellow stopper David Forde . Republic of Ireland player Daryl Murphy talks to the media during training ahead of the Poland clash . However, there is a school of thought which suggests that any vacancy on the left side of the back four could be filled by Hull winger Robbie Brady, who has operated there in the past for both club and country. Indeed, he scored twice from that position in November's 4-1 friendly victory over the United States in Dublin, and that has not been lost on his manager. O'Neill said: 'He did very well, really well, scored two goals and from that position on the field, was really excellent.' However, Ward's fitness - he has suffered some irritation from screws used to repair his fractured ankle - and readiness to play will be fully assessed before a final decision is taken. O'Neill said: 'I'll have a word with him now and see how he feels. This was the first bit of work that he's done, but we'll see. 'Fitness is very, very important, but sometimes players can get through on adrenaline. You wouldn't want to be going in with four or five players not having done that much, but Stephen knows himself now. If he thinks he can make it, well that's good news for us.' James McClean limped out of training on Tuesday ahead of Republic of Ireland's Euro 2016 clash with Poland . Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane in action as his side prepare for the Group D leaders . Poland currently lead Group D by three points from Germany, Scotland and Ireland, and while O'Neill does not necessarily view Sunday's encounter as a must-win affair, he knows the impetus a victory would give his side. He said: 'Naturally, we are at home and the onus is on us to try to get forward and try to win the game, and that's what we are going to try to do. 'But there are a number of games left in the competition. You mentioned the top two places [qualify] automatically - it's a tough old group we are in, but we are going for it.' Celebrations of Ireland's RBS Six Nations Championship victory last weekend are still very much ongoing, and O'Neill is hoping to take a little of that into the game. He said: 'The Irish rugby team has done fantastically well and maybe we could take something from that. They have given us a lead, let's go and try to continue that.'","Republic of Ireland face Poland in at Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Sunday .

"Arsenal's exit from the Champions League last 16 for the fifth consecutive season on Tuesday has once again exposed the limitations of Arsene Wenger's unbalanced squad. The Gunners came close to making Champions League history by becoming the first team to reverse a two-goal deficit from home but fell just short in their 2-0 victory at the Stade Louis II. Here, Sportsmail identifies nine players in three key areas - goalkeeper, defensive midfielder and centre forward - that could transform the north London side from fading challengers to serious title contenders... Danny Welbeck helps Santi Cazorla off the ground after Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League . Arsene Wenger needs to spend in the summer to address shortcomings in several key areas . Read how Arsene Wenger has gone almost two decades in the Champions League without winning the prize with Arsenal . GOALKEEPERS . PETR CECH . Chelsea . Cost: £20m . Jose Mourinho says it will cost 'huge money' for Cech who at 32 is still reliable and a calming influence. The £20m price tag is too high and you get the impression for any other club Cech would cost less. The figures and Cech's age will act as a deterrent for the normally cash-conscious Arsene Wenger. However, if Cech's experience prevented Champions League quarter-final, first-leg displays such as the one against Monaco it's a deal worth considering. Petr Cech has a cut a disconsolate figure after losing his place to Thibaut Courtois this season . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says second choice Cech will only leave Stamford Bridge for 'huge money' BERND LENO . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: £12m . Arsenal have a keen interest in the 23-year-old German Under 21 international. He already has good experience despite his age, having made his Champions League debut against Chelsea in 2011 at 19. Arsenal scouts watching his team-mate Lars Bender have been impressed and Leno is interested in a move. His contract runs to 2018 but he said: 'The foreign option is certainly appealing. A new language, a new culture - that I could definitely even imagine.' Bayer Leverkusen stopper Bernd Leno has impressed Arsenal scouts and is open to a move abroad . MATTIA PERIN . Genoa . Cost: £16m . Arsenal have pondered the experience of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas, the promise of Mainz's Loris Karius but Mattia Perin at Genoa keeps cropping up on their scouting lists. He is 22 and tipped to become the new Gianluigi Buffon but Arsenal have watched him for three years now. Liverpool have also considered him as have Inter Milan. Another option with Premier League experience and at a similar price who has been discussed is Asmir Begovic of Stoke City. Mattia Perin has been tipped to become 'the next Gianluigi Buffon' and is also wanted by Liverpool . DEFENSIVE MIDFIELDERS . LARS BENDER . Bayer Leverkusen . Cost: £22m . Arsenal have considered moves for Bender over the past few seasons and his injury record plus Leverkusen's reluctance to deal has stalled discussions. This season has been one of his best however and he is back in their thinking. Only problem is he is now also on the lists of Manchester United and Barcelona, who want him when their transfer ban is lifted next January. A stylish and strong player who could add much-needed discipline to the squad. Germany midfielder Lars Bender has been a long-term target but Bayer Leverkusen are reluctant to sell . MORGAN SCHNEIDERLIN . Southampton . Cost: £30m . The favoured choice of Arsene Wenger, Schneiderlin is expected to be the subject of an early summer bid from Arsenal. Southampton want him to stay but have already earmarked certain players to replace him should he go. Tottenham, Manchester United and Liverpool have also looked at the 25-year-old France international, who is one of the league's best midfielders. Mauricio Pochettino could prove an obstacle but Champions League qualification may be the key. Arsenal are expected to resume their chase for Southampton holding midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (left) The France international has emerged as one of the Premier League's best midfielders in recent seasons . JAMES McCARTHY . Everton . Cost: £30m . Everton do not wish to sell but McCarthy is a player Arsenal like a lot. Tottenham's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell also has the Republic of Ireland international high on his wishlist and the north London neighbours will test Everton's resolve as they formalise summer plans. McCarthy is still only 24 but has plenty of experience at domestic and international level. Highly regarded by his team-mates and coaches alike, he can also play a more advanced role if required. James McCarthy is an unexpected name who could shore up the centre of Arsenal's midfield . CENTRE FORWARDS . MARIO MANDZUKIC . Atletico Madrid . Cost: £20m . Aggressive, skilful and a goalscorer. Mandzukic is a handful on and off the pitch but he would give Arsenal the edge they lack. He fell out with Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and his relationship with Diego Simeone is now said to be strained. His representatives have already sounded out Premier League clubs and he seems intent on a move to England. Wenger wanted him last summer but the Croat was keen to replace Diego Costa at Atletico. Mario Mandzukic (left), being replaced by Fernando Torres, has fallen out of favour at Atletico Madrid . ALEXANDRE LACAZETTE . Lyon . Cost: £25m . Cash-strapped Lyon are doing their best to hike up the price of their star striker and he seems intent on leaving with Manchester City and Liverpool also among clubs to have checked on him this season. He has 26 goals in 28 games despite a run of just two in his last four. Still only 23, Lacazette can play off either wing and act as a foil to a big target man. Fits Arsenal's style and life with Wenger would be a big pull for the ambitious Frenchman. The 23-year-old Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette has scored 26 goals in 28 games this season . EDINSON CAVANI . Paris Saint-Germain . Cost: £35m . Cavani has been looking for a move away from Paris for the past year. His representatives held talks with Manchester United last year and he was keen to join prior to David Moyes departing. He split from his agent and is now looked after by his brother. All the Premier League big guns have been contacted and Arsenal are interested although the cost and wages would be high. Other options exist such as Palermo's Paulo Dybala but he is keen to stay in Italy. PSG striker Edinson Cavani would bring goals but comes with high wages and an expensive price tag . The Uruguay striker was part of the PSG side that sent Chelsea out of the Champions League .","Arsenal dumped out of Champions League last 16 for fifth year in a row .

"A video has emerged believed to show ISIS executioner Jihadi John ranting on camera shortly after he arrived in Syria from the UK. The footage is of two bands of fanatical fighters joining forces in 2013 under the command of notorious terrorist Omar al-Shishani. At the front stands a man thought to be Mohammed Emwazi - the west Londoner last week unmasked as the killer of Western hostages in a series of videos which have shocked the world. A man thought to be Jihadi John proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013. The video is thought to be the first known appearance by the executioner now unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi . The video is thought to have been filmed  just months after Emwazi is understood to have fled Britain to take up arms alongside the extremists. It shows a pledge of allegiance made when the so-called 'Army of Muhammad Brigades' group joined forces with the so-called 'Brigade of Migrants', of which Emwazi is believed to have been a member. The speaker proclaims: 'This army announces unity within its ranks for the sake of implementing the Shariah and returning this blessed land to God the most glorified and the most high under the leadership of the emir Umar al-Shishani.' Emwazi, now 26, attempted to join al-Shabaab in Somalia after finishing his university course in London in 2009, but was refused entry to Tanzania and  returned to Britain, from where he later went to Syria. He is thought to have been in a group who were among the first to go to fight in the Middle East, along with fellow Londoners Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, Choukri Ellekhlifi and Mohammad el-Araj. Ellekhlifi was two years above Emwazi in his north London school, Quinton Kynaston Academy, and later became part of a robbery gang which carried out a series of raids in central London. Ellekhlifi, 22, fled to Syria while on bail and was killed fighting near Aleppo in August 2013, months after the video thought to feature Emwazi was filmed. El-Araj, 23, was killed two weeks later during a firefight. Al-Mazwagi, from North London was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. Emwazi was last week unmasked as the killer who carried as series of beheadings of Western hostages . In the film, the man thought to be Emwazi stands in front of notorious terror leader Omar al-Shishani (right) Emwazi's links to the London crime gang meant he had developed a love of violence, which led to him being chosen to feature in the beheading videos for which is now known throughout the world. In the latest video, the man suspected of being Emwazi stands at the front of a long line of gun-toting militants, with al-Shishani standing behind him arm-in-arm with two other fighters. Commenting on the likenesses of Emwazi to the speaking in the latest video to emerge, Raffaello Pantucci of the Royal United Service Institute told MailOnline: 'Given he’s masked, it is difficult to make the precise connection between the two, though there are definite similarities. 'Given the group and community that Emwazi came from – the West London group - were all alongside the Katiba al Muhajireen under Omar al Shishani, it might well fit that it could be Emwazi. 'Given his solid Arabic and his willingness to be front and centre in films, it would fit that it could be him. Al Shishani seems to have been quite willing to record films of himself with his foreign fighter warriors.' Charles Winter from the Quilliam Foundation added: 'There are certainly similarities between Emwazi and the man speaking in this video, the eyebrows for example. 'In terms of the group, we know that it has a large proportion of foreign fighters so there's a possibility that he could have joined but I'm unable to say whether it is definitely him. The video shows a pledge of allegiance to Omar al-Shishani, now a commander of ISIS in Syria . Emwazi is thought to a fighter (second right beneath flag) who appears in another photo featuring al-Shishani . Mr Winter added: 'While he does have certain features that resemble Emwazi, there have been numerous false alarms with ID-ing ""Jihadi John"" in the past. A balaclava does a lot to obscure one's face, and a lot to make people look similar, too.' Others have cast doubt on whether the man is Emwazi, saying the speaker in the film looks shorter than the Londoner and appears to be holding the Kalashnikov rifle with his right hand, whereas Jihadi John held his knife in his left hand. If the video does show Emwazi, the footage would be the first known time he appeared on camera in Syria after going to fight. It is believed he was one of more than 700 fighters in The Migrants Brigade who arrived in the Middle East three years ago. The group were not part of ISIS at the time the video was filmed, but joined the group in the months that followed. Emwazi has since become one the world's most wanted men after he appeared in a series of gruesome videos beheading a series of foreign hostages, including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Mohammed Emwazi is believed to have among a group of Brits, which also includes Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (left), Choukri Ellekhlifi (centre) and Mohammad el-Araj (right), who were among the first to travel to Syria to fight . Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (centre), the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, is pictured here with Abu Omar al-Shishani (right), one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani has  moved from the conflicts of the Caucasus, south of Russia to become one of the most feared commanders in the ISIS army now terrorising Syria and Iraq . Omar al-Shishani, whose real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, is an ethnic Chechen from the Caucasus nation of Georgia, specifically from the Pankisi Valley, a centre of Georgia's Chechen community and once a stronghold for militants. He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis. After recuperating and being refused re-enlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010. Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012 to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict. The red-bearded fanatic became the commander of the Brigade of Migrants, which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form the Army of Emigrants and Supporters, a larger and more structured group with a religious council. In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and has become the group's military commander in Syria, leading it on an offensive to take over a broad stretch of territory leading to the Iraq border. Numerous reports of his death since then are thought to be untrue.","Video shows two bands of militants joining forces during Syrian war .

"Gareth Bale hit the post with an effort from around 50 yards out during Real Madrid's 1-0 defeat by Athletic Bilbao on Saturday evening but the question is: Did he mean it? With the Spanish giants trailing 1-0 at San Mames, the Welshman produced what looked like an audacious repeat of David Beckham's famous lob for Manchester United against Wimbledon back in 1996. The ball flew through the air and caught Bilbao goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz completely off guard before dipping and smacking the post; much to the disappointment of Javier Hernandez who raised his arms to celebrate before being beaten to the rebound by a defender.

Whether Bale meant it or not, had the ball sailed in it would surely have been up there with some of the wideman's finest strikes. Beckham's successful attempt from such a distance is one of the finest, most memorable goals of the Premier League era. Aged just 21, Beckham received the ball in his own half and spotted Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan off his line before producing a stunning strike from the halfway line which flew perfectly into the back of the net. Meanwhile, defeat for Carlo Ancelotti's side on Saturday means Barcelona can leapfrog Los Blancos at the top of the La Liga table with a win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.

"David Luiz will be back, raising one of the biggest cheers of the night, and, unlike last year, Zlatan Ibrahimovich will take centre stage, but when Chelsea take on Paris St Germain at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night, the stakes will go beyond merely contesting the right to play in the Champions League quarter finals . Laurent Blanc’s future as manager at PSG will hang in the balance, as will the competing philosophies at the respective clubs. In a battle of old money versus new money it’s not often Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea are consigned to the former category, the frugal, traditional team taking on the gaudy spendthrifts. Laurent Blanc's position as PSG manager is under threat despite domestic dominance in France . Branislav Ivanovic's crucial away goal has given Chelsea the edge in the tie ahead of Wednesday's game . But with Chelsea having grown out of their own age of extravagance, it is Qatari-backed PSG who have fallen foul of UEFA’s new Financial Fair Play rules. When Jose Mourinho makes his barbed comments about clubs which ‘think they can over-ride what Financial Fair Play says’ he has PSG in his sights as much as Manchester City. And perhaps understandably so; despite being fined, like Manchester City, £49 million for breaching the FFP rules, told by UEFA to break even by 2016, to not increase their wage bill and to limit transfers, the club managed to spend £43m on Luiz. And, according to reports in France, the club’s provisional budget for turnover next season has risen again to £350million after increased sponsorship deals with Nike, Emirates, Nivea, Huawei, Pure Essential and Mumm – all in addition to the disputed £150m four-year deal they have with the Qatar Tourist Authority, which UEFA refused to accept was a fair market price for a secondary sponsor. Jose Mourinho has complained about the Paris club's extensive spending, but FFP has had little impact . Former France defender Blance knows his bosses expect the team to progress beyond the last 16 . PSG captain Thiago Silva has spoken of his desire for the club to challenge Europe's major powers . All of which leads the club to believe that their dream of winning the Champions League within the next few years can be achieved. ‘I do not think the project here is stalling at all, it was always going to be a big project,’ said Thiago Silva, captain and Luiz’s defensive partner. ‘The owners aim is to have us on the same level as Real Madrid and Bayern. We know that we have the players to be able to win the Champions League, and even with the very difficult game against Chelsea - we have to believe that this year can be our year.’ That goal appeared a distinct possibility when Carlo Ancelotti’s side ran Barcelona close in the Champions League quarter finals in 2013, being knocked out on away goals. And when they beat Chelsea 3-1 at Parc de Princes in the first leg of the quarter final meeting last year, they appeared to be continuing their growth. But a 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge saw them ejected from the competition and they are now are in danger of exiting in the last 16. Silva praised the professionalism of his team-mate, and former Chelsea defender, David Luiz (right) Luiz was on the other side when the teams met in the quarter final last year, when Chelsea progressed . PSG will take heart from the first leg in Parc des Princes, where Chelsea were hanging on to the 1-1 draw by the end and the fact that last year PSG were missing an injured Ibrahimovich at Stamford Bridge. ‘We are better equipped than last year to beat Chelsea,’ said Thiago Silva. ‘Even if you look at the game in Paris, we were the better team no doubt. If it was not for an unbelievable performance from their goalkeeper we would have won the game and would be travelling to London with the lead, we must take heart from that. ‘David Luiz is very excited to go back to Chelsea. He had great memories there, he helped them to win the Champions League - so I would be very surprised if the Chelsea fans gave him anything other than a fantastic reception. Javier Pastore looked to have given PSG a winning lead in the first leg last season, but Chelsea hit back . Demba Ba's last-gasp goal put Chelsea through, but PSG are confident they can win this time around . Lionel Messi scores against PSG in 2013, when it looked like the French side were on the brink of Europe's elite . 'He is a winner though, yes he has good memories of Chelsea, but his only objective will be to knock them out - and for us to progress.’ Blanc’s future remains uncertain. Though form has improved since the embarrassing 4-2 defeat at Bastia at the turn of the year and despite thrashing Lens on Saturday, Lyon will overtake them if they win at Montpellier on Sunday. They knocked Monaco out of the domestic cup last week to reach the semi-finals and are in the French League Cup final – but give that their budget is more than three times the size of Lyon, even a domestic treble may not save Blanc. With Diego Simeone looking likely to sign a new deal with Atletico Madrid, Rafa Benitez and Jurgen Klopp look the most likely candidates to take over form Blanc for next season. And should PSG’s European dream die on Wednesday in London, Europe’s leading coaches can expect to be fielding fresh inquiries from the Qatari owners.","PSG owners have invested hugely in squad without European success .
French club went out to Chelsea in quarter finals last year .
Laurent Blanc's side are top of Ligue 1 and on course for a domestic treble .
But unless they win at Stamford Bridge Frenchman could be out of a job ."
"It has been a trying start to the year for Gareth Bale at Real Madrid, with the crowd at the Santiago Bernabeu twice jeering him for his supposed selfishness on the pitch. It appears the incidents, against Espanyol on January 10 and Real Sociedad on January 31, have impacted Bale's performances. Statistics show that since the second time Bale was booed, he has shot at goal 12 times in 450 minutes in La Liga, which averages out as one attempt every 37.5 minutes.

Before that game, Bale  shot at goal every 22.9 minutes. The Wales international first incurred the wrath of the Madrid faithful by not threading the ball into Cristiano Ronaldo to send him through on goal in the 3-0 victory over Espanyol. Three weeks later, the whistles returned, despite Bale helping Madrid to a 4-1 win over David Moyes' side in the absence of Ronaldo, who was suspended. The incident that aggravated a tempestuous Madrid crowd in that match was when Bale nipped in front of James Rodriguez to meet a Karim Benzema pass, only to skew his shot wide of the post with the goal gaping.

"On the way home from Old Trafford on Monday night, the debate, as it turned out, was the wrong debate. Should Danny Welbeck have been sold to Arsenal last summer? Should he have celebrated his winning goal back in Manchester? Both questions were irrelevant. Welbeck is an honest and talented footballer but he wouldn’t make a difference to Louis van Gaal’s United. He is good without being really good. Danny Welbeck shoots to score the winning goal against Manchester United on Monday night at Old Trafford . A stranded David de Gea (right) looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former United player Welbeck . Welbeck celebrated his goal against his former club as Arsenal won the FA Cup tie 2-1 . Welbeck is swamped by his Arsenal team-mates on a night to forget for United supporters . United manager Louis van Gaal (left) and assistant Ryan Giggs watch on during their latest defeat . Welbeck, whose international record is better than his club record, scored a well-taken and well-anticipated goal on Monday and celebrated appropriately. His overall performance, though, was modest. Had he been playing in red rather than in blue and yellow, the result would not have been different. On Tuesday Welbeck said: ‘Manchester United is a club that means so much to me. I’m a fan and it’s hard to knock them out. I’ll always respect the fans. I had a lovely reception and I’m thankful for that.’ But United’s problems under Van Gaal go much deeper than any associated with his decision last August to sell a player he figured — with reason — would have been his fourth-choice centre forward. Van Gaal cut a frustrated figure during the match as he and his team lost their last chance of a trophy . United's (left to right) Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney look frustrated on the pitch . Tactical genius? Not quite. Louis van Gaal received 3/10 for his tactics on Monday night, but what about the players? CLICK HERE FOR FULL RATINGS . The most telling moments of this FA Cup tie came in the second half. It was a close game at that point. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will have been disappointed his team had conceded an equaliser so carelessly so soon after taking the lead but at half-time he appeared to tell his team to continue in the same vein. Van Gaal, however, sniffed danger, or thought he did. He made two substitutions, neither of them positive, and that seemed indicative of a coach unsure of his players and unconvinced by his original plan. He did a similar thing at Swansea recently and United lost that one, too. Later, with United chasing in the wake of Welbeck’s goal and Angel di Maria’s sending-off, Van Gaal pushed Marouane Fellaini — and, soon after, Chris Smalling — to the top of the United formation and asked them to feed off a diet of long balls pumped from their own half. Angel di Maria is sent off by referee Michael Oliver after the midfielder grabbed the official's shirt . Di Maria applauds the United supporters after being sent off for manhandling the referee during the tie . Radamel Falcao sits on the bench next to Juan Mata as the on-loan striker went unused against Arsenal . Van Gaal issues instructions alongside Giggs but their tactics and substitutions were questionable . With their exit from the FA Cup against Arsenal, Manchester United's attention now rests solely on the Premier League. Yet United haven't beaten a side currently in the top half since their home win against Liverpool in mid December last year. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY . This is a valid tactic and one that worked at West Ham last month. Fellaini, in particular, can be strangely effective in that role. Nevertheless, while this was going on, United’s Spanish playmaker Juan Mata and their Colombian centre forward Radamel Falcao sat in the dug-out. They were still there when an aimless hoof from Phil Jones rolled out of play for a goal-kick and referee Michael Oliver signalled the end of the game. This, perhaps, is most damning. Van Gaal’s tactical preferences can be discussed all night long. United, whether they knew it or not, hired a pragmatist last summer and it is that side of the manager that the supporters are seeing now. More pertinent is the fact that one of European football’s leading coaches decided — at the sharp end of a home cup tie that he knew his team must win — to put his trust in some Hackney Marshes football rather than ask two players in whom his club has invested millions of pounds to go on and change the game through method and design. It is a strange state of affairs and one that tells us Van Gaal has limited faith in his players. It also points to problems that will greatly affect United’s transfer strategy this summer. Calum Chambers of Arsenal competes for the ball with Adnan Januzaj and Marouane Fellaini . Van Gaal knows he has to look for a new right back, central defender, holding midfielder and forward . Van Gaal's tactics have been questionable this season since he came to United as manager . They’re out of the FA Cup and Manchester United face the hardest run-in of the top-four hopefuls...

Van Gaal knows he needs a right back, central defender, holding midfielder and a centre forward. That is probably about £150million right there. The Dutch coach also knows, however, that he needs to ease out some very big names to make that happen. Van Gaal has to make decisions about Mata, Falcao, Robin van Persie and Rafael da Silva and that is before he addresses the issue of whether less glamorous types such as Jones, Smalling and Jonny Evans are evergoing to mature into footballers good enough to help United back to the top of the Premier League. Van Gaal has spoken many times about his squad lacking balance. What he has been understandably less candid about is the fact that it is just not good enough. There are problems with players such as Di Maria that need time and tactical tuning to address. There is, at least, no doubt about his quality. The cross he delivered for Wayne Rooney to equalise on Monday was evidence of that. Di Maria is not the issue. It is the supporting cast — such as Adnan Januzaj and Ashley Young — that Van Gaal remains unsure about. At Arsenal, Wenger has his critics. His team remain skittish and unpredictable. Nobody can accuse the Arsenal manager of not knowing his own mind, however. There is a methodical consistency about Wenger that, for better or for worse, is clear from the way he chooses and sets up his teams. The same cannot be said about Van Gaal. At the United training ground on Wednesday, the increasingly irritable manager will be looking for something new, trying to find yet another way of turning water into wine before Sunday’s home game with Tottenham. What is unclear though, is whether this constant changing of personnel and tactics tells us more about the limitations of the manager or the players. Arsenal applaud their travelling fans at the Theatre of Dreams after claiming victory over United .

"Graphic video footage has emerged of three Los Angeles police officers shooting dead a homeless man on a sidewalk in broad daylight after shouting 'drop the gun!' The clip, described by an LAPD commander as 'disturbing', was posted online within a few hours of Sunday's incident by the passer-by who filmed it. It comes in the wake of several fatal  shootings in the US by on-duty police officers. At the start of the footage four officers are seen struggling to apprehend a man on Skid Row, an area in LA where many of the city's homeless stay. He is seen wheeling around trying to strike the officers. They eventually wrestle him to the ground amid a collection of sleeping bags as two more officers sprint to the scene. While two police detain a nearby female who picked up one of their dropped batons, another can be heard shouting: 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' Scroll down for videos . Shot dead: Los Angeles police were seen shooting dead a homeless man on Sunday at midday . Altercation: At the beginning of the clip, the man is seeing taking swings at several police officers on Skid Row . Two officers then breakaway to subdue a woman who had picked up one of their dropped batons as their colleagues struggle with the violent man . A Taser is heard being discharged before five gun shots are fired, leaving the man lying motionless, face down. The three officers, one of whom is a sergeant, shot the man as they struggled on the ground for control of one of the police officer's weapons, after a stun gun proved ineffective, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. They were answering a report of a robbery at midday on Sunday. Smith said the department was aware of the video, and would attempt to amplify its sound and pictures to figure out exactly what happened. 'The video is disturbing,' Smith said at a briefing with reporters late Sunday night. 'It's disturbing any time anyone loses their life. It's a tragedy.' Smith said at least one of the officers was also wearing a body camera. The homeless man, who has not been formally identified, was later declared dead at a hospital. Confronted: He was being confronted over an alleged robbery inquiry before five shots were fired . The three officers, one of whom is a sergeant, shot the man as they struggled on the ground for control of one of the police officer's weapons, after a stun gun proved ineffective, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said . The fatal shooting took place in Skid Row at lunchtime on Sunday . The shooting in Skid Row came during a national debate about police use of force after several killings by on-duty police officers. In November rookie cop Peter Liang shot dead an unarmed black man, Akai Gurley, as they patrolled a housing estate in Brooklyn, New York. Police claim that Liang appeared to accidentally fire a shot when he was about 10 feet from the 28-year-old without saying a word. Prosecutors alleged that Liang's first concern was that he 'was going to be fired' while Mr Gurley's friend fought alone to keep him alive and was forced to find a neighbor to call 911. He has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter. The killings of two unarmed blacks by white police officers in Missouri and New York last summer touched off protests over police conduct that intensified after grand juries refused to indict the officers. Tensions escalated further after two New York City police officers were killed by a man who suggested in online posts that their deaths were in retaliation for the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City. The gunman committed suicide. Garner, who was put in a chokehold by an officer, was heard gasping, 'I can't breathe' before he lost consciousness and later died. Black teenager Brown, 18, was shot and killed by white officer Darren Wilson, who claimed he was acting in self-defense. The shooting set off days of racially-charged protests. The violence Sunday had echoes of the August shooting by Los Angeles police of 25-year-old Ezell Ford, whose death in a struggle with officers brought demonstrations in the city. Ford was unarmed, but police officers said he was shot only after reaching for an officer's gun. On the video,  shot by a man called Anthony Blackburn, witnesses yell: 'Motherf***er! Motherf***er! They just killed that man!' as more officers pull up and order the crowds to disperse. 'Ain't nobody got no motherf***ing gun!' shouted one witness as he filmed the incident, which took place in front of the Union Rescue Mission, 545 S. San Pedro St. Mr Blackburn's video had been viewed 4.3 million times over the first 12 hours that it was posted. Witnesses told the Los Angeles Times that the man is known on the street in the area as 'Africa,' and that he had been there for four or five months after spending time in a mental health institute. One witness, Jose Gil, 38, told the Times he saw the man swinging at police then heard one of them shout, 'he's got my gun!' before the shots were fired. Dennis Horne, 29, said the man had been fighting with someone else in his tent before officers arrived. 'It's sad,' Horne said. 'There's no justification to take somebody's life.' Pastor Wayne Gaddis, president of the Baptist Convention, President of the California Missionary Baptist State Convention, told CBS Los Angeles: 'We do not support police brutality. But we do support the police department. Tents and cardboard shelters cover the sidewalks of Skid Row, the downtown neighborhood where an estimated 1,700 homeless people live. Many of them struggle with mental illness and addiction. Police Commission President Steve Soboroff said the independent inspector general and the district attorney had all begun investigating the incident. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, head of the activist group the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, called on the Police Commission to hold special hearing on use of force by officers in Skid Row encounters. Hutchinson said in a statement that the shooting 'underscores the need for the police commission to hold a special hearing to fully examine police tactics and training in the use of deadly force by LAPD officers involving skid row residents many of whom have major mental challenges.' Other recent deaths during police actions in New York and in Ferguson, Missouri, and the lack of prosecution of the officers involved, have brought nationwide protest. The violence Sunday had echoes of the August shooting by Los Angeles police of 25-year-old Ezell Ford, whose death in a struggle with officers brought demonstrations in the city. Ford was unarmed, but police officers said he was shot only after reaching for an officer's gun. Police guard the scene of the fatal shooting in downtown Los Angeles .","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Real Madrid were beaten 1-0 by Athletic Bilbao at San Mames on Saturday meaning if Barcelona beat Rayo Vallecano Sunday lunchtime they will move to the top of La Liga. Gareth Bale hit the post from 50 yards out but it was the closest Carlo Ancelotti’s team came as an Aritz Aduriz header in the first half was enough to give Athletic a famous victory that could seriously derail Real Madrid’s title charge. They started brightly enough with Karim Benzema swapping passes with Marcelo and crossing for Ronaldo, only for Xabier Etxieta’s clearance to stop the ball reaching Madrid’s top scorer.

Subs not used: Aurtenetxe, Gomez, Remiro Gargallo, Lopez Cabrera . Bookings: Gurpegi, Etxeita, Aduriz . Goal: Aduriz, 26. Real Madrid: Casillas, Carvajal, Varane, Pepe, Marcelo, Illarramendi (Jese, 71), Isco, Kroos (Borges, 76), Ronaldo, Bale, Benzema (Hernandez, 80). Subs not used: Coentrao, Khedira, Navas, Nacho. Bookings: Marcelo, Illaremedi, Kroos, Isco. Att: 51,000 . Athletic had been on a good run with two league wins and a cup semi-final victory and they were soon into their stride with forwards Iñaki Williams and Aduriz stretching a Madrid defence under-protected by a midfield still missing Luka Modric who will not be back until midweek in the Champions League. When Athletic’s goal came it was that midfield weakness that created the opening. Mikel Rico had all the time and space he wanted to cross for Aduriz and the on-form centre-forward rose to head home his 18th goal of the season. Isco should have got across to Rico more quickly. Pepe might also be disappointed he was beaten so easily by Aduriz in the air, but the Athletic striker, who scored twice in midweek to put Athletic in the Cup Final, is on such good form that there is talk of a Spain call-up despite his 34 years. He hung for a moment in the air having got in front of the Real Madrid defender and powered his header past Iker Casillas. Real looked disjointed all over the pitch. Toni Kroos kicked-out at Andoni Iraola and was booked and Asier Illaramendi was yellow carded shortly afterwards for a foul on Iker Muniain. Athletic also had Aduriz and Etxeita booked but they were keeping their heads and their shape better than their rivals. Madrid raised the tempo in the second half and Bale lead the assault on Athletic’s goal. When he tricked his way down the right and pulled the ball back from the byline it looked like producing the equalizer. But before Ronaldo could sweep the ball home from three yards out Gorka Iraizoz got a hand to the cross to divert it to safety.

Isco forced a save from Iraizoz after taking a pass from Ronaldo but Athletic were keeping the European Champions at bay. Their keeper was making sure of it charging off his line to deny Benzema with Real’s next chance. Carlo Ancelotti took his time to make his first change and when it came it was a brave one. Winger Jese Rodriguez replace midfielder Illaramendi and Real went from 4-3-3 to 4-2-4 with Bale and Jese on the flanks and Ronaldo and Benzema through the middle. Ronaldo claimed a penalty when he tumbled over Iraizoz but the referee was right to call it Athletic’s way. Aduriz then went close with a header at the other end. Both Kroos and Williams were replaced by their respective managers with 15 minutes left. Williams had run himself into the ground; Kroos has been running himself into the ground for weeks and desperately needs to be rested. Despite the changes threir was still no way through for Real Madrid and Ancelotti played his last card replacing Benzema with Javier Hernandez.

"Tottenham scouts are monitoring Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette. The much-coveted 23-year-old has been in excellent form this season with 24 goals in all competitions. The France international has scored an impressive 13 goals in his last 11 games, although he has drawn a blank in the last two of those.

Newcastle United attempted to sign him last year but he is keen to move to a side that can compete in the Champions League.

"Two of Europe's top clubs are in crisis as Real Madrid fell to a 1-0 loss at Athletic Bilbao and AC Milan could only manage a 2-2 draw with Verona. The results leave Carlo Ancelotti's men top, but just two points ahead of a Barcelona side who have a game in hand, while Filippo Inzaghi's Milan are 10th in Serie A with just eight wins in their 26 league matches. The Sunday papers in Spain and Italy have not held back in their criticism of the teams, with Corriere dello Sport's headline reading: 'No future for Inzaghi'. In Spain, 'Freefall' is the headline in Marca. 'No future for Inzaghi' reads the headline in Sunday's Corriere dello Sport after AC Milan drew 2-2 with Verona . AC Milan have struggled for the entirety of this season, and Inzaghi himself was coy about his future after the match. Corriere carry a quote from the former Milan player: 'Will I stay? I'm not the one to ask,' while Gazzetta Sportiva quote Pippo as saying: 'We gave away a goal like fools. I go forward with my head held high.' Nico Lopez was the scorer of Verona's all-important equaliser, in the 95th minute of the match. As Sportiva point out, he was the man who scored the goal against Inter Milan that led to the sacking of Walter Mazzarri in 2014. There is crisis at two of Europe's biggest clubs as both AC Milan (left) and Real Madrid (right) failed to win . Over in Spain, Marca claim Madrid lacked ideas and character as they collapsed at San Mames. Despite being top of the league, there are high expectations from fans of Los Blancos, and the 1-0 loss to Bilbao was far from good enough. Aritz Aduriz scored the only goal of the game to 'turn La Liga upside down', and Ancelotti said post-match, 'it's quite confusing what we are doing in attack.' 'There it goes!' reads the headline in Sunday's AS, and they claim Barcelona will 'go out like a motorbike against Rayo', whom they play on Sunday lunchtime. Barcelona can go top of La Liga if they win their game in hand against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday lunchtime . Barcelona can go top of La Liga for the first time in 16 games with a win, and should that happen Ancelotti will have a real problem on his hands.

"The teams on the fringe of the race for European places next season have been given a boost by the FA Cup semi-final draw. After Arsenal and Liverpool were kept apart, a final between the two could result in an extra Europa League place being awarded to the Premier League.

With Chelsea winning the latter competition and all but guaranteed a top-four finish, their spot would go to the team who finish sixth. In the FA Cup, if the winners have already qualified for Europe via the League, their place goes to the runners-up.

"It's deja vu all over again for Arsenal in the Champions League. Tuesday night's brave but preventable Champions League exit against Monaco was the fifth time in a row Arsene Wenger has been knocked out at the last-16 stage. And once again it was the first leg that cost him. Arsenal were knocked out in France on away goals, a 2-0 away win failing to make up for a catastrophic 3-1 loss at The Emirates. Their players know the history. 'We say same thing every year,’ complained defender Laurent Koscielny. 'Our first game is catastrophic. We have to put it right - play well in two games.' Arsene Wenger vents his frustration on the sideline as Arsenal fall a goal short in their 2-0 win over Monaco . Aaron Ramsey made an immediate impact off the bench and scored but couldn't help the Gunners advance . Monaco celebrate advancing to the Champions League quarter finals as Arsenal fall again in the last 16 . Aaron Ramsey concurred: ‘We’ve always gone out to Bayern Munich and Barcelona at this stage but no disrespect to Monaco, we thought we’d have a good opportunity to qualify. But we gave ourselves a tough test from the first leg. It’s nearly again, but it’s not enough.’ After losing 4-3 on aggregate to Barcelona in 2011 – beating them 2-1 in the first leg before losing 3-1 at the Nou Camp - Arsenal's first leg travails have hurt them every 12 months.

(AC Milan win 4-3 on aggregate) Arsenal were a shambles in the San Siro as Kevin-Prince Boateng, Robinho (two) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (from the penalty spot) tore them apart. Incredibly, Arsene Wenger's men clawed back three of the goals in the first half at The Emirates through Laurent Koscielny, Tomas Rosicky and Robin van Persie (penalty) but still couldn't force extra-time with Robin van Persie missing from close range. Where did it all go wrong? Fans will remember the Van Persie miss (perhaps coloured by the player's subsequent exit), but it was the mental collapse in the first leg that cost Arsenal. The first goal was spectacular, if avoidable, but the other three were brutally poor defending. Against a decent, but not world-beating attack, the likes of Johan Djourou proved they didn't belong.

Bayern ended up winning the Champions League . Where did it all go wrong? It's a little harsh to criticise a defeat against Europe's best side, but Arsenal were naive in the first leg. Having weathered a Bayern storm, and found a way back into the tie at 2-1, the Gunners committed too many men forward, and conceded a sloppy third.

Where did it all go wrong? Mesut Ozil's missed penalty was the turning point. Before that point they had bossed the game against the European champions. It took the wind out of their sails, and Bayern eventually produced their magic. Wojchiech Szczesny brings down Arjen Robben, as Bayern once again sealed a first-leg lead .

"When Sunderland manager Gus Poyet lost his temper and took out his anger on a cooler box before picking a fight with Hull City boss Steve Bruce, it brought back memories of many a touchline scrap. The technical area of the KC Stadium seems to have a way of bringing out the worst in managers - only last year Alan Pardew attempted a headbutt on Hull's David Meyler. So, with Tuesday night's flare-up in mind, Sportsmail looks back at our top 10 technical area spats. Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland's Gus Poyet played down their spat and have now shaken hands . Bruce is held back by the assistant referee during his clash with Poyet on the touchline . Things turned sour when Bruce and Poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart . As the pair locked horns Bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in Poyet's direction . Alan Pardew swears at Manuel Pellegrini, January 11, 2014 . The sight of a 52-year-old man calling a 60-year-old a 'f***ing old c***' seemed to shock many - and Pardew later apologised for his 'heat-of-the-moment' outburst. A Newcastle goal disallowed for offside while Pellegrini's Manchester City were 1-0 up prompted the row between the two bosses and as the fourth official looked to separate them Pardew had a pop at his opposite number. The FA 'reminded him of his responsibilites' - a bit of a let-off for the man now in charge of Crystal Palace. Alan Pardew (centre) and Manuel Pellegrini clashed over a disallowed goal back in 2014 . Martin Jol and Arsene Wenger let off steam, April 22, 2006 . For such a usually mild-mannered man, Wenger does seem to get into his fair share of rows with other managers - and on this occasion it was Tottenham's Martin Jol. Jol's side refused to put the ball out in the build-up to Robbie Keane scoring an opening goal at Highbury while Arsenal had a man down. This infuriated Wenger, who was challenged on his views by Jol. They were separated by the fourth official but Wenger still had to go back for one last pop at Jol - and he perhaps had the last laugh with Arsenal equalising and eventually pipping Spurs to fourth place in the Premier League by two points. Arsene Wenger (left) and Martin Jol had a disagreement over putting the ball out of play for an injury . Jose Mourinho vs Arsene Wenger, October 5, 2014 . These two have history dating back 11 years, and they still don't seem to get on to this day. Mourinho's arrival in the Premier League back in 2004, when Wenger's Arsenal were champions, heralded the end of the north London club's annual title hopes - and Mourinho certainly has a way of getting under his opposite number's skin. Just over 12 months after his return to the Premier League in 2013 and he was winding up Wenger again. The Frenchman took exception to Gary Cahill's challenge on Alexis Sanchez in a 2-0 Chelsea win at Stamford Bridge and stepped into Mourinho's allocated area. Some verbals from the Special One saw the pair come face-to-face before Wenger pushed the Blues boss in the chest. He later said he had 'nothing to apologise for'. Wenger pushes Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho during Chelsea's clash with Arsenal this season . Mourinho was furious with Wenger's behaviour and even brings up the lack of punishment to this day . The pair have history and have consistently rowed since Mourinho arrived in England back in 2004 . Kenny Dalglish tells Arsene Wenger to 'f*** off', April 17, 2011 . The third of a Wenger trio of incidents - but on this occasion he was remarkably restrained. Arsenal looked to have kept their title hopes alive at the Emirates Stadium with a Robin van Persie penalty eight minutes into stoppage time but Dirk Kuyt kept his cool to slot in a 102nd-minute spot-kick to level things and effectively hand the title to Manchester United. Liverpool manager Dalglish wasn't too happy with Wenger's touchline protests and at the whistle after Kuyt converted he approached the Arsenal boss with his arms outstretched and shouted 'It's a penalty, p*** off!' before adding 'It's a penalty, f*** off!'. It's fair to say he got his point across. David Moyes takes on Roberto Mancini, March 25, 2010 . Moyes was criticised for his lack of results against big clubs but on this occasion his Everton side managed a win at the Etihad Stadium - and wound up his opposite number at the same time. Both managers were sent off following a physical confrontation with Mancini trying to barge Moyes out of the way and then seeing the Scot square up to him. They were escorted down the tunnel by police such was the animosity. However, the pair shook hands after being told they had to share a lift to watch the rest of the game from the upper tier. Awkward. Roberto Mancini pushes David Moyes during their spells as Manchester City and Everton managers . Referee Peter Walton saw the stoppage-time clash worthy of sending both managers to the stands . Ally McCoist and Neil Lennon square up, March 2, 2011 . Old firm clashes always tend to be heated occasions, whether in the stands or on the field, but McCoist and Lennon extended the rowing into the technical area back in 2011. Three red cards, 13 cautions and 34 arrests at Celtic Park told the story of the afternoon and McCoist angered the home dugout with something he said at the final whistle. The two squared up and pushed each other before being pulled apart. McCoist got a two-match ban for his troubles while Lennon's previous record saw him take a four-game suspension, but the Northern Irishman would have been the happier after a 1-0 win. Neil Lennon makes his point clear to Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist on the Celtic Park touchline . Nigel Pearson's grip on James McArthur, February 7, 2015 . Even a month on, nobody really seems to understand what was going through Pearson's head on the touchline at the King Power Stadium. What started out as a jokey exchange suddenly became more sinister as the Leicester boss seemed to pin down the Crystal Palace midfielder by the throat as he looked to resume play with a throw-in. The fact that Pearson had failed in a bid to sign McArthur a few months back added to the confusion. Pearson appeared to grab McArthur around the throat and the floored player was seen mouthing 'get off me'. Things got even more strange in the aftermath when Pearson dismissed the incident as 'light-hearted' and told journalists that he could 'look after himself' and then seemed close to the sack before eventually keeping his job. Nigel Pearson clashed with James McArthur when Leicester hosted Crystal Palace last month . Leicester City boss Pearson (left) appears to put his hands towards the neck of  McArthur in February . Jose Mourinho's gouge on Tito Vilanova, August 17, 2011 . It's a rare occasion that the Special One admits he was in the wrong, but he did here, which gives you an idea of how shameful his actions were towards Pep Guardiola's then-assistant. During a familiar Spanish Super Cup El Clasico clash, Mourinho stole up behind Vilanova while a touchline row was already going on and jabbed a finger into his eye. Vilanova shoved back and both were handed bans. 'I should not have done what I did, obviously not,' Mourinho later said. 'The person who messed up there was me.' Joe Jordan rows with Gennaro Gattuso, February 16, 2011 . Recognised as two hard-nuts of the game, not many people were keen to get between Gattuso and Jordan as they rowed at the San Siro. Having been beaten by Tottenham at home in the Champions League, Gattuso seemed to want to distract from the defeat by picking on the Spurs bench. A fierce full-time shouting match between the two ended with the Italian grabbing the Spurs man by the throat before aiming a headbutt at him. Gattuso got a four-match ban, but given Jordan's record as a player he was probably lucky Harry Redknapp's No 2 didn't have a go back - and the Tottenham manager admitted as much. Joe Jordan and Gennaro Gattuso come close after Tottenham's win over AC Milan in the San Siro . Gattuso grabs Tottenham's assistant by the throat as Spurs manager Harry Redknapp tries to seperate them . Alan Pardew headbutts David Meyler, March 1, 2014 . Pardew, then Newcastle United boss, was sent to the stands after headbutting Hull City's David Meyler at the KC Stadium. With the Magpies 3-1 up, Meyler shoved past Pardew as he went to retrieve the ball for a throw-in - and the Newcastle boss was unimpressed, coming together with the Hull player and pushing his head into his face. He received a £100,000 fine from his club, £60,000 from the FA, was given a formal warning by Newcastle and was slapped with a three-match stadium ban and a touchline ban for a further four games by the Football Association. Pardew's punishment represented the longest ban for a manager in England since 1989 - and he also underwent anger management counselling in the aftermath.

"Within minutes of the final whistle at every Champions League tie, the two managers are in possession of a full statistical analysis of the match. Sadly, the temptation is still to look at the scoreline. At the sharp end of European football English teams cannot keep the ball. On the continent, this is considered to be a crime. It is the primary reason all four English teams - Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City - were eliminated from the Champions League before the quarter-final draw. Manchester City's players leave the Nou Camp looking glum after being eliminated from Champions League . Lionel Messi stole the show on Wednesday, taking 116 touches, 42 more than any other City player . Manchester City had goalkeeper Joe Hart to thank for keeping the score to just one at the Nou Camp . Messi joins in the celebrations with goalscorer Ivan Rakitic and Luis Suarez during the first half . Will we ever learn? Probably not. Over two legs in the Champions League second round, Manchester City did not have a single player who touched the ball on more than 74 occasions. It is pitiful. Where was David Silva? Where was Samir Nasri? Where was Yaya Toure? Nowhere, absolutely nowhere. In the Nou Camp on Wednesday, when Barcelona won 1-0 and it would not have flattered them had they scored eight, nine or 10, Lionel Messi touched the ball 116 times. That’s what we are in the game for, to be spellbound by players who want to make things happen with a clever twist or spin or flick. At the Etihad, when Barcelona won 2-1 in the first leg, Messi settled for 107 in the Premier League champions’ backyard. James Milner was City’s highest with 64. Martin Jol always encouraged his players to ‘be the boss of the ball’ when he was head coach at Tottenham. English football still looks to be terrified of it. Former Tottenham manager Martin Jol always encouraged his players to 'be the boss of the ball' Pep Guardiola's Bayern are joint top for passing accuracy with Barca (89.2 per cent) this season . To those who followed the fortunes of the four English teams in the Champions League, it will not come as a surprise to anyone that none of them are in the top five for passing accuracy. Barcelona, who toyed with City during Wednesday’s 1-0 victory in the second leg, are joint top with Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich (89.2 per cent). Next come 10-time champions Real Madrid (88.3), followed by Paris Saint Germain (88.1) and another team entrenched in the obsession with possession, Ajax (87.5). The elite teams rely on possession, keeping the ball in circulation until they can carve out an opening and move in for the kill. We will hear some tripe over the next few days, with people convinced that we must continue to refine a mangled, hybrid system to suit English football. Well 40 years in and it’s not working. Arsenal were dumped out on Tuesday despite being favourably drawn against Monaco in the last 16 . Arsene Wenger saw his Arsenal side crash out of the Champions League despite a 2-0 win in the second leg . Our national team went out of a World Cup in Brazil without even winning a game because they couldn’t keep the ball in an average group comprising Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. At Euro 2016, even with some of weakest teams in European football at the table, England will fail dismally because of their inability to retain possession. Our Champions League teams are heading the same way because they are incapable of flipping between the demands of the Premier League and the tactical subtleties of European football. At this point there will be those who cite the classic counter-attacking teams, such as Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan (2010) and Roberto Di Matteo’s Chelsea (2012), who went on to win the European Cup. They are the exception, not the rule. Barcelona’s chasing of Manchester United in Rome (2009) and the more humiliating defeat at Wembley (2011) was another wake-up call for English football. Sadly, we forgot to set the alarm. Talk to Barcelona’s players and they are happy to share the secrets of the Champions League, the magic formula that has been refined over the years at their training ground on the outskirts of the city. Chelsea were eliminated by PSG despite Jose Mourinho's side having a one-man advantage for 90 minutes . David Luiz celebrates after his header took the tie to extra-time before PSG went through on away goals . Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool were sent crashing out at the group stage of the Champions League . A dejected Raheem Sterling slumps to the floor after a 1-1 draw at home to Basle sealed Liverpool's fate . ‘When we have the ball we keep it at all costs,’ admitted Andres Iniesta ahead of Wednesday’s second leg at the Nou Camp against Manuel Pellegerini’s team. ‘And when we lose it, we do everything we can to win it back.’ Iniesta has won the European Cup three times - in 2006, 2009 and 2011 - since he broke into the Barcelona team under the Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard. Spain’s World Cup winner knows his stuff. Barcelona have two speed settings - quick, and very quick - and their entire system is designed to provoke the opposition into making mistakes. City routinely gave the ball away within five seconds. Arsenal (57.1 per cent) are the only English team to feature in the top five clubs who keep the ball in the Champions League this season. In the Stade Louis on Tuesday they moved through the gears, with Santi Cazorla (141 touches) and Mesut Ozil (126) running the show in their impressive 2-0 victory. England failed to make it out of their modest World Cup group in Brazil last summer . England manager Roy Hodgson watches on in anguish as his side are beaten 2-1 by Uruguay . Joao Moutinho, so influential for Monaco in the first leg, fell short in the centre of their midfield with 72 touches. His midfielder partner Jeremy Toulalan had 56. Bayern (67 per cent), who are moving into a new phase of possession-based football under Guardiola, head the list of teams dominating games, followed by Barcelona (64), Porto (60.9) and Juventus (59.6). Those four teams, possibly the most entertaining to watch in the competition this season, are all in the draw for the quarter-final. This stuff is staring us in the face and yet we will choose to ignore it because we will be back in thrall with the thrills and spills of the Barclays Premier League this weekend. We love its combative nature, the ability to throw up surprises because of its rugged composition, an unpredictable mix of styles, and its raw pace. For English football to succeed in Europe, the top teams must evolve, playing a possession-based game and learning to pick their moment in the biggest matches. Until they do, we all know the score.","Manchester City became the latest team to be eliminated from Europe .

"Ajax manager Frank de Boer has revealed he has aspirations to one day manage Tottenham or Liverpool after previously going close to taking up the reins at White Hart Lane and Anfield. De Boer, who has won four Dutch titles at Ajax, has been linked with a move to the Barclays Premier League on multiple occasions and the 44-year-old has now confirmed rumours linking him with a move to England.

Ajax manager Frank de Boer has revealed he previously came close to joining Tottenham and Liverpool . Mauricio Pochettino beat off competition from De Boer to take up the reins at White Hart Lane . Speaking exclusively to FourFourTwo, De Boer said: 'Together with Mauricio Pochettino I was the biggest candidate, and if they had chosen me, I would've done it. ""If I get an offer from a club in the future, I will consider the possibility and then follow my feeling. I look at whether it's a club where I think I can present myself well and where I'll be able to act in the way I like. 'Before, there was potential interest from Monaco as well, but it wasn't something I was looking for at that moment. Liverpool and Spurs are clubs I could manage. 'Liverpool approached me in the same way Tottenham did this year, wanting to hold exploratory talks first.'

"Celtic captain Scott Brown has accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head and Aidan Connolly of diving in the fall-out from Sunday's controversial William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final clash at Tannadice. The exciting 1-1 draw produced three red cards - one of which was a case of mistaken identity - and two penalties, one of which was saved. United boss Jackie McNamara claimed Brown's hefty challenge on Ciftci in the ninth minute sparked the rammy which ended with Hoops defender Virgil van Dijk and Paul Paton being red carded by Craig Thomson at the behest of his assistant Graham Chambers. Celtic's Scott Brown has accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head . Brown holds his head during the bad-tempered Scottish Cup quarter-final on Sunday afternoon . The United midfielder was mistaken for team mate Calum Butcher who had tangled on the ground with the Dutchman and the Tayside club have confirmed their intention to appeal the dismissal. Speaking at Lesser Hampden where he was publicising the Scottish League Cup final between the two teams at Hampden Park on Sunday - they will meet in the Scottish Cup replay and the Scottish Premiership in the immediate two games after that - the Scotland skipper said: 'I think it was a great tackle. The referee is five yards away and he had no problem with it. 'The linesman was 10 yards away and two of them had great views and you can clearly see on television that I have won the ball. 'I was kicked in the head (by Ciftci). You can blatantly see that. We will see what happens with that. 'At the time I didn't know who it was. I felt a boot against my face. Leigh Griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Dundee United . Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final . 'There was so much going on at the time, I didn't know who it was until I watched it again afterwards.' Ciftci scored from the spot on the stroke of half-time after Connolly was adjudged to have been fouled by Celtic forward Anthony Stokes in the box. The mayhem continued three minutes after the break when United defender Paul Dixon was dismissed for blocking a goal-bound drive by Leigh Griffiths with his arm. United keeper Radoslaw Cierzniak, who had a fine game, saved the consequent penalty by the Hoops striker, who made amends in the 71st minute when he headed in a Stefan Johansen cross. Parkhead manager Ronny Deila accused Connolly of diving to win the penalty, a view with which his captain concurred. 'It was a blatant dive,' said Brown. In a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton . The referee points to the spot after Aidan Connolly was brought down in the Celtic box . 'I was close by. Anthony put his leg in but you can see that he has pulled his leg away before the lad has gone down. 'He played it really well. I will give him that.' Brown would not say if Connolly should face retrospective punishment but pointed back to Celtic midfielder Derk Boerrigter's two-match ban for simulation at the start of the season. He said: 'We have had a player who did that at St Johnstone and he got a two-match ban so I think it was dealt with rightly. 'You don't want to see people cheating whether it helps you or not. It is not a nice part of the game.' The former Hibernian midfielder, however, believes the introduction of video evidence at games would have cleared a lot of the confusion up. Celtic keeper Craig Gordon fails to stop Nadir Ciftci from giving Dundee Utd the lead . Celtic captain Brown celebrates with Griffiths as the game finishes in a 1-1 draw on Sunday . 'I think yesterday would have been ideal for it,' he said. 'We stopped the game for four or five minutes and it was the wrong decision that Paton got sent off. 'If we had watched that back we would have clearly seen who it was. 'It wouldn't stop the game every two minutes, (only with) big decisions like that. We definitely need that.' Brown insists there is no bad blood between the clubs and Sunday's final on a newly-laid Hampden pitch - and the two following meetings - will each start with a clean slate. He said: 'It was both teams wanting to win and I think that is good for the Scottish game. 'As soon as you step on to the park it is a clean slate. 'The pitch at Hampden will help us. They are relaying that now so it should be in great shape.'","Dundee United and Celtic drew 1-1 at Tannadice on Sunday .

"If there was one man that didn’t deserve to be on the losing side at the Nou Camp on Wednesday it was Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. The England No 1 was in sensational form as he denied Barcelona’s three-pronged attack of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez time and time again. Hart denied Messi from the penalty spot in the first-leg to give the Citizens a slim chance of progression in the second-leg, but it just wasn’t to be as Ivan Rakitic’s goal secured Barcelona’s spot in the last eight.

"Rangers caretaker manager Kenny McDowall would welcome the return of Ally McCoist to first-team duties. But McDowall is not sure what plans the new-look Ibrox board have for the remainder of the season. McCoist was placed on garden leave by the outgoing regime on December 21, after triggering a 12-month notice period with his resignation. Rangers caretaker manager Kenny McDowall (right) would welcome the return of Ally McCoist (left) Former Rangers manager  McCoist pictured in the crowd recently and he could potentially return . Rangers' Scottish Championship title bid was already floundering by then but they have since won only three out of nine matches and slipped to third place as well as going out of both major cup competitions. McDowall briefly met new board members on Friday following the Dave King-led boardroom takeover but no new talks are planned as the former Celtic reserve coach prepares for the visit of fellow play-off hopefuls Queen of the South on Tuesday night. When asked whether he would welcome McCoist's restoration, the reluctant manager said: 'If it was Ally, obviously I came with Ally, so obviously that would appeal to me. But it's a difficult one to answer because the board have their own ideas and it's totally up to them. 'Gordon Durie has come up and been fantastic. Gordon didn't expect to be put in the position he got put into. Ian Durrant got put down to the youth department, which wasn't the best thing to happen to Ian. I would like to look at getting Ian back to work alongside myself and Gordon. McCoist was placed on garden leave by the outgoing regime in December and McDowall became caretaker .

'Jim Stewart is obviously there as well, the goalkeeper coach, and Jim has done some extra stuff as well. We have all had to muck in during a difficult period and we have all done our best to keep going and keep in contention for promotion.' New board members, who include Paul Murray, Douglas Park and John Gilligan, are reported to be meeting former Fulham boss Felix Magath, who is a Rangers shareholder. 'They are quite entitled to speak to whoever they want to speak to regarding the manager's situation,' said McDowall, who is also serving his notice. 'I will just wait and see and carry on with my duties. I'm getting paid to take the team and I will carry on my duties until I'm told otherwise.' Those duties have been more of a burden for McDowall than any other feeling, by his own admission and demeanour, but he will at least have the support of a potentially full Ibrox on Tuesday.

"After his heroic performance in the Nou Camp, Joe Hart came out in defence of his manager Manuel Pellegrini, claiming he deserves to keep his job. Manchester City keeper Hart, who made an incredible 10 saves to limit Barcelona to a 1-0 win on Wednesday, admitted that his team-mates were feeling the pressure of speculation about their futures after another European failure. But the England No 1 insisted the players are fully behind their manager as they seek to end their campaign on a high. Joe Hart was in inspired form against Barcelona, pictured here saving from man-of-the-moment Lionel Messi . The Manchester City and England No 1 backed his manager despite the team's last-16 exit .

'It's always going to be the same at City, for all the players. We appreciate that if we don't win everyone will be speculated about. You have to be strong inside.' Hart was easily City's best player at the Nou Camp, and his immense contribution stopped Barcelona adding to Ivan Rakitic's goal. Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said: 'The score could have been a rout. Hart was really on it towards the end. We had a lot of chances, which is not normal in this type of game. We deserved to win by a bigger goal difference.'

"Celtic striker John Guidetti has caused a stir after appearing to sing 'the H*** are deid' on Dutch television. The 22-year-old Swedish striker was performing a chant the supporters sing to him when he plays. As the programme's credits began to roll, he sang: 'Oh John Guidetti, puts the ball in the net-y, he's a Super Swede and the H*** are deid, walking in Guidetti wonderland.' Celtic striker John Guidetti sang the song in question during an appearance on Dutch television . Guidetti has scored 13 goals since joining Celtic on loan from Manchester City this season . A group of Rangers fans have been petitioning Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to ban the word 'H**' from football grounds. The group say the term incites 'religious hatred' and is 'a derogatory and sectarian term for a Protestant'. There is no indication that Guidetti, who is on loan from Manchester City, had any idea of the meaning of the chant, but he caused anger nonetheless by saying he thought it was 'a good song'. A spokesman for the anti-sectarian charity Nil by Mouth told The Scotsman there was a need 'for a proper education programme for Scots footballers'. He added: 'Clubs should make it clear to them the kind of language likely to provoke others.' Guidetti was repeating a song that he had heard sung in the terraces while he played . Celtic manager Ronny Deila said recently he had not given up hope of signing Guidetti on a permanent basis .","John Guidetti sang a song from the terraces on Dutch television .

"The years finally seem to be catching up with Phil Neville after the former Manchester United star debuted a new look on  Match of the Day 2. Neville's trademark blond highlights were noticeably dull as he sat down to talk about Sunday's Premier League action with presenter Mark Chapman and Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown. The 38-year-old appears to have ditched the peroxide in favour of a darker dye to rid himself of the grey which has crept in since his retirement in 2013.

"Stuart Pearce believes Gary Neville needs to get managerial experience of his own before he can be considered as a possible successor to Roy Hodgson as England head coach. Neville is currently a member of the England coaching staff and has been linked with the top job once Hodgson, who has been in charge since 2012, leaves the post. However, former Manchester United captain Neville has never managed a club or international side before and Pearce has described suggestions the 40-year-old could take over the national team without that experience as 'incredible'. Stuart Pearce does not believe Gary Neville has the experience to replace Roy Hodgson . Former Manchester United defender Neville has been tipped to replace Hodgson . Ex-Nottingham Forest boss Pearce, who was in charge of England Under-21s for six years and also took caretaker charge of the senior team following Fabio Capello's resignation, told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek: 'You only really know what it's like to manage when you're in that technical area and you're the manager. 'To even suggest that Gary could take over, for me, is incredible really. The top job in English football, you need experience and I think you have to gain that experience by managing either at club level, at international level, or hopefully a mixture of both. 'You can't replicate what it's like to be in the technical area when all pressure falls on you. 'I've been with Fabio (Capello) to the World Cup and in press conferences, and the pressure that's put on him; (someone) who has been around and knows the game and has a strong personality....You need someone in that position that's got the experience of that position. 'Gary will get that eventually, but I think he needs, like anybody, to gain the experience, maybe in club football, as a manager and after that probably in international football as well.'

"It was a good night for Premier League misfits at the NRGi Park as Denmark beat the USA thanks to a Nicklas Bendtner hat-trick after Jozy Altidore had opened the scoring for the visitors. On an evening when Tottenham's Christian Eriksen became the youngest Dane to win 50 international caps, Altidore, who could only muster a single goal in the English top flight during an 18-month spell at Sunderland, put the USA ahead after 19 minutes in Aarhus. But the Danes were soon level through former Arsenal forward Bendtner. Aron Johannsson restored Jurgen Klinsmann's side's lead before Bendtner scored twice in the final seven minutes to seal his hat-trick and earn victory for Morten Olsen's side. Nicklas Bendtner celebrates with his team-mates after firing the home side level during the first half .

Denmark started the international friendly on the front foot but found themselves a goal behind when Altidore, who joined Toronto in January as part of the deal that saw Jermain Defoe return to England, stroked home Timmy Chandler's cross. The goal failed to alter the pattern of the game and the home side were level on 33 minutes. The Wolfsburg forward found himself in acres of space in the six yard box after the US defence failed to deal with Lasse Vibe's pass before Bendtner swept home. Johannsson gave the away side the lead - once more against the run of play - after 66 minutes when the AZ forward pounced in the box after Altidore's unselfish pass. As Denmark looked to be heading towards a home defeat Bedntner was on hand to grab his second to draw the hosts level for a second time in the 84th minute. And the game was won in injury time with the pick of the five goals. Eriksen played played a diagonal pass though to Bendtner who, with one touch brought the ball under control, before firing the ball into the bottom corner.

"A bench warrant has been issued in Maryland for civil rights icon Walter Fauntroy. The 82-year-old pastor and former Congressman, who was a trusted aid to Martin Luther King Jr., has had his passport revoked as a result of the warrant. Fauntroy is believed to be somewhere in Africa, according to friends and family. The warrant stems from an event to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama in Maryland in 2009 that Fauntroy was involved in organizing. Warrant: Walter Fauntroy, a trusted aid to Martin Luther King Jr., is wanted over his involvement in an event for the 2009 Presidential Inauguration and a $50,000 check he wrote for the function that bounced. He is seen here with the Rev. Al Sharpton in Washington in August 2010 . According to WUSA9, he and some others hired vendors for the function, however the party never actually happened. A $50,000 check he wrote to cover expenses then bounced. If and when Fauntroy re-enters the country, he will be arrested. Bench warrants are usually issued by judges  for persons deemed to be in contempt of court. Suspicions were raised about Fauntroy's possible disappearance in November when he missed the funeral of fellow civil rights activist and friend Marion Barry, who served three terms as mayor of the District of Columbia. He then failed to participate in any events related to the 50th anniversary of Selma. Flashback: Walter Fauntroy - seen center right with Martin Luther King Jr. (left) at the White House in 1965 - is believed to be on the run, with a bench warrant issued for his arrest . Historic: Walter Fauntroy raises Marion Barry's hand in victory after Barry won his campaign for a seat on the school board on November 1, 1971 in Washington, DC . Civil Rights icon: Walter Fauntroy and Coretta Scott King talk to a D.C. police officer while protesting outside the South African embassy in 1984 . Fauntroy started going to Africa, first to Libya - where he claimed to have a relationship with Qaddafi - before traveling to Nigeria and Dubai. Friends and family report they don't know why Fauntroy would be in Africa. They have also questioned his mental state, living accommodations, and believe he has no source of income, WUSA9 reported. In 1959, Fauntroy became pastor of the New Bethel Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., succeeding his mentor, Reverend Charles David Foster, who had just passed away. Walter Fauntroy, a pastor and former civil rights leader (seen here in 1969) is now wanted over his involvement in an event to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama in Maryland in 2009 . Disappeared: Fauntroy listens here as President Barack Obama speaks during a dedication ceremony at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on October 16, 2011 . The following year Martin Luther King and Wyatt Tee Walker asked him to become the District of Columbia branch director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Fauntroy accepted and became the civil rights organization’s lobbyist in Congress until 1970. He lobbied for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and worked on the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March in 1965, and the Meredith Mississippi Freedom March in 1966.","Bench warrant issued for Walter Fauntroy, 82, in Maryland .

"Celtic captain Scott Brown has insisted he has no reason to fear being banned for Sunday’s League Cup Final and called on critics of his Tannadice tackle on Nadir Ciftci to ‘man up’. The Parkhead skipper, whose heavy challenge on the Dundee United striker sparked a melee during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final at the weekend, is one of a number of players who will find out on Tuesday if they face retrospective action from the SFA. But, dismissing any concern, Brown said: ‘Am I worried about being cited? Not in the slightest. The referee was two yards away and he had a clear view of my tackle and he saw that I won the ball. Celtic's Scott Brown has accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head . ‘It was a great tackle. He was fine with it and so was the linesman. They saw what they saw and they made their decisions. ‘At the end of the day, it’s a man’s sport. People need to man up a bit. People moan about the tackles, but if the ball is there to be won, go and win it. As long as it’s not dangerous and you are not flying two-footed into somebody.’ In the wake of an absorbing 1-1 draw game that saw three red cards and two penalties, one of which was saved, the Tannadice club announced they are appealing the red card issued to midfielder Paul Paton. The luckless Paton was the victim of mistaken identity by referee Craig Thomson, at the behest of assistant referee Graham Chambers, after his team-mate Calum Butcher clashed on the ground with Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk. But while Paton’s appeal on Thursday is expected to be straightforward, Van Dijk faces a 48 hours cup final sweat after Celtic also appealed his red card. Brown holds his head during the bad-tempered Scottish Cup quarter-final on Sunday afternoon . And in what is shaping up as a disciplinary D-Day, United trio Cifti, Butcher and Aidan Connolly will join Brown in finding out by 3pm this afternoon whether they face retrospective disciplinary action from SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. Ciftci appeared to kick Brown in the face following the Celtic man’s heavy challenge, while Butcher could be hit with a red card for his role in the clash with van Dijk. Connolly, meanwhile, could face a simulation charge after Celtic boss Ronny Deila accused him of diving to win his team’s first half penalty kick, scored by Ciftci. Paul Dixon was the other sending off during Sunday’s match but United won’t contest that and he misses the Scottish Cup replay at Parkhead on March 18. After the cup match, United boss Jackie McNamara said much of the trouble could have been avoided if referee Craig Thomson had sent off Brown for his initial challenge on Ciftci. The referee did not even give a foul but the Celtic captain – who called for video evidence to be introduced to help the under-fire match officials – added: ‘I was kicked in the head (by Ciftci). You can blatantly see that. We will see what happens with that. At the time I didn’t know who it was. I felt a boot against my face. ‘There was so much going on at the time, I didn’t know who it was until I watched it again afterwards. ‘I’m probably lucky it was to my face, and not another part of my body. Leigh Griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Dundee United . Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final . In a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton . ‘Do I hope Virgil wins his appeal? That would be great but we will see. But I didn’t see that incident because I had (Ciftci’s) studs in my face at the time. You could see the marks, you still can.’ Brown, who was speaking at Lesser Hampden where he was publicising Sunday’s showpiece occasion, also backed up his boss Deila’s assertion that Connolly had been guilty of simulation to win a penalty. ‘It was a blatant dive,’ said Brown. ‘I was close by. Anthony (Stokes) put his leg in but you can see that he has pulled his leg away before the lad has gone down. ‘He played it really well. I will give him that but we had (Derk Boerrigter) get a two-match ban for that so I think it was dealt with rightly. You don’t want to see people cheating whether it helps you or not. It is not a nice part of the game.’ Brown refused to be critical of match officials Thomson and Chambers, and instead insisted video evidence would have cleared up the confusion. ‘I think yesterday would have been ideal for it,’ he said. ‘We stopped the game for four or five minutes and it was the wrong decision that Paton got sent off. ‘If we had watched that back we would have clearly seen who it was. ‘It wouldn’t stop the game every two minutes, (only with) big decisions like that. We definitely need that.’","Dundee United and Celtic drew 1-1 at Tannadice on Sunday .

"It had to be James Milner, didn't it? The man who already has social media history woke up this morning to find himself, once again, the unwitting subject of sniggers around the globe when a video of him being nutmegged by Lionel Messi before awkwardly tumbling on the Nou Camp went viral. In the stands Pep Guardiola put his hands to his face while up in the commentary box Gary Neville branded it 'barbaric'. James Milner (right) attempts to shackle Lionel Messi during Manchester City's European exit . Milner's spoof Twitter account Boring James Milner has amassed over 389,000 followers . No matter that his team-mate Fernandinho befell the same fate moments earlier, it was funny because it was Milner. Milner whose clean cut, straight-talking Yorkshireness spawned the spoof @boringmilner Twitter account (last count 389,000 followers). Milner who we poke fun at because he is the antithesis of everything we say we loathe about footballers. No drunken late nights partying, sordid kiss-and-tells or dummy-spitting rows with managers to see here. Unfortunately, Milner will be remembered as being the victim of Messi's genius at the Nou Camp . Dutch manager Ruud Gullit took to Twitter and added: 'OMG. Messi made Milner famous' Bolton's on-loan midfielder Barry Bannan wrote Messi 'ain't human' after his ridiculous skills . The inference behind the giggles was loud and clear - the dour Englishman was shown up by the silky-skilled Argentinian master and he really had no right to be on the same pitch. But who does? Not many on the planet could have lived with Messi as he waltzed and weaved through the parting sky blue seas on Wednesday night. At times it appeared as though he was playing a different sport. Milner was not alone in being made to look foolish. Messi was in stunning form, producing an incredulous nutmeg that drew gasps from the football world . Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland echoed Gary Neville, tweeting 'watching the game with my legs closed' The Argentina ace leaves Milner on the floor after passing the ball through his legs and skipping past him . He will, however, take all of this in his stride. The latest twist in a season which, for him, has been far from boring. Once again, he has played all over the park. Central midfield, full back, wing - when Manuel Pellegrini suffered a striker shortage he even put him up front. And the Chilean, in a rare dropping of the guard, was quick to praise his Mr Versatile in an interview before City's 1-0 defeat. 'It would be very difficult to find a more complete player than [James] Milner,’ Pellegrini told Sportsmail. ‘There are players who are better technically. There are quicker players. 'There are players who head the ball better. But show me a player who does all the things that Milner does well and there isn’t one.' Darts player Adrian 'Jackpot' Lewis wrote on Twitter that 'Messi could nutmeg a mermaid' Former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola witnessed Milner's embarrassment from the stands . Queens Park Rangers striker Charlie Austin wrote that Guardiola's reaction said it all about Messi's skills . Milner drops to his knees as City fail to reach the Champions League last eight for the fourth year in a row . Messi inspired the Catalans to a 1-0 victory (3-1 on aggregate) on Wednesday to send Barcelona through . In what could have been a testimonial dinner speech, the appreciative manager added: 'Whatever position I put him in he plays well: at full back – which is the only place he doesn’t like playing– attacking midfield, wide, or as a striker. I used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game. ‘You leave him on the bench and he is furious, but watch him during the game, encouraging and shouting. And in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes. 'It’s very difficult to find another Milner – an intelligent player, with big balls and a massive heart.’ Manuel Pellegrini insists that it would be difficult to find a more 'complete' player than Milner . Milner has only started 15 Premier League games, making most of his appearances from the bench . All of the above counts for nothing when the Twittersphere goes into a mean meltdown. But it matters to others who are ready to pounce should City fail to reach an agreement to extend a deal that runs out in the summer. At home, Liverpool and Arsenal have registered an interest. At the turn of the year there were approaches from clubs abroad and offers of pre-contract agreements. None were signed because Milner, as always, wants to do the right thing and to him that is honouring the deal he signed at the Etihad Stadium. Pellegrini is keen to get a new deal done. But the man with big balls is playing hard ball - and he has every right to do so. The England international scores from a free-kick to earn a point against Hull in February .

"Gus Poyet has spoken of his pride at what he achieved at Sunderland four days after being relieved of his duties as head coach. The 47-year-old Uruguayan was sacked on Monday in the wake of an horrendous 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa which left the club perched just a point above the Barclays Premier League relegation zone. But on the day his successor Dick Advocaat met the media for the first time, Poyet insisted he left the Stadium of Light after 18 months at the helm with his head held high. Gus Poyet said he was 'very disappointed' after being replaced by Sunderland following recent bad results . The north east club decided to sack Poyet after a 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa saw them battling relegation . He said in a statement released on his behalf by the League Managers' Association: 'Certainly I am very disappointed to have left Sunderland, but I am extremely honoured to have served this special club as their manager. 'When I arrived in October 2013, Sunderland had played seven matches and lost six, gaining only one point, and they were bottom of the Barclays Premier League. 'Thirty-one matches later at the end of the season, we had won 10 and drawn eight, taking us to the complete safety of 14th position. 'I will always remember fondly that miracle unbeaten run, a vein of form for which I was honoured to be short-listed for the Barclays Premier League Manager of the Year Award. Veteran Dutch manager Dick Advocaat has replaced Poyet at the Stadium of Light for the rest of the season . Poyet emphasised his pride at winning all three of his Tyne-Wear derbies in his 18 months in charge . 'I leave Sunderland feeling proud of all of our achievements during my tenure, not least reaching the club's first cup final in 22 years, when we took more than 30,000 fans to the Capital One Cup Final at Wembley. 'Of the three Tyne-Wear derby matches since I joined the club as manager, I am very proud that we were able to win all three, two of which were away from home.' Poyet was appointed in an attempt to bring stability to the club after Paolo di Canio's brief, but tempestuous reign, and while he was disappointed to lose his job, he thanked chairman Ellis Short for giving him his chance in the top flight. Poyet pointed to his side's 'miracle run' last season, where they beat Chelsea and Manchester United away . He said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank chairman Ellis Short for giving me my first opportunity to manage in the Barclays Premier League, without a doubt the greatest league in the world. 'I also thank my staff for their valuable assistance, the players for all their efforts and, in particular, the fans, who demonstrate such unbelievable passion for the club.

"Dick Advocaat has been appointed as Sunderland manager on a deal until the end of the season. The 67-year-old's package will be incentivised with the target of Premier League survival. Advocaat told the club's website: 'Sunderland is a big club and I am very much looking forward to the challenge ahead. We must now concentrate on Saturday as a priority and I can't wait to get started.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, has taken over at Sunderland . Gus Poyet was sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa .

We have one aim only now - to climb the table and everyone is fully focused on the task ahead of us.' Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats – currently one point above the relegation zone – avoid the drop. He has brought with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. Former Swansea and England Under 20 goalkeeping coach, Adrian Tucker, also joins Advocaat's backroom staff. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked on Monday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to a deal with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen – who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg – recommended him for the role. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats –  one point above the drop zone – avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld on Monday night. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then – the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . VIDEO Poyet sacked as Sunderland manager . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract – which expires in 2016 – to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level. Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet. They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box. The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge. His first home game will be the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle on Easter Sunday. HULL . Chelsea (Home) - March 22 . Swansea (Away) - April 4 . Southampton (Away) - April 11 .

"Ronaldinho seems to have been given the perfect gift by NBA star LeBron James, a dazzling watch thought to be worth around £40,000. The Brazilian footballer, now plying his trade with Queretaro in Mexico after stints with Barcelona and AC Milan, said thanks to the Cleveland Cavaliers small forward on Instagram while posing with the Audemars Piguet watch. It is part of a limited edition of 600 designed by James, and is said to popular model with Premier League footballers. Ronaldinho has thanked LeBron James after the NBA star gave him a dazzling watch, worth around £40,000 . Ronaldinho in action for Brazil in 2011 and LeBron James playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers last month . The watch is a limited-edition Audemars Piguet, which LeBron James designed (pictured in 2011) The 18-carat watch also features a scratch-resistant sapphire glass, while the LBJ signature is printed in blue. It is described by Audemars Piguet as 'an iconic watch for a legendary athlete'. They add: It is in the constant striving for perfection personified in his life both on and off the court that LeBron James sees the deepest connection between himself and Audemars Piguet. 'This model is a celebration of James' outstanding achievements to date.' It was released in November 2013 but Ronaldinho still appeared to be delighted, posting on social media site Instagram: 'I loved this gift! Limited series watch from my bro LeBron James. Thanks, my friend!' The present from LeBron wasn't the only thing to put a smile on the World Cup winner's face recently, as he was pictured partying in Cancun last week.

"Liverpool are the biggest English club  when measured solely by the number of major trophies won, all-time. With 18 league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, five European Cups and three UEFA Cups, they have lifted 41 major honours in their history, two more than their closest rivals in this regard, Manchester United, who have 39. United have more league titles, 20, and 13 of those have been won since Liverpool’s last league title in 1989-90. They also have more FA Cup wins than Liverpool (11), but fewer League Cups (four), fewer European Cups (three) and fewer other European trophies (one, the Cup-Winners Cup of 1990-91). The silverware has been totted up as part of a Sportsmail study to explore which English clubs are the ‘biggest’; 59 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been considered, having played in England’s top division for at least a season. John Barnes and Peter Beardsley celebrate in 1990 with the last league trophy to head to Liverpool . Steven Gerrard hoists Old Big Ears aloft after that famous night in Istanbul . Crowds . We ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull. Then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates. Their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs. Global fanbase . We added up the total number of fans and followers for each club on Facebook and Twitter — by far the most popular global social media platforms. Every club has official accounts. Trophies . We counted ‘major’ trophies won by each club, giving points for each; 10pts for each European Cup/Champions League win, 8pts for each top-division English title, 5pts for each FA Cup or other European trophy win, and 3pts for each League Cup win. No ‘one-off’ trophies such as the Charity Shield are considered because they are not the product of multi-match competitions. And being a losing finalist does not count for points either — here at Sportsmail, winning is everything, second is nowhere. Average league finish . The average league finish position for each of the clubs since 1888-89. Player quality . We counted the number of players from each club who have played for England, all-time, ranking the clubs by total. This reflects historic ‘bigness’. We then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 World Cup — a measure of modern ‘bigness’. The overall ranking is an aggregate of these two. Income . We ranked the clubs by their income for the most recent season available. The biggest clubs have generally had the most money and been able to buy and pay the best players. The trophies considered as ‘major’ are those earned through playing a whole season, tournament or competition, so no ‘one-off match’ silverware has been included, such as the Charity Shield or Super Cup, nor have we counted silverware won in events that have ever been ‘one-off match’ occasions - like the Intercontinental Cup, which morphed into the Club World Cup. Some trophies are bigger than others; few would disagree a league title is more impressive than an FA Cup, or that a European Cup is bigger than a League Cup. So we have weighted the trophies, awarding 10 points for each European Cup, eight for each league title, five for an FA Cup or other European trophy and three for each League Cup win. In fact when the clubs are ranked 1 to 59 on total trophy wins without weighting, the order is very similar to the order when weightings have been applied. Liverpool stay at No1 for example ahead of United, themselves clear of Arsenal (28 trophies) in third, Aston Villa (20) in fourth and Chelsea (also 20) in fifth. When clubs have the same number of trophies the total points are used to separate them. Villa and Chelsea have both won a European Cup but Villa’s seven league titles to Chelsea’s four made the difference between that pair. When the points are the same, the club with the higher number of most important trophies are ranked higher. The full rankings of the ‘biggest’ clubs by trophies accompany this piece. Of the 59 teams in our study, 46 of them have won at least one major trophy. The 12 that haven’t are ranked by how closely they have come, for example as runners-up in the FA Cup (which is as close as Crystal Palace, Fulham and Hull among others have come), runners-up in the League Cup (Oldham) and then by the highest position they ever achieved in the top division. After the top five trophy winners come Everton and Tottenham in sixth and seventh places, Everton ahead on points because their nine league titles, the last of them in 1986-87, are far superior to Tottenham’s two titles, the second and last in 1960-61. Spurs are more cup specialists, having won eight FA Cups, four League Cups and three cups in Europe, albeit not the European Cup. Manchester City, Newcastle and Sunderland fill out the top 10 places, with rankings 10 to 20 dominated by former Premier League teams, among them Blackburn, Wolves, Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds, Huddersfield, Sheffield United, Portsmouth and Preston among them, all of who have won the English title at least once and all of whom have won between four and 10 major trophies in their histories. Bolton in 23rd place are the highest-ranked club never to have won the title, and are 23rd courtesy of their four FA Cup wins. They are a place above West Ham, who have also never won the title and have won three FA Cups. Arsene Wenger and Tony Adams beam after Arsenal won the Double in 2002 .

"Roberto Mancini’s Inter Milan side crashed to a home defeat after Chelsea loan man Mohamed Salah sealed all three points for Fiorentina at the San Siro. Both sides were in form and full of confidence after progressing to the Europa League round of 16 midweek, and Inter in particular after winning their past three league matches.

The winger smashed home from close range 10 minutes after the interval to make it 1-0 . Salah (third right) celebrates with his team-mates after giving Fiorentina an all-important lead . Salah scored the only goal of the game 10 minutes into the second half, following up after Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic fumbled at Manuel Pasqual's cross and only succeeded in parrying it straight to the feet of the Egypt international. It was Salah's third goal in four Serie A matches since joining Fiorentina from the Blues, also netting against Tottenham Hotspur in midweek. Inter, who had earlier hit the post through Fredy Guarin, went close to equalising on several occasions. They weren’t able to make their numerical advantage count, however, after Fiorentina ended the game with nine men after Nenad Tomovic and Stefan Savic were both stretchered off with injuries.

"Ronaldinho has been heralded as one of the most skillful footballers to have ever played the game, lighting up European football for many years, always with a smile on his face. His exploits at Barcelona saw him claim a Champions League trophy in 2006, as well as shaping a team that became the best in the world. An individual master and former Ballon d'Or winner, the Brazilian playmaker has also played with some of the finest stars on the planet. He is therefore well placed to select his Champions League dream team. Take a look at his eleven talented picks below. Ronaldinho is surrounded by the media as he celebrates with the Champions League trophy in 2006 . The Brazilian playmaker enjoyed successful spells in Europe with Barcelona (left) and AC Milan (right) Ronaldinho was a key part of one of the best teams on the planet... so what's his Champions League XI? GOALKEEPER . Gianluigi Buffon . Although Ronaldinho never featured on the same team as the Italian stopper, his record in Europe speaks for itself. 135 Champions League and UEFA Cup appearances; the most expensive goalkeeper of all time enjoyed individual and team success with Parma and Juventus. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'There have been some very good goalkeepers in my era, but Buffon is there for consistency. Most of the goalkeepers have had times when their form has not been so good, but Buffon has been at such a high level for so long.' Gianluigi Buffon makes Ronaldinho's Champions League dream team because of his consistency at the top . DEFENCE . Cafu . The Brazilian full back defined an era for his position, bombing down the flank as Brazil's class of 2002 were heralded as one of the best of all time. Spells in Italy with Roma and AC Milan saw Cafu bring his attacking nature to Europe, and he captured the Champions League in 2007 in his penultimate season as a professional. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'You don’t become the most capped player in Brazil’s history, without being very special. I was so happy when he finally won the Champions League with Milan, for the best right back ever not to win the biggest club trophy would not be right.' Ronaldinho describes Cafu as the 'best right back ever' - he is the most capped player in Brazil's history . Cafu had spells in Europe with AC Milan and Roma, and finally claimed glory in the Champions League in 2007 . John Terry . A mainstay in Chelsea's back four for over a decade, Terry was involved in several fierce battles with Ronaldino in the Champions League and was able to lift the trophy in 2012. The no nonsense captain has dedicated himself to the Blues, and has been rewarded with 13 major club honours. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'We [Barcelona] had some big Champions League games against Chelsea, and I could see then why John Terry is still so important for them now. He is very tough to play against, but he is a fantastic leader, the leader you need in those sorts of games.' Chelsea's John Terry tries to tackle Barca star Ronaldinho during a Champions League tie at the Nou Camp . Paolo Maldini . Another one-club man, Maldini won 26 trophies during his glittering 24-year career with Milan. A typical quick, elegant and colossal Italian defender, he holds the record for appearances in UEFA club competitions at 173, as well as netting the fastest ever goal in a Champions League final in 2005 (50 secs, vs Liverpool). Oh, and a haul of five European Cup winners' medals (1989, 1990, 1994, 2003 and 2007) isn't bad either. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'He was one of the best defenders in Champions League history, but what was so impressive about him is that when he was on the ball he didn’t look like a defender, but like an elegant midfield player.' Paolo Maldini (right) holds the record for appearances in UEFA club competitions and is an AC Milan legend . Roberto Carlos . Like Cafu, a marauding defender who brought the art of Brazilian flair to defending. Claimed three Champions League titles with Real Madrid (1998, 2000, 2002) and was a true Galactico at the Bernabeu. Netting three goals in 161 European outings, Carlos also had a ferocious left foot. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'Would be worth having in any team for his ability to take free kicks, but as well as being one of the best free kick takers ever, he is also one of the finest left backs ever. So important to all of Real Madrid’s Champions League wins.' Ronaldinho taps Brazil team-mate Roberto Carlos on the head during a training session in 2006 . The Real Madrid left back was known for his attacking prowess, as well as his fierce left-footed free kicks . MIDFIELD . Claude Makelele . His exploits with Real Madrid and Chelsea saw a holding midfield role named after him, so Makelele ought to have claimed more than the one Champions League final success (2002). Small in height but pulled no punches in the tackle, Jose Mourinho built a successful team around the Frenchman at Stamford Bridge. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'Defenders feel safe knowing that he is ahead of them, the attackers feel safe knowing he is behind them, for me he is the best I have ever seen doing the job of protecting the defence. You never saw him play a bad game.' Claude Makelele tries to tackle Ronaldinho during a second leg tie at Stamford Bridge . The 'Makelele role' became famous after the Frenchman's successful spell at Chelsea . Frank Lampard . The model goalscoring midfielder over the last decade, Lampard's late surges into the box were a driving force for Chelsea and he finally claimed the European Cup in 2012 after a victory against Bayern Munich. The England international scored 23 goals in 106 appearances in the Champions League. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'I told Frank Rijkaard that we (Barcelona) should sign him, but he didn’t want to leave Chelsea. I am sure they would not have let him go, at that time he was one of the greats in Europe. His goal record from midfield was what really impressed me.' Frank Lampard and Ronaldinho shake hands after an entertaining fixture in 2006 . The Brazilian says he urged Frank Rijkaard to sign the England midfielder, and praises his goal record . Kaka . When Ronaldinho left Barcelona for Milan in 2008, he linked up with his Brazil team-mate and Ballon d'Or winner. Although his record move to Real Madrid did not quite work out, Kaka's influence and elegance in the No 10 role in a team that reached two Champions League finals in three years (2005 and 2007, winning the second) must not be forgotten. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'Things did not work out for Kaka as well as expected at Madrid, but we must not forget the player at Milan who was the real Kaka. For two, maybe three seasons he was the best player in the world, there was nothing he couldn’t do.' Brazil team-mates Ronaldinho and Kaka pose for photographers at a press conference in 2005 . The duo went on to play with each other at AC Milan, Ronaldinho says he was 'the best player in the world' ATTACK . Lionel Messi . If anyone was to usurp Ronaldinho at Barcelona, they would have to be some player. Lionel Messi is that man. The record goalscorer in the European Cup (75), three Ballon d'Ors, and three Champions League titles (2006, 2009, 2011) in one of the greatest club side's in history, the Argentine forward has it all. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'I have won everything, it is impossible for me to have regrets. I do wish though that I could have played with Messi for longer than I did at Barcelona. There are no words to describe him; he just has magic in his feet.' Lionel Messi has won it all in Europe - three Champions League winners' medals and three Balon d'Ors . Messi usurped Ronaldinho at Barcelona but he holds no grudges toward his former team-mate . Thierry Henry . Combined grace and speed with a sublime eye for goal, and came so close to Champions League glory with Arsenal in 2006. The club's record goalscorer opted for pastures new when Barcelona came calling, but only briefly played with Ronaldinho. A European Cup followed in 2009, and Henry finished with a record of almost one in two in European competitions. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'My good friend who I played with at Barcelona, and there was even a chance that we nearly played together again in New York. Just a nightmare for defenders, was quick, had skill, and was strong.' Ronaldinho didn't get to work with Thierry Henry for long at Barcelona but praises his speed and skill . Henry is Arsenal's record goalscorer and has a fine record in European competitions . Ronaldo . One of the greatest finishers to ever grace the planet, Ronaldo had the world watching his every move on the pitch as he dazzled with Brazil, Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. He scored 49 goals in 93 European appearances, but unfortunately never lifted the Champions League trophy. Ronaldinho's verdict: 'He was my idol and then I end up playing and winning a World Cup with him. The most complete striker there has ever been, the most complete striker there will ever be, it is almost unbelievable to think that he never won the Champions League.' Ronaldinho described Brazil team-mate Ronaldo (right) as the 'most complete striker there will ever be' Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Manchester United in a quarter-final clash at Old Trafford in 2003 . How Ronaldinho's ultimate Champions League XI looks... they would be a match for any team in Europe .","Ronaldinho won the Champions League in 2006 with Barcelona .
Ronaldinho has played with some of the best players in the world .
He says he urged Frank Rijkaard to sign Frank Lampard for Barca .

So, who else makes up his ultimate dream team from the European Cup?"
"The last time Liverpool finished outside the top eight in England’s top division was in the 1961-62 season, when they weren’t even in the top division. They were winning the old Second Division title that year, ending an eight-year spell outside the top flight, one of the rare periods in their history when they have played below the elite. In the 110 seasons they have played league football since promotion from the Lancashire League to the Second Division of the Football League in 1893, they have finished, on average, eighth. That means they have the highest average finish, all-time, of any club. Their precise average finish is 8.26, which puts them ahead of next-best Arsenal (average finish 8.78, also in 110 seasons) and third-placed Everton, who have averaged a placing of 9.71 in their 115 league seasons. Daniel Sturridge equalises for Liverpool at Anfield against Manchester United on Sunday . Liverpool players celebrate in the dressing room having won the Division One title in 1990 . Luis Suarez, now at Barcelona, guided Liverpool to second place in the Premier League last season . The average finishing positions have been calculated as part of a MailSport study to explore which English clubs are the ‘biggest’; 59 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been considered, having played in England’s top division for at least a season. Liverpool’s incredible consistency over time means they have only spent 11 seasons of 110 outside the top division. Those were their inaugural season, plus 1895-96, then 1904-05, then the eight-year spell between 1954 and 1962. At the peak of their powers, between 1972-73 and 1990-91, they finished outside the top two in the top division just once, when they were fifth in 1980-81. Chelsea, celebrating a 3-2 win at Hull on Saturday, lead the Premier League this season so far . Phil Neal is pictured with the UEFA Cup, Charity Shield, and League Championship trophies in 1976 . Arsenal last won the Premier League title in 2004, when they went unbeaten for the entire season . Steve McMahon (centre) lifts with Division One trophy in 1986 with his Liverpool team-mates . In that 19-year period Liverpool won the title 11 times and their finishing positions in a list looked like this: 1-2-2-1-1-2-1-1-5-1-1-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2. Arsenal have been in the top division non-stop since 1919-20 but had 13 seasons in the second tier at times before that. Although famously a top-four team since Arsene Wenger arrived in 1996-97, they have finished outside the top 10 as recently as 1994-95 (when 12th) and were distinctly mediocre and finishing well down the pecking order in the mid-1970s. Everton are one of 10 current league clubs who have played all 115 seasons since the league began in 1888-89; the others being Preston, Aston Villa, Wolves, Blackburn, Bolton, West Brom, Burnley, Derby and Notts County.

Manchester United are the fourth-best club in average finish (from 111 seasons), followed by Villa, Tottenham, Chelsea, Newcastle, Manchester City and Sunderland. The best team in this regard currently outside the Premier League are Leeds.

"It's the ultimate compliment for any player to have their talent recognised by their fellow professionals. So, to settle the argument of which is the greatest Premier League XI since it started in 1992-93, Sportsmail has studied every PFA  team of the year to find out which players are most highly-regarded by their peers. The results are fascinating – and surprising in some cases too. Legendary Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel was selected in only one PL all-star team (1993), as was Dennis Bergkamp (1998) and therefore are well short of being considered for the greatest XI. Peter Schmeichel famously saves a penalty from Dennis Bergkamp in 1999... but neither make the all-time XI . Eric Cantona and Paul Scholes weren't voted for often enough either while Gianfranco Zola – regarded as one of the best players in Chelsea's history – was never picked in a PFA side. Roy Keane and Frank Lampard were picked on fewer occasions than central midfield rivals Steven Gerrard and Patrick Vieira. Likewise, stars like Luis Suarez and Gareth Bale performed too briefly on the Premier League stage to be chosen as often as other players. Based on the number of times they were voted for by their fellow professionals in the PFA Premier team of the season, here is the best  XI over the last 23 years. And for Gerrard, heavily criticised after his red card against Manchester United on Sunday, there is some good news – nobody has been picked more often. THE PREMIER LEAGUE ALL TIME XI . EDWIN VAN DER SAR (PFA Team 2007, 2009, 2011) Played in Premier League for: Fulham, Manchester United . Sir Alex Ferguson compared the Dutchman's influence with Peter Schmeichel's after he helped Manchester United return to the top following a period of dominance by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea. Van der Sar was 34 when he joined United from Fulham but it proved to be a master signing, and one that Ferguson admitted he wished he'd made earlier. Van der Sar won three league titles in a row and was the hero of United's penalty shootout win against Chelsea in the 2008 Champions League final, making the match-winning save from Nicolas Anelka. Edwin van der Sar celebrates with his Manchester United team-mates after beating Chelsea in May 2011 . GARY NEVILLE (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2005, 2007) Played for: Manchester United . The heart of Manchester United's team that dominated English football for two decades and part of the 1999 Treble-winning side. Neville was United's effective leader and club captain off the field well before he eventually wore the armband on it. The right-back for United and England was the most voiceferous member of the famed Class of 92 and since retirement has become a hugely influential figure both as a television pundit and England coach . Gary Neville was a stalwart of the Manchester United side and was named six times in the PFA XI . RIO FERDINAND (2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013) Played for: West Ham, Leeds, Manchester United, QPR . A skilful centre half in the continental mould, Ferdinand started at West Ham but was first voted into the Premier League team in 2002 after an excellent season at Leeds United. After impressing at that summer's World Cup, Manchester United paid a £29million transfer fee for Ferdinand, a British record that stood for four years. He became an integral part of Manchester United's success in the 2000s culminating in their Premier League-Champions League double in 2008. Now plays for QPR but is expected to retire at the end of the season . NEMANJA VIDIC (2007, 2008, 2009, 2011) Played for: Manchester United . United's hard-man captain who formed a formidable central defensive partnership with Ferdinand. The Serbia international endured a poor first six months at Old Trafford after arriving from Russian football but went on to become a huge fans' favourite. One of the bravest players seen at Old Trafford, Vidic put his head and body in where others feared to, leading to a number of injuries. When Sir Alex Ferguson left, Vidic signed for Inter Milan, and the incoming manager David Moyes missed his presence. Nemanja Vidic (left) and Rio Ferdinand formed a formidable partnership at the heart of United's defence . ASHLEY COLE (2003, 2004, 2005, 2011) Played for: Arsenal, Chelsea . Considered by many the greatest English left back of all time with more than 100 caps, Cole won the Premier League title with Arsenal and Chelsea with fans in north London not forgiving him for moving to Stamford Bridge. Cole was quick, mobile and had the ability to defend and attack. The controversial decision by Roy Hodgson to leave him out of England's World Cup squad backfired and Cole decided to move abroad where he now plays in Serie A for Roma. One of the few defenders who could get the better of Cristiano Ronaldo in his prime. Ashley Cole (left) gets the better of Cristiano Ronaldo during the 2004-05 season . CRISTIANO RONALDO (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009) Played for: Manchester United . Hard to believe he was only in the Premier League for six years such was the impact he made. He was voted into the PFA team for four seasons in a row before he signed for Real Madrid for a then world-record fee of £80million. There were eyebrows raised when Sir Alex Ferguson sold David Beckham and unveiled an unknown Portuguese teenager. Ronaldo treated Old Trafford to a series of stepovers on his debut and by 2008 was voted World Player of the Year, the only time that honour has gone to someone in the Premier League after Michael Owen in 2001. He has subsequently gone on to scale even greater heights at Real Madrid. Ronaldo was named World Player of the Year during his outstanding Manchester United career . STEVEN GERRARD (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2014) Played for: Liverpool . Indisputably the best player of the Premier League era not to have won the championship, Gerrard is nonetheless regarded as the greatest player in Liverpool's history alongside Kenny Dalglish and was man of the match when he led their comeback in Istanbul to win a fifth European Cup in 2005. Gerrard in his prime was the ultimate box-to-box midfielder, stopping goals, creating goals and scoring goals, often spectacular ones. Will leave Liverpool this summer to join Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS. No player has been named in the PFA XI more times than Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (centre) PATRICK VIEIRA (1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004) Played for: Arsenal, Manchester City . Was voted into the PFA team for six consecutive years between 1999 and 2004, an unprecedented spell of dominance in the Premier League era. Vieira was Arsene Wenger's first signing – actually arriving at Highbury shortly before the manager who was tied up with contractual issues in Japan – and was the blueprint for an Arsenal team who set new standards for the whole country. A tall, quick and powerful midfielder, Vieira helped Arsenal win the Double and then succeeded Tony Adams as captain, leading the 2004 Invincibles side that went through an entire season unbeaten. Patrrick Vieira (right) gets in the team ahead of his great rival at Manchester United, Roy Keane (left) RYAN GIGGS (1993, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2009) Played for: Manchester United . Statistically the greatest player in the Premier League, with a record number of titles (13) and appearances (632), Giggs was named six times in the PFA team spanning a period of 16 years. He was a flying 19-year-old winger who had led Manchester United to their first championship for 26 years when he was named in the 1993 all-star side, and a clever 35-year-old central midfield playmaker when he was chosen in 2009. Now assistant manager to Louis van Gaal at United having been interim manager at the end of last season. Ryan Giggs back in 1993, when he was entered in his first PFA XI, 16 years before his last . ALAN SHEARER (1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003) Played for: Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United . The Premier League's record goalscorer with 260 – more than 70 goals ahead of anyone else, Shearer won the championship with Blackburn Rovers and became the only Premier League player to also be the world's most expensive player when he signed for hometown club Newcastle United for £15million having just finished as leading goalscorer at Euro 96 for England. Shearer could score all types of goals, rocket shots, tap-ins and headers, and following a brief spell as Newcastle's interim manager, is a respected TV pundit. Alan Shearer (left) and strike partner Chris Sutton celebrate after leading Blackburn to the title in 1995 . THIERRY HENRY (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006) Played for: Arsenal . Added Va-Va-Voom to the English game after Arsene Wenger signed him from Juventus and turned an inconsistent winger into the most lethal centre forward in Europe. Like Vieira, Henry was picked for six consecutive PFA teams and won the Golden Boot for being the leading scorer in the division on four occasions. Rivals Cristiano Ronaldo as being the best Premier League import ever seen and after spells with Barcelona and New York Red Bulls is back in this country, offering his views on the game with Sky Sports.

"Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more goals in European competitions than any other player following his brace against Schalke in the last-16 of the Champions League. Ronaldo struck twice to score his 77th and 78th goals in Europe, which puts him above  former Real Madrid team-mate Raul and Barcelona's Lionel Messi. The Portuguese international is also now level with Messi as the joint record all-time goalscorer in the Champions League proper - with 75 goals apiece in Europe's elite competition. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest goalscorer in European competitions with 78 goals . Ronaldo headed the ball past goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther during his side's match against Schalke . 78: Cristiano Ronaldo (Sporting Lisbon, Manchester United, Real Madrid) 77: Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) 76: Lionel Messi (Barcelona) 70: Filippo Inzaghi (Parma, Juventus, AC Milan) 67: Andriy Shevchenko (Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan, Chelsea) 62: Gerd Muller (Bayern Munich) 62: Ruud van Nistelrooy (Heerenveen, PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Hamburger) 59: Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) 59: Henrik Larsson (Feyenoord, Celtic, Barcelona, Helsingborgs) 56: Eusebio (Benfica) And the 30-year-old did not stop there when it came to breaking records on Tuesday night as he also became the first player in Real's history to score 40 or more goals in five consecutive seasons. However, the former Manchester United winger did not appear to be too happy after the final whistle despite his side's progression to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Ronaldo shook his head in disgust repeatedly and stared into the camera with a frosty glaze following Real Madrid's 4-3 defeat on the night. In fact, Ronaldo was so angry that he told reporters: 'I won't talk again until the end of the season.' Real Madrid fans jeered their side's players throughout the defeat and waved white hankies to show their unhappiness at the performance.

ITV pundit Roy Keane said of the atmosphere at the Santiago Bernabeu: ‘Usually when you qualify for the quarter-finals of the Champions League there is celebration in the stadium but they’re not happy. 'Everybody seemed a little nervous tonight, it was such a strange atmosphere. I’ve been to this stadium a number of times when it’s been bouncing and rocking but from the first whistle everyone just seemed nervous and on edge and it reflected in the team’s performance. 'He (Ronaldo) looked frustrated tonight. His body language wasn’t great. I think he was frustrated with everything with the way he started the game and then with his team-mates because the guy is a winner but obviously he produced the goods.' Real boss Carlo Ancelotti openly admitted after the match that his side deserved to be criticised. ‘It was bad for the image of the club,’ said Ancelotti. ‘The reaction of the crowd was totally justifiable but it will serve to wake us up. 'I still believe in the team because I know what they can give but at the moment they are not giving it. We are playing very badly. We need to train more, work more, we need more of everything.’ Meanwhile, Messi will have the chance to close the gap on Ronaldo's European record  when Barcelona host Manchester City at the Nou Camp on March 18.

"For much of the past four years, James Forrest has been damaged, both physically and mentally. Ronny Deila, the Celtic manager, describes him as a 'frightened' footballer. Self-belief was never an issue until a relentless series of muscle injuries began. To some, Forrest is the best player Celtic have. An £8million star-in-waiting. Reduced to the role of a walk-on extra in each of the past four seasons, however, it’s hard to be certain. ‘It’s been a long time since James Forrest has been consistently good,’ said Deila. ‘But, touch wood, that’s six months without a pulled muscle and he is moving in the right direction. Celtic winger James Forrest has been plagued by injuries during the last four years of his career . ‘We have been unbelievably patient with him because we have had to build him up from the bottom.’ Deila might have been describing ’70s TV character Steve Austin, The Six Million Dollar Man, rather than a winger recently rated in an altogether higher bracket. Stripped down and carefully rebuilt in a painstaking quest to get to the heart of the injuries that have rendered him a Parkhead bystander at times, there is cautious optimism from Deila that — this time — Forrest might just be ready. A second-half substitute and the scorer of the second goal against Dundee United, the winger was close to stealing the show in Sunday’s League Cup Final win. Yet his efforts were not appreciated by everyone. John Guidetti’s feelings on the spot-kick Forrest won and missed were embarrassingly public. Knocking the desk before him, however, Deila welcomed signs that the physical frailties in the Forrest make-up are healing. Forrest missed a penalty in the League Cup final after arguing with John Guidetti over who should take it . ‘It has been hard work building his self-belief back up, so that he won’t get these injuries,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘It has been slow. I was happy for him to score on Sunday and win a penalty. ‘But, you know, he is not even close to what he can be as a footballer. ‘I am happy he is going in the right direction — but we know there are still things to work on. ‘He has the right people around him and we know that, if we get it right, he will be a very important player for us.’ Arriving from Stromsgodset, Deila expected Forrest to be one of his key players. A coach who revels in the relentless quest for physical improvement, the Scotland international has become his pet project. According to Deila, the balance of his body was all wrong, his running style placing strain on vulnerable muscles. Celtic manager Ronny Deila says he has had to be patient with Forrest while he overcomes his injury hell . ‘James has been worse than he is now,’ he said. ‘He was afraid because he had been out for two of the past four years with a lot of pulled muscles. ‘You get frightened and we need to get his confidence back and believing in himself. It has been psychological, but it has also about getting the balance and control of his body. ‘He has a great attitude and is working hard. So far, we have managed to get him out of the cycle of pulled muscles — but he has had other things, as well. ‘When you get a sore knee or twisted ankle, it affects your way of running. ‘He’s in a very good place now after 30 minutes on Sunday and 90 minutes last week, plus full training on Monday and Tuesday.’ Forrest is available for selection against Dundee United in their Scottish Cup quarter-final replay. ‘I can see he will get better and better,’ said Deila, who can call again on Adam Matthews at right-back. ‘It’s about strengthening his core, getting balance to change direction at high speeds. The medical staff have been working hard at getting it right, but now he needs more time on the pitch. Forrest smashes the ground in frustration after failing to score the rebound to his missed penalty . ‘His body is not nearly where it should be. It takes him five days to recover from playing 90 minutes. ‘We have to be careful because, when you are tired, that’s when you get pulled muscles. ‘We have to build him up step by step. Hopefully, in six months we will be sitting feeling excited about James Forrest.’ His inclusion in Gordon Strachan’s Scotland squad to face Northern Ireland and Gibraltar surprised some as much as did the exclusion of Forrest’s new Parkhead team-mates Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong. ‘I am not surprised about Scotland because they are thinking the same as us,’ said Deila. ‘They know what he is able to do and his skills are so high in certain situations, like when we want pace and touch, ability in one-on-ones. Gordon will be thinking about Gibraltar and he needs players who can go past defenders. ‘Stuart and Gary have just started at Celtic and I think they need more consistency and performances. In the end, hopefully, they will be good enough to get into the squad.’ The 23-year-old did get his name on the score sheet however as Celtic beat Dundee United 2-0 . After already playing for United in the Scottish Cup, neither can face their former club on Wednesday evening. Familiarity is in danger of breeding contempt between the teams and others must wish they could also excuse themselves from a third meeting in 10 days. The three games have featured four red cards (two rescinded) and three penalty kicks. United’s keeper Rado Cierzniak has saved two of them. To that end, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons will again be assigned spot-kick duties for Celtic. Guidetti, who had a spectacular public strop after Forrest held firm on Sunday, will again be told to stand aside. ‘I have not said so much,’ remarked Deila of that episode. ‘We have talked about it, but it’s nothing. ‘We had Leigh and Kris to take penalties and both were off. ‘I don’t have any problems with John as a character. He is a funny boy. He is a striker who loves scoring goals and wants to take penalties. ‘They are young players and they have to learn and use these experiences to get better. ‘We talked about the need to put the team first. There’s no point arguing inside the team.’","James Forrest has been cursed with injuries throughout the last four years .

"Over the course of his career, Michael Chopra’s net-finding abilities have cost clubs in excess of £9million in transfer fees. Once tipped as Alan Shearer’s heir apparent during his formative days at Newcastle United, he made a fortune in English football, lost a chunk of it through a well- publicised gambling addiction, and most recently played in the Indian Super League with Kerala Blasters. Now, in a move that caused Scottish football to perform a collective double take, Chopra has joined Championship strugglers Alloa Athletic until the end of the season. Michael Chopra appears for Alloa Athletic for the first time against Rangers at Ibrox on Tuesday . The 31-year-old made his debut as an injury-time substitute during Tuesday night’s 2-2 draw with Rangers at Ibrox, confirming that this remarkable coup by a part-time club hadn’t actually been some form of elaborate hoax. Among the many questions that sprang up from his appearance in a black-and-gold jersey, a simple one seemed the most obvious: Why? ‘Once I finished in India, my main objective was to get back and I’ve been looking around at what leagues I could play in,’ said Chopra, a former England youth international who was most prolific during two spells at Cardiff City. ‘The last week I’ve been training at Port Vale and I got a phone call on Monday asking if I would like to come to Alloa, and I jumped at the chance. ‘This isn’t a financial thing because I could have got more money from one of the offers I had in England but I just want to play and get some goals. Chopra (right) comes on as a substitute during the second half of the Scottish Championship match . Chopra speaks on his phone as he walks on the pitch ahead of the Rangers match on Tuesday . ‘It’s a challenge for me but, if I can help keep Alloa in the Championship, then it will have been well worth it. ‘I’m also desperate to play in the Petrofac Training Cup Final (against Livingston on April 5) because I’ve never actually won anything in the game and it would be brilliant if we won that. People ask me if I even knew of Alloa but I did — I actually watched them beat Rangers 3-2 on the telly earlier in the season! ‘I loved it at Ibrox the other night when I got a couple of minutes. I can’t believe Alloa are where they are in the league. ‘I’ve never played in Scotland before but I thought the standard was good and the fitness levels unbelievable when you consider we’re part-time. ‘Honestly, I played for Blackpool admittedly during some hard times for that club (last season) but this Alloa team is better than that Blackpool one. Alan Shearer (right) celebrates with Chopra after scoring for Newcastle against Wigan in April 2006 . ‘And here at least you know the guys will give 100 per cent. You know you will get a shift from the guy next to you and that’s not always been the case elsewhere.’ Chopra hopes his influence will also be felt outside of match scenarios. His aim is to copy the illustrious names who aided his own career by helping develop the more youthful players at Recreation Park. ‘I remember when I was at Newcastle and I was a young boy, I was playing with Alan Shearer, Michael Owen and Patrick Kluivert and they gave me the best experience possible,’ recalled Chopra. ‘They made me the player I am today and I’ll be looking to try and help all the young boys at the club and passing my experience on. ‘I will stay up here a lot of the time, although I’m going back to Newcastle this weekend because my son plays football and I can’t miss his game! ‘Otherwise, I will be up here training and playing, and I’m hoping to be able to train with St Mirren on a Friday if that can be finalised. ‘I’m also going to be coaching the kids on a Wednesday night. I want to put something back in and community coaching will be good.’ Chopra celebrates a goal for Sunderland against Middlesbrough at the Stadium of Light in September 2008 . Chopra (centre) in action for Cardiff against Dagenham and Redbridge in the Carling Cup first round in 2009 . Chopra’s advice may also extend to the perils of gambling. During a court case in 2013, he estimated he had blown around £2m through the vice. He was still a teenager when involved in card games on the Newcastle team bus that could see up to £30,000 in cash change hands. Chopra also claimed the main reason he joined Sunderland in 2007 was because the signing-on fee would pay off his debts. His situation deteriorated to such a point that he told the court he had been threatened by loan sharks at the Ipswich Town training ground during a later stint in Suffolk. Chopra then sought help from the Sporting Chance clinic, the facility set up by former England defender Tony Adams to treat behavioural problems such as alcohol, drug and gambling addictions in professional and amateur sports people. ‘I’ve had problems, well- documented ones, in the past but I’ve moved on,’ he insisted. ‘Everyone makes mistakes and I certainly made some but I’ve put all that behind me. I’m trying to be positive, I’ve cleaned up my act and I’m on the straight and narrow.’ Chopra isn’t discounting still being at Alloa next season and clearly has a genuine hunger to be scoring again after an injury-scarred spell in India. Chopra warms up ahead of a match between Blackpool and Birmingham at Bloomfield Road in February 2014 . Chopra (left) plays for Kerala Blasters against Atletico de Kolkata in the Indian Super League last December . ‘That was a great experience,’ he said. ‘My dad is Indian, so that made it more interesting as well. Unfortunately I suffered a hamstring injury early on and then I ruptured my ankle ligaments, but it was still great seeing it all. ‘My team-mates included Stephen Pearson and Jamie McAllister. I spoke to Jamie about this move the other night and he was very encouraging. ‘Now I just want to give it my best shot and help Alloa as much as I can — and if things go well I certainly wouldn’t rule out staying on. Alloa are very ambitious. ‘But right now I am only thinking about playing and doing well and I haven’t spent too much time thinking of what will happen beyond the summer.’ Key to the completion of one of the most fascinating transfers of the season was Lee Ebden, Alloa’s head of player recruitment. Chopra (left) shakes hands with Alloa caretaker manager Paddy Connolly at Ibrox on Tuesday . ‘I heard Michael could be available through my contacts and, after that, I did a bit of homework — including speaking to Chris Hutchins, who was assistant manager at Ipswich when Michael was there — and got glowing references,’ said Ebden. ‘Chairman Mike Mulraney was very supportive as always and gave me the go-ahead. ‘Michael is within our budget. He will get the same bonus as the other lads if we stay in the Championship and, if he helps us do that, then he will have been well worth the effort. ‘We’ve made a massive statement because we are desperate to stay in this league and then look to do better next season when, who knows, Michael could still be with us.’","Michael Chopra signed for Alloa Athletic on Tuesday .

"Manchester United are the biggest club in England when it comes to crowds - both now and historically - and the joint biggest along with Liverpool when it comes to ‘star players’ in their line-ups, all-time. Crowds and stars have been considered as part of a Sportsmail study to explore which English clubs are the ‘biggest’; 58 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been included in the study, having played in England’s top division for at least a season. Two different measurements were used for crowds - the average gates for each club this season, plus the biggest gate each club has ever had at any point. The aim of this was to gauge not just one season but reflect former ‘greatness’ for clubs now enduring leaner times but who were authentic giants at some point. Manchester United, averaging over 75,000 fans every game at Old Trafford, top the crowds list . This is what Maine Road looked like in 1934, the year Manchester City recorded a record attendance of 84,569 . Arsenal's Emirates Stadium sees them second in attendances for this season, and fourth overall on crowds . CLICK HERE to see Sportsmail's definitive list of the BIGGEST clubs in England . United’s current average attendances of more than 75,000 leaves them way ahead of the field, with Arsenal in second place just below 60,000, then Newcastle (nearly 51,000), Manchester City (45,400), Liverpool (44,700), with Chelsea, Sunderland, Everton, Tottenham and West Ham filling out the top 10. All 59 clubs in the study have been ranked on current attendances, and separately on their biggest historic gates. An aggregate of those two ranks gives the overall crowd ranking topped by United, with City in second place, then Chelsea, Arsenal and Sunderland. City have the highest single attendance for a home club match in English football - almost 85,000 were at Maine Road for the game in question, an FA Cup tie against Stoke in 1934. United are the club with the next biggest home record, just over 83,000 for a league match with Arsenal in 1948. We ranked all clubs on the size of their average gates during this season to reflect contemporary pull. Then we ranked each club by the size of their biggest historic gates. Their overall crowd rank is an aggregate of current pull and also potential based on past highs. Incidentally, this was also played at Maine Road, which United were using at that time because Old Trafford had been so damaged in the blitz. Eight other clubs also have record home attendances of more than 70,000: Chelsea, Everton, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Tottenham, Charlton, Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday and these all-time highs are reflective of these clubs having massive paying support in different eras. AFC Wimbledon's support may be loud and loyal, but they are bottom of our list in terms of crowds . With Kingsmeadow one of the Football League's smallest grounds, AFC Wimbledon rank low on attendance . We counted the number of players from each club who have played for England, all-time, ranking the clubs by total. This reflects historic ‘bigness’. We then ranked the clubs by the number of players provided to the 2014 World Cup — a measure of modern ‘bigness’. The overall ranking is an aggregate of these two. To measure the amount of ‘star’ players at each club, both all-time and more recently, our study used two objective criteria - the number of players capped by England at each club, ever, and the number of players called up by their countries for the most recent World Cup. The notion of ‘stars’ will always be subjective. That is a given. But using proxies of England players over time and World Cup players last summer allowed hard data to compare all the clubs on a like-for-like basis. The clubs have been ranked on each criteria with an aggregate ranking to determine the ‘biggest’ clubs in terms of all-time stars. Using this method, United and Liverpool are joint top. Liverpool have provided the third most England players, all-time (67), behind Aston Villa in first place (73) and Tottenham (71). They also provided the joint third-most players of all the clubs in the English league to the World Cup (10). Manchester United had the most players of any English team at the World Cup, including Wayne Rooney . Liverpool were third for number of players at the World Cup, including Luis Suarez and Steven Gerrard . Fabian Delph is the only Aston Villa in the current England squad, but they top the historical list . United provided the most players to the World Cup of all English clubs (14), followed by Chelsea (12) then Liverpool, Arsenal and City on 10 each. United have provided the fifth most England players, or 65 to date. Thus both Liverpool and United’s aggregate ‘star player’ rankings are the same. Our ‘star player’ index has Arsenal and Tottenham in joint third, followed by Everton, City and Chelsea in joint fifth, then Aston Villa in eighth, Newcastle in ninth, with West Brom and Southampton joint 10th. The full rankings are in the tables below.","Manchester City top the all-time top attendance list from a game in 1934 .

"Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid are in a mini-crisis mode, with world stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale struggling for form. Real fan Lucas Navarrete of managingmadrid.com writes on the team's current troubles, and why he wouldn't hesitate to drop a big name. Carlo Ancelotti’s Real Madrid have recorded five losses, two draws and just one win in La Liga’s toughest venues since the Italian took over: Nou Camp (Barcelona), Vicente Calderon (Atletico Madrid), Mestalla (Valencia), Sanchez Pizjuan (Sevilla) and San Mames (Athletic Bilbao). The fans remember how successful the team was during last season’s run at the Champions League and the Copa del Rey, and they also have in mind why that happened. In those three games – the Copa del Rey final and the Champions League semi-finals —Real Madrid played with a 4-4-2 formation that allowed them to defend properly and counterattack at the earliest opportunity. Cristiano Ronaldo looks on in horror after Atheltic Bilbao score to consign Real Madrid to another defeat . A sorry Madrid forward line kick off after Artiz Aduriz sends San Mames wild by putting Bilbao ahead . Real employed a 4-4-2  to devastating effect against Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League . The team’s attacking trio of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema did not feature together on two out of those three games, the other one being the return leg against Bayern in the Allianz Arena. Injuries to Bale (a 1-0 win against Bayern at the Bernabeu) and Ronaldo (Copa del Rey final) forced Ancelotti to use a 4-4-2 system that proved to be so solid that the Italian coach played Gareth Bale as a midfielder on Real’s historic 4-0 win in Germany. This season, Bale also had to miss last October’s Clasico. Ancelotti knew what he had to do, he used that same 4-4-2 formation with James and Isco on the wings, and Real Madrid were able to come back and earn a convincing 3-1 win against Messi and Co. Considering how badly the team have struggled against Valencia and Atletico Madrid since 2015 started, it’s not surprising to see that several polls around the Spanish media prove that the fans want to see that 4-4-2 formation again. Welsh star Gareth Bale has provoked the ire of the Real Madrid fans for his percieved selfishness . Many Madrid fans are calling for Bale to be the odd man out if they are to switch back to the 4-4-2 system . The £86million Bale tries in vain to turn around his side's fortunes in Saturday's disappointing loss . If that happens, Ancelotti will either be forced to move one of the BBC to the bench or play Bale in a much more defensive role. That will turn Real Madrid into a less-glamorous side, but they will also be a solid team capable of beating tough opponents once and for all. The BBC-system works and is good enough to easily dismantle most La Liga and Champions League teams. But whenever you go up against the best clubs in European football, you need to have a good defensive plan that the usual 4-3-3 formation does not provide. Given that Ronaldo is Real Madrid's best player and that Benzema is the team's only centre forward, it would be reasonable to think that Bale would indeed be the one moving to the bench if Ancelotti decides to use this 4-4-2 formation, and that would be the right call. The buck stops with manager Carlo Ancelotti when it comes to choosing a big name to lose from his line-up . Benzema is crucial to the team's fluidity upfront, setting up his teammates and helping the midfielders at controlling the tempo of the game, and unless Ronaldo changes his game and becomes a pure striker, the Frenchman is the only player in the roster capable of doing that. While it would be tempting not to pay attention to the fans' whistles, having the Bernabeu fans against you is always the first step towards a move out of the club, and that's why Ancelotti should try to regain the fans' support. The Santiago Bernabeu is a very demanding crowd and they have already affected the way Gareth Bale plays. After the whistles, the Welsh player is not attempting nearly as many shots as he was when things were working out well for him, so Ancelotti will surely use Bale's experience as a good example to change Real Madrid's shape and improve the way his team is defending. If a £86m player needs to sit on the bench, so be it. Real's deadly rivals Barcelona are in  form, with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi celebrating against Rayo .","Madrid lost to Atheltic Bilbao 1-0 on Saturday in a blow to their title chance .

"Manchester United are the most popular English football club worldwide and also the wealthiest. They are comfortably ahead of all their rivals in both these categories, with just four contenders in the pack behind them vying to be authentic ‘global’ names with financial clout to match. That quartet are Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. Popularity has been measured by combined followings on Facebook and Twitter - the two biggest social media platforms, used by more than a billion people - while wealth has been measured by income in the most recently completed season, namely 2013-14. Manchester United are closing in on five million followers on social media site Twitter . United have also attracted a staggering 63 million likes on Facebook . At the other end of the scale, Northampton Town have fewer than 30,000 followers on Twitter . The clubs’ global fanbases and wealth have been considered as part of a Sportsmail study to explore which English clubs are the ‘biggest’; 58 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been included in the study, having played in England’s top division for at least a season. United were slower than most clubs in embracing social media, not setting up an official Facebook page until 2010 and only starting an official Twitter account in 2012. But with a following now of more than 70 million people across those two platforms, United are way ahead of Chelsea in second place (47m), Arsenal (38m), Liverpool (30m) and City (21m). There is then a big drop-off before Tottenham in sixth (7.5m) and another drop off before Aston Villa, Everton and Newcastle, each with between two and three million ‘followers’ on official social network platforms. No other teams have as many as two million, although every club in the country now has an official Facebook and Twitter presence and all clubs have at least tens of thousands of followers on these sites. Manchester City are the defending Premier League champions but trail their rivals United in the money table . The full details for all the clubs in Sportsmail's study are in the accompanying tables. ‘Big’ clubs almost by definition will have lots of supporters of one kind or another; increasingly these are spread around the world, fans whose primary engagement with the teams they follow being via television and the internet. It is notable how significant membership or recent membership of the Premier League appears to be in influencing the number of social media followers. Swansea, Hull, Fulham, QPR, Stoke and Norwich all make the top 20 in our list whereas multiple former English title winners including Leeds, Wolves and Blackburn do not. Does that mean Swansea are ‘bigger’ than Leeds? As a straightforward proposition, most neutrals would agree not. But it goes without saying the Swansea, currently, as a stable, well-run Premier League club are currently ‘bigger’, ie: higher up, richer, better marketed to a worldwide audience as part of the global commodity that is the Premier League. Similarly, any club currently in the Premier League or there very recently is likely to be richer than clubs that are not and have not been. United lead the way in income, earning £433m in revenues last season, ahead of City in second place then Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. Southampton, Swansea, Stoke and Crystal Palace all make the top 15 clubs on this measure where again the likes of Wolves, Blackburn and Leeds are in the lower reaches of the top 30.","Manchester United are clear at the top of social media and money tables .
They have almost 25 million more followers than the next club Chelsea .

"Paul Pogba struck a late goal to send Juventus 11 points clear at the top of Serie A as the Frenchman continues to show why he's one of Europe's most coveted midfielders. Juve scraped past Sassuolo on Monday as the playmaker scored his seventh league goal of the campaign and gave them a clear lead over nearest rivals Roma with 12 games left to play.

"Carlo Ancelotti has the best comeback lines. He's a soft touch, they've been saying in Madrid; the club needs to be ruled with an iron fist, they add; the players need tough love, they complain. Ancelotti dealt with the issue last week in a press conference, arching his trademark left eyebrow into its most quizzical state of scepticism. 'This soft touch has won three Champions League,' he said. And it's hard to argue with that. They will argue with it, of course, at Real Madrid. Tuesday's Champions League tie against Schalke should be some blessed relief from domestic worries but then this has often been Ancelotti's way. He is after all the Champions League specialist. The debacle of Istanbul aside - when his team threw away a 3-0 lead to lose the 2005 final Liverpool – it is a competition which has been very good to him. Carlo Ancelotti characteristically raises his eyebrow during a press conference on Monday . Ancelotti's laid-back attitude means he is loved by the majority he comes into contact with . It was the trophy that saved him last summer. The muttering at the club was that he would be dismissed but, having delivered the much-anticipated 'decima' - Real Madrid's tenth European Cup after a gap of twelve years - even the powers that be at the Bernebeu didn't quite have the stomach to sack him. But the credit Ancelotti accrued for that historic win is now being called in. At the turn of the year Real Madrid were considered the most-formidable team in world football; they had a four-point lead at the top of La Liga and the so-called BBC – Bale, Benezema and Cristiano – looked unstoppable. Whatever happened to the players over the Christmas break, it wasn't good. Since then the club has been knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Atletico Madrid, which was quickly followed by the 4-0 defeat at the Vicente Calderon to their Madrid rivals. Then there was the under-par home draw to Real Villareal last weekend and Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao. Real Madrid - and Cristiano Ronaldo - have struggled for results in recent weeks . There are doubts over the suitability of Welshman Gareth Bale at the Bernabeu . Athletic Bilbao players run off to celebrate with Aritz Aduriz after scoring during the win over Real . Angel di Maria with last season's Champions League trophy - which saved Ancelotti's job . The 4-0 defeat to Atletico was the one that really stung president Florentino Perez and it elicited a presidential visit to the dressing room and promise from the team leaders that things would improve. But those captains include Sergio Ramos, currently out injured, Iker Casillas, described by one commentator as being reduced to the status of a 'celebrity' in goal, and Cristiano Ronaldo, whistled at the Bernebeu for enjoying an extravagant birthday party on the immediate aftermath of that 4-0 defeat. When the president demands more and the result is a 1-1 home draw and a defeat to Athletic, then it's the manager who gets the blame. Ancelotti is well used to this of course. He is a specialist in working for the most-demanding owners football can fathom, his CV including stints with Calisto Tanzi at Parma, who was eventually convicted of £6million fraud, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at AC Milan, Roman Abramovich at Chelsea and now Perez at Real Mardid. And he has played this part before. His final year at Chelsea was also undermined by whispers that he was too friendly with the players, that he wasn't tough enough on them, that the training was too soft. The fact that John Terry, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole loved Ancelotti – they took him to the pub on the last day of the season in 2011 when Ancelotti had found out he had been sacked – probably didn't help, given that those three players were not in the good books of the board at the time. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has made his feelings known in the Spanish capital . There is a deeper parallel between Chelsea and Real Madrid. Both had tired of the antics and histrionics of Jose Mourinho and eventually settled on Ancelotti as the polar opposite. Where Mourinho attacks at full throttle, Ancelotti can make his point with a mere raising of those expressive eyebrows; where Mourinho sees conspiracies, Ancelotti simply smiles enigmatically; and while Mourinho appears to value a state of perpetual conflict, Ancelotti prefers to be a peacemaker. But while he is seen as the antidote to Mourinho, when things go wrong, what were once seen as strengths are suddenly picked on as weakness: he is too conciliatory, too consensual, too caring. It is hard not to like Ancelotti. Not many managers at his level would have the self-depreciation to describe themselves as 'a fat boy with a bowful of Emilian tortellini.' When Juventus fans compared him to a pig, he objected on the grounds that it was insulting to pigs. After all, he had grown up on a pig farm and food is the other great passion of his life. He once took David Beckham on a 100-mile round trip to Parma to ensure he tried a favourite restaurant. Ronaldo heads home as Real Madrid comfortably swept aside Schalke in the last-16 first leg in Germany . Jose Mourinho and Ancelotti's feud was defused by the Italian in a matter of seconds . Ancelotti once took David Beckham (centre) on a 100-mile drive to show him his favourite restaurant . His playful humour is often lost in translation. But he is the man who once took up an entire team meeting at AC Milan to organise a practical joke on Mathieu Flamini, the punch line of which was unprintable and adolescent in its obscenity and yet funny nonetheless. His geniality won't save him of course. Though progressing through to the Champions League quarter-finals should be a breeze, with a 2-0 lead secured in Gelsenkirchen, there is a meeting with Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Sunday week which now looks ominous. Being pleasant is never enough. But being good can be and fortunately Ancelotti is. Significantly all the signs are that the players at Real Madrid are behind him but then he is hard man to fall out with for long. When he and Mourinho were trading barbs, when Ancelotti was at AC Milan and Chelsea and Mourinho was at Inter, the Italian eventually wearied of the whole charade. When Chelsea and Inter met in the Champions League that year Ancelotti deliberately sort out Mourinho in the tunnel beforehand to shake hands and agree a truce. 'We made a pact,' said Ancelotti. 'No more bickering, no more controversy. Six words, a handshake and in ten seconds we had an understanding.' It's hard to fight against grace. In quietly going about his business, he demonstrates that there's more than one way to be an effective football manager. The big bosses who run football clubs may be un-nerved by his manner but they cannot deny his record. And if he does need the Champions League to save him yet again this year, starting with Schalke, at least he knows the competition is like an old friend to him, always there to help him through the critical moments in his career.","Carlo Ancelotti's laid-back style offers relief from other managers .

I still believe in the team because I know what they can give but at the moment they are not giving it. We are playing very badly. We need to train more, work more, we need more of everything.’ Ronaldo headed in a Toni Kroos corner on 25 minutes to cancel out Christian Fuchs’ shock opener and when Schalke took the lead again on 40 minutes through Klass-Jan Huntelaar, Ronaldo headed in a Fabio Coentrao cross to equalise. It was his rage at the lacklustre performance from some of his team-mates more than his finishing that was most striking. Karim Benzema scored eight minutes into the second half but Real still allowed Schalke to level on the night with substitute Leroy Sane beating Casillas with a long range shot and when Huntelaar got his second five minutes from time it left Roberto Di Matteo’s team needing just one more goal for one of the all-time Champions League shocks. The fifth goal never came and Madrid stumbled over the line but this was hardly a performance to put fear into the rest of Europe. The mood was set before kick-off when supporters jeered Ancelotti’s name as it was announced. The credit he earned for winning this competition last season seems to have long since disappeared. He needed a positive Champions League display from his players – he never got one. Real looked flat going forward and were slow to cover space at the back and when Tranquillo Barnetta crossed from the right on 25 minutes, he found Fuchs with time and space to shoot past Iker Casillas. Sami Khedira, who will leave on a free transfer at the end of the season had failed to follow Fuchs’ run and Casillas was beaten too easily. Ronaldo turned to shout at his sleepy team-mates after he rose to head in Kroos’ corner five minutes later but Madrid did not wake up.

Schalke are starting to gain a reputation for spectacular exits from the Champions League.

They might not have made progress, but Schalke get full marks for entertainment, as these aggregate scores show... 2014, last 16 . Real Madrid 9-2 Schalke . 2013, last 16 . Galatasaray 4-3 Schalke . 2011, semi-final . Manchester United 6-1 Schalke . James Restall . A Raphael Varane back pass almost let in Huntelaar who then rattled the bar. And with his third chance inside five minutes he found the back of the net. Casillas spilled Meyer’s shot straight to the Dutchman and, against his old club, he made it 2-1. Ronaldo stepped forward to level once again but a crescendo of whistles still greeted the half-time whistle. Benzema put them 3-2 up on the night on 53 minutes but Leroy Sane beat Casillas from distance to cause further embarrassment. This was the first time since 2009 Madrid had conceded three at home in Europe. Ancelotti immediately brought on Modric and Marcelo for Khedira and Coentrao. The Croatian looked to restore some control to midfield but when Huntelaar got his second of the game off the underside of Casillas’ bar the miracle looked back on for Schalke’s 4,000 following. Gareth Bale was jeered when he shot well wide from a good position. He is a victim rather than the cause of Madrid’s malaise but is starting to struggle in front of the club’s unforgiving supporters. He will be glad that former Tottenham team-mate Luka Modric is now back in the side alongside him. His return and Ronaldo’s reliability were the plus points for Madrid on a night when they answered more questions than provided answers. Around 1,000 Real Madrid supporters had voted for Ronaldo to be dropped earlier this week in a poll organized by Spanish newspaper Diario AS. Whether they were at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night or at home clicking other online surveys it is impossible to know.

There is a Under-20s game on Wednesday and I will get a look at some of the boys in that. ‘I thought (Andrew) Murdoch was terrific tonight, I thought (Tom) Walsh was terrific. And we had decent performances from a couple of others. ‘We weren’t rotten tonight. We were better than we were on Saturday. We’ve drawn twice with Alloa already this season and it was never going to be 3-0 or 4-0. Rangers manager McCall insists he saw some positives on Tuesday night against Alloa . Rangers were forced to share the points with Alloa as some familiar flaws haunted them at Ibrox . ‘The players showed spirit and ability after coming from behind to go ahead but we’ve switched off and let them score with their second time up the park. It is easy to knock what is going on here. I respect that and understand that. ‘But there is a fight to be had and we have got to have enough fighters to believe we can go on and still make this season a success. But tonight is a massive disappointment. Ibrox has become a hard place to play and the players know they’ve got themselves in this position with their performances in recent months.’ Meanwhile, the SFA’s appeal against Steve Simonsen’s two-match ban for gambling on football matches has been postponed due to the unavailability of tribunal members. The appeal was due to be held today but a new date will now be set.","Rangers drew 2-2 with Alloa Athletic at Ibrox on Tuesday night .

"As the part-time players of managerless Alloa Athletic punched the air in celebration of their latest point against Rangers, the scale of the job facing Stuart McCall veered into sharp focus. Frankly, the new Ibrox boss faces the biggest uphill task since Sir Edmund Hillary conquered Everest if he is to succeed in getting this bunch of players back to the summit league of Scottish football. On a night when Alloa left their shock new signing — ex-Sunderland and Newcastle striker Michael Chopra — on the bench until the dying embers of the match, a glancing header by former Chelsea kid Ben Gordon opened the scoring and had Rangers on the back foot. Rangers' Lee Wallace and Alloa's Jonathan Tiffoney tussle for the ball during the match at Ibrox . Rangers forward Dean Shiels challenges Alloa's Kevin Crawley during the Scottish Championship game . Alloa's new signing, former Sunderland and Newcastle striker Michael Chopra, made his debut at Irbox . Two goals from Nicky Clark in five minutes looked like somehow securing a rare victory for a stodgy and lethargic Rangers but Liam Buchanan’s late leveller ensured deserved parity for the team from the Wee County. It was merely the latest sting from the Wasps, who have now drawn twice at Ibrox in the league this season, as well as holding Rangers at home in the Championship and knocking them out of the Petrofac Training Cup in Clackmannanshire. For Ibrox fans, the elation of Dave King’s boardroom coup has very much been replaced by the utter deflation that comes as standard when watching this side. Indeed, when McCall’s team travels to Easter Road on Sunday hoping to keep their play-off hopes alive, the second-most expensively assembled squad in the country can be said to pitch up in Leith in the grip of relegation-esque form. Over the course of the last nine games — a quarter of a league season — third-placed Rangers have dropped 19 points from an available 27. In context, they have picked up eight points, while second-bottom Alloa and rock-bottom Livingston — who drew at Ibrox on Saturday — both have amassed six over the same time period. Rangers' Nicky Law gives chase to Alloa's Mark Docherty during the Scottish Championship match at Ibrox . And, worryingly for McCall, not even five changes to his starting line-up could inject any badly-needed urgency into proceedings. There was a first-team recall for goalkeeper Cammy Bell, who was pulling on a Rangers jersey for the first time in seven months after recovering from a shoulder injury. That meant Lee Robinson was on the bench, with veteran keeper Steve Simonson dropping out of the squad altogether. Injuries meant Rangers were without defender Sebastian Faure and attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, who has been one of the Ibrox club’s best players since arriving on loan from Newcastle United. Striker Kenny Miller dropped to the bench, while Kyle Hutton found himself left out of the squad completely. But the team news that stood out was Chopra, who took his place on the bench and would remain there for most of the evening. Rangers' Andy Murdoch and Alloa's Kevin Crawley both raise their feet for the ball during the 2-2 draw . In front of a crowd of 28,902, the first chance fell to Rangers. Lee Wallace raced down the left and his cross found its way to Clark, who turned and shot over the bar. Then captain Lee McCulloch seized on a corner and, when his first effort was blocked, his subsequent shot went out for a throw-in. The grumbles from the Ibrox stands began on 12 minutes. With each passing minute they grew louder. But young Tom Walsh gave them something to get excited about when he picked up a pass from Dean Shiels and sent a 20-yarder narrowly over the top of Craig McDowall’s crossbar. Kris Boyd then had a chance after good work down the left from Shiels. But his turn and shot ended with the ball being fired straight down McDowall’s throat. Young Andrew Murdoch then had a firm shot saved easily by McDowall. In the best move of the match, Walsh powered down the right and slipped a clever ball into the overlapping Wallace, but the full-back’s ball across goal was turned over his own bar by Michael Doyle. On a rare foray up the park, Kevin Cawley sent a weak right-foot shot from distance scampering wide of Bell’s goal. It had been a listless first half and the jeers at half-time were from fans who sounded wearily accustomed to this type of fare.

Clark celebrates his second goal Alloa player look frustrated with themselves for conceding . Despite Clark's brace, Rangers go on to draw 2-2 and interim boss Stuart McCall knows the scale of his job . There were more jeers at the start of the second half when the Ibrox support were beseeching their side to show some attacking urgency, only for Darren McGregor to take the safe option of a back-pass from the halfway line to keeper Bell. Worse was to follow when Alloa scored with their first meaningful effort on goal. Michael Docherty’s free-kick was glanced home by Gordon as Ibrox was left stunned, but not surprised. ‘Cancel their day off this week anaw Stuart,’ shouted a furious lone voice at the back of the Bill Struth Main Stand. Rangers nearly levelled with a header from Marius Zalkiukas but McDowall was equal to it as he pulled off a diving save. McCall’s side got back into it, however, when McCulloch’s deflected shot hit the bar and Clark cleverly diverted the ball with his head into the bottom corner past the stranded McDowall. Clark then thought he had won the match when he headed in a fine cross from the left by substitute David Templeton. Buchanan’s intervention in the 82nd minute, when he superbly chipped the ball over Bell and into the net, put paid to that idea. Buchanan was replaced by Chopra in the 95th minute but there was no time for the journeyman, who has cost £9.5million in transfer fees over the course of his troubled career, to become a hero. But, as the Alloa players milked their standing ovation from their hardy bunch of fans, the jeers and shouts of ‘disgrace’ that greeted the Rangers players at the final whistle left everyone in no doubt who, once again, were the villains of the piece. Rangers players look dejected after the final whistle as their hopes of promotion continue to fade away .","Rangers were held to a draw by part-time players of Alloa Athletic at Ibrox .

"Scottish Championship side Alloa Athletic have pulled off a coup with the shock signing of former English Premier League star Michael Chopra. The former Newcastle, Sunderland and Cardiff forward was most recently contracted to Indian side Kerala Blasters, and had been training with Port Vale. But managerless minnows Alloa – who play on a plastic pitch at 3100-capacity Indodrill Stadium – have announced they had signed the 31-year-old until the end of the season, subject to international clearance.

The well travelled forward has played for clubs including Blackpool (above), Sunderland and Ipswich . Alloa, who are known as the Wasps, face Rangers on Tuesday night in the Championship and the club are hoping international clearance will be received in time for Chopra to make his debut at Ibrox. The Clackmannanshire club moved for Chopra after their head of recruitment, Lee Ebden, became aware of the striker's availability after he left cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar's football club in India . Caretaker boss Paddy Connolly, filling the dugout after boss Barry Smith quit, was thrilled with the capture and reckons Chopra's experience could be vital for the Wasps in their fight for Championship survival. 'We are delighted to bring someone of Michael's pedigree into the club,' Connolly told the Alloa Advertiser. Chopra celebrates after scoring a goal for Cardiff in the Championship . The 31-year-old started his footballing career as a youngster on Newcastle's books . 'When the chance came up from the chairman, I felt it was a no brainer because of the level he has played at in the game. 'He's played in the Premiership down south for many years and then played abroad so he is a very experienced. I know the player through watching him over the years and he is still only 31 so I am sure he still has plenty to offer. 'He is still short of some match sharpness, but I am sure his arrival will be a lift for the players and the club as whole.'","Scottish Championship side pulled off a coup by signing Michael Chopra .

"Gordon Strachan insists he has no need to lay down the law to any of his Scotland players. The issue of professionalism among footballers was again raised after the Scots' skipper Scott Brown was pictured apparently slumped in the street after an alleged drunken night out in Edinburgh last Wednesday. After his Hoops side lifted the Scottish League Cup with a 2-0 win over Dundee United at Hampden on Sunday, manager Ronny Deila was at pains to stress his midfielder had not broken any rules although he conceded the incident had not been 'a positive example' for youngsters. Gordon Strachan says he hasn't brought in any new rules over his Scotland squad in light of Scott Brown's . Strachan was speaking at the national stadium after announcing his squad for the home friendly against Northern Ireland and the Euro qualifier against Gibraltar later in the month. The former Celtic boss has implemented an alcohol ban for all those on Scotland duty and believes that is enough. 'I haven't made rules,' said Strachan. Brown and Strachan pose together when the Scotland skipper signed for Celtic under the boss back in 2007 . 'The only one is the alcohol thing, which is for everybody, not just the players and that hasn't been broken in two and half years.

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of international fixtures and reflects on a selection of interesting rumours from the Football League. 1. Ashley Williams was on Arsenal’s radar for ages before signing a new four-year deal at Swansea last summer, but a move to the Emirates fell through supposedly because he wasn’t considered Champions League quality. The 30-year-old has made a nonsense of that verdict since with his performances for Wales. Brilliant in a defiant defensive display when they gained a 0-0 draw away to Group B favourites Belgium in November, the Welsh captain was again outstanding in the 3-0 win in Israel which put Chris Coleman’s side top of the group. While Gareth Bale grabbed the headlines, Williams was superb at the back. He gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes – and won it back both times. Ashley Williams (right, pictured with Gareth Bale) was in impressive form during Wales' win against Israel . 2. John Terry is clearly a far more decent bloke than the various unsavoury episodes of his past would suggest. At the age of 34 and with a back that needs constant treatment, Chelsea’s captain could have done with a weekend off after playing all but four of Chelsea’s 45 games so far this season. But he gave up his time to play 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard’s All Star charity game supporting various good causes in the Merseyside area. Terry was also first to agree to play when Stiliyan Petrov ran out a sell-out game in Glasgow 18 months ago to raise funds for Leukaemia research. John Terry, pictured with Mario Balotelli, played 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard's All Star charity match . 3. Nathaniel Clyne might have to rein in some of the attacking instincts that have worked so well for him at Southampton when he’s wearing an England shirt. The 23-year-old is beginning to look like a natural at right back for Roy Hodgson after winning his third cap in the 4-0 win over Lithuania. But Hodgson clearly asked Clyne to keep his position to let opposite full back Leighton Baines do most of the marauding forward. The Everton man played 53 passes in the forward half, nearly twice the number (28) that Clyne did. England ace Nathaniel Clyne may have to keep his position in order to let Leighton Baines maraud forward . 4. Portugal might have gone top of Group I with their 2-1 victory over Serbia but new boss Fernando Santos could do with finding some fresh talent for his squad. Seven of the side that started the game, including Cristiano Ronaldo, were already in their country’s senior squad for Euro 2008. Portugal have failed to significantly freshen up their international squad since Euro 2008 . 5. There must be something about the north London air because if Harry Kane can’t stop scoring goals, the same is true of Olivier Giroud. Arsenal’s centre forward, who has 11 goals from 13 starts for his club since the start of 2015, was on the scoresheet again for France as they beat Denmark 2-0 in a Sunday night friendly. Kane, certain to get his first full England start in Italy after his dramatic 79-second debut goal against Lithuania, has 14 from 14 starts for Spurs since New Year’s Day. Harry Kane and Olivier Giroud flew the flag for north London by scoring for England and France respectively . 6. Andrew Robertson’s return from injury could be a key in helping Hull battle away from the relegation zone in the last two months of the season. The 21-year-old left back, picked up from Dundee United last summer by Steve Bruce for a bargain £2.8million, showed he is back to full match fitness with a dazzling display for Scotland. He played 100 passes in all during the win over Gibraltar, with 93 of them reaching a team-mate – and 49 of them in the attacking half of the field. Hull full back Andrew Roberton impressed against Gibraltar following his return to full match fitness . 7. Notts County say they are going to name a new manager this week with 50-year-old Dutchman Ricardo Moniz, once on Tottenham’s coaching staff, the current bookies’ favourite to get the job. They might be better off forgetting that and sticking with the experienced figure of Paul Hart who stepped up from working with the Academy for a one-off day as caretaker boss against relegation rivals Scunthorpe. The 61-year-old made a dramatic difference, lifting County out of the relegation zone with a 2-2 draw – and only a late Niall Canavan goal stopped him taking all three points. Notts County look set to appoint former Tottenham coach Ricardo Moniz following Shaun Derry's exit . 8. Midfielder Daniel Johnson was the big star when Aston Villa’s youngsters reached the quarter-finals of the NextGen series in 2012, but despite sitting on the bench as an unused sub for a few times could never find a way to the first team when Paul Lambert was in charge. He finally gave up trying to earn a Premier League chance in January and signed for Preston. After scoring in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Fleetwood, he now has six goals in 12 games – and must wonder how he’d have fared if he’d hung on for the Tim Sherwood regime. Daniel Johnson, pictured scoring against Fleetwood, has been in impressive form since leaving Aston Villa . 9. Mark Yates was sacked by Cheltenham in November as punishment for failing to match his achievements of previous seasons when he twice took the tiny club to the League Two play-offs. That worked well. Replacement Paul Buckle has since come and gone too, and the club are now bottom of the table following a 3-0 home defeat by Plymouth. Caretaker Russell Milton is in charge until the summer – but has so far overseen just one win in eight matches. Cheltenham have struggled in League Two since deciding to sack former manager Mark Yates . 10. Signing a goalscorer is the key to success at any level as Grimsby have proven by shaking up the race for promotion from the Vanarama Conference. Paul Hurst’s team looked nowhere near the race until they brought in 6ft 5ins centre forward Ollie Palmer on a loan deal from Mansfield – and haven’t looked back. The 23-year-old got his sixth from nine games in a 2-0 win at Welling that lifted them above Bristol Rovers on goal difference and just a point behind leaders Barnet. Ollie Palmer has scored six goals in nine games since joining Grimsby Town on a loan deal from Mansfield .","Ashley Williams' proposed move to Arsenal fell through in the summer .

The Brazilian scored a stoppage-time free kick to equalise for Orlando City after their opponents New York City had taken a late lead against the run of play.

It was the least they deserved after the home team had dominated most of the game as the MLS’s two newest sides went toe-to-toe in this showpiece event. The city had been celebrating their new team all weekend ahead of the match; a festival atmosphere enveloping the place the day before and starting again with barbecues outside the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium well before the game. Football is a team game, but this was very much about one man: Kaka. Two teams were making their MLS debuts in front of a sold out 63,000-strong crowd, but the Brazilian, considered the greatest player on the planet in 2007, was playing the lead role. He did not let down his adoring fans. His mere presence on the pitch whipped the striking purple crowd into a frenzy, from the moment he led the side out ahead of kick off for the very first time, introducing city to their new team. It took only two minutes for him to make his mark. Just placing a ball for a free kick drew pandemonium around the Citrus Bowl, but he delivered a ball into the box which Seb Hines, on loan from Middlesbrough, headed inches wide of the left post. The home side dominated, and Kaka was the catalyst for everything. He nudged the ball with his thigh, 12 minutes in, travelling outside the area with its momentum and hitting a left-foot shot just wide.

Former Stoke player Brek Shea (top) who now plays for Orlando City is tackled during the game . An Orlando City fan cheers amid frenzied scenes . In the best chance of the half passes exchanged between Kaka, Lewis Neal and Kevin Molino and ended with the ball laying off for the main man to shoot first time, his powerful effort saved. His $7,167,500 salary is mammoth, but so is the responsibility on his shoulders to carry the team. He showed yet another example of what he will bring for that in the 23rd minute, picking the ball up 10 yards outside the area and turning quickly to change the direction of play to pass to Brek Shea free on the left, who shot narrowly over. Two minutes later, the crowd were raising from their seats, straining to get a better look, as he drove forward with the ball on the left, tried to get in between two defenders then eventually got a shot away. When Shea, formerly of Stoke, Barnsley and Birmingham, produced a 360 spin to beat an opponent, there was clearly a touch of Samba to his thinking. This was not to forget that former Barcelona forward David Villa, another of the league’s newest stars, was making his debut for New York City where he will be teaming up with Frank Lampard when the Manchester City midfielder joins in the summer. But while Kaka took to the league straight away, Villa had a frustrating evening. Orlando fans clad in purple get behind their team in Sunday's inaugural match .

He was involved, however, when New York City almost took a surprise lead on the break after 67 minutes.

He shot hard a low across goal but just wide. But they did go in front, in the 76th minute.

"Virgil van Dijk has hit back at Sean Dillon after the Dundee United skipper said he set out to injure him during the League Cup Final. Dillon required six minutes of treatment, and a number of stitches, after coming off second best in a 50-50 with the Dutchman. To compound his frustration, in his absence, Kris Commons scored the goal which put Ronny Deila’s side on their way to a 2-0 triumph. Dillon was later sent off for a lunge on Emilio Izaguirre but felt justice was not correctly served in his earlier confrontation with van Dijk. ‘I think he left his leg in, I didn’t like it,’ Dillon stated. ‘I get the ball, he gets my leg, and they get a throw-in. So that’s very frustrating. Sean Dillon claimed that Virgil van Dijk tried to injure him during the Scottish League Cup Final . ‘I’m not going to exaggerate it but it’s a big gash, about three inches long maybe, and I needed seven stitches in it.’ But van Dijk hit back at Dillon’s version of events by insisting there was nothing in the challenge. ‘No, never,’ van Dijk countered. ‘I know we are not going to have the same conversations as we had last week but I can honestly say I didn’t do anything wrong. ‘I didn’t leave my foot in, I would never do that on a fellow player.’ Van Dijk had been sent packing by Craig Thompson at Tannadice and only learned on Thursday that he was free to take his place at Hampden. He admitted the uncertainty surrounding the disciplinary case made the build-up to the game far from ideal. Van Dijk helped Celtic on their way to a 2-0 victory at Hampden Park . ‘It was a very good feeling to win the cup, especially after the tough week I had personally,’ said the Dutchman. ‘I was worried after the game last week. I was very stressed and really down. ‘I couldn’t believe I was sent off. I was disappointed with the red card and knew it was going to be a long week even though we said we were going to appeal straight away. ‘You want to know as soon as possible. ‘It was a strange week so I was just happy to be able to play. It would have been very hard to watch it from the stands. ‘This was my first final ever and it was special. We are on our way for the Treble and we want to make history. I wanted to play in the final very badly.’ ‘It gives the manager a boost - but it gives everyone at Celtic a boost. We knew if we were up for it we had a chance to win it. Hopefully we can go on and win the league and Scottish Cup. That’s what we aim to do. Dundee United skipper Dillon saw red later in the game for a foul on Emilio Izaguirre . ‘We know if we are at 100 per cent we can beat everyone in the country. I am very confident we will get the job done.’ Nir Bitton meantime spent the past week nursing fears over the prospect of personal League Cup Final heartbreak. After limping off during the stormy 1-1 Scottish Cup quarter final draw with Dundee United the previous Sunday, the Israeli admits he was slowly coming to terms with the fact he was going to miss the biggest game of his life. That would have been a cruel blow for Bitton, who admits to becoming hooked on Hampden during the 2-0 semi final win over Rangers last month. In the end, however, the prospect of a first cup win of his fledgling career proved the perfect pain relief for his aching ankle. ‘I’ll be honest with you, at the beginning of last week, I didn’t expect to be fit for the Final,’ Bitton said. ‘I trained for the first time on Saturday morning and I was a little bit afraid going into the game. If it was a league game, I may have given the injury a little bit more time to heal. ‘But I pushed it simply because it was a cup final. Nobody wants to miss a cup final in their life, especially after the atmosphere that I felt at Hampden in the semi final win over Rangers. ‘I’m just happy that I managed to get back and we managed to win. When it comes to a Cup Final, you know everything is about winning and you think of nothing else when you win. So I’m happy to have won and I’m happy to have the trophy.’","Sean Dillon claimed that Virgil van Dijk had set out to injure him .

"Celtic midfielder Kris Commons believes they can go from strength to strength after winning the first trophy of Ronny Deila's reign. Deila is on course to become only the third Celtic manager to win a domestic treble, after Jock Stein and Martin O'Neill, following his side's League Cup triumph on Sunday. That added a new medal to Commons' cabinet but the playmaker is not about to rest on his laurels ahead of the William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against Dundee United at Parkhead. Kris Commons put Celtic ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions . Commons is congratulated by his team-mates having put the Scottish Premiership leaders in front . Commons says his side will continue to grow under Ronny Deila after winning their first trophy . The 31-year-old appeared likely to leave the club in January as former Celtic manager Neil Lennon targeted him for a move to Bolton but the former Scotland international went on to sign a two-year contract before netting the opener against United at Hampden on Sunday. And he is fully embracing Deila's quest to improve his team and players. Commons said: 'I think we're a better team than last season. On paper we set really high standards with the clean sheet record, goals scored and points tally. I think this time last season the league was done and dusted. It's hard to say we are a better team but I feel like we are in a better place. 'We've not reached the top. It's not like we've conquered it and that's where we need to be, we will still be looking to make improvements and progress year-in, year-out. 'If we do win the treble we will be looking to do it again next year and the year after then add Champions League group stages and try to get last-16. Celtic boss Deila enters the dressing room with a smile on his face after winning the Scottish League Cup . Deila says he is finally beginning to enjoy life at Celtic after a slow start, now he has lifted his first trophy . 'You've got to keep striving for greatness. If you think you've reached the top and stand still that's when you start going backwards.' Commons, who admitted his own season had been a 'rollercoaster', added: 'When a new manager comes in, it's very difficult to make it seamless. He is a different nationality, we had a few new players and we weren't achieving the style of play he wanted. Changes take time and now we are seeing the benefits.' Commons' words were music to Deila's ears as the Norwegian continues to wipe out early impressions of him following Celtic's poor Champions League qualifying campaign. 'I think we have progressed a lot in the things I want to bring into the culture and how we want to work,' he said. 'I'm starting to really enjoy it. In the beginning it's enough to be there, you don't know where to start. Now it's settled, everybody knows their role and what's expected, and now we have to work better than we have done before. 'There is so much to go but that will never stop. But we have done a good job so far and we just have to keep working in the same way, and I think we will get even better results. The Celtic players celebrate on the podium with the Scottish League Cup after beating Dundee United 2-0 . 'When you are at a club like Celtic, the pressure is so unbelievably high so everybody in the club is always thinking about results. And that's the wrong way of thinking in my opinion, but it's very hard not to do it. 'So everything has been an environment that's all about results, then you don't get any creativity because you are so afraid to do something different. To get that culture of development, to get people to get into what to do every day and try to improve things, that has been the biggest challenge for me. 'Winning and developing, individually and as a team, I think we are getting that message across. People understand that we want to get the best out of them and the players are getting very interested in doing the things to improve themselves. Deila hopes to become the third Celtic manager to achieve a domestic treble after his first triumph . Goalscorers James Forrest and Commons pose with the Scottish League Cup final trophy in front of the fans . 'It's all about tempo. They are much lighter, as a team we have dropped 50 kilos in six months. That's a lot. Things are getting quicker and sharper in training. It's not only a physical thing, it's also a tactical thing that you have to work in the intensity you want to play, maybe higher.' Deila is not about to make major changes to freshen things up in the third of their four consecutive matches against United. 'If you are good at something you have to continue doing what you are good at, not start doing something else,' he said. 'We want to build on what we are good at and do that even better. I'm not into surprising opponents so much. I want them to fear us for what we are - they know what's coming and don't know how to handle it. That's our goal in the future.'","Kris Commons scored first goal in the League Cup final .

"Kris Commons says he wants Celtic’s arch-rivals Rangers in the Scottish Premiership as soon as possible — despite the Ibrox club suffering a lamentable 2-2 home draw with Alloa on Tuesday night. Championship leaders Hearts could clinch automatic promotion to the top tier if results go their way this weekend. That would leave Rangers embroiled in a grim battle for the second promotion spot under new manager Stuart McCall, although on current form they could even miss the play-offs. Celtic forward Kris Commons, pictured training on Tuesday, wants Rangers back in the top flight . However, in a view unlikely to curry unanimous favour amongst Celtic supporters, Commons — who scored in the recent League Cup semi-final between the Glasgow giants — admits he wants the Old Firm fixture back next season. ‘Personally, yes, because the games with Rangers are the best games,’ said the Parkhead forward. ‘They draw the best crowds and a large TV audience for people around the world. It makes people want to get out of bed in the middle of the night in Australia. ‘My mates down south don’t know much about Scottish football but they want to see that game. I love playing in them. ‘There are a lot of fans who are on the fence (about) whether it’s right or wrong but I love them.’ The new board still hope the return of Ibrox icon McCall can spark an improvement as they battle Hibernian for second place. The Ibrox side were hot favourites to finish top of the league at the beginning of the season, but Commons remains unsurprised to see them struggle. Rangers suffered a disappointing 2-2 draw against Alloa on Tuesday - their fifth in a row in the league . Ben Gordon (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after his goal gave the part-timers a shock lead . ‘I have played in the Championship in England with teams trying to get back up and it’s not easy,’ he continued. ‘Some teams go down from the Premier League and they end up in League one, like Blackpool, Sheffield United and Wednesday. ‘Not only does it affect the players, the manager, coaches and fans, it’s a city thing. It’s a massive thing. ‘It’s very difficult to have the wind knocked out of your sails. ‘When you are struggling — as Rangers are — that’s when you need to call on experience and that’s why they have tried to go with Stuart McCall.’ Commons scored the opener as Celtic secured the League Cup with a 2-0 win over Dundee United on Sunday. The Parkhead side can take a huge step towards their target of a rare domestic treble by beating the Tannadice side again in Wednesday night’s Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead. Celtic are bidding to win a domestic treble this season after claiming the Scottish League Cup last Sunday . Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill completed domestic clean sweeps when Rangers were strong, but Commons rubbishes any suggestion of a diminished achievement in the absence of their Glasgow rivals. ‘I think the last time it was done was in an era when money and wages were massive,’ he said. ‘You look at the teams — (Chris) Sutton, (Neil) Lennon, (John) Hartson and (Henrik) Larsson — people who were on fortunes and I think that they got a huge amount of credit for what they did. ‘If we can get across the line and achieve this Treble, I don’t think it should be looked upon as a lesser achievement. It’s the same level.’ Last season’s Player of the Year, meanwhile, plans to take any penalties against United after admitting the on-field spat between James Forrest and John Guidetti over a missed spot-kick on Sunday was regrettable. James Forrest (right) celebrates with John Guidetti after scoring in the League Cup final . ‘I don’t think that has ever happened before at Celtic,’ he said. ‘It’s the sort of thing you see on The Football Years on TV. It was like a (Paolo) di Canio-(Frank) Lampard moment. ‘I can understand from John’s point of view because he has taken a couple of penalties and scored. He has not been on the score sheet a lot of late. He’s a striker and he wants to get goals. ‘But they were not great scenes — probably just an eagerness to score and win. ‘It perhaps put a little dampener on the way that we won. The manager bases a lot on team spirit and team bonding. ‘We are meant to have this good unit as a team but, clearly at the end of the game, it looked as though people were doing things on an individual basis. ‘I don’t think any player should throw a strop on a football field. You should never do that.’","Kris Commons wants Rangers to get promoted to the Scottish Premiership .

"These candid photos reveal what life is like in a poverty-stricken village in Cuba – and how much the Caribbean island’s rural communities could benefit from an influx of American tourists. Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities once the US fully lifts its ban on trade and travel. It’s in villages such as Gabriel where visitors can experience a side of the Caribbean island that few holidaymakers bother to see. Scroll down for video . People linger outside a residence, where meat is sold at a roadside stand, in the rural village of Gabriel, Cuba . Cuba's rural communities, where there are few jobs, could benefit the most from thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments . Like in Havana, posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere in the village of Gabriel . A salesman waits for customers at his roadside stand, where customers can buy fresh vegetables and fruit from a local farm . In Gabriel, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor, and – just like in the capital of Havana – posters or paintings of revolutionary hero Che Guevara are visible everywhere. While life goes on as normal in 'the real Cuba', talks continue to take place between US and Cuban officials to restore full diplomatic relations and move towards opening trade. The old Cold War foes are claiming progress after a second round of discussions to end a half-century diplomatic freeze. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain, including Cuba’s place on the US state sponsor of terrorism blacklist. Thawing relations between the US and Cuban governments could open isolated communities to new economic opportunities . It is likely that with economic sanctions lifted, Cuba will change forever, and there are fears it will lose some of its unique identity . In Gabriel, Cuba, there are very few cars, workers harvest tomatoes by hand, and goods are transported by horse and buggy or tractor . The US is planning to ease travel and trade restrictions with Cuba, a former Cold War foe, after agreeing to restore ties severed since 1961 . While most US tourists will likely stick to Havana or all-inclusive resorts on the sea once the ban on travel is lifted, rural villages who do welcome foreigners are not prepared to handle them in large numbers. Many lack running water, suitable accommodation and modern facilities, including toilets. With Cuba poised to open itself up to a massive market for holidaymakers, tourists from outside the US are being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now, before the Caribbean country becomes 'Americanised'. Rural villages are not prepared to handle foreign tourists in large numbers, as there are very few modern facilities . With many issues unresolved, the US is hoping to reach agreement on reopening embassies in time for a regional summit in Panama in April . Some travel experts are encouraging tourists to visit Cuba sooner rather than later if they want to see unadulterated local culture . In rural Cuba, villagers make a living by selling vegetables, fruit and meat from local farms . The number of tourists visiting Havana has seen a steady increase following the normalisation of Cuba-US relations last year . While the landmark thaw in relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go before it changes forever. TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson recently told MailOnline Travel: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in. 'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida. Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro have promised to restore embassies in each other’s capitals, although a few hurdles remain . One of the biggest hurdles is Cuba's place on a US list of state sponsors of terrorism, from which Cuba is pushing to be removed . Tourists on a double-decker bus take in the sights, including a local football match, during a tour of Havana, Cuba's capital . If the US lifts its restrictions on travel and trade, one of the biggest draws for American tourists could be Major League Baseball games . 'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place. If restrictions are lifted and Cuba becomes a popular destination for US tourists once again, one of the biggest draws could be the countries’ shared love of baseball. Major League Baseball is considering playing spring exhibition games on the baseball-mad island nation, where American teams played before Fidel Castro came to power. Major league teams regularly held spring training camps in Cuba in the 1940s and ‘50s, and there have been discussions to bring them back to the country once the governments officially end the diplomatic freeze.","In village of Gabriel, farmers sell produce and meat at roadside stands, and there are very few cars .

"Asking a young child to talk about Nelson Mandela and the concept of human rights, equality or the right to individual self-realisation is quite a leap from asking them about their favourite food. But that's exactly what Amnesty International has done, in a heart-warming video called Human Rights Heroes Of The Future, which poses such questions to children ranging in age from five to nine. One girl is asked: What did Nelson Mandela do? She says: 'He stood up for what he believed - that white people shouldn't just have all the fun and black people should have fun as well.' Another is asked: Who was Nelson Mandela? She replies: 'Nelson Mandela was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should. 'But then he was put into jail because of what he said - and then he finally went out because people were protesting for him to come out. And then there was a song Free Nelson Mandela - and everything kind of became how he wanted it to be.' Meanwhile, an equally challenging poser is put to a 'short five-year-old' boy: What does equality look like? His sweet response? 'If there was one man over here like he was five years old, and one man over here like he was five years old too, they would all be the same size.' 'Nelson Mandela was a man who thought that black people should just have the amount of right just as the white people should.' This was the reply to one of a series of human rights questions put by Amnesty International to children aged five to nine . 'Fear - the more you worry about it, the bigger it gets... and the more you think positively, the more fear would be, like friendly - you wouldn't worry about anything, and have a great time basically' 'If there was one man over here like he was five years old, and one man over here like he was five years old too, they would all be the same size' Other questions put to the youngsters included topics that might faze some grown-ups. For example: At a time of daunting global events, many people are afraid. What would you advise? A boy, aged about nine's reply? 'Fear - the more you worry about it, the bigger it gets... and the more you think positively, the more fear would be, like friendly - you wouldn't worry about anything, and have a great time basically.' The video was released by the human rights organisation to coincide with the publication of its new book Dreams Of Freedom on World Book Day. The book combines the words of human rights heroes such as Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Anne Frank, Chief Standing Bear, Malala and Aung San Suu Kyi with beautiful illustrations from international artists including Oliver Jeffers and Chris Riddell. In a time when children across the world are traumatised, frightened and confused by news events, the aim of the book is to empower them to explore hard-won rights and understand how precious they are. 'The world wouldn't be the same... the world would be terrible - and it would be quite boring' 'Being unique without anybody stopping you being unique' The video was released by the human rights organisation to coincide with the publication of its new book Dreams Of Freedom on World Book Day . Author and former Children’s Laureate Michael Morpurgo wrote in the foreword to the book: 'Dreams Of Freedom is a feast of visual stories – brave words and beautiful pictures, woven together to inspire young readers to stand up for others and to make a difference. 'It gives me great hope for the freedom of future generations. 'I have grown up, not in a perfect country by any means, but in a society where, by and large, we can say what we like, write what we like, be who we want to be, so long as we do not threaten the liberty of others and so long as we respect their rights. 'What we can forget, if we are not careful, is that it was not always like this. These rights have been fought for, died for, argued over, for centuries. 'Indeed the struggle to protect and defend our freedom goes on, both in our own country and in the world beyond.' Kate Allen, Amnesty’s UK Director, said: 'In a time when many children can't help seeing news about threats from terrorism and other atrocities, this book celebrates heroism and shows how important it is for all of us to stand up and make a difference. 'Every child should be given the strength to stand up for themselves and each other. 'There is no better book to inspire and empower young readers, to give them courage and confidence for the future.'

"It was on December 21 – the day Liverpool began their unbeaten run – that a bloke dressed as Jesus Christ held a sign at Anfield that read: 'Brendan, I've got your back!' Yet divine intervention has nothing to do with it. It is Brendan Rodgers that has resurrected Liverpool by throwing out the old system and implementing the new.

Mike Mullarkey, the linesman, failed to recognise Juan Mata was more than a yard offside when he made it two. A defensive error by Dejan Lovren created the third. Liverpool were torn apart by preventable goals. The visitors got into scoring positions more frequently, having 19 shots to Manchester United's 11, but lacked a cutting edge.

Liverpool played 4-2-3-1 against Basle on Dec 9 (left) with right-back Glen Johnson (No 2) drifting inside and Raheem Sterling (No 31) up front... but they switched to 3-4-3 against Manchester United on Dec 14 (right) Sterling sees his shot saved by Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea at Old Trafford on December 14 . It took just 25 seconds for United to go up the other end for Wayne Rooney to score the opener (pictured) United's Juan Mata was offside by more than a yard but the goal counted as the linesman failed to notice . Mata runs away in celebration while Brad Jones, having replaced Simon Mignolet, looks towards the linesman . Liverpool's average positions in their latest win against Burnley shows they still play 3-4-3 . Even though Liverpool were hit for three by Manchester United, they persisted with 3-4-3 in the next game against Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup quarter-final, and have done since. It's helped them get 29 points since Christmas, while Merseyside rivals Everton have just 28 in total for the season. Just look at their 2-0 win against Burnley on Wednesday, for example (shown right). Emre Can (No 23) dropped into the back three. Alberto Moreno (No 18), a left-back with a winger's soul, was pushed forward. Joe Allen (No 24) and Jordan Henderson (No 14) owned central midfield in tandem, and the three-pronged attack featuring Sterling (No 31), Daniel Sturridge (No 15) and the indispensable Philippe Coutinho (No 10) worked. They're fast, they swarm, they press, they move. It's not rocket science, yet it leaves teams bewildered. Fit-again Sturridge started on Wednesday rather than Sterling being used in the middle, as he had been against Manchester City and Southampton. Easing Sturridge back in, as is only natural after an injury that cost five months. Possession too, it seems, is no longer nine-tenths of the law. Manchester City had 51 per cent against Liverpool at Anfield, yet lost 2-1. Southampton had 60 per cent, and lost 2-0. As was the case with Tottenham Hotspur, Swansea City, and so on. Steven Gerrard pictured doing keepie uppies during Liverpool's training session at Melwood on Friday . Gerrard runs with the ball as he looks to help his team continue their fine form following his injury . Liverpool have claimed 29 points since Christmas, while rivals Everton have 28 in total for the season . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers made the switch from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3 on December 14 and it's worked . 'We have restructured the team and organised the team in a different way,' Rodgers said last month, 'to get that solidity back and get the balance back both offensively and defensively.' It sounded like one of those generic responses that roll off managers' tongues, but there was more to this. Even at the back. Simon Mignolet was dropped for goalkeeper Brad Jones against Manchester United, but returned to the first team on Boxing Day. Since then, Liverpool have conceded the least (6) in the Premier League and have the best goal difference (+15). No surprise, then, that a table since December 26 puts them top (29 points) ahead of Arsenal (27) and, remarkably, Stoke City (23). Mignolet makes a save during Liverpool's comfortable 2-0 win over Burnley at Anfield on Wednesday night . Mignolet was dropped for Jones against United in December, but returned to the first team on Boxing Day . Yet should we expect anything less? Rodgers has a knack for upping the ante, after all. In 2012-13, Liverpool averaged 1.47 points per game between August and December, rising to 2.5 between January and May. In 2013-14, they went from 1.89 to 2.53. And this year, they have gone from 1.47 to 2.56. Only Wolfsburg (2.67) better that out of every club in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1, yet Liverpool have played three more games. And if they maintain their 2.56 average, Liverpool would end up with 77 points – enough for them to qualify for the Champions League in nine out of the past 10 years. Daniel Sturridge  scores against Burnley at Anfield on Wednesday night as he gets back to full fitness . The return of Sturridge following a combination of thigh and calf problems helps but he has been eased in . Sturridge started against Burnley but began on the bench against Manchester City and Southampton . The return of Sturridge following a combination of thigh and calf problems helps. Without him, they average 1.3 goals per game, 1.5 points and their win percentage is a measly 42.1. With him, it rises to 1.9 goals, 2.4 points and 77.8 per cent. Who needs Luis Suarez? Or Steven Gerrard, for that matter. Jordan Henderson has captained Liverpool eight times in the Premier League since November 29, winning seven and drawing one. They have scored 15 goals and conceded just twice when the hard-working deputy wears the armband. No other captain in the Premier League has a better win percentage than him (88). A natural, it would seem. Even Lucas Leiva, when not injured, provides cover for the back three as a defensive midfielder. Rodgers has a man for every occasion, and it's clicking at the right time. Gerrard led Liverpool to Champions League glory against AC Milan in 2005 but is leaving for the MLS soon . Jordan Henderson has been in inspired form for Liverpool and struck sensational goals in his last two games . Henderson has led the team in Gerrard's absence as Liverpool have made a charge for the top four . If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Their luck with 3-4-3 – arguably 3-4-2-1 on occasion – may well run out, because imperfections will always be there. The price of failing to qualify for the Champions League? Some £31.3million, give or take – not including the prize money – and the unwanted consolation of Europa League football. Trouble is, their new system is no secret. Others will try to copy or stump them, and Rodgers must anticipate it. In 210 minutes against Chelsea in two Capital One Cup semi-final legs, after all, Liverpool scored just once and were eliminated. It's so far, so good. All this will matter little if they don't beat Manchester United on March 22, or Arsenal on April 4, or do better against Chelsea on May 9. Ripping up the blueprint in mid-December was a start. Time for the finish.","Liverpool remain unbeaten in the Premier League since 3-0 loss at Old Trafford .

"At my current vintage, 62, my mother was content to spend her days playing golf, perhaps a rubber of bridge, popping in on the grandchildren, then spending the evening watching TV. In the past seven days, by contrast, I’ve attended a leaving party for friends in their late 50s who are starting a new life in the country; given a presentation on Post-War Art And The Politics Of Memory to fellow undergraduates on my part-time degree course; drooled over Ralph Fiennes in his latest theatre production; and hosted supper for some girlfriends — finding time, in between, to buy a pair of skinny jeans and get my roots tinted. Like most women of my age, I’m occasionally exhausted, but in the main, engaged, active and having as much (if not more) fun than ever. Linda Kelsey says aged 62 she is occasionally exhausted but is very active and having more fun than ever . So, I can’t understand why Mariella Frostrup — a woman who is smart, successful, has the voice of a vamp and looks that make men of most ages go weak at the knees — has declared herself, at a mere 52, the poster girl for the fed up 50-something brigade. Despite the evidence to the contrary, Frostrup thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation. ‘Politicians don’t talk to us,’ she moans. ‘Advertisers ignore us. We aren’t sold music or movies, fashion or cosmetics, aside from “miracle” creams promising to reduce wrinkles so we dare show our unsightly faces in public.’ It simply isn’t so, Mariella. Julianne Moore, 54, has won an Oscar, Julie Walters, 65, has stolen the limelight from the young, good-looking cast of Channel 4’s Indian Summers and 50 Shades Of Grey, based on the books of E. L. James, 51, has become the highest grossing 18-plus film ever. Monica Bellucci, 50, is smouldering away as the latest Bond girl, 65-year-old Twiggy is fronting a magazine cover and new beauty campaign, and Theresa May, 58, is said to be in the running as a potential next leader of the Tory party. All this as The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, full of fabulous oldies, promises to outdo the success of the first on the (truly) silver screen. Mariella Frostrup, 52 (pictured), thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation . Having conflated her existential angst at turning 50 with what she perceives is going on in society at large, Mariella seems to have missed the blindingly obvious fact that older women have never been so visible — or so courted. Not just by politicians, who know the grey vote is the most likely to turn out at the ballot box. But now we’re worth more than a bob or two (over-50s represent 76 per cent of the nation’s wealth), by retailers and advertisers who realise we’re worth wooing because of, and despite, our wrinkles. That makes me grateful, not grumpy. Compared with our mothers’ generation, there’s been a seismic shift in attitudes. Even if there’s still a way to go we should be recognising that whole new windows of opportunity have opened up. Julianne Moore, 54 (pictured), won the Best Actress accolade at this year's Oscars . Like Mariella, I remember that turning 50 can feel like the beginning of the end. Yet when I saw older friends were getting on with their lives with added relish, I was determined to enter my new half-century with cocktails and laughter. To paraphrase Noel Coward: to hell with what comes after. I hired a marquee and invited 100 family and friends to eat, drink and dance the night away. The party broke up at 3am when the police shut us down because the music was annoying neighbours three streets away. Of course, there are real physical and psychological reasons why hitting the big Five-0 may be a wobbly moment in a woman’s life. Julie Walters, 65 (pictured), has stolen the limelight from the rest of the cast of Channel 4’s Indian Summers . While the menopause can be liberating, it carries a sense of loss of possibilities as well; at least it did for me. Not to mention it saw me stop sleeping and take up sweating and flushing bright red for three years. But while former generations had to suffer in silence, with HRT and alternative remedies and therapies, we can at least alleviate some of the symptoms. My 50s weren’t without their fair share of turbulence. At 55, my 23-year relationship came to an end after my husband announced he needed a gap year and never came back. My darling dad died that same year. My only son left the nest shortly after and I had emergency surgery for a blockage in my intestines that nearly killed me. But determined not to be defeated, I set myself a bucket list, including writing a novel (I published three) and learning to sing (sadly, my voice is as awful as ever). I started walking an hour a day, and went back to university to study art and literature, one of the most stimulating and satisfying things I’ve ever done. Monica Bellucci, 50 (pictured), is the latest Bond girl and will star in the new 007 film, Spectre . And after my marriage breakdown, I was overawed to find out love can flower at any age and sex can be better than ever. I was 56 when I met my partner, Ronny, a year after my husband walked out. All these things I did or discovered because, as a woman in my 50s, I still could. How different it was for my mother’s generation, who seemed to accept that slowing down was inevitable in their 50s. ‘You do too much, you need to rest,’ is my 87-year-old mother’s mantra. In some ways, we women in our 50s and beyond aren’t just luckier than our mothers, we’re also luckier than the men of our own generation. As we go downhill physically, we have an arsenal of hair dye, skincare and make-up at our disposal, and can even have work done if we’re all that bothered. As for fashion, I don’t resent the fact that I can’t suit all the latest trends. These days I stick to tried-and-tested shapes and styles that work for me — there are plenty of retailers supplying them. There’s still so much I plan to do. There’s another novel to write. A Masters degree once I’ve collected my BA later this year. 65-year-old Twiggy (pictured) is fronting a magazine cover and new beauty campaign . If some of the ads aimed my way are the Saga cruises Mariella objects to, that also doesn’t bother me — my partner and I have planned our American road trip this summer with the help of the internet rather than a package tour. M y friends aren’t being put out to pasture, either. One of my closest, who’s just turned 65, was devastated when her husband left three years ago after 40 years. But after dabbling with internet dating she met a lovely new beau. Mariella’s portrayal of older women feels outmoded and overplayed — not to mention the route to becoming self-obsessed and feeling terminally sorry for ourselves. Getting old is impossible to imagine when you’re young. But then getting old is not what it used to be. The truth is we older women have never had it so good and the opportunities to turn this stage of the game into the time of our lives have never been more abundant. We should all be celebrating, not complaining.","Mariella Frostrup, 52, thinks women over 50 are hard done by .

"ISIS have tried to justify the beheading of eight alleged informers as 'revenge' for military operations targeting the Islamists in Syria and Iraq in the militants' latest gruesome  video. The video contrasts the murders of the eight men, all blindfolded dressed in red jumpsuits, cut with footage of people who apparently have been killed or badly injured in coalition attacks on ISIS-held locations. The men are accused of being informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Militants claim the eight men were informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS . The slickly edited video - which appears to take inspiration from violent video games, complete with sickening 'player profiles' of each of the doomed men - is thought to have been shot in the Euprhates, which covers Syria and Iraq. The men, who are both Iraqi and Syrian, are led by their murderers out of a van onto a derelict piece of land, where they are forced to kneel in a row. The captors, armed with what look like meat cleavers, stand behind their victims. Behind them, the buildings appear to have been reduced to rubble. Interspersed with the footage of the prisoners is footage of a dead child under the rubble and in a body bag, and a dead man at the hospital, who appears to have been shot. The makers of the video seem to want to point the finger of blame for their latest horrendous actions at the coalition forces' campaign against ISIS. Revenge: The militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold . To make that clear, the video begins with a mock-up of a coalition airstrike, complete with a fake jet seemingly piloted by someone with an American accent. ‘By God we will get our revenge,’ the video states. This new video has been released just days after another ISIS production, which claimed to show a young boy executing an alleged Israeli-Arab spy. At about the same time, militants fighting for the Islamic State have released a video claiming to show the execution of two Libyan soldiers. The militants have turned to brutal videos like these as a form of propaganda, apparently simultaneously hoping to attract new fighters and spread fear among those working against ISIS.","Video shows murders of eight men allegedly working against Islamic State .

"Some people say being addicted to sex isn't a real addiction. Indeed, many may welcome the constant craving by a partner with plenty of stamina. But one woman has revealed the toll her continuous urge to copulate has taken on her life and says managing her condition is a constant juggling act. Scroll down for video . One woman has anonymously confessed that she is addicted to sex and that managing her condition is a constant juggling act . In an anonymous confession to Australia's Gold Coast Bulletin the woman reveals: 'I once had sex with two guys in one night before going to meet up with the guy I was supposed to be seeing at the time. 'This all got a little messy when at one stage I was seeing three men by the same name, in the same week.' Sex addiction is described by the relationship counselling service Relate as any sexual activity that feels out of control. Yet some scientists argue there's no such thing as a clinical addiction to sex and 'sufferers' are simply making excuses for their lack of self-restraint. Russell Brand (left) has admitted to getting treatment for sex addiction and Ulrika Jonsson (right) presented a 2007 Channel 4 show called Am I A Sex Addict? in which she questioned her own romantic behaviour . The woman confesses: 'I'd meet up with men just to have sex. They wouldn't even have to take me to dinner first. You don't want to get too full before a bedroom romp, after all.' Celebrities linked to the controversial condition include Russell Brand, Michael Douglas and Tiger Woods, who are all reported to have sought professional treatment. 'It's not so bad when you're in a monogamous relationship because you always have someone to get your fix with,' the woman writes. 'You don't have to worry about catching anything because of your addiction.' She comments that if she had the time she'd sneak off to the bathrooms to alleviate her urges and says there are little 'key-ring vibrators' that can be used in an emergency. She also mentions the guilt and shame she feels and how men are meant to be the ones obsessed with sex rather than women. Michael Douglas was widely reported to have a sex addiction when he was admitted to rehab in 1990. The Hollywood actor finally admitted the claims in his 2012 biography. American actor David Duchovny admitted to having a sex addiction and checked into rehab for treatment in August 2008. Tiger Woods reportedly checked into a clinic for sex addiction treatment following the breakdown of his marriage in 2009. In his memoir My Booky Wook Russell Brand admitted to suffering from an addiction to heroin and sex, and booked into rehab to treat his addiction to ‘carnal overindulgences’. In her 2007 confessional documentary for Channel 4 entitled Am I A Sex Addict? Ulrika Jonsson questioned her own sexual behaviour and what makes a sex addict.","Anonymous writer reveals the difficulties of living with sex addiction .

"Jorge Pereira won the open savoury amateur prize with his empanada Chilena, a traditional Chilean pasty made with beef, onion, hard-boiled egg, olives and sultanas . A Chilean miner stole the show at the World Pasty Championships by beating his Cornish competition. Jorge Pereira won the open savoury amateur prize with his empanada Chilena, a traditional Chilean pasty made with beef, onion, hard-boiled egg, olives and sultanas. Mr Pereira decided to take part in the contest while on a two-month visit to the UK to see his wife's family. Wife Gail, who spoke on the non-English-speaking cook's behalf, said: 'Jorge feels very excited and happy to be so far from my country to win such a prize. 'It's all about getting recognition for his country rather than winning.' There were also pasty makers from the US and Canada at the championships, held on Saturday at the Eden Project in Bodelva, Cornwall, to celebrate the British delicacy.

"An extremely rare £1 coin dating back to the start of English Civil War is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction. The solid silver 1643 Declaration Pound was struck in Oxford, which was Charles I's seat of power after he withdrew from London. Charles was beheaded just six years after the coin was created, but an inscription on the back declares the King's belief that he could not be toppled. An extremely rare £1 coin from the start of English Civil War is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction . The coin was made as the a new mint was set up in the city and was created to launch an official currency for parts of the country under the King's command. The legend on the back of the coin translates as 'Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered', symbolising the King's belief in the 'absolute monarch'. The words were a declaration of the King's power, but this belief in an almighty monarchy caused some of the tensions which led to the Civil War between the Royalist Cavaliers and the Parliamentarian Roundheads. The  large coin, which is more two inches across and remains in good condition, was passed down through one family for generations but the current owner did not realise its value. Timothy Medhurst, a coin specialist and auctioneer at Duke's Auctioneers in Dorchester, Dorset, where the coin will be sold, said it was the type of item he dreams of finding. 'This coin marked Charles I's attempts to regain his failing power and it represents a pivotal moment in the history of the British Isles,' he said. Charles I was beheaded just six years after the coin was created, but an inscription on the back declares the King's belief that he could not be toppled . 'It is a coin which is rare to find and it will cause a stir in the coin collecting world. 'The value of coins from this period are at an all-time high, and it will be highly sought after. 'The coin has been handed down through several generations to the current owner, who had no idea of its value and is as excited about the auction as I am. 'It is fair to say that 1643 was a crucial year in the history of the Civil War and it is fascinating to think that this coin was produced by hand, in silver, at such a tumultuous time. 'It was only six years after this coin was struck that Charles I was beheaded and labelled as ""tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy"" by the 59 judges who found him guilty of high treason.' The English Civil War (1642-1651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between the Roundheads and Cavaliers in the Kingdom of England. It led to Charles I being beheaded and his son being exiled in 1649 as the monarchy was replaced by a protectorate, led by Oliver Cromwell. After Cromwell's death, his son Richard was unable to maintain the confidence of the New Model Army, causing the protectorate to fall and the monarchy to be restored with Charles II on the throne in 1660. The sale takes place on March 12.","Rare English Civil War era coin could fetch up to £50,000 at auction .

"A motorist escaped his exploding car unhurt despite bravely emptying his boot of butane gas canisters to avert an even worse catastrophe. Instead of running for cover, Tomasz Morawski, 34, leapt from his burning vehicle, opened his boot and carried the explosive canisters to safety at the side of the road. With help from a passing motorist, he guaranteed the safety of other drivers who recklessly continued to pass his burning car, and that of firefighters who arrived to extinguish the flames. Spontaneous combustion: Tomasz Morawski, 34, leaps from his car after its engine burst into flames when he stopped at a red light on his way to work in the city of Gliwice, southern Poland . Bravery: As other motorists try to get their vehicles out of the way, Mr Morawski and another motorist empty his boot of butane and propane gas canisters to avert a possibly disastrous explosion . Busy: The video was shot from a CCTV camera during the morning rush hour in Gliwice . 'I'm just glad I was able to get the gas canisters out in time otherwise this could have been a lot, lot worse,' Mr Morawski said. CCTV footage shows Mr Morawski's vehicle quickly engulfed in flames after he stopped at a red light on the way to work in Gliwice, southern Poland. As the fire quickly spreads, he jumps out of the driver side door, pops open the boot and begins emptying it of propane and butane gas canisters. Fellow motorist Michal Bukowski, 29, was quoted by Central European News as saying: 'I was going in the opposite direction and was waiting for the lights to change when I saw the car suddenly go up in flames with a massive whoosh. 'It was like it had been hit with a rocket. 'The driver got out and I saw him running back and forth across the road taking canisters to the pavement. 'I quickly dialled the fire brigade and then pulled over to help.' As black billowing smoke filled the sky the two men unloaded the car as a fire engine pulled up.

"Many people exercise to music and the majority of these have some form of fitness tracker or app. Now joggers and cyclists can combine the two - with headphones that play music without the need for a phone and track your steps and sleep. The TalkBand N1 also doubles up as a stereo Bluetooth headset so if you choose to pair it with a phone, you can receive and make calls too. Scroll down for video . They know when you're awake: Huawei's new TalkBand N1 headphones track every movement of their users, including how many calories they have burned, all while having storage space for 1,000 songs . Chinese tech giant Huawei announced the headphones alongside its next-generation fitness tracker - the TalkBand B2 - at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The N1 looks like a standard pair of headphones but has a Bluetooth chip, accelerometer and 4GB of storage inside - the equivalent to 1,000 songs. By being Bluetooth-enabled, the headphones sync with the TalkBand app for both Android and iOS devices meaning they can be used to make calls - using a built-in microphone - or stream songs from a phone. This includes apps such as Spotify. Huawei told MailOnline the headphones will go on sale by the end of September this year and although official prices haven't been announced, the earbuds are expected to retail for around £100. The TalkBand app will add support for the headphones through a software update nearer the time of release. Elsewhere, the headphones are IP54-rated waterproof, will work for three days and can be charged via microUSB. The N1 will last for 12 days on standby, or for five hours for continuous calls.

"A New York City truck driver is accused of using a fancy bumper-retracting gadget to help him avoid paying the toll on the George Washington Bridge. Authorities say Pablo Ortega was seen activating a device to make his 'bumper lift to a 90-degree angle' so his license plate would be 'unreadable to the EZ-Pass reader' by an officer from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police who was positioned at a toll booth earlier this week. Ortega, 45, was charged with tampering with public records and possession of burglary tools. Scroll down for video . Pablo Ortega, 45, was charged with tampering with public records and possession of burglary tools . Authorities believe that Ortega was trying to avoid paying a $95 toll for crossing the George Washington Bridge . Police say he used a device to lift his truck's bumper at a 90 degeree angle to avoid an EZ-Pass reader . The officer observed Ortega flipping a switch on the dashboard of his red 1997 Peterbilt tractor-trailer as he entered the bridge from Fort Lee, New Jersey. The suspect had a load of candy he was hauling across the Hudson River. It normally costs $95 for an 18-wheel truck to cross the Hudson into upper Manhattan. The rear license plate of the truck was covered with grease and unreadable, the New York Post reported. Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said: 'This is more sophisticated than most of the contraptions we've seen in the past.' The device, which can be used legally to protect bumpers from getting scraped, cost Ortega about $2,500. It is not known how many times Ortega used the device. The device on Ortega's red 1997 Peterbilt tractor-trailer was operated by a switch on the vehicle's dashboard�� .","Pablo Ortega is charged with possession of burglary tools and tampering .

"It is one of the world's best loved musicals - the true story of a novice nun who falls in love with a widower and his seven children. From Julie Andrews waltzing through the Alps to seven children behaving perfectly,  The Sound of Music might look like it portrays the family everyone wants. But Andrews' real life counterpart - Maria Kutschera - was far from the idealized mother the popular film portrays. In fact she was a difficult Austrian woman plagued by insecurities. Scroll down for video . Maria Kutschera (centre) was far from the idealized mother The Sound of Music portrays, her son has revealed in a new book . Whereas Julie Andrews (above) waltzed carelessly through the Alps in the 1965 film, Maria was described by her son Johannes as 'incredibly strong' with 'literally an indomitable will' Her son Johannes has now revealed all in a new book written by Tom Santopietro. He said: 'She was  incredibly strong with a formidable will, literally an indomitable will. 'And sometimes running into that will was not so pleasant.' The 75-year-old added that his mother was very complex and admitted that she was unhappy as a child. Maria was born in 1905 while travelling from her parents' village in Tyrol to a hospital in Vienna, Austria, on a train. By the time she was ten both of her parents had died and she was sent to live with a violent uncle. Maria escaped from him and in 1926 she was a schoolteacher at the Nonnberg Abbey, in Salzburg, intending to become a nun. But while there she was asked to take a job as a governess at the home of a widowed man, who was left with seven children after his first wife Agatha died of scarlet fever. That man was Georg von Trapp. They would quickly become married and have three more children. Georg von Trapp was previously the commander of Austrian submarine U5. He is pictured with his fiancée Agathe Whitehead . The Von Trapp family are pictured in 1939. Top row: Werner and Rupert; Second row: Dr. Franz Wasner, Johanna, Martina, Maria and Georg, Johannes, Hedwig, Maria; Bottom: Agathe, Rosmarie and Eleonore . The family, including Andrews (centre), perform a song in the film. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children who does not feature in the film, said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that' It was not long before Maria founded a family choir. Although the children sang together before she joined them, they remember her particularly pushing  public performances - especially after Georg lost his fortune. Rosmarie, one of Maria and Georg's children, often found her mother particularly difficult. She said it got worse after her father died in 1947. 'I was not happy on stage. I was made to do it,' Boudicca Fox-Leonard of the Sunday People reported her saying. The now 87-year-old said: 'We never went running in a field and singing songs like that. We had a hard life. It was a struggle.' In real life, after fleeing the country in 1938 the von Trapp's came to rely on their musical performances for money . She also recounts Maria sending her for shock therapy after she had a breakdown and said she locked step-daughter Johanna in a room for announcing she was getting married. After fleeing the country  in 1938, the family - known as the Trapp Family Singers in the US - came to rely on the performances for money. The popular film was made after Broadway found a book  detailing the family's adventurers. Maria later sold the rights  to Hollywood for £3,000. But director Robert Wise rebuffed her attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her.' Even director Robert Wise rebuffed Maria's attempts to act as an adviser. He admitted in an interview: 'She was bossy, I didn't like that about her' Only three children, none of which feature in the film, survive. The last surviving von Trapp singer died in early 2014. Four of the couple's great-grandchildren are still attempting to keep the tradition alive. Sofi, Melanie, Amanda, and their younger brother August have revived the family's musical heritage and are singing together. They can remember little of their great-grandmother. Sofi said: 'We know she was a little impulsive, but without her the family would never have survived as a single group. 'The Captain would have been taken off to war if it wasn't for the singing.' The Sound of Music Story, by Tom Santopietro, is out now.","Maria von Trapp was criticised by son Johannes in a new book .

"Ikea is to launch a range of desks, tables and lamps that will wirelessly charge mobile phones. The Swedish furniture giant revealed today that the new collection will use Qi wireless technology to power-up compatible devices that are placed on or near the furniture. The Home Spot range of desks, bedside tables and lamps will hit stores in Europe and North America next month - with an international roll-out set to follow. Latest range: Swedish furniture giant Ikea said the new collection would use Qi wireless technology to charge devices that are placed on or near the furniture . Recipe: The Home Spot range of desks, bedside tables and lamps will hit stores in Europe and North America next month - with an international roll-out set to follow . Jeanette Skjelmose, Ikea’s lighting and wireless charging business area manager, said: ‘Through research and home visits, we know that people hate cable mess. ‘They worry about not finding the charger and running out of power. Our new innovative solutions, which integrate wireless charging into home furnishings, will make life at home simpler.’ Qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type, and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally. There are now more than 80 Qi-enabled smartphones available. Among these are models of the Nokia Lumia, Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus and Sharp Aquos. In the spotlight: Qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type, and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally . Starting out: One technology industry analyst said it was a 'very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology' Menno Treffers, chairman of the Wireless Power Consortium - which developed Qi - said the new collection shows customers 'the beauty and simplicity of wireless charging'. The most common type of wireless charging is known as inductive charging, which works on a well-known but rarely-used principle most often seen in electric toothbrushes. It was discovered by British scientist Michael Faraday in 1831. Mobile phones are using a more advanced version of the technology, which can operate over centimetres, rather than millimetres. The docking station has a coil within the charger, which generates an electrical field around the device. When a suitable mobile phone is placed next to or on top of the station, a coil within the battery resonates with the primary field. It then takes power from the magnetic field and converts and stores it back as electrical energy. He added: ‘We applaud Ikea for its unmatched insight and their unique passion for making wireless charging affordable and simple for consumers.’ Two months ago Ikea - which employs 147,000 people worldwide - reported annual profits of €3.3billion (£2.4billion) for 2014, unchanged from the year before. One of the designers of the Home Spot range, David Wahl, said: ‘We have created smart wireless solutions so you don’t need to see the cables anymore. ‘Many products can be charged at the same time, but you still have a beautiful wireless home.’ Technology industry analyst Jeff Kagan said it was a ‘very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology’. He told Agence France-Presse: ‘I expect every other furniture maker to jump on this same bandwagon.’","Qi wireless technology will power-up devices placed on/near the furniture .

"The unspeakably twisted world of a bankrupt Australian businessman is unravelling after he moved to the Philippines and allegedly lured innocent children into his home - and has now been implicated in a child's death. Peter Gerald Scully, from Melbourne, was charged last year with human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online  for paying clients. The 51-year-old managed to avoid being arrested until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013. It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. 'I started crying, I don't know what we were doing,' a tearful Daisy said. Agent Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) Scully then allegedly rubbed mineral oil on the girls' bodies and sexually assaulted them, while Alvarez was took photos. They were then told to keep digging and Daisy was made to sleep in the same room where they had been digging the holes. The next day Daisy said they were forced to perform sexual acts on the man. 'I was crying and screaming so much that Alvarez covered my head with a pillow. I choked so much but Scully continued his abuses on me,' Daisy said. 'Alvarez slapped me and said that I if don't stop crying, Peter will continue doing this.' The girls were then told to keep digging after the horrendous ordeal. That evening, Daisy said they were forced the alcohol and she managed three drinks before passing out and woke up  the next morning to discover she had slept in one of the dug-out graves because she had kept crying and calling for her 'mama'. It was on the fourth day that became unbearable for the little girls. 'They were filming, taking photographs while we dug our graves, and they again brought us to their room, this time, I was tied with a nylon cord, my hands, my feet – I could not move,' Daisy said. 'I wanted to kill myself, I wanted to die that night, because I could not bear it any longer.' However, it was the very next day that the girls fled for their lives when Scully and Alvarez left the house. Queenie’s mother took the girls to the local police station to file a complaint against Scully and Alvarez. The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . When the police turned up to the house - they apprehended Alvarez but Scully escaped. Police said there had been numerous complaints made against Peter Riddel and Peter Russel. Authorities also said that Scully's youngest victim was only one-year-old at the time. Agents assigned to the case described the video footage as 'the worst video we have encountered in our years of campaign against child pornography' which led to seven young victims being rescued, the inquirer.net reported. Alvaraz, now 18, revealed her bizarre lifestyle to a prison warden at the Cagayan de Oro City Jail where she was detained . She met Scully when she working as a prostitute at just 14-years-old and allegedly endured a similar ordeal to Daisy and Queenie before paid by Scully to entice the children into their home. Following information from Scully’s former live-in-partner named Margallo, police officers checked on a home that Scully used to live in when they discovered the remains of what is suspected to be of the 10-year-old girl that Scully allegedly abducted from Talakag town in Bukidnon. Police believed the girl was murdered in July 2013 after Scully had ensured her parents that he would get their daughter a good education. Police said  a team would be sent to the 'horror house' to check if any other children had been buried. Scully had been implicated in an alleged home-buying scheme scam in Melbourne before leaving for the Philippines in 2011, The Age reported. The following year, the Supreme Court of Victoria banned Scully from operating the Key Home Buyer Program which cost investors $2.68 million. Police said they had been searching for Scully since September when two teenage girls were allegedly found naked and chained in an apartment that he rented.

"Shocking: Virginia Roberts' friends claim she was a money-hungry sex kitten' who enjoyed her lavish lifestyle . The woman who has accused Jeffery Epstein of keeping her as a sex slave was actually a money-hungry sex kitten' who enjoyed her lavish lifestyle, former friends have claimed. Virginia Roberts is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem of underage women in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made to 'service'. But those who used to be close to the 31-year-old say she relished her role as his 'travelling masseuse' and never acted like she was being held captive. Philip Guderyon, who used to date Roberts and would drive her to Epstein's Pal Beach, Florida, mansion told the New York Daily News: 'She was like the head b***h. She’d have like nine or 10 girls she used to bring to him. 'She never looked like she was being held captive,' he added. 'She and the other girls would walk out of there smiling, with their little bathing suits on, like they had just come from the beach. 'She’d have like $4,000. And then I’d take them all to the mall and they’d get their nails done.' He also said while making thousands of dollars from the relationship, she would buy fancy clothes and drive around in Epstein's Mercedes. Crystal Figueroa, whose brother dated Roberts in the early 2000s, told the Daily News Roberts would ask if she knew anyone 'slutty' so they could be sent to Epstein. In 2001 she was sharing a Palm Beach apartment with Anthony Valladares. He told the Daily News that she bragged about going to the 'millionaire's house' for a day or two, before returning with cash. He did say that she tried to get out of the sex business, but was dragged back in. Last month it was revealed Roberts accused two male acquaintances she was raped, bringing her credibility into question. Roberts' lawyers says the latest allegations do not contend the fact she was used for underage sex. Attorney Sigrid McCawleysaid : 'To say that our client acquiesced in this abuse, or that the abuse was OK because she was paid for it — leaves out the fact that this is why we have laws in the United States to protect minor children who are groomed and sexually trafficked by adults.' Epstein served 13 months in a Florida prison after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Allegations: The 31-year-old is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem of underage women in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made to 'service' The scandal resurfaced in January when Roberts named Prince Andrew in a lawsuit, accusing him of using her for underage sex. According to court records connected with Roberts' current lawsuit, she maintains that she was recruited to join Epstein's harem in 1999 by his friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. She says during the three years she worked for Epstein, she was made to entertain his friends and named Prince Andrew and Dershowitz as two men she had sex with. Both men have denied having sex with Roberts, and Dershowitz is trying to get his name removed from the suit, claiming Roberts made the entire story up.

"A leading economist is to step down as executive chairman of an influential City think-tank amid drug abuse allegations. Professor Douglas McWilliams, 63, revealed last night that he is to leave his role at the Centre for Economic and Business Research after footage emerged of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine in a north London drug den. The think-tank, which he founded in 1992, confirmed he will take a five-month sabbatical. Professor Douglas McWilliams - A top economist and George Osborne cheerleader - has allegedly been spotted sneaking out of a crack house in north London . Professor McWilliams, who has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, said last night he was ‘taking time off to deal with issues I have not had the chance to address fully when I have been in full-time work’. It comes just two weeks before the launch of his book The Flat White Economy which tells how London swapped the City’s champagne and supercars lifestyle for bicycles and trendy flats. It was confirmed last night that the CEBR board agreed on November 5 last year to allow Professor McWilliams to step down from his position as executive chairman. A CEBR spokesman said: ‘Mr McWilliams plans to take a sabbatical and to return to full-time work at CEBR on August 1, 2015. ‘Meanwhile he plans to fulfill all speaking engagements that he has accepted.’ Referring to reports that Professor McWilliams was an adviser to George Osborne, the spokesman added that ‘neither he nor any other member of CEBR staff has spoken to or met George Osborne since he became Chancellor’, but that CEBR has ‘briefed or advised all four major political parties’. McWilliams, 63, was reportedly seen smoking two rocks last weekend during a visit to the notorious drugs den . Witnesses had claimed that Professor McWilliams had been a regular at various drugs dens in the north London area for the past several months. One source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Last Sunday McWilliams turned up at the den around 10pm and was there about a hour and a half. There were two rocks of the drugs. He smoked it over a table and then sat there all spaced out. 'He was in a suit and started talking about the economy and all that for about 20 minutes. He kept mentioning someone famous he worked with but didn't make much sense. He was asked if he wanted any more and said ""I've had too much"".' McWilliams refused to discuss the allegations when approached by journalists from the Sunday Mirror and has been contacted for comment by MailOnline. Former Professor of Commerce at Gresham College, McWilliams is described on the CEBR website as 'one of the most widely quoted economists'. The think-tank's website states: 'CEBR's clients are mainly public, private, government, professional bodies and third sector organisations. Most are UK based although several have a global reach. We advise 25 of the FTSE 100 companies.' On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about 'illegal drugs' It adds: 'We advise a number of UK government departments and independent government bodies. Recent projects include the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Arts Council England.' McWilliams, married to wife Ianthe for 35 years, has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, and in April estimated that voters would be £165 a year better off by the time of May's General Election, giving Chancellor George Osborne 'rather more scope' for cutting taxes in the spring budget. He said: 'The Government – and especially George Osborne – have credibility in the City and partly because both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls do not.' In December the CEBR claimed Britain's economy would be larger than Germany's by 2030, and suggested that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world's fifth largest economy. The growth in Britain's national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Douglas McWilliams, 63, was reportedly seen at a London crack den .

"Support for British military action against ISIS has risen sharply in the last five months, as the government comes under pressure to catch Jihadi John. David Cameron has vowed to give security and defence chiefs everything they need ‘to find these people and put them out of action’ after the ISIS killer was unmasked as former London student Mohammed Emwazi. Backing for air strikes against ISIS has risen by 11 points to 63 per cent since September, while support for boots on the ground has grown from a quarter to a third. Scroll down for video . New polling shows support for the RAF taking part in airstrikes has risen from 52 per cent in September last year to 63 per cent, according to a YouGov survey for The Times . The idea of British and American ground forces being sent into Iraq to take on ISIS is now backed by 32 per cent, up from 24 per cent September . MPs voted in September by 524 to 43 to back air strikes against ISIS in Iraq, with six RAF Tornados joining war planes from the US, France and Arab nations in military intervention. But Britain is not involved in Syria, after MPs voted against action against the Assad regime in the country a year earlier. New polling shows support for the RAF taking part in airstrikes has risen from 52 per cent in September last year to 63 per cent, according to a YouGov survey for The Times. Eight in 10 Tory voters back airstrikes, compared to just over six in 10 Labour backers. Some 73 per cent of Ukip supporters and 62 per cent of Lib Dems support airstrikes, while just 40 per cent of Green party supporters back the idea. There is also growing support for ground troops to be sent it, although more people are still opposed to the idea. The idea of British and American ground forces being sent into Iraq to take on ISIS is now backed by 32 per cent, up from 24 per cent September. However, ground troops are still opposed by 45 per cent. David Cameron has insisted he will back the services in their efforts to take on ISIS, but some believe that will only be possible with the use of ground troops in Iraq and Syria . However, Tories are split 41 to 41 for and against ground troops. Among Lib Dems – who opposed the Iraq war - only 16 per cent are in favour, with 60 per cent opposed. The killer known as Jihadi John has appeared in ISIS propaganda videos beheading hostages, including Britons, since last summer. The naming of terrorist as Emwazi has put renewed pressure on the security services, after it emerged he had been pinpointed as a potential terrorist by the British authorities but was nonetheless able to travel to Syria in 2013 and join ISIS. Mr Cameron has insisted he will back the services in their efforts to take on ISIS, but some believe that will only be possible with the use of ground troops in Iraq and Syria. Speaking on Friday, the Prime Minister said: ‘I'm not going to talk about specific individuals and specific cases. But… when there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens, we will do everything we can with the police, with the security services, with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action.’ He defended the security services, insisting ‘they are incredibly impressive, hard-working, dedicated, courageous and effective at protecting our country’.","63% now back RAF airstrikes against ISIS, up from 52% in September .

"A design flaw has left a fighter jet that's part of the Pentagon's most expensive project ever incapable of carrying highly advanced bombs. The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load, according to an Inside Defense report. Though it's mandated that an F-35B jet, designed by Lockheed Martin, hold eight SDB IIs in the bay, only four reportedly fit. The F-35 program will reportedly cost a whopping $590 billion over the next decade. Trouble in the skies: The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load (file photo) The F-35B is one of three variants of the F-35 program, which has proved expensive and troublesome to get off the ground. The F-35B features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings, Inside Defense reported. In the US, it will be used by the Marine Corps. However, the F-35B is the centerpiece of the British Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier-based fleet. The Ministry of Defense has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the HMS Prince of Wales. The F-35 program has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays. Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program, said in an Inside Defense interview last week that changes are being made to the F-35B jet so it can be released on schedule. DellaVedova also said that Lockheed Martin will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015. 'This is not a new issue to us,' DellaVedova told Inside Defense. 'We've been working with the SDB II program office and their contractors since 2007. 'The fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support SDB II that have already been incorporated into production F-35 aircraft. 'These minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing SDB [II] developments.' Inside Defense reported that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external SDB IIs are in fact meant to go on the F-35B. Bombs away: The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, defense contractor Raytheon says . Defense contractor Raytheon is behind the SDB II bomb. The company proclaims on its website 'SDB II can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets, reducing aircrews' time in harm's way. The weapon's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous, larger weapons that required multiple jets. SDB II's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers, as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions.' The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, the company says. The SDB II weapons system is fully accommodated by both the F-35A - the Air Force version - and F-35C - the US Navy version, company executive Jeff White told Inside Defense. White told the news outlet 'I think it's just the B. When we did our fit checks on the JSF, the A and the C basically had the same bay.' 353 F-35Bs are being bought by the United States Marines Corps, Inside Defense reported. According to the news outlet, approximately 17,000 weapons will come from the United States Air Force's SDB II program.","Fighter jet F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load .

"Britons left wheelchair-bound by multiple sclerosis can walk, run and even dance again after being given a pioneering stem cell treatment. Doctors have described the recoveries as ‘miraculous’, while patients say they have been given their lives back. The treatment uses a patient’s own stem cells – the body’s master cells – to fight the disease. Recovery: MS sufferer Holly Drewery became wheelchair-bound after the birth of daughter Isla, but thanks to the stem cell transplant she can dance, run and chase after Isla in the park . If it fulfils its early promise, it could be the first therapy that does not just slow the damage done by the condition, but reverses it. Professor Basil Sharrack, of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, said: ‘Since we started treating patients some three years ago some of the results have been miraculous. Today, Holly Drewery can run after her daughter Isla. Two years ago she could take her for a walk only if someone pushed her wheelchair while she held on to Isla’s pushchair. Miss Drewery, 25, of Sheffield, pictured with Isla, was diagnosed with MS after suffering numbness and blurred vision. She became wheelchair-bound after her health worsened on Isla’s birth. She needed help with basic tasks and couldn’t even wiggle her toes. Three weeks after the stem cell transplant she was able to walk out of hospital. Now, more than 18 months on, she is almost back to normal. She has a part-time office job and, although she still gets tired, can dance, run and chase after Isla, two, in the park. She said: ‘All I wanted to be able to do is take Isla out. It worked wonders. I am more or less back to normal.’ Sam Ramsey collapsed when out celebrating her 22nd birthday and six weeks later was paralysed from the neck down by MS. Other treatments failed but now, after the stem cell treatment, Miss Ramsey, 25, of Newark in Nottinghamshire, can walk on crutches, has passed her driving test and ordered a car. She told the Sunday Times: ‘This treatment has given me my life back.’ 'This is not a word I would use lightly but we have seen profound neurological improvements.’ However, more research is needed to prove the patients are not just experiencing a temporary remission, which does happen in MS. The neurological condition, which is more common in women than men, usually strikes those in their 20s and 30s and affects 2.5million people worldwide, including 100,000 Britons. It can cause blindness and paralysis, but current drugs are not suitable for all and there is no cure. The disease occurs when ‘friendly fire’ from the body’s immune system destroys myelin, the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting the transmission of vital signals. The Sheffield treatment uses the stem cells to ‘reboot’ the immune system so that it stops attacking the body and brain. First, a sample of the patient’s blood is taken and stem cells are removed from it and stored. The patient is then given a high dose of chemotherapy to wipe out their faulty immune system. Finally, they are given their stem cells back. As master cells, they are able to form a new, healthy immune system. The transplant has a one-off cost of around £30,000, similar to the amount spent on some patients’ drugs each year. As well as stopping the disease in its tracks the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, seems to heal damage that has already been done. Sam Ramsey, 25, of Newark, pictured with her mother Tina, was paralysed as result of her MS, but now, after treatment, she can walk on crutches and has passed her driving test . A number of MS sufferers were given pioneering therapy at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield . Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves). The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS cannot be predicted. MS is a lifelong disease for which a cause and cure are yet to be found; however, doctors and scientists are making discoveries about the treatment and management of MS every day. The visible and hidden symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from person to person and from time to time in the same person. However, symptoms can include difficulties walking, pain, dizziness, slurred speech, emotional and mood changes, memory problems and extreme tiredness. A man who was blind in one eye has almost normal vision again. A woman in Canada who needed 24-hour care appears free of MS more than a decade after being given a transplant of her own stem cells. Despite these dramatic improvements, the treatment is not suitable for all patients. A US trial on almost 150, reported last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed it to help roughly half the time. There are also concerns about complications including potentially lethal infections. Professor Sharrack and colleagues are seeking patients with relapsing-remitting MS, the most common form, for an NHS-funded trial. The MS Society described the Sheffield work as ‘very encouraging’ and said it is eagerly awaiting the results of larger trials.","Pioneering treatment has allowed wheelchair-bound patients to run again .

"While Tony Abbott is in New Zealand spruiking his national security plans, it looks like the security of his job as Prime Minister is, for the second time this month, in question. As he remains 'undistracted and undeterred by the hyperventilating which seems to be taking place at least amongst the media', Liberal backbenchers have reportedly given Mr Turnbull the go ahead saying he has the numbers for a successful spill. But they've said the move would have to be initiated by senior ministers from the Cabinet. Since these reported emerged on Saturday, supporters of Ms Bishop have claimed the Foreign Affairs Minister is against the move however she would stand against Mr Turnbull if the spill were to eventuate. Scroll down for video . Speculation has been rife about a second leadership challenge - less than three weeks since Mr Abbott (front) survived a spill motion - as Mr Turnbull (right) has reportedly been told by MPs that he has the numbers to beat the Prime Minister. However it is believed Ms Bishop (left) is against another spill motion but will stand against Mr Turnbull if it goes ahead . Ms Bishop publically backed Mr Abbott on Saturday saying she supported the 'the leader that the party has elected'. 'I am not aware of any attempt to bring a spill motion to challenge the leadership.' Ms Bishop isn't alone with rumours that Trade Minister, Andrew Robb, is vying for the role, however, Mr Robb has also publically backed Abbott, saying he had earned the right to contest the next election. Senior cabinet ministers claim Mr Robb has labelled the Communications Minister as 'not conservative enough' to lead the party, reports the Daily Telegraph.

Federal MP Bob Katter chimed in, likening the Liberal Party to a 'pit of snakes'.

'It would be really nice if the LNP put some people in government who are interested in governing the country, instead of being interested in getting promoted into a ministry or from the ministry into leadership positions.'

"A rare white elephant has been captured after it was discovered roaming wild in a  jungle in Burma. The seven-year-old female elephant was captured by forestry officials six weeks after it was spotted at a reserve in the western Ayeyarwaddy region. The elephants have been revered for centuries in Asian nations including Burma, Thailand and Laos, and their appearance is said to bring good fortune, as well as herald political change. Scroll down for video . A rare white elephant, similar to this animal, has been captured after it was discovered roaming wild in a jungle in Burma . 'We had to be careful,' said Burma's forestry department spokesman Tun Tun Oo, who said the elephant had first been sighted in the Pathein township. 'It's wild. We didn't want the elephant or the forestry department officials to get hurt.' Often pinkish in color, with fair eyelashes and toenails, the animals are actually albinos. They were normally kept and pampered by monarchs as a symbol of royal power and prosperity - and many people still believe they bring good luck to the country. The elephants have been revered for centuries in Asian nations including Burma, Thailand and Laos, and their appearance is said to bring good fortune, as well as herald political change . Previous white elephants transported from Myanmar's jungles have been heralded in lavish ceremonies in which military leaders sprinkle them with scented water laced with gold, silver and precious gems. And in the 16th century  Thailand, then known as Siam, and Burma even went to war over the disputed ownership of four white elephants. Burma currently has eight white elephants in captivity, most from the Ayeyarwaddy region. Five are in the zoo in the capital Naypyitaw, and three in Yangon. According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are between 25,600 and 32,750 Asian elephants remaining in the wild. Only males carry tusks and thus at risk from poachers who want them for their ivory. The capture of wild elephants for domestic use has become a threat to wild populations. India, Vietnam, and Burma have banned the capture of elephants in order to conserve wild herds, but in Burma elephants are still caught for the timber industry or the illegal wildlife trade, according to charity the WWF.

"Chile's president went to a hospital Saturday to meet with a 14-year-old girl who shocked the country by going on YouTube to plead for the leader to let doctors euthanize her because she is tired of her struggle with cystic fibrosis. The government quickly said no after the video began spreading on social media Thursday. A government statement said President Michelle Bachelet talked with Valentina Maureira and her father for more than an hour at the Catholic University hospital in the capital. Scroll down for video . President Michelle Bachelet, right, poses for a selfie with Valentina Maureira, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, at a hospital in Santiago, Chile . Officials did not release any information on what was said. But the government provided photographs of the visit, including one of Valentina taking a selfie with the president, who is also a pediatrician. Valentina grabbed attention after posting on YouTube a video that appeared to have been shot from a hospital bed. 'I urgently request to speak to the president because I'm tired of living with this illness,' said the teenager, whose older brother died at age 6 from the same disease. 'I want her approval so I can get a shot that will make me sleep forever.' Maureira, a 14-year girl who suffers cystic fibrosis and asked the Government for permission to die through a YouTube video, at the Clinic Hospital of Catholic University of Santiago de Chile . Cystic fibrosis damages multiple organs, especially the lungs, by causing recurrent infections that damage tissue. Valentina said she was frustrated by the lack of options and by how the disease had hurt her quality of life. On Thursday, presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde expressed sympathy for Valentina's plight, but stressed that Chilean law does not allow euthanasia. 'It's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request; it's impossible to grant her wish,' Elizalde said. Chile's government on Thursday rejected a plea from 14-year-old Valentina Maureira (above) to be euthanized . In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, the girl's father, Fredy Maureira, said he supported his daughter's request, though he added that he 'cried through the night' after he first heard about her wish to die. 'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' Maureira said. Shortly after her video picked up attention online the Chile government rejected her plea. Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizalde said Thursday that although 'it's impossible not to be overcome by emotion with the girl's request, it's impossible to grant her wish,' because it's not allowed under Chilean law. Elizalde said the health ministry was in contact with Maureira's family and was providing her psychological assistance as well as medical treatment. In a statement issued by the hospital, Castillo said she had been transferred out of the critical pediatric patient unit. 'Right now our therapeutic efforts are aimed at the recovery of her nutritional state and supporting her family,' he said. Scroll down for video . Maurerira suffers from cystic fibrosis, and watched her older brother die from the disease when he was just 6-years-old .

'This is so tough, but I have to respect her decision because she's the one who's suffering this illness,' said Fredy Maureira. 'I already lost a 6-year-old son because I didn't have enough money and organs. Now my daughter just wants to die in a dignified way,' he added. Maureira said that after he first heard his daughter's wish to die, he 'cried through the night.' The degenerative disease is affecting Valentina's liver, pancreas and lung, and she has said that she's frustrated by the lack of options and how much it has affected her quality of life.

"Ray Rice claims he felt close to suicide during the mass outrage over footage that showed him punching his then-fiancee unconscious. It is just over a year since the former Baltimore Ravens player was captured on surveillance cameras attacking Janay Palmer in the elevator of a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Reflecting on the past year, which saw him dropped from the league, Rice told the Baltimore Sun he felt like 'it wasn't worth living'. 'The big picture of it all, being the person that I am, I really felt horrible,' Rice told the newspaper in an interview. Scroll down for video . Seen here with wife Janay, Rice thanked and apologized to fans, the city of Baltimore, his former team, and even Raven's owner Steve Bisciotti as he prepared to leave town for him home state of New York . 'You almost want to punish yourself. I know I'm never going to win the battle of public opinion. Honestly, I almost felt like at one point that it wasn't worth living. I see why people commit suicide. 'It hurt that bad. I was low, real low. It hurt that bad because you worked your whole life to do all the right things and then you're the world's most hated person. 'It was really tough. My daughter, oh Lord, I grew up without a father, there's no way I could check out on my own family.' It comes after he issued an apology to Ravens fans, who turned up in their droves last year to exchange their Rice jerseys for new ones with other players' names. Rice was booted from the Baltimore Ravens after footage was leaked showing him knocking out his now-wife in a casino elevator . The NFL lifted the ban on Rice in November and allowed him to become a free agent but he remains untouched by any team . In a statement on Facebook, he wrote: 'To all the kids who looked up to me, I'm truly sorry for letting you down, but I hope it's helped you learn that one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare. 'There is no excuse for domestic violence, and I apologize for the horrible mistake I made.' The running back, who helped the Ravens win the Super Bowl in 2012, is currently a free agent, after his indefinite ban from the league was overturned upon appeal in November. Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti has said Rice will never play for the team again. But Rice said he valued the time he spent with Bisciotti, general manager Ozzie Newsome and head coach John Harbaugh. Rice told his fans that 'one bad decision can turn your dream into a nightmare' 'I love you all very much, and I'll always be proud to say I played for the Baltimore Ravens,' he said. The NFL's inept handling of Rice's case plunged the league into crisis. He was originally suspended just two games, after a hotel video showed him pulling an unconscious Janay Palmer from an elevator in an Atlantic City casino. The punishment was widely denounced as too lenient, and when another video that showed the actual punch surfaced, the Ravens sacked him and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell banned him indefinitely. The NFL Players Association successfully appealed on the grounds that the league violated labor laws by increasing Rice's punishment after the second video surfaced because it gave no real new information on the case.","Ray Rice says he understands how people can feel suicidal .

"Switch off? The sale of halogen bulbs could be banned as part of the EU's energy-saving drive . The sale of halogen bulbs which are used in millions of homes could be banned as early as next year as part of the EU’s energy-saving drive. It follows the prohibition of traditional incandescent bulbs, which have been phased out in an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Millions of halogen bulbs are sold in Britain every year, often for use in kitchen and bathroom spotlights. Any ban could consequently cause enormous inconvenience. The European Commission and green campaigners say halogens are not much more efficient than traditional bulbs so should be replaced by energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs – known as CFLs – and LEDs. Yet these alternatives can be as much as 15 times more expensive. There is the additional problem that some LEDs do not work with the dimmer switches and wiring circuits currently used by halogen bulbs, while CFLs can take up to five minutes to reach full brightness. The EC is due to hold a vote on the issue in April, when it could agree to go ahead with the proposed 2016 ban or push back the date to 2018. Consumer group Which? argued there are good reasons for a delay. A spokesman said: ‘Half of Which? members still have halogen bulbs in their home and more than two in five have halogen spotlights. Delaying the ban until 2018 would allow more time for some of the compatibility and user issues to be resolved.’ And a campaign group of manufacturers called LightingEurope is demanding any ban on halogens is delayed until 2020 at the earliest, in order to minimise the impact on consumers and the industry. The group’s secretary general, Diederik de Stoppelaar, said: ‘A phase-out before 2020 is going to be costly and inconvenient to consumers. The industry supports the change to more energy efficient lighting... however, an earlier date does not allow for alternative developing technologies to be widely available.’ But Which? added that despite the inconvenience, there are some positives to switching. The new bulbs last longer and, because they are more energy efficient, they will cut electricity bills over time. Typically, halogens use 10 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs, while CFLs use 60-80 per cent less and LEDs up to 90 per cent less. LED lights are so efficient that a 5-watt bulb is, in theory, equivalent to a 35-watt halogen. But while a typical 35-watt halogen spotlight costs about £1, a 5-watt LED can be anything from £5 to £15. The managing director of British lighting company BLT Direct, Steven Ellwood, supports the 2016 ban. He said: ‘We understand the concerns of experts who want to delay the ban in order to iron out some issues. [But] implementing the ban sooner rather than later would see plenty of benefits for consumers, not to mention the environment.’ Other advocates of the 2016 deadline argue that the energy savings for Britain as a whole could be so large that it would eliminate the risk of black-outs caused by the closure of old and run-down power stations. One analysis suggests that if all 27million homes reduced their need for lighting by 100 watts on winter evenings, this would cut peak energy demand by 5 per cent.","Follows ban of incandescent bulbs in bid to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

"It's thousands of years since mankind won dominance over nature, and we're still pretty proud. But  a top researcher says we've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends. Humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 BC, it is claimed, giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our Neanderthal rivals. Man's best friend: An early cave painting in Libya of dogs chasing a deer in the Akakus Mountains. A new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought . Left behind: While early humans hunted with wolves, their Neanderthal rivals in Europe continued using primitive tools without any help, according to anthropologist Dr Pat Shipman (artist's impression) The controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist Pat Shipman of Pennsylvania State University. She has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago, after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in Europe. No match: The theory claims Neanderthals (model pictured) were no match for the hunting technique . Instead, she said, humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from Africa up to 70,000 years ago. At the time, our close genetic relatives the Neanderthals were dominant in Europe, fighting for survival as they hunted creatures such as woolly mammoths with primitive tools. But soon afterwards the rival species died out, leaving a clear path for the homo sapiens that make up today's humans. Strong rival theories of their demise include that Neanderthals, just like woolly mammoths, were unable to cope with the changing climate of the last ice age or that humans were better hunters. Dr Shipman, however, told The Observer: 'We formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the Neanderthal. 'Early wolf-dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison and would have hounded them until they tired. Then humans would have killed them with spears or bows and arrows. 'This meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off – often the most dangerous part of a hunt – while humans didn’t have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey. Dogs would have done that. 'Then we shared the meat. It was a win-win situation.' Dr Shipman's theory, shared in her book The Invaders: How Humans and Their Dogs Drove Neanderthals to Extinction, was partly inspired by early dog remains. Crossing paths: Wolves and woolly mammoths co-existed for millennia, but only wolves survived in the end . Close relation: A Natural History museum employee examines a model of a Neanderthal during an exhibition last year. Neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences . She examined 33,000-year-old fossils of dogs found in Siberia and Belgium, and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves. Although they were far more similar to wolves than the pets of today, there were clear signs of domestication, she said - including shorter snouts, densely-packed teeth and wider jaws. The theory is the latest in a long line about our prehistoric ancestors, many of which contradict each other. Last year a study at the University of Tübingen in Germany claimed early humans emigrated from Africa far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago. Another study at the University of Chicago said wolves began evolving into domestic dogs between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, while a third study said dogs may not have evolved from wolves as we know them today at all.","Neanderthals were wiped out after ancient humans arrived from Africa .
Scientists  disagree on why - but top anthropologist may have the answer .
Dr Pat Shipman said we paired up with wolves in symbiotic partnership .
Wolves cornered prey and humans made the kill, sharing meat afterwards .

"Margaret Thatcher is said to have ordered testing of a laser to be used in the Falklands War . A secret 'death ray' laser was developed during the Falklands War and ordered for testing by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, documents reveal. Britain was said to have worked with America to develop the high powered lasers for use on the battlefield during the 1970s and 1980s. The beam, nicknamed a 'death ray', had been developed quickly because of fears over the weapons possessed by the Soviets - but was never used. But Lady Thatcher was said to be so impressed with the technology she ordered testing to take place during the Falklands War, the Daily Express reported. Existence of the laser was revealed in the National Archives, in a letter - marked 'top secret' from the then Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine to Lady Thatcher in 1983 about the weapons owned by the Soviets and Britain's position. It said: 'You may recall that we developed and deployed with great urgency a naval laser weapon, designed to dazzle low-flying Argentinian pilots attacking ships, to the Task Force in the South Atlantic. 'The weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted circle.' The letter was revealed under the 30 year rule. Sheffield academic Dr David Clarke found the letter in his search of the archives and said the 'naval laser weapon' referred to a device tested, but never used in anger, when troops were defending the Suez Canal in 1941. Margaret Thatcher (pictured front, centre) visited HMS Hermes when it came back from the Falklands War . This device used powerful searchlights to dazzle pilots as they attacked Royal Navy ships. In 1982, when the Falkland Islands was invaded, it was decided to use the same tactics to try and blind enemy pilots. In the 1980s Britain was said to be focused on developing medium power lasers directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes, optic and electro-optic sensors. These weapons was designed to target low flying aircraft by 'dazzling' pilots targeting ships. The 'death ray' was said to be unlikely to be unsuccessful in targeting ships but would work on humans. Britain's laser weapon research in the 1980s was covered by two programmes - known as Raker and Shingle. According to the correspondence from Mr Heseltine, Britain had been working with America on developing laser weapons since the 1970s. Mr Heseltine also detailed fears in his letter to Lady Thatcher about the Soviets were developing a range of secret beam weapons. However he said he was uncertain whether owning these weapons was useful. In the letter he added: 'the Russians could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid-1980s (in fact, the Russians may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser Kirov)'. The Falklands War lasted from April to June 1982, with the loss of 255 personnel from the UK.","Britain believed to have worked with America on development of lasers .

"It may be the first official day of Spring, but it would be wise not to pack away the scarves and gloves just yet. Forecasters predict a colder-than-average March, with parts of north-west England and Wales expected to wake up to at least 2in of snow tomorrow. According to long range forecasts, the cold snap is expected to last throughout March and will see Britain covered in more snow and frost. Then April will bring in a long-awaited warm and sunny Easter, where temperatures could peak at an above-average 21C (70F).

But the mercury is expected to plunge to below freezing tonight and tomorrow evening, with around 2.4in of snow forecast to fall in western Britain. Around 4in of snow may fall over the Pennines and the Scottish Highlands on land above 1,300ft (400 metres). Temperatures will be slightly below average for this time of year, dipping to zero tonight and -1C (30F) tomorrow evening. Chris Page, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'This week will be cold with sunny spells and some wintry showers. 'These showers will see snow fall on the hills in the north of the country.

Two lambs were born this week at at Shugborough Hall estate near Stafford, the first of around 100 lambs and goat kids that are expected to be born throughout Spring. Crocuses have also sprung up in the eight-acre field of the village of Inkpen in Berkshire - another sign of the changing of the seasons this week. But the newborn lambs are unlikely to see this season getting warmer yet as cold conditions continue throughout March, which is forecast to be drier in the second half of the month but with colder nights and frost. However, by Easter Sunday on April 5 the mercury is expected to reach 21C - around 8C above average for the time of year. This is likely to be caused by a build-up of higher pressure that will bring warmer and more settled conditions. And May could be even warmer, with temperatures of up to 27C, according to British Weather Services. The warmer than average weather is leading to hopes that Britain could be on course for a hot dry summer.","Lambs were born in Stafford this week as today marks first official day of Spring, according to meteorologists .

'(One reason is) vendors having committed themselves to another purchase & needing to sell to cover their new debt/commitment.' Mr Rowe also said that agents having a higher expectation of what markets are willing to pay, and changes of employment conditions within a region can also contribute to the change in the market.

"She's one of the most famous and successful magazine editors in the world, legendary for her frosty manner, trademark bob and wearing sunglasses at all times - even during the Oscars ceremony. But what makes American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, 65, so successful? In an interview with Alistair Campbell for his new book Winners And How They Succeed, she shared the secrets of her success. Anna Wintour shares the traits that have taken her to the top including being decisive and resilient . In a book extract in the Sunday Times' Style magazine, Wintour, who became American Vogue's editor in chief in 1988, reveals that being decisive, delegating and recovering fast from setbacks have taken her to the top - and kept her there. Having been fired from her role as a junior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar after just nine months in 1975, she said: 'Everyone should be sacked at least once in their career because 'perfection doesn't exist'. She added: 'It's important to have setbacks, because that is the reality of life.' The most powerful woman in fashion and editor of Vogue for almost 30 years is rumoured to have been the model for Miranda Priestly, the terrifying magazine editor who hires Anne Hathaway in The Devil Wears Prada. But her analysis of her own strengths is far more human and surprisingly humble than the film character as she asks whether 'journalist' is even the right word to describe what she does. Yet her most surprising trick is pretending to be sure of herself, even if she doesn't feel it. Anna Wintour, second left, sitting next to her daughter Bea Schaffer, earned admiration for wearing her signature dark glasses indoors during the Oscar ceremony .

'People work better when they have responsibility,' she said. She also revealed that she has no idea how to make a dress, couldn't create an image from a photo shoot and can't write, and instead responds to other people's talents.

"The Conservatives will build 200,000 cut-price homes to help first-time buyers get a foot on the property ladder, David Cameron will pledge today. A scheme offering starter homes for sale at 20 per cent below the normal market price is to be doubled in size if the Tories win the election. The estimated discount on a typical £200,000 house would be a hefty £40,000. Scroll down for video . Levels of home ownership have plummeted to the lowest level in 30 years, according to latest figures . The scheme for 100,000 such homes was announced at the Conservative Party conference in September. The Prime Minister now wants to build 200,000 over the next five years. Pledging to produce a Britain ‘where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own’, Mr Cameron will say: ‘There is a particular kind of security that comes with having a home – and that’s what I want to talk about today. Too many people have been denied that security. ‘The young people in their 20s and 30s, still living with their parents, desperately saving for their own place. The couple who want a child but can’t afford to upsize – even though they both have full-on, full-time jobs. It shouldn’t be this way.’ David Cameron will pledge to build 200,000 cut-price homes to help first-time buyers get a foot on the property ladder . The move comes amid concern over falling levels of home ownership and the prospect that future generations may never be able to afford a home of their own. Mr Cameron is also considering a radical idea tabled by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to extend the right to buy to 2.5million tenants in housing association properties. The Tories’ Starter Homes initiative is due to begin today. First-time buyers aged under 40 are eligible to apply and can register their interest at www.starter-home.co.uk. The homes will be built by the private sector and several major developers such as Barratt and Taylor Wimpey have signed up to take part. Anyone buying one will have to hang on to it for at least five years before selling it on the open market to prevent speculators using the scheme to make a windfall profit. Ministers are consulting on whether to extend the minimum resale period to 15 years. Labour last night attacked the Tory housing plan after Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps struggled to explain how it would be funded. In an interview with Sky News Mr Shapps initially suggested homebuyers would be offered government-subsidised mortgages, before saying ministers would ‘get together’ with developers and landowners to finalise details. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said the comments suggested the Conservatives’ plans were not credible. ‘The Tories’ housing policies are in chaos,’ she said. ‘Grant Shapps, a former housing minister, couldn’t even explain how the Government would deliver a key election pledge.’ But Tory sources said there was a clear plan to keep prices down by allowing construction in areas where planning permission would not normally be granted for housing. Hundreds of acres of unwanted commercial and industrial land are to be turned over for the scheme, which Mr Cameron has said will help ‘unlock home ownership for a generation’. In some cases, developers will be allowed to build a small number of homes for sale on the open market to subsidise the cost of the new starter homes. Developers will also be spared infrastructure levies which add about £20,000 to the cost of a home on a normal development. Rules allowing homeowners to build conservatories without planning permission are to be extended . Controversial rules that allow homeowners to build big conservatories and extensions without planning permission are to be extended for another five years, the Tories said yesterday. The regulations, which permit extensions of up to 26ft long without authorisation – provided no neighbours object – provoked a major row when they were first announced by the Government in 2013. But Tory sources said they would be retained until at least 2020. Regulations which make it easier for former offices to be converted to homes would also be extended. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said that the move was designed to ensure ‘common sense on home extensions, so families aren’t crushed by expensive red tape’. Councils will also be forced to help find plots for people seeking to build their own homes, as part of a scheme that ministers believe could produce up to 20,000 new homes a year. Ministers say they want to offer new starter homes in both towns and the countryside – and it is possible that some will be built in the Green Belt. The price of homes available in the scheme will be capped at £250,000 outside London and £450,000 in the capital. Mr Cameron will pledge that design standards will not be allowed to slip, saying that people will not be offered ‘rabbit hutches or shoe boxes, but decent, well-built homes with gardens – places to start and raise a family’. But industry sources questioned whether the scheme could be delivered and pointed out that it has been doubled in size before a single home has been built. One senior industry figure described the target for 200,000 cut-price homes over five years as ‘very ambitious’ in the context of the 125,000 or so new houses started in total last year.","David Cameron to announce housing policy in speech in today .

"Sam Stephens is taking fundraising  to new heights, vowing to legally change his name to Buzz Lightyear if he raises $4,000 for a children's cancer charity. The 26-year-old toy story fanatic will run in the Brighton Marathon in April to raise money for charity after learning of his friend, Joe Grimley, loosing his younger sister to leukemia. ‘I wanted to something a bit personal and cancer is obviously a big deal, especially in children, it’s horrible,’ told The Daily Mail Australia. Thumbs up: Mr Stephens committed to running 26 miles in the Brighton Marathon wearing his Buzz Lightyear costume after reaching his first goal of £500 . Sam Stephens (pictured left) with his friend Joe Grimley(pictured right) who tragically lost his young sister to leukemia . Mr Stephens said he wanted to bring something 'a bit different and unique' to his fundraising events, ultimately taking it 'to infinity and beyond' by setting a series of Toy Story related goals on the way. He says if reaches $2,400, he will get a Buzz tattoo on his thigh. If he manages to raise $4,000, he will take the plunge and officially change his name with deed poll to 'Buzz Lightyear' like the Space Ranger from the Universe Protection Unit. 'This means there will be no more Samuel Thomas Stephens, I will be known on all my official documents, (passport driving license etc) and to the whole entire universe as Buzz Lightyear,' Mr Stephens says on his donation website. Mr Stephens has been overwhelmed with the public's response, as donations have been flooding in after his plight hit news websites a few days ago. 'I never expected it to blow up like this.' ‘In two days I had close to 250 pounds(A$495) come in from all over the world. People I don’t even know, from America and even Finland.’ Mr Stephens says he wanted to bring something 'a bit different and unique' to his fundraising events choosing to legally change his name to 'Buzz Lightyear' if he reaches his target . In what the philanthropist has labelled 'drytashamarathon', Mr Stephens will also be taking part in 'Movember', which means he'll sport a moustache until the marathon, and 'Dryathalon', a sobering challenge where he will abstain from drinking. Mr Stephens has already achieved two of his goals by raising an astonishing $2,000. This means he'll don a Buzz Lightyear costume while running the 26-mile marathon, and let those who have donated to his cause style his new facial hair. Mr Stephens(pictured left) is ready for his transformation into his childhood hero, Buzz Lightyear (pictured left) 'I want to do all I can to help raise awareness and I think the Toy Story theme adds a nice touch to what we are trying to achieve.' 'Buzz Lightyear is a childhood hero of mine and I am looking forward to my kids being called Lightyear and my wife, Mrs Lightyear,' Mr Stephens told The Daily Mail Australia. Mr Stephens, who is currently working in Australia, says he won't do anything by half measure, looking outside the box to give people more incentive to donate. The 26-year-old Brighton man has been travelling and training for the marathon in Sydney, Australia with plans to return home in April.","Sam Stephens will change his name to Buzz Lightyear if he raises $4,000 for a children's cancer charity .

"Half of American voters think that congressional Republican's inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak on Capitol Hill was a bad idea, a new poll shows. Forty-eight per cent of respondents in a new poll say they disapproved of Republican House Speaker John Boehner offering the Middle Eastern leader an invitation to speak to Congress without first clearing it with President Obama. Thirty per cent of all respondents favored letting Netanyahu speak, with more than 20 per cent saying they didn't know enough to answer. The Israeli leader landed in Washington on Sunday night. Scroll down for video . Forty-seven per cent of Americans do not approve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured leaving Israel on Sunday with wife Sarah) giving his speech to Congress . Responses to questions about the speech, planned for Tuesday, largely broke down along party lines, the poll from the Wall Street Journal and NBC shows. Nearly half, 47 per cent, of Republicans asked about the address said that they supported the move, compared to 28 per cent who oppose it. Just 12 per cent of Democrats said they were behind letting the Israeli leader, who faces an election in several weeks, speak without Obama's approval. Sixty-six per cent disapproved of it. While the relationship between Netanyahu and Obama has deteriorated over America's nuclear program negotiations with Iran, the percentage of Americans who looked favorably on the prime minister has increased. Thirty per cent now think positively about the right-wing Likud leader, up from 24 per cent in August, right after Israel's large-scale bombing operation in the Gaza Strip. Views of the prime minister, who also held the post in the late 1990s, were also split by party, with 49 per cent of Republicans holding a positive view compared to only 12 per cent of Democrats. The relationship between President Obama and Netanyahu has become strained because of American negotiations with Iran . Despite the controversy inspired by its leader, American's views of Israel as a country continue to be strong. Forty-seven per cent of the US electorate view Israel as a country in a good light, compared to 17 per cent negative. Netanyahu's visit is seen as possibly upsetting delicate negotiations over limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting crippling sanctions. Proposed legislation in Congress would levy additional economic restrictions on the country that many Israelis consider their biggest security threat if talks fall through. Obama has decided not to meet with the prime minister during his visit and some Democratic members of Congress have said they will not attend his speech. The Israeli leader will also speak at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference on Monday. While it may be causing disagreements in Washington, half of Americans had not read or seen coverage of Netanyahu's visit to the US. The poll was conducted on Wednesday through Sunday and surveyed 800 registered voters. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46 percentage points.","Forty-seven per cent of  voters say inviting Israeli prime minister a bad idea .

Above, the couple takes a vacation with their son and daughter . The shooter had asked Darrell Shriver, (right) 68, for a job but didn't get it, according to resident John Shriver, 72. Above, the victim and his wife Martha, (left) 67, who was wounded but expected to survive . Joe Alridge, 36, is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, as well as the Shrivers . Aldridge, who took his own life in his pickup truck on Friday morning, was described as a recluse by those in the town . It was known in the town that Aldridge's family and the Shrivers had been feuding for years, a resident of nearby Summersville told Daily Mail Online. The Shrivers were described as a hard-working clan that owned businesses including construction, cabinet making and cattle farming projects since 1969. Darrell Shriver's wife Martha, 67, was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. She is expected to survive. 'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' John Shriver said. The elder Shriver discovered the bodies of Carey and Valirea after getting a call to check on them from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star. The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his older, college-aged sister . He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'. The shooter is thought to have killed his cousin Garold Dee Aldridge, (center left) 52, and his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, (right) 47 . The motive for the gunman killing his cousin Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, is unknown . The Shrivers were described as a hardworking family that owned several businesses. Above, Carey and Valirea with their daughter . Martha Shriver (right) called John Shriver, 72, to check up on her son Carey before she and husband Darrell (left) were shot . Authorities identified the four other victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold. John Shriver was unsure about why the killer would target his own family members, according to the Associated Press. His uncle Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between the shooter and his cousins 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to Arkansas Online. The alarm was first raised around 10.15pm by a 15-year-old girl wearing nothing but a nightgown who ran barefoot to her neighbor's house through the snow when her parents Garold Aldridge, 52, and Julie Aldridge, 47, were shot. 'She said she seen a man in her dad's bedroom, talking to him in a normal voice. Then she said she heard gunshots and screaming,' an unidentified neighbor said. 'She was barefoot, in a nightgown with no sleeves at all and her legs were all scratched up from briars, he told the Springfield News Leader. The shooter had no trouble getting into his neighbor's homes. Armed with a .45-caliber handgun, Aldridge shot his seven victims before killing himself in his pickup truck in the middle of a highway on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, to the east of Texas County. The car was still running. He did not leave a note. Around town, Aldridge was described as a recluse, and it was unclear what, if anything, he did for a living. Vernetta Lucille Swartz, 76, Joseph Aldridge's aunt, now lives California and said was grief-stricken. 'Two of my nephews and wives were shot, and I guess another nephew was the shooter,' she said. The shooter was found dead in his pickup truck in the middle of the highway after shooting seven people dead in rural Missouri. He was described as a recluse by those in town who knew of him . A 15-year-old girl ran to her neighbor's house after hearing her parents shot on a night that would ultimately claim nine lives (pictured) Police first heard of the incident after the young girl contacted police at around  10:15pm on Thursday evening . John Shriver is a relative of the Shriver victims, two of whom he found dead on the floor of their bedroom after being called by Martha Shriver . A neighbor told Daily Mail Online that everyone in the small towns of Tyrone and Summersville is aware of each other, and that Aldridge 'probably killed 10 per cent of the town's population last night'. Tyrone is estimated to have around 50 residents. All victims lived within a three mile radius of each other. Alice L. Aldridge, 74, the suspect's mother, 'died of natural causes' on the couch and is thought to have been dead for more than 24 hours before being found Thursday night. The woman, who Aldridge lived with, had a history of breast and lung cancer. Police discovered her while looking for her son. Her death may have sparked the suspect to go on his rampage, Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Joseph Aldridge has a previous criminal history that includes being sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for possessing a handgun while being a marijuana user. He was released in 2010. Troopers began an investigation in the area following the shootings. A resident reported that authorities were knocking on doors at 3.45am on Friday. The state-wide Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting the small town in the investigation. Authorities did not release a suspected motive for the killings and are not looking for any other suspects. Sheriff James Sigman (pictured) has said that the victims all lived within three miles of each other in the small town . 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents' the superintendent of nearby Houston's school district said . Staff of the Houston's school district were told to arrive early for counseling Friday morning, according to the Houston Herald. Superintendent Scott Dill said that residents of the close-knit community are in a 'state of shock' and he has been trying to help kids come to grips with the situation. Children related to victims were not in school on Friday. 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents,' he told Daily Mail Online. Texas County, Missouri is an Ozark region of about 25,000 people located east of college town Springfield and south of Army base Fort Leonard Wood. Tyrone is located in the southern portion of the county, south of Houston, the county seat, which has about 2,000 residents. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the shootings were 'a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.' Department of Mental Health in the state have also made contact with local authorities to provide crisis intervention services and counseling. Mr Whittaker said that the county averages about one homicide a year, many years having none. The Aldridges will be buried on Thursday at First General Baptist Church in nearby Willow Springs. An online fundraising page for their family had raised more than $8,000 as of Sunday morning. Many residents of Texas County have expressed their condolences for the victims' families by changing their profile pictures to a man leaning over in prayer.

"The last the world knew of Pia Farrenkopf, she had withdrawn $1,500 from her checking account in February 25, 2009. Friends and family didn't see or hear from the woman they described as fun and intelligent in the years since, but they chalked it up to Farrenkopf's solitary tendencies. Meanwhile, letters piled up in her mailbox in the middle-class neighborhood where she lived in Pontiac, Michigan, before being taken back to the Post Office as unclaimed. Mummified: Pia Farrenkopf, who was 44 when authorities believe she died, sat for five years in the backseat of her car mummified . A family member even tried to phone in 2012 to tell Farrenkopf her mother had died, but never got a response. Mortgage payments kept being deducted automatically from bank accounts flush with cash from Farrenkopf's job at ALLTEL Information Services, where she had once programmed banking software. It was not until the money ran out in 2013 and the bank foreclosed that Farrenkopf was finally discovered. The Detroit Free Press reports two repairmen, hired to patch a hole in the roof, found her in 2014, slumped in the backseat of the Jeep Liberty parked in her garage, mummified. Investigators later noted she was found surrounded by hundreds of unopened letters and several empty packs of cigarettes. She had $500 in cash in her pockets and a partially drank bottle of wine by her side. Detectives couldn't find a single fingerprint on the bottle. The home was in a state of chaos and disrepair - a far cry from the way her friend Joan Gill Strack said Farrenkopf liked to keep her home. Scene: Neighbors said they helped clear the driveway and mow the lawn while they believed Farrenkopf was still in the home, though many eventually moved away . World traveler: Farrenkopf traveled to England and Scotland, as well as around the United States, while working programming banking software for ALLTEL Information Services . 'Her house was well-kept, very clean, very tidy,' Strack said. 'She liked things picked up and ordered.' But police found the floors littered with empty soda bottles, more unopened mail, loose clothing and refuse. Black mold had invaded after the sump pump broke down, with dark spots dotting the walls. Strack, who had worked with Farrenkopf when the two lived in Little Rock, Arkansas, said she was 'fun to be around' and 'very, very good at her job,' and traveled to Scotland and England and throughout the US for work. Still, Farrenkopf was never extremely social. Siblings recalled long stretches of time where they wouldn't hear from Farrenkopf, who would often not  return phone calls. Fun and smart: Farrenkopf, pictured in this undated photo taken at a coworker's birthday celebration, was described as an excellent employee . Mysterious: Darryl Tillery, a neighbor, said he could not have known that the solitary Farrenkopf was in her garage for five years . Then a postcard or call came from a far-flung destination like Austria. 'Sometimes she would go, literally, for years without us hearing from her,' one sister, Jean LeBlanc, who lives in the Boston area near where Pia and her nine siblings grew up, told the Free Press. 'And then all of a sudden, she'd show up, so nobody ever thought anything about it.' Strack remembers how easily Farrenkopf could cut people out of her life when, after a friend showed up a few hours late for a party without calling, she immediately ended the relationship. 'Pia told her she was done with her,' Strack said. 'She didn't speak to her after that.' Strack said her own friendship with Farrenkopf ended in 2001, though she could provide few details beyond saying that they were together too much. Yet Farrenkopf was by all accounts still doing well. She continued working at Pontiac Fidelity National Information Services, where she was an 'exemplary employee,' management told the Free Press. She even began planning to open a small business of her own - a fitness business in nearby Waterford called Slender Lady. LeBlanc, who managed a Curves location in Massachusetts, agreed to travel to Texas with her sister in 2003, where the two attended a two-week seminar on health in preparation for Farrenkopf opening her business. Past due: Bills and letters would stack up in Farrenkopf's mailbox and then be returned to the Post Office unclaimed, a letter carried told the US Postal Inspector in 2014 . Towed: Authorities dragged out the 2003 green Jeep Liberty that once belonged to Farrenkopf where she was found dead and mummified . That plan was never fully realized. Court records showed the owners of the property sued Farrenkopf in 2005 for breaking her lease, though Farrenkopf never responded to the complaint. Credit card companies also initiated three lawsuits against her from 2005 to 2007 over unpaid bills, receiving judgments that added up to over $15,000. Her homeowners association placed liens totaling more than $2,000 against unpaid dues for the association. Farrenkopf wasn't always shut in her home, though it was often unclear where she was. Officers checked on her home in 2005, when neighbors told them they had not seen her in a month. Inside the home, police said they rescued her abandoned cat, Bungie, and white poodle, Baby, but while the pets were kept in a shelter - Baby was later adopted - there's no evidence Farrenkopf came to collect them. Sister Mary Mulligan looks over an image of Pia Farrenkopf in the 1983 Cardinal Cushing Central High School, an all-girls Catholic school yearbook in Boston (file photo) In May 2008, she resigned from her job under circumstances that are unclear, then in October of that year, she was cited for driving with a suspended license, expired plates and no proof of insurance. There's no record of Farrenkopf after the 2009 cash withdrawal, and investigators, who checked credit card statements and subpoenaed bank, phone and health records in a 'massively thorough' search say her cause of death is undeterminable. 'There was no trauma to body, so it only leads to a couple conclusions,' Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said. 'Either it was a medical situation that led to her death or something self-induced.' Medical records showed Farrenkopf, who was 44 when investigators believe she died, smoked more than a pack a day and in spite of being worried about her liver, drank regularly. Other family members dealt with cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney disease, according to that report. But the tank in the car still had two gallons of gas left, which led investigators to rule out carbon monoxide poisoning and her organs were so mummified, according to deputy medical examiner Dr Bernardino Pacris, making a toxicology report impossible. The case is now inactive, leaving relatives wondering what happened to their sister that would have ended her life quietly and out of sight. 'I just don't understand why anybody would sit in the backseat of their own car. And just stay there,' LeBlanc said. 'Why would you do that?'","Pia Farrenkopf of Pontiac was found mummified in the backseat of her car .

"An old crowd favorite at Minnesota Timberwolves' basketball games known famously as 'Jiggly Boy' made a special comeback to celebrate Kevin Garnett's return to the team. And he brought his moves. When the Target Center stadium's jumbotron first caught John Sweeney in the audience, he only gave the camera a couple of quick waves. It was a far cry from the beloved Jiggly boy of the 2003-04 season, when Sweeney was known to strip off his jersey and rip off his tank top and get down, with 'WOLVES' scribbled on his stomach and 'KG' for Garnett written on his arm. Scroll down for video . Crowd favorite John Sweeney, 49, brought back Jiggly boy for Kevin Garnett's welcome home game with the Minnesota Timberwolves . Sweeney first created Jiggly boy for the team's 2003-04 season (pictured), but hadn't been seen for 10 years . Sweeney got a text days from the team's game operations a couple of days before Garnett's return that said: 'KG is coming back. What about Jiggly?' The crowd went wild the minute Sweeney appeared on screen during the February 25 game against the Washington Wizards, with many instantly recognizing him despite the years that had passed. And the camera soon panned back to the 49-year-old dad, the announcer asking 'Wait a second, can we go back there?' One of Sweeney's sons tries to grab his dad's arm and pull him up to dance, and the camera held on him - an invitation and a tempt. But Sweeney shook his head no and encouraged his sons to dance instead. The crowd went wild the minute Sweeney appeared on screen during the February 25 game against the Washington Wizards, instantly recognizing him despite the years that had passed . As Usher's Yeah comes on Sweeney breaks out into dance, his sons flanking behind like backup dancers . After a couple of dips, Sweeney takes of his shirt to reveal KG written on his stomach, and 'Welcome home' written on his chest . The camera panned away again but the announcer wasn't ready to give up. 'Let's give it one more try,' he told the audience, who wouldn't get enough. As Usher's Yeah cames on, Sweeney finally relented. His sons pulled him out to the stadium's stairwell, where he still seemed hesitant. But then all of a sudden, Sweeney broke out into his famous moves, his sons flanking him from behind like backup dancers. Jiggly Boy was back. After a couple of dips, Sweeney took off his shirt to reveal KG written on his stomach, and 'welcome home' written on his chest. Then he gave the audience what they really want to see: body rolls. And Garnett didn't miss the show, giving Sweeney a salute. When Sweeney responded with an enthusiastic thumbs up, the basketball player tapped his heart to show his appreciation and gratitude. Garnett didn't miss the show. He first gives Sweeney a salute. When Sweeney responds with an enthusiastic thumbs up, the basketball player taps his heart to show his appreciation and gratitude .

It was the Timberwolves' game operations that asked Sweeney for a comeback. Sweeney told the Star Tribune he got a text days before the welcome home game that said: 'KG is coming back. What about Jiggly?' But although Sweeney, an improv comedian, may not be stage shy, after 10 years he said he now also has to consider his two sons, aged nine and 11. 'We had a good philosophical discussion on the car ride home,' he said. 'About when it's appropriate to take your shirt off.'","John Sweeney stripped off his jersey and body rolled to Usher's Yeah .

"Every election candidate should be forced to declare if they plan to take up second jobs outside Parliament, the sleaze watchdog has said. Lord Bew, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, warned trust in politics had been damaged and it would be 'foolish' for politicians to think they could ignore public anger. It comes as plans are being drawn up to curb rowdy behaviour in the House of Commons, with MPs facing bans from debates for heckling and swearing across the chamber. Politicians standing for election in May should declare that they plan to keep second jobs once they reach the Commons, the head of the sleaze watchdog has said . Trust in politicians was rocked again last month with the emergence of a new 'cash for access' scandal. Former foreign secretaries Jack Straw and Sir Malcolm Rifkind were suspended from their parties after being caught by hidden cameras discussing the possibility of working for a fictitious Chinese company. Veteran Tory Sir Malcolm also announced he would not stand for re-election in May's general election, after he claimed MPs from professional backgrounds could not be expected to live on their £67,060 salaries. Prime Minister David Cameron insisted that extra work can be fitted in alongside constituency duties and MPs voted down a Labour call for a ban on holding paid directorships, consultancies or trade union roles. Labour candidates have already been told they will not be allowed to hold directorships or be consultants if elected in May. Lord Bew, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, warned trust in politics had been damaged and it would be 'foolish' for politicians to think they could ignore public anger . MPs caught shouting and swearing across the Commons chamber face being banned under a Labour crackdown on bad behaviour. Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle wants the Speaker to be able to issue yellow and res cards to MPs who behave badly. After a first warning, a rowdy MP could be ejected for an hour while a repeat offence could see them miss three sessions. It comes after complaints about the boorish behaviour in the Commons and warnings it deters people from engaging in politics. Labour MP Sarah Champion has claimed male MPs are 'very good at gesticulating' about female MPs' breasts and bottoms as they tried to make speeches. Lord Bew told The Observer: 'All candidates for parliamentary elections should publish at nomination a register of interests, including paid jobs. 'What we would expect them to be transparent about is whether they expect to continue with those roles. If the public feels that they have been brought into a decision on this matter, that can only be helpful.' 'It would be foolish to ignore that we are in a new and worrying place. This is something that could be acted upon. If the parties decided to do it quickly, they could do. 'It is important for public confidence that the House of Commons is not seen to be influenced by the prospects of personal gain. We just can't allow this malaise to continue.' Lord Bew expressed frustration that Parliament had not taken better steps to clean up the system, despite consistent calls by the committee for measures such as a cap on outside earnings, another idea being examined by Labour. 'They are really riding for a fall, in our view, unless a more proactive approach is taken to these issues,' he said - saying that voters increasingly saw politics as 'an insider's game'. 'We have been arguing for change in and around lobbying, and we are frustrated we haven't been able to get Commons movement on it. We think that would have been helpful in the background to the current issues. 'We definitely believe parliament needs to take a more proactive approach.' An Opinium poll for the newspaper found significantly increased public support for increasing MPs' basic salaries in return for a ban on outside earnings - with the move now favoured by 40 per cent to 34 per cent. A year ago voters were mostly against the idea by 39 per cent to 36 per cent.","Sleaze watchdog Lord Bew says politicians are 'foolish' to ignore anger .

"Most of America has spent this winter shivering in a colder-than-usual polar plunge that's seen almost every state turned white and the Great Lakes freeze over. But in Alaska, residents are wondering what's become of the blizzards and arctic lows that usually characterize the northernmost state. The biggest city, Anchorage, is so unseasonably warm that a winter festival could only go ahead after trucks drove in snow from a stockpile, and hide it under PVC to stop it from melting away. No-show snow: Streets in Anchorage were snowless (left) for a winter festival, while volunteers (right) had to pile up snow and cover it with PVC so a sculpting competition could go ahed. The rest of the U.S. has had a frigid winter . We took your winter! This was the scene Saturday on Boston Common, the heart of a city buried in snow - prompting the envy of Alaskans . Digging out: Boston's motorists found their cars swamped by snow, while the usually frigid land of Alaska was left hardly touched . Want some of this? In the Massachusetts capital, huge piles of snow have emerged as authorities struggle to find anywhere to put snow taken off the roads . Bemused residents even took to asking Boston - which has been swamped with more than 100 inches of snow in a record-breaking winter - if they can have their winter back. Speaking to the Boston Globe, Anchorage-dweller Danielle Crelley, 19, said said: 'This is the worst winter ever... We can’t even go sledding. I just want to build a snowman.' Another, store owner Nina Walker, proposed a trade between Massachusetts and Alaska. She said: 'You give us your snow, and we’ll give you the Palins.' Cameras from local station KTUU showed the snow-less scenes in the city. Their comments follow an unusual set-up for the annual Fur Rendezvous festival, in which Anchorage city authorities had to spread a thin coating of snow from diminishing stockpile to create a winter feel. Sunday highs in the city are set to be above freezing, while Wednesday is predicted rain. A dog sledding race, which usually winds through the Anchorage streets, has been relocated 260 miles north, where there is still enough snow. It was the first time the event had to move since it began in 1946. Wanna trade? One Alaskan said that Boston was welcome to Sarah Palin and her family - if they can restore winter to Anchorage . Winter of two Americas: Climate figures showed that this winter has seen western states experience unseasonable warmth, while the east shivered. Alaska has been warmed by the same phenomenon heating California . Speaking to the KTVA station, former organizer Gary Huffard said: 'This weather is as crazy as it can get!'. He later encouraged people to come down to the event's funfair because, for once, 'you can enjoy the carnival without turning blue'. It comes as cold weather records continue to fall across the country, with February declared the coldest month in New York for 81 years. Boston was predicted still more snow Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, adding to its current total of more than 100 inches since winter began. The average temperature in the New York City over the last four weeks has been 24°F - 11 degrees below normal. New York joins other metropolitan areas such as Chicago and Pittsburgh, which have also experienced their most frigid February in decades. As the mercury continues to plummet, ice breakers are being deployed by the US Coast Guard to create ferry and shipping lanes along the Hudson River in New York and the Delaware in Philadelphia. Many already knew in their bones it was true - but official figures have now confirmed that for some parts of the country, February was the coldest month in history. In New York, the cities of Buffalo, Syracuse, Binghamton and Ithaca all scored their lowest ever averages in more than a lifetime. In Buffalo the February average was 10.9°F, beating the 1934 record of 11.4°F. Syracuse was colder still, with an average of just 9°F. Hartford, Connecitcut, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Portland, Maine also set records. Caribou in Maine had an average of just 2.5°F. While Boston has been colder in February before, it has never been snowier. Its 64.8 inches in February smashed the old record of 41.6. If it managers just another 5.6 inches, the winter will officially be the snowiest ever. Total snowfall for the season is way above normal across the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service. As of Febreuary 26, Worcester, Massachusetts had 108.6 inches, compared to a normal snowfall of 49.9 inches. However, meteorologists at the Northeast Regional Climate Center said the record winter is just down to luck. One said: 'We can't point to anything specific... It's just the way the jet stream bulged and set up. It's random, like a deal of cards. Sometimes you're dealt a royal flush, sometimes you get nothing.' Everywhere else: Emily Martinez makes a snow angel on freshly fallen snow as a a storm out of the Pacific Northwest brings snow to the San Bernardino Mountains on Saturday, in Green Valley Lake, California . New Mexi-snow: Richard Hample of Albuquerque took out his skis to get some exercise near Silver and Harvard on Saturday morning . Ploughing through: Travelers walk with their luggage to the airport due to impassable roads in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Saturday . A lone duck swims in a small creek in Hurst, Texas, on Saturday. The area received almost two inches of snow and freezing rain . A horse looks for grass underneath the snow and ice in a field in Reno, Texas, west of Fort Worth, on Saturday . According to The New York Times, it has not been this frigid in New York since February 1934. That month it averaged 19.9°F. On February 9 of that year, the mercury sank 15 degrees below zero - the lowest daily reading in the city's history. Jay Engle, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, told The Times: 'It was like the most sick month you can think of.' As the records continue to tumble - with almost 500 daily low-points being beaten in the last month - forecasters predict there's more on the way. Record-breaking: Ice chunks form underneath the snow-covered Brooklyn Bridge in New York City at the end of the coldest February in more than 80 years - and two more snow storms are expected to hit the region over the next few days . Frozen: The mercury has not fallen this low in the city since 1934. Pictured are fire fighter working to tackle a blaze in sub-zero climes . Duties continue: The tug Arabian Sea pushes a barge through the icy waters of the Hudson River on Friday, near Rhinecliff, in Upstate New York. With the prolonged cold winter weather, the Coast Guard has been busy clearing shipping lanes . This next winter storm will begin to take shape Saturday in California as a disturbance digs into the Southwest, bringing rain in the lower elevations and snow in the mountains. Snow, sleet and ice will then spread eastward across the Plains, Midwest and Northeast through midweek. Texas has already seen six inches of snow as a result of the storm, with Oklahoma - seven inches - and New Mexico - one foot - also suffering from the wintry downpours. Boston's all-time winter weather record is also at risk, after 102 inches of snow fell on the city in the space of a month. Insurance companies in the area are getting a historic number of claims from homeowners whose properties have been damaged by the weight of the snow. Experts say that popping, creaking, or cracking noises can be signs of a stressed roof that could be about to collapse. Residents are warned to leave immediately in those cases. Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, told the Boston Globe: 'If you are hearing loud cracking, like cracking wood, there is something going on up there. But if it’s just a variety of sounds, don’t automatically get everyone out of the building.' Wintry conditions also caused chaos across the southeastern United States this week as the area saw an unprecedented amount of snowfall. Wet, heavy snow snapped tree limbs and cut power lines in North Carolina leaving more than 200,000 Duke Energy customers without electricity at one point. Nearly a foot of snow fell in parts of Alabama - closing roads, schools and businesses. A volunteer who works with the National Weather Service measured 11 inches of snow in the Guntersville area in the morning. Authorities said 8.5 inches of snow fell in the Athens area, with similar amounts reported in other towns and cities across northern Alabama. School's out: Children make snow angels in Richardson, Texas. A winter storm that dumped several inches of snow in Texas on Friday closed schools, snarled travel and forced a main highway into Oklahoma to shut down after nearly 20 vehicles slid off the road .

"A friend of Jihadi John, unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi (pictured) has used the Human Rights Act to avoid being deported . A friend of Jihadi John accused of organising al-Qaeda terror atrocities has used the Human Rights Act to avoid being deported despite being deemed a threat to national security. The terror suspect, originally from Ethiopia, is believed to be a leading member of al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia. He was accused of playing a part in the 2005 plot to blow up the London Underground  and is  an associate of ISIS executioner Jihadi John - unmasked this week as Mohammed Emwazi. But the deportation case against the man, who can only be identified as J1, collapsed after a five-year court battle when a British diplomat admitted the system was not working. Lawyers argued the man's human rights would be breached if he was sent back to Ethiopia, where he could face detention and possible torture. The terror suspect is now living in London and has also been linked to two al-Qaeda extremists killed in US drone attacks in Somalia. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government has 'serious questions' to answer about the case and questioned why he wasn't placed under special controls. She told the Telegraph: 'This man (J1) has been linked to planned terror attacks, associated with known terrorists, and identified as a risk to the UK. So why didn't Theresa May at least put him on a TPIM in 2013 when he was released from immigration detention? 'And what is being done now? Are they reconsidering TPIMs, deportation assurances or prosecution options? Or do they no longer believe he is a significant threat?' A TPIM is a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure which allows authorities to impose a curfew and limit communications on someone they 'reasonably believe' is involved in terror activities. The terror suspect has been accused of being a leading member of an al-Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia, pictured are hundreds of al-Shabaab fighters . He was accused of playing a part in the 2005 plot to blow up the London Underground, pictured is CCTV footage of failed July 21 bomber Hussein Osman (circled in green) at Clapham Junction train station . J1 has been accused by the Government of being a senior organiser for al-Shabaab. Court papers disclose that 'on the morning of the failed London bombings of 21 July 2005, a mobile telephone which the appellant (J1) now accepts was used by him, was in contact with a telephone used by one of the bombers, Hussein Osman'. The Government argued he was a threat to national security and should be deported, court papers show. They claimed he was an associate of Londoners Mohammed Sakr and Bilal Berjawi, both of whom died in US drone strikes in Somalia. Sakr and Emwazi were friends and Sakr attended Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood along with Emwazi. It was revealed this week that Emwazi was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for  al Shabab. MI5 was also aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014. It was revealed  that Jihadi John was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for al Shabab, pictured with British journalist David Haines . They had a file on Emwazi from at least 2009, when he was stopped as he arrived in Tanzania. British agents suspected that he was trying to travel to Somalia to join up with al-Shabaab, an accusation that Emwazi denied. He was never charged with a terror offence. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government has 'serious questions' to answer about the case . Michael Adebolajo, convicted of Lee Rigby's murder, is also believed to be linked to the Somali group. The case has heightened calls for the Human Rights Act to be scrapped. It collapsed when Anthony Layden, the British diplomat in charge of negotiating his deportation, admitted the system was not working. He is believed to have blamed the Home Office for the failure. This comes as the Government admitted that hundreds of ISIS extremists like Emwazi have been free to leave Britain because they were not being properly monitored by the security services. A spokesman for the Home Office said yesterday: 'Control orders were not working and were being struck down by the courts. 'TPIMs have been endorsed by the courts, counter-terrorism reviewers, the police, and the Security Service. Following a review of the powers available to manage the terrorist threat, the range of measures available under the TPIM Act is being extended, including a measure to allow TPIM subjects to be relocated to different parts of the country.' Michael Adebolajo, convicted of Lee Rigby's murder, is also believed to be linked to the Somali group al Shabab .","Terror suspect accused of planning attacks has avoided deportation .

"John Kerry tried to defuse the ongoing row over Benjamin Netanyahu's forthcoming speech to Congress - despite fears it will affect negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program. The Secretary of State said he did not want the Israeli's Prime Minister's forthcoming address to a joint session of Congress to become 'some great political football'. Netanyahu's speech, organized by John Boehner, the Republican House Speaker, was set up without the blessing of the Obama administration - and comes as the White House tries to strike a deal over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Scroll down for video . Play ball: Secretary of State John Kerry, right, tried to stop a feud over Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu (left) escalating in an interview Sunday . On his way: Netanyahu is pictured above with his wife Sarah, leaving Tel Aviv for the address to Congress on Tuesday . It is feared that such a public show of closeness to Israel, a firm foe of Iran, could dash Obama's hopes in the negotiations, in which he hopes to curb the nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. Kerry played up U.S.-Israeli unity in an interview on Sunday for ABC's This Week show, insisting 'the prime minister of Israel is welcome to speak in the United States, obviously. 'And we have a closer relationship with Israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history.' There is, however, a clear different in policy between Netanyahu and the White House - with the Israeli leader expected to urge Congress to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions by keeping up the current sanctions regime. Congress wants to keep the sanctions regime strong, but the President has said he would veto any new penalties to preserve the negotiations. Kerry reiterated Washington's determination to pursue negotiations with Iran, saying the White House deserved 'the benefit of the doubt' to see if a nuclear deal could be reached. By accepting an invitation from the Republican party to . address Congress on Tuesday, the Israeli leader infuriated the . Obama administration, which said it was not told of the speech . before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol. Solemn: Netanyahu has claimed his visit is above the political, and says he is standing up for all Jews by visiting Washington. He is pictured above praying at Jerusalem's Western Wall . But both sides have tried to downplay the rift. In remarks on Saturday at Jersualem's Western Wall, . Netanyahu said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to say . that I respect U.S. President Barack Obama.' He added that he . believed in the strong bilateral ties and said, 'that strength . will prevail over differences of opinion, those in the past and . those yet to come.' Netanyahu did not repeat those remarks as he departed on . Sunday. The Israeli prime minister, who is running for . re-election in a March 17 ballot, has framed his visit as being . above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for . all Jews. 'I'm going to Washington on a fateful, even historic, . mission,' he said as he boarded his plane in Tel Aviv. 'I feel . that I am an emissary of all Israel's citizens, even those who . do not agree with me, and of the entire Jewish people,' he told . reporters. Not popular: Anti-Israeli demonstrator are pictured above protesting in D.C. ahead of Netanyahu's address . Netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge Congress to . approve new sanctions against Iran despite Obama's pledge to . veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks. U.S. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the Iran . diplomacy, and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate . election stunt that will play well with voters back home. While White House and Israeli officials insist that key . areas of cooperation, from counter-terrorism to intelligence to . cyber security, will remain unaffected, the divide over the Iran . talks has shaped up as the worst in decades. Previously Israel has always been careful to navigate . between the Republican and Democratic camps. The planned . address, however, has driven a rare wedge between Netanyahu's . government and some congressional Democrats. Some two dozen or . more of them plan to boycott the speech, according to unofficial . estimates. Iran itself has weighed in on the speech as well. Speaking in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister . Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Netanyahu of trying to undermine . the nuclear talks in order to distract from the Palestinians' unresolved bid for an independent state. 'Netanyahu is opposed to any sort of solution,' Zarif said. Meanwhile a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, . said the 'politicized' nature of his visit threatened 'what . undergirds the strength of the relationship'. As one former U.S. official put it: 'Sure, when Netanyahu . calls the White House, Obama will answer. But how fast will he . be about responding (to a crisis)?'","Secretary of State tried to downplay rift over Israeli prime minister's speech .

"Ricky Haruna (pictured) whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from the Met Police after complaining about racism . A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of. She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints. She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.' The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London. She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'. She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'. She said: 'After that I was harassed and ­ victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.' She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.' She was sacked seven years after she was pictured alongside Kate Middleton - then Prince William's girlfriend - and who she regularly escorted. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud which she was later cleared of. She is pictured holding the two commendations which she was awarded by the force in 2007 . Although she cannot speak about the case as she is now re-employed by the force, her lawyer Lawrence Davies said: 'She was devastated to be unlawfully dismissed and elated to be reinstated. 'She very much looks forward to rebuilding her career in the Met Police,' he told the Sunday Mirror. He previously said: 'When PC Haruna reported the bullying in the workplace, rather than support her, the Met's response was to target her and sack her.' PC Haruna joined the Met in January 2002 after graduating in sociology and criminology from Goldsmiths, ­University of London. She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Her disciplinary process was prompted by a public complaint regarding alleged criminal conduct which was investigated by the Directorate of Professional Standards. 'It is only right that such complaints are investigated, however, the steps taken by the MPS in this instance will be reviewed in the light of the PAT findings.'

There were an estimated 20,000 on the streets, while organisers claimed there were as many as 70,000. Demonstrations on this scale are rarely seen in Russia, where the government does not often give approval to mass protests. Hundreds had already planned to rally against Vladimir Putin's today, but this protest was abandoned to instead demonstrate against Mr Nemtsov's death in an apparent 'contract hit' in the shadow of the Kremlin. Russian riot police, armed with batons, were observing the protest which remained peaceful. The mood was sombre, with heavy security as police helicopters flew overhead and police boats patrolled the river. Families, the old and young walked slowly, with many carrying portraits of Mr Nemtsov, who was shot dead while walking home from a restaurant in central Moscow on Friday night. 'If we can stop the campaign of hate that's being directed at the opposition, then we have a chance to change Russia. If not then we face the prospect of mass civil conflict,' Gennady Gudkov, an opposition leader, said before the march. 'The authorities are corrupt and don't allow any threats to them to emerge. Boris was uncomfortable for them.' The march follows last night's demonstration on the bridge where Mr Nemtsov was shot, with scores of mourners gathering to lay flowers.

CCTV footage showed the Russian opposition leader walking along the Great Moskvoretsky Bridge in Moscow, before a person is seen approaching him from the shadows. The gunman then makes a quick escape in a car nearby. In the days before his death, Mr Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, said he feared being killed by the Russian leader. 'I'm afraid Putin will kill me. I believe that he was the one who unleashed the war in the Ukraine. I couldn't dislike him more,' he said in an interview with Russia's Sobesednik news website. He also revealed his 86-year-old mother's fears that he was be assassinated because of his outspoken views. '""When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that."" She was completely serious,' he added. Opposition activists also blamed the Russian President for his death, claiming they were in 'no doubt' it was politically motivated.

The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River . Marina Litvinenko described news of the veteran liberal politician's shooting as 'absolutely devastating'. She was asked on BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme whether she believed the shooting of Mr Nemtsov near the Kremlin in Moscow was linked to her husband's poisoning. She replied: 'It's a different way to kill a person, but a way to present that anybody who will try to say something against us will be killed.' Ilya Yashin, a friend and fellow opposition leader, said he hoped the killing would not frighten people. 'Essentially it is an act of terror. It is a political murder aimed at frightening the population, or the part of the population that supported Nemtsov and did not agree with the government. I hope we won't get scared, that we will continue what Boris was doing. 'It was President Putin who created this atmosphere of hate in our country, the atmosphere of intolerance, which one way or another materialized in the bullet that killed my friend Boris Nemtsov.' Meanwhile the Kremlin, which uncharacteristically allowed the protest to go ahead, is investigating whether the killing is linked to the conflict in Ukraine. National investigators who answer to the Russian leader say they are pursuing several lines of inquiry, including the possibility that Mr Nemtsov, a Jew, was killed by radical Islamists or that the opposition killed him to blacken Putin's name. Putin's opponents say such suggestions show the cynicism of Russia's leaders as they whip up nationalism, hatred and anti-Western hysteria to rally support for his policies on Ukraine and deflect blame for an economic crisis. 'It is a blow to Russia. If political views are punished this way, then this country simply has no future,' Sergei Mitrokhin, an opposition leader, said of Mr Nemtsov's murder. Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55. His 87-year-old mother Dina had a premonition that her son would be killed, according to the politician. He told earlier this month how his mother warned him: 'When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.' Nemtsov studied physics at State University of Gorky and earned a PhD in Physics and Mathematics. In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, Nemtsov organised a protest movement in his hometown, which prevented the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the region. The liberal reformer rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin and became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin. Nemtsov first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British premier Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. She praised his market reforms after visiting Nizhny Novgorod where as governor in the early 1990s he led spearheaded reforms. The father-of-four, 55, was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail in January 2011 after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. He was a prominent and vocal critic of Mr Putin and wrote a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and his inner circle to corruption. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. He has written more than 60 academic publications about quantum physics, thermodynamics and acoustics and  designed n of antennas for space apparatuses. Jewish advocacy website AJC named Nemtsov as one of the most prominent Jews in Russia thanks to his mother's heritage. In his 1997 memoir, The Provincial Man, Nemtsov revealed that he was baptised Russian Orthodox in secret. He leaves behind his wife Raisa Akhmetovna and four children.","More than 20,000 march through Moscow to protest against the killing of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov .

"Anthony Brumwell (pictured), from Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, was jailed for three years and two months after he spent £15,000 of his grandmother's savings . A man with an addiction to chat lines has been jailed after using his grandmother's savings to fund his habit. Anthony Brumwell, who has previously defrauded other members of his family, spent £15,000 of his grandmother's savings and extended her overdraft. He left the 74-year-old at risk of eviction due to rent arrears that accrued through his activities, Durham Crown Court heard. Her life insurance was also cancelled as her accounts dried up, leaving her with 'significant worry and confusion'. Ian Mullarkey, prosecuting, said the issue came to light when a £5,000 loan application was posted to Brumwell's father, despite carrying the defendant's phone number. Other family members quickly checked his grandmother's finances and realised what was happening. Her reaction was: 'He's cleaned me out again.' While the 31-year-old was on bail for theft and fraud against his grandmother he turned his attention to employer Start Energy, for whom he was account manager. Brumwell, from Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, set up a bogus £10,400 'deal' through the Peterlee-based business for an electricity meter for another company. But he gave his own bank details on invoices for payments. Mr Mullarkey said this caused Start Energy major difficulties as the other company cancelled a large contract, resulting in the loss of four jobs. The court heard his financial difficulties began when he started using premium rate chat lines as a teenager, taking out payday loans to try to meet his debts along with the cost of everyday living. Shaun Dryden, mitigating, said Brumwell was spending up to £1,000 a month on the chat lines, which can cost between 41p and £2.50 per minute. Judge Simon Hickey told 31-year-old Brumwell at Durham Crown Court (above): 'Your actions are said to have broken your grandmother's heart' He said: 'This is on top of bills and rent, and there is a point where he could not fund what he was spending.' Brumwell admitted charges of fraud against his grandmother and employer, plus attempted theft. Judge Simon Hickey jailed Brumwell for three years and two months. He said: 'Your actions are said to have broken your grandmother's heart. 'The tragedy is that that generous lady would have given you the money if you asked.' Judge Hickey added that, given the defendant's circumstances, compensation was 'unrealistic'.","Anthony Brumwell given three years, two months at Durham Crown Court .

"A design flaw has left a fighter jet that's part of the Pentagon's most expensive project ever incapable of carrying the military's most highly advanced bombs. The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load, according to an Inside Defense report. The fighter jet is the centerpiece of the British Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier-based fleet, and dozens have already been ordered. Trouble in the skies: The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load (file photo) The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the HMS Prince of Wales. Though it's mandated that an F-35B jet, designed by Lockheed Martin, hold eight SDB IIs in the bay, only four reportedly fit. The problem will not affect the Royal Navy's consignment of F-35Bs, however, as its aircraft are to carry different weapons. The F-35 program will reportedly cost more than £2.5billion over the next decade. The F-35B is one of three variants of the F-35 program - and it's proved the most expensive and most troublesome to get off the ground. The F-35B features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings - like a helicopter. The F-35 in general - and the F-35B in particular - has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays. The queen unveils HMS Queen Elizabeth with Prince Philip in a ceremony on the Firth of Forth in July. The ship will be launched for sea trials in 2016 . The Ministry of Defence has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth(pictured) and the HMS Prince of Wales . Since work began in 2007, an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete . Artists impressions of the ship's flight deck released before construction was underway. When completed the vessel will have enough room for dozens of aircraft . Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program, said in an Inside Defense interview last week that changes are being made to the jet so it can be released on schedule. DellaVedova also said that Lockheed Martin will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015. 'This is not a new issue to us,' DellaVedova told Inside Defense. 'We've been working with the SDB II program office and their contractors since 2007. 'The fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support SDB II that have already been incorporated into production F-35 aircraft. 'These minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing SDB [II] developments.' Inside Defense reported that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external SDB IIs are in fact meant to go on the F-35B. An MoD spokesman said: 'The Small Diameter Bomb II is not part of the UK's planned weapon inventory for the Lightning II. The programme to integrate weapons from the UK inventory onto Lightning II is on track to deliver initial operating capability as planned in December 2018.' Bombs away: The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, defense contractor Raytheon says . Defense contractor Raytheon is behind the SDB II bomb. The company proclaims on its website 'SDB II can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets, reducing aircrews' time in harm's way. 'The weapon's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous, larger weapons that required multiple jets. 'SDB II's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers, as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions.' The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, the company says. The SDB II weapons system is fully accommodated by both the F-35A - the Air Force version - and F-35C - the US Navy version, company executive Jeff White told Inside Defense. White told the news outlet 'I think it's just the B. When we did our fit checks on the JSF, the A and the C basically had the same bay.' 353 F-35Bs are being bought by the United States Marines Corps, Inside Defense reported. According to the news outlet, approximately 17,000 weapons will come from the United States Air Force's SDB II program.","F-35B is slated to be used by the Royal Navy on HMS Queen Elizabeth .

Painter and decorator Mr Black, 48, noticed that instead of saying 'find the odd one out', the toy says 'f**k you? odd one out'. 'I was cooking in the kitchen when I heard him saying 'f*** you,' he said. 'I was disgusted, I thought he had learned it at nursery. 'But then when I was playing with him I realised that it was Peppa Pig that was teaching him it - I was very upset.

'He can say ""mum"", ""dad"", ""please"", ""thank you"", and sadly ""f**k you"". 'We've been buying Peppa Pig toys for our kids for years but will never buy them again.' Job centre advisor Mrs Black, 34, said she was shocked when relatives questioned whether Amari had learned the swear word from his parents. 'I'm devastated. He got in trouble at my mum's for saying it and told me off because she thought he was learning it from us at home,' she said. 'He's definitely banned from playing with it now. 'We would never use that language at all, let alone in front of an impressionable child. 'I want to encourage him to talk as much as possible, but it's hard because whenever I tell him he's doing well, he responds with 'f*** you'.'

"The doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was taken on an emotional ‘last farewell’ fly-past of the pilot’s home island of Penang before being deliberately landed on the water and sinking intact thousands of miles away, according to a British pilot who claims to have identified its final resting place. The unusual overflying of Penang is ‘perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator’ he says. The theory of Simon Hardy, a senior Boeing 777 captain with a major commercial airline, has gained support from one of Britain’s top flight safety specialists, David Learmount of the respected Flight International magazine and flightglobal website. Scroll down for video . Missing: MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12.41am on March 8 2014 for an approximate six-hour flight to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew . The unusual overflying of Penang, pictured, where the captain of the lost Boeing is from, is ‘perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator’ Captain Hardy spent six months analysing the flight data of the stricken aircraft, which disappeared almost a year ago with 239 people on board, in a bid to solve the mystery. He has concluded that the search in the vast Indian ocean being conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Board (ATSB) is about 100 nautical miles away from the where the aircraft actually is. He also believes the riddle of the aircraft’s odd dog-leg flight path immediately after take-off from Kuala Lumpar is down to the aircraft performing a final ‘fly-past’ of Malaysia’s Penang island to allow someone to have ‘a last emotional look.’ Captain Hardy notes from his research that the captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor. Details are reported in the Sunday Times. Captain Hardy says that after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 16.41 GMT on March 7 last year, flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control at a point over the China Sea where four flight information regions intersect. The last verbal contact had been at 19.19 and the captain’s was the last voice heard. Captain Hardy said the flight did something ‘quite remarkable’ by flying in and out of the airspace of Malaysia and Thailand eight times noting: ’I’ve never seen anything like that but it is a good way to cause confusion between the controllers.’ The captain of the lost Boeing 777-200, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, left, came from Penang, while First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid was from Selangor, right . Missing: Searchers scouring huge swathes of the world's oceans for the jet have so far found no sign of it . After flying along the border the passenger jet performed a sharp u-turn towards Penang, one of three turns made in quick succession. 'It took me months to work out what this was. 'The clue was Ayers Rock,’ he said referring to the giant natural feature and landmark in the heart of Australia. 'I have done the same manoeuvre there, to look down and get a great view. Somebody was taking a last emotional look at Penang.’ He explained: ’I thought of this at 5am, went downstairs and researched where the air crew were from.’ Noting that pilot Shah was from Penang while co-pilot Hamid was from Selangor, he said: ‘Someone did a nice long turn and looked down on Penang. It’s perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator.’ Military radar gave the last fix of the flight at 18.22 GMT heading South towards the navigation waypoint Anoko. It then flew straight for thousands of miles before, it is believed, ending up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Australia. Australian investigators believe the plane crashed. But Captain Hardy believes it was deliberately landed on the water and then sank intact close to a trench in the sea – explaining why no wreckage has ever been found. Australian investigators said they had been in touch with Captain Hardy and described his theory as ‘credible.’ Flight magazine’s Mr Learmount said: ‘Since Capt Simon Hardy revealed in Flightglobal/Flight International his calculations about where Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is likely to have come to rest, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau – leading the MH370 search team – has spoken at length to him. ‘Despite worldwide interest in his work, nobody – yet – has suggested his calculations are anything but logical and mathematically sound.’","Theory of Simon Hardy, a senior Boeing 777 captain, has gained support from one of Britain’s top flight safety specialists .

"The Duke Cambridge was blessed with good luck this weekend after he submitted his head to the jaws of a Chinese-style lion on his tour of Japan. Prince William was visiting a coastal area in the north of the country that was one of the areas worst hit by the 2011 tsunami. The town of Onagawa was severely damaged on March 11 four years ago, when a huge 28ft wave swept across the land after it was triggered by an earthquake. Scroll down for video . Prince William is greeted by a lion dancer during his visit to the Chime of Hope Shopping Centre in Onagawa, Miyagi. It is said to be good luck to put your head in the jaws of the lion . Prince William meets another of the Chinese Lions who were waiting at the Chime Of Hope shopping centre to greet him on his trip to northern Japan . The royal arrived in the neighbouring city of Ishinomaki this morning and spent some time at a local newspaper, which produced handwritten copies when the electricity went down after the disaster struck. Hiroyuki Takeuchi, who was editor of the paper of the time, has since established a children's newspaper, allowing younger members of the community to tell their own stories about the disaster, as well as reporting on everyday events. He then headed to a hilltop in Ishinomaki that overlooks an area nicknamed 'The Bay Of Destruction', in reference to how much of the land was laid to waste after the wave. William paid his respects and presented a bouquet of flowers at a shrine for the 3,300 residents of the area who lost their lives in the tragedy. Prince William looks at handwritten newspapers in the days after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami to keep vital community communication links going as he visits the Ishinimaki newspaper office .

William looks out over the Bay Of Destruction, which was almost completely destroyed by the disaster . Thousands more were injured locally in the disaster and 20,000 also lost their homes in the incident. The last stop in his four-day tour of Japan was of particular importance to William - he had insisted that he visit areas hit by the tsunami on his first ever trip to the country. While the people of the country have been working hard to rebuild their lives after the disaster, much of the worst-hit areas are still badly affected. The prince is greeted by local children as he visits areas hit by the tsunami in Ishinomaki . William waves to wellwishers as he arrives at the Chime of Hope Shopping Centre in Onagawa . During his visit to the town of Onagawa in the afternoon, William visited a market called the Chime Of Hope that has been completely rebuilt after it was demolished in 2011. The second-in-line to the throne met with shopkeepers and residents from the new neighbourhood shopping centre, which has re-established 30 businesses from a tailor's shop, to a greengrocer, cafe and an artist's design studio. Hundreds of locals turned out to greet the 32 year old, with many waving Union Jack flags. At the end of the visit, William rang the Bell of Hope, which originally hung in in Onagawa Station and was washed away during the tsunamii, but was later found in the harbour. Thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the second-in-line to the British throne .

"The boyfriend of EastEnders star Gillian Taylforth has claimed his head 'exploded like an egg' when he was pushed into a police van during her drink-driving arrest. Dave Fairbairn was a passenger in the actress' car when police detained her on a night out last month, prompting a clash with officers which led to him receiving a penalty for public disorder. Now Mr Fairbairn, 59, is said to have appealed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission claiming he was assaulted. Row: Gillian Taylforth's boyfriend Dave Fairbairn (pictured) was a passenger in her car when police detained her on a night out last month - prompting a clash with officers which led to him allegedly being assaulted . Dave Fairbairn (left), the boyfriend of soap star Gillian Taylforth (with him and right), said police assaulted him . He told Lewis Panther of the Sunday People: 'The copper who kept telling me to stop swearing pushed my head hard. And all I could see is a girder come towards me. 'My head just exploded like an egg. It went everywhere. Because it was a white floor you could see how soaked it was. I was covered. 'If I had seen someone covered in that much blood it would have been straight to hospital... They took me straight to a police cell.' Photographs of him leaving a police station later appeared to show a trickle of dried blood on his forehead, with smears around his nose and right eye. The pair were stopped at 1.25am on a Saturday morning, five miles from her £900,000 home in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. Mr Fairbairn said officers knew Ms Taylforth's name as soon as they tapped on the window of her car, which he said she was moving a few metres to avoid being clamped. As she was arrested he insisted he swore just once - saying 'for f***'s sake' at the general situation and not at any individual officer. Accused: The EastEnders actress was charged with drink driving and appeared at Stevenage Magistrates' Court last week (pictured). Her boyfriend - who received a fixed penalty - insisted he swore just once . Scene: The pair were stopped in the early hours in Hertford (pictured), five miles from the actress' home . But he riled police by filming his girlfriend's arrest on his phone, Mr Fairbairn claimed. The former stockbroker - who was jailed for 15 years in 2003 over one of Britain's biggest ecstasy-smuggling plots - was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and taken to a police station. He was released after Hertfordshire Police served him with a fixed penalty notice, which he said he is appealing. His girlfriend, who has made a surprise return to EastEnders as Kathy Beale after a nine-year break, was also arrested and was charged with drink driving. She appeared before Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Monday and was granted unconditional bail ahead of a full hearing in May. A Hertfordshire police spokesman said earlier: 'The 59-year-old was arrested at 1.25am on February 7 in Fore Street, Hertford. She has been charged with drink driving.' The actress started dating Mr Fairbairn in 2012 after they met through friends following the breakdown of her 23-year relationship with ex-fiancé Geoff Knights. Best known for playing Kathy Beale in Eastenders before her character vanished in 2006, Ms Taylforth has also appeared in The Bill and the 2013 series of Celebrity Big Brother. She made a surprise return to Albert Square to mark EastEnders' 30th anniversary and is now due to return to the show in a fuller role. Surprise return: Ms Taylforth's character Kathy Beale has reappeared in the soap after a nine-year hiatus . Back on screen: Her character was reunited with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) in a live episode . Her boyfriend was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2003 after being found guilty of plotting to import and supply Class A drugs at Bristol Crown Court. He served seven years behind bars. At the time of the court case, it was the biggest drugs raid in history after police found 839,500 ecstasy tablets worth an estimated £7.5million. Mr Fairbairn has since been diagnosed with prostate cancer, the same disease which killed Ms Taylforth's ex-partner four years after they broke up. He is already suing a different police force over a similar argument in 2013 when he was accused of drink driving on the M62 in Merseyside, he told the Sunday People. His solicitor could not be reached for comment. A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a complaint was received, via the Independent Police Complaints Commission, on February 24, and is being assessed by the Beds, Cambs and Herts Professional Standards Unit.'

And John Christopher Smith, 23, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle during the hearing at Cambridge Crown Court last week. Following the case, Detective Sergeant Stuart Dolan said the gang caused 'misery' for the victims of their crime. 'This was an organised gang who targeted homes in order to steal vehicles to ultimately use as getaway vehicles after smashing into shops and banks to steal ATMs,' he said. 'They caused misery for the burglary victims as well as causing a huge amount of damage to shops and banks across the region. 'This case shows we will relentlessly pursue those we suspect of being involved in organised crime and continue to put them before the courts.'

"We all know we should be eating the recommended ‘five a day’ of fruit and veg. Now there’s a host of exotic superfruits that are said to help reverse the skin’s ageing process, boost energy levels and even fight disease. MANGOSTEEN . Native to South-East Asia, mangosteen is also known as the ‘queen of fruit’, because Queen Victoria offered a reward to anyone who could deliver some to her palace. Perhaps she’d heard about its amazing health benefits, which range from healthy joints to improving the immune system. Mangosteen (pictured) is also known as the ‘queen of fruit’ and is native to South-East Asia . ‘Mangosteen has been touted for its high content of xanthone compounds, which studies have shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties,’ says Naomi Mead, lead nutritionist and founder of nutrition clinic Food First. Mangosteen is also good for acne, PMS and younger-looking skin. Buy your mangosteen in liquid form from Holland & Barrett (£2.45) or Planet Organic (£2.75), or order a bottle of capsules from biovea.com (£17.20). PITAYA . More commonly known as dragon fruit, this is mild- tasting, but packs a powerful nutritional punch. Pitaya (pictured) is more commonly known as dragon fruit and although it's mild-tasting it has high nutritional values . ‘Pitaya is rich in vitamin C, which has been repeatedly proven to protect against auto-immune diseases, heart problems and even the signs of ageing skin. It contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation and improve cell function,’ says Mead. Ocado stocks it in fresh (£2.99) and tea (£2.99) form. GAC . The spiky outer layer of this vine fruit might be poisonous, but the edible arils, or extra seeds, hidden inside are used across South-East Asia because of their fantastic red colour. Gac fruit (pictured) has a spikey outer layer which might be poisonous but the extra seeds inside are edible . The fruit contains huge amounts of beta-carotene and lycopene, known for their medicinal properties. ‘Research has found the concentration of lycopene in gac to be around ten times higher than in tomatoes and carrots,’ says Mead. ‘Several studies, including research from the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences at Portsmouth University, suggest lycopene helps protect against cancer of the lung, stomach and prostate.’ Order gac, in powder form, for the princely sum of £66.57 from Amazon. No one said every superfood comes cheap. SAW PALMETTO . The berries of this plant have been used in American Indian herbal medicine for hundreds of years — and for good reason. The fruit contains antioxidant compounds that can help in the treatment of an enlarged prostate gland or benign prostate hyperplasia. ‘Clinical research has shown that taking one 320mg capsule of saw palmetto daily for two months before prostate surgery reduces blood loss, the development of problems during surgery and the total time spent in the hospital,’ says Mead. Capsules available from Holland & Barrett (£12.25) or Amazon (£7.99). LUCUMA . ‘Not only is it a good source of antioxidants, fibre, beta- carotene, niacin, potassium, zinc and iron, but the caramel taste makes it a healthy sugar alternative for diabetics and those avoiding refined sugar,’ says Mead. Pick up this yellow Peruvian fruit at Planet Organic (£6.99) or Whole Foods Market (£7.42). PICHUBERRY . Another Peruvian export, this small berry  looks similar to a kumquat, but has a much higher vitamin content. Not only does it boast excellent levels of vitamin D, vital for healthy bones and skin, but it also contains vitamins C and B12. ‘It has been shown to reduce inflammation as well as possessing anti-cancer properties,’ says Mead. Pichuberry (pictured) is a Peruvian export and looks similar to a kumquat but has a much higher vitamin content . Also known as Inca berries, green-fingered experts say they’re hardy enough to be grown in Britain. Find them at biovea.net/uk (£13.05) or suttons.co.uk (£2.49 for seeds). ARONIA . All hail this North American berry, which has one of the highest antioxidant values recorded for a fruit.

"Saturday Night Live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining ISIS, and not the US Army, at the end. The segment was laid out the same as the recent My Bold Dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his Toyota Camry. The spot that first aired during the 2015 Super Bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service. In this version however, the father, played by Taran Killam, dropped off his daughter, played by Dakota Johnson, and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him; 'Dad, it's just ISIS.' Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson (above) played a young girl joining ISIS in a skit on Saturday Night Live . The skit ended with the tagline; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad' There was even a vehicle with the ISIS flag in the skit . This is the first time that Johnson, the star of Fifty Shades of Grey, has hosted Saturday Night Live . From there, Johnson jumped on a truck with actors playing members of the Islamic State and with a mock flag, which actually appears to read; 'I would like a cat.' When the father then says to take care of his girl, one of the men yells; 'Death to America.' Then, as the commercial ended, a message appeared on screen; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad.' Johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody . Some on twitter found the parody 'depraved' Others on twitter found the bit 'hysterical' Johnson teels her father not to worry saying, 'Dad, it's just ISIS' This all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the United States with ties to the terrorist organization and three female British teenagers left to join the group. The skit was met with outrage by many on Twitter, who took the program to task for being insensitive. 'Can't be serious. Isis skit? Like going to college? When so many people are being kidnapped and killed?Depraved,' wrote Raine LaChance. 'Apparently NBC and SNL thought it was funny to have a skit showing ISIS driving to an airport to pick up an American girl. Tasteless Scum!,' said Jim Ematrudo. Others however found the skit 'hilarious.' This also comes the same week that the identity of ISIS member Jihadi John was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in Iraq dating back thousands of years in Mosul. John is British citizen Mohammed Emwazi, the man who is responsible for the high-profile beheadings of Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Steven Sotliff as well as British citizens David Haines and Alan Henning in the name of the terrorist organization. His identity was previously unknown as he always wears a mask. Canada this week also said that they believe four missing teenagers may have traveled to be in ISIS.","Saturday Night Live made a parody of a Toyota Camry commercial in which a young girl is driven to the airport by her father to head off to the army .

"A Jetstar Airways flight was forced to return to Melbourne – causing a delay for passengers and crew – after one of the travellers was caught drinking and smoking on board. The Perth-bound flight turned around about an hour after take-off and the disruptive man was arrested after the plane was met by police officers early Sunday morning. An airline spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald that the unruly passenger has been banned from flying with Qantas and its subsidiaries, including Jetstar Airways. A flight attendant told passengers that the man was caught drinking his own booze on board the plane . A YouTube video captured by a passenger shows a man getting out of his seat as Australian Federal Police officers board the plane in Melbourne. One of the flight attendants tells passengers: ‘Ladies and gentlemen we do have security forces coming on board, we ask you to please remain seated, thank you.’ The man makes his own way to the front of the cabin, where he is met by the officers before being escorted off the plane. The flight attendant tells passengers that the man was drinking alcohol that he brought on board and was twice caught smoking on the plane. She added: ‘We carry jet fuel which is 10 times more volatile than car fuel, so for safety reasons [the flight turned around]’. The plane was forced to turn around over Gulf St Vincent, west of Adelaide, and return to Melbourne . The cross-country flight normally takes four hours to complete, but was forced to turn around over Gulf St Vincent, west of Adelaide.

The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels. Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch. As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting. Her South American counterpart, Maria Clemencia Rodriguez went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket.

The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper. Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

"Charged: April Emery was arrested after her children were found wandering the streets selling toys . An Osceola County, Florida mother has been arrested after authorities said they found her two young daughters going door to door trying to sell their toys. The Osceola County Sheriff’s Office says the girls, ages 7 and 9, were walking barefoot about a half-mile from their home about 10:30 a.m. Thursday. The girls told deputies they were selling their toys 'to help mommy stay in the house.' The girls had missed a 7:20 a.m. bus to school, deputies said. The deputies found the mother, April Emery, at home sleeping. According to investigators, when deputies woke her up she said she blamed her daughters for not waking her up at school time. WTSP reports that Emery did not seem to be concerned about her daughters' well being. When deputies told her they found her daughters walking around, she told them, 'Well they should know better, it's their job to wake me up in the morning to get ready for school.' Emery was charged with child neglect without great bodily harm. The arrest was reported to the state Department of Children and Families, which had investigated previous allegations of poor child care at the home. According to the sheriff’s office, the home had running water, electricity and food, and the girls were were wearing clean clothes and had toys 'to keep them entertained.' The girls are now staying with a family member. Accused of neglect: April Emery allegedly told police it was her child's fault for neglect because they were the ones responsible for waking her up for school .","April Emery has been arrested after authorities said they found her two young daughters going door to door trying to sell their toys .

"Former High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge (pictured) claimed the research showed that social mobility often depended on people's ability to maintain stable relationships . Couples who stay together until their children fly the nest can boost their incomes by a third, according to new research. The study found husbands and wives could earn thousands of pounds extra- almost the same boost as having a degree- just by sticking with their partner. Former High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge, the founder of the Marriage Foundation which commissioned the research, claimed it showed that social mobility often depended on people's ability to maintain stable relationships. The study found that a woman with a degree in her mid-forties, who married before the birth of her children and has stayed with her partner until they reached 14 or 15 years old would earn around £31,000. But if the same mother had separated from the father of her child, her income would drop dramatically to £23,000 a year. Sir Coleridge told The Sunday Times: 'The better-off on the whole stay together, and so preserve and increase their wealth for the next generation. 'The less well-off, on the other hand, are marrying less and less, staying together less and less, and seeing the perpetuation of their poverty into future generations.' Coleridge is now launching a manifesto for political parties to tackle family breakdown, estimated to cost tax payers £47billion a year. Harry Benson, research director of the Marriage Foundation, claimed that people who stayed together had a greater combined income and therefore more stability. The study was created in conjunction with Stephen McKay, a professor in social research at Lincoln University, which analysed data from Understanding Society, a UK study that follows 40,000 households.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that as much as 90 per cent of new parents in the top tax bracket are married- compared to just 50 per cent on minimum wage. Susanna Abse, chief executive of the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships, said there was evidence that when relationship quality increased, so did financial earnings. 'It's about parents being able to collaborate on things such as childcare. If you're offered a promotion but have just gone through a relationship breakdown, you will not have the support network, and energy goes out of the career,' she added.","Partners staying together until children flew nest boost income by a third .

"As the executions of Bali Nine masterminds Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman loom, fellow convicted drug smuggler Martin Stephens loses hope for a second chance at life. Stephens was one of the nine Australians who were imprisoned in Indonesia after trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. The 39-year-old has been sentenced to life and was moved from Kerobokan prison to Malang in East Java. Scroll down for video . Martin Stephens has penned a letter begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo to spare the lives of Bali Nine duo . The married inmate has penned a letter to The Australian and says Indonesian president Joko Widodo has given drug offenders like himself no hope of living a normal life. Mr Widodo's hardline on narcotics has Stephens fearing  'it would be better if they took me out the back and put a bullet in the back of my head' if he had no chance of reducing his sentence. 'It is more human to just take me out the back and shoot me like Andrew and Myuran,' Stephens said. 'Isn't 20 years a bad enough penalty? But life means no hope. It means I will die in prison. Can you imagine having to live like that?' Stephens says the impending executions of Chan and Sukuraman makes him lose hope that he will never leave prison . The married inmate fears he will die in prison and never know what it would be like to live with his wife . Stephens has a good reason to want his life sentence reduced like Renae Lawrence, who is eligible for parole next year. In 2011, Stephens married Christine Puspayanti - a Javanese woman - who he met for the first time while at Kerobokan prison. She was visiting with a church group while Stephens was serving out his sentence in the Bali jail. Stephens also shares how he has forgiven Chan for his hand in getting him involved in the plot, but would never forget where the blame lay. Ms Puspayanti - who has a daughter from a previous relationship - said she was lonely without her husband at home with her. 'My daughter and I would at least like to know when Martin might come home,' she told News Corp. In 2011, Stephens (pictured in 2006) married Javanese woman Christine Puspayanti who has a daughter from a previous marriage . It comes after the Governor of Jakarta urged Mr Widodo to reconsider his stance on the death penalty. Mr Widodo's close ally, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, said he believed drug smugglers who have reformed themselves in prison, like Chan and Sukuraman, should be handed a life sentence instead of death. 'If from inside [jail] they're still controlling drugs, then execute them immediately that day,' 9News reported Mr Tjahaja Purnama as saying. 'But if people want to change, give them a chance to live. 'Maybe he can make other people more aware instead of punishing him with death.'","Martin Stephens is one of the Bali Nine who tried to smuggle 8kg of heroin .

"Prince William arrived in China tonight for one of the most high-profile – and diplomatically sensitive – tours of his fledgling royal career. Following four successful days in Japan, the future king flew on to Beijing where he was greeted at the Norman Foster-designed Capital International Airport by British Ambassador Barbara Woodward, Britain's first female ambassador to the country. Also present was the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, and Ambassador Sun of The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. Scroll down for video . The Duke of Cambridge arrives at Capital International Airport in Beijing, where he was greeted by Chinese delegates and the British Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward (second from left) Walking through the VIP section after arriving on a schedule flight from Tokyo, the prince glanced at a display of cherry blossom, lanterns and a display dedicated to the new Chinese year, the Year of the Sheep. Stepping foot for the first time on Chinese soil, the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the Royal family to visit the country since the Queen nearly 30 years ago. In truth, many had believed that William’s father, Prince Charles, would be the first to stake that claim. The Queen’s heir has been assiduously courting the Chinese in recent years on behalf of his charities, setting up a number of initiatives in the country, including The Prince’s Charities Foundation (China) and an organisation to preserve historic architecture. He has also met with several senior Communist party leaders in the UK. However he has also made no secret of his personal, and deeply held, opposition to Chinese actions in Tibet, regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (reviled in Beijing as a dangerous separatist), to Clarence House. The pair have even been photographed holding hands. Prince William with the British Ambassador Barbara Woodward . After taking part in the formal handover of the former British Colony of Hong Kong in 1997 to China, Charles also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as ‘appalling old waxworks’. Two years later let it be known he was boycotting a Buckingham Palace banquet in honour of the then visiting president of China, Jiang Zemin. William’s grandfather, Prince Philip, also has form in the country. During the Queen’s 1986 visit to China he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of British students: ‘If you stay here much longer, you’ll all be slitty-eyed.’ Something of a herd of elephants in the room, then, for 32-year-old William to manoeuvre – and that’s even before he flies to the west of the country to visit China’s own dwindling band of wild Asian elephants and convince the locals to curb their demand for ivory and other illegal animals products. First, however, he will spend a morning in Beijing, visiting the exquisite Forbidden City – the ancient home of China’s deposed emperors - as well as a traditional Hutong, a traditional narrow alley unique to the country. He will also meet several senior Communist Party leaders, including, it is believed, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang. With China on course to overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy, the UK government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and William’s visit will be seen as part of that. Given the sensitivity of these meetings the prince – who is putting off becoming a full-time working royal for at least two years to work as an air ambulance pilot – will have to show both maturity and diplomatic dexterity. The royal is scheduled to visit the  Forbidden City – the ancient home of China’s deposed emperors (Pictured: William with Barbara Woodward) He will no doubt be grateful for the assured presence of the Queen’s favourite diplomat, Sir David Manning, who has accompanied him to the Far East at her request. Later on Monday he will fly to Shanghai to embark on a concerted push to promote British business and culture when he opens the Government’s GREAT festival of Creativity at the city’s Long Museum. The festival is designed to showcase British innovation and creativity in everything from fashion to health, technology, education and entertainment. He will even attend the premiere of home-grown success story Paddington, although William will be too busy to see the actual film. It’s a packed programme and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince’s wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy, William has made the right noises so far, it seems. Earlier in the day the Prince was in northern Japan, where he was greeted by Chine-style lions . Thousands of well wishers lined the streets during his visit to the Chime of Hope Shopping Centre in Onagawa, northern Japan earlier today . In Japan he even threw his usual caution to the wind and was persuaded to don a Samurai outfit – although drew the line at a ponytailed wig. Earlier today he looked delighted to be greet by a traditional Lion Dance as he visited the north-eastern city of Ishinomaki, which was devastated by a tsunami in 2011, which killed some 19,000 people. William placed a bouquet at a hilltop shrine and was mobbed by wellwishers, taken aback by the prince’s willingness to interact, in stark comparison with the rather staid nature of their own Imperial family.

"Ministers have ordered an inquiry into Jihadi John's secondary school after it emerged that two other former pupils went on to become terrorists. Education secretary Nicky Morgan has ordered an urgent investigation into the school after it emerged two dead Islamist fighters were also taught at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north London. Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting with terrorists in Syria in 2013 after joining up with an al-Qaeda group, while Mohammed Sakr, 27, died fighting for Al-Shabbab in Somalia. Their deaths and the fact Jihadi John was revealed as former pupil Mohammed Emwazi last week has raised questions over what measures are in place to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers. Ministers have ordered an urgent investigation into the school attended by Mohammed Emwazi (pictured left) after it emerged two dead extremist fighters  - including Choukri Ellekhlifi (right) - were also taught there . Yesterday the Government announced an urgent internal review into whether enough had been done at the school. Mrs Morgan has ordered officials to examine all evidence, including school records and inspection findings, to establish whether enough was done to prevent teenagers becoming radicalised. The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming  extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern', a spokesman said. The spokesman added: 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review all schools that fit this category. 'Our understanding of the challenge, and the way we monitor the ability of schools to respond to it, has advanced hugely in the past few years. Quintin Kynaston Academy's (pictured) head insisted the school is 'not a breeding ground for terrorists' 'As part of this, this government set-up a dedicated Due Diligence and Counter Extremism division within the DfE and they are working tirelessly to develop our understanding of the problem and to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern. 'The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria. 'The allegations about Quintin Kynaston may be historic and it is clearly a completely different school today, but I'm sure we will look back at the evidence from the time as part of this review to see if there are any lessons we can learn for the future.' The Telegraph reports both Ellekhlifli and Sakr were 'close associates' of Emwazi. Ellekhlifi was fighting alongside al-Qaeda linked extremists in Syria when he was killed by government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11, 2013. The Department for Education review aims to help officials understand how to prevent pupils or former pupils becoming extremists and travelling 'to Syria or other areas of concern' - pictured: Jihadi John in an ISIS video . Sakr was fighting with al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate, which has been responsible for a series of atrocities including the attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in which at least 67 people were killed. Quintin Kynaston Academy's current headteacher has insisted the school is not a breeding ground for terrorists. Alex Atherton told The Telegraph: 'QK has been proactive in working with the government's Prevent strategy, and this has resulted in positive work around the well-being and safety of our students. 'Students that may have attended nine years ago are not a reflection of the students we are proud of having at QK, and we will continue to put in place support mechanisms to make sure all our students feel safe and that they can raise any concerns.' One unnamed man who claimed to be a student alongside Ellekhlifi at QK told the paper he and his friends saw 'quite a lot of young men going towards a radicalised direction', but said he didn't realise the extent of it, adding 'It was a massive shock' when he learnt that Ellekhlifi went to Syria.

"The head of the US army has admitted that he is ‘very concerned’ about cuts to Britain’s defence spending. General Raymond Odierno warned that the cuts could diminish Britain’s ability to fight future campaigns. He also called on the Government to maintain defence spending at the Nato target of two per cent of national income. Scroll down for video . Head of the US Army General Raymond Odierno, who has warned that cuts to Britain's defence spending could diminish their ability to fight future campaigns . General Odierno, the US army chief of staff, suggested defence cuts had already damaged America’s confidence in their military ally. I would be lying to you if I did not say that I am very concerned about the GDP investment in the UK,’ he told The Daily Telegraph. ‘We have a bilateral agreement between our two countries to work together. It is about having a partner that has very close values and the same goals as we do. ‘What has changed, though, is the level of capability. In the past we would have a British Army division working alongside an American army division. Now it might be a British brigade inside an American division.’ His warning came after the former head of the Army said yesterday that fresh cuts to Britain’s Armed Forces would be ‘unwise’ with the West facing twin dangers of a new Cold War with Russia and the rise of Islamist extremism. Sir Peter Wall (left) and former Defence Secretary (right) are among those to have spoken out against the Chancellor's plan to reduce military spending to below the NATO benchmark of 2 per cent of GDP . In his first interview since retiring last September, General Sir Peter Wall admitted that he doubted UK politicians had the will to ‘tackle the really wicked issues’ facing the world. And the ex-Chief of the General Staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election. He said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training, equipment and even military missions – further undermining the UK’s global standing. The Prime Minister has faced criticism over the cuts which, say experts, would 'comfort enemies' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Peter urged: 'We military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment. 'Implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the Nato summit in Wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody's responsibility around Europe to meet the 2% of GDP for defence expenditure, implicit in that is the fact that that's what we ought to be doing ourselves.' His views were echoed by former Defence Secretary Liam Fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds. 'To say that we were willing to guarantee a proportion of GDP for international aid but not willing to implement our commitments in terms of defence, I think a lot of Conservatives would find that very difficult to swallow especially at a time when you can see the international security environment is deteriorating,' he told the BBC'S Andrew Neil. 'What is happening at the moment with, for example, Putin's Russia, is really only one miscalculation away from creating an Article 5 crisis that brings conflict to the European continent.' He was referring to the NATO article which considers an attack on one of its members an attack on all 28. Dr Fox added the relationship between Britain and America had been compromised following Parliament's voting against intervening in Syria following the regime's reported use of chemical weapons. 'I think there was damage done to Britain's relationship with the US at least to an extent when Parliament voted not to take action over the Syrian use of chemical weapons. During a recent visit to Washington Mr Cameron was told by President Barack Obama that reducing Britain's defence budget to below 2 per cent would undermine the treaty . 'I think there's a real danger here which is (that) you shouldn't make threats which you're not willing to follow through on. 'If you draw red lines, as President Obama did, and don't follow them through, that only gives comfort to your enemies.' David Cameron was among world leaders who pressed other member countries into meeting the 2 per cent target of military spending at the summit in Wales last year. However recent reports revealed the Government planned to lower spending to 1.8 per cent. President Obama last month insisted Britain live up to the agreed amount or it would face weakening NATO. During a visit to Washington he told David Cameron that anything less than 2 per cent would seek to undermine the treaty. Only four countries are thought to have met the quota in the past. They are the US, Britain, Estonia and Greece.","General Raymond Odierno has admitted he is 'very concerned' about cuts .

"It was a foregone conclusion that  HTC would use this year's Mobile World Congress to launch its latest handset, but the Taiwanese firm had something else up its sleeve. At the event in Barcelona the phone maker unveiled early details about a full-body virtual reality system it has developed in partnership with gaming giant Valve. The system, dubbed RE Vive, moves beyond just a headset and uses Kinect-style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in their games. At Mobile World Congress HTC unveiled early details of a full-body virtual reality system developed in partnership with gaming giant Valve. The system moves beyond a headset (pictured) and uses Kinect-style lasers to track the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in game . Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles. The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better. This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example. HTC’s Vive has ‘full room scale’ and two wireless controllers with hand tracking. A developer version will launch in the spring and the consumer model will go on sale later in the year. The system is powered by the Oculus Rift technology and HTC will announce more information nearer the time of the developer launch. HTC also used the event to unveil its 5-inch HTC One M9 phone with 20MP camera and a fitness band, in partnership with Under Armour. In particular, the M8's rear-facing 4 Ultrapixel camera has been added to the front of the M9, and the M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP. Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles.The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better.This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example (pictured) Ultrapixels are, for all intents and purposes, another name for megapixels. However, each individual pixel is marginally larger meaning they capture more light. In addition to the upgraded lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed around the human eye. When a photo is taken on the One M9, this algorithm makes it appear as close to how the human eye would view it as possible, with the same light adjustment and focus. It also adds similar depth qualities, boosted by the dual camera the firm originally added on the M8. 'I have previously struggled to buy into virtual reality when it consisted of sitting on a chair and simply looking around, but HTC’s Vive system has convinced me otherwise. During the demonstration I was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup, the HTC Vive headset, two controllers and sensors on two of the walls. These sensors use lasers to plot the room’s shape, size and obstacles. For the demonstration version, the headset was attached to the computer using wires. But the HTC spokesman told MailOnline this was because of the interference from the various networks covering the trade show and the final version will be wireless. During a demonstration MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup, the HTC Vive headset (pictured), two controllers and sensors on two of the walls. These sensors use lasers to plot the room’s shape, size and obstacles . Once I put the headset on, a grid appeared around me similar to how the holodeck appears in Star Trek. The demonstrator handed me the wireless controllers, which in itself was a strange experience to see controllers ‘floating’ towards you but not see the hands holding them. I was then trained to use the controllers by blowing up a balloon with the left hand and punching it through the air with the right. The first ‘experience’ dropped me underwater onto a sunken ship. Small fish swam around me, which I could ‘touch’ and move. I could look over the edge of the ship and explore the deck. If at any point I approached a real-world obstacle, a feint grid would appear to warn me. During this experience a virtual stingray swam near my face and a huge whale made me jump as it appeared on my left shoulder and cast a shadow over me. Another experience involved painting in the air. Colours and brushes were selected with the left controller and painted with the right. These paintings hung in the air and I was able to walk through them. I also made snow fall around me. A third involved exploring a kitchen, making a meal and serving it. At one point I dropped an egg near my foot and it broke and made a mess. I could use the controllers and triggers to pick up objects, move them around and drop them. These skills were then put to the test during another experience in which I had to repair a robot. While the final experience had me placed in the middle of a virtual battle. I could explore the battleground and kneel down so my face was in line with the ground. I couldn't count the number of times I jumped, laughed, expressed surprise and was wowed by this technology. And this is an early version, with a limited number of trials. By these standards, this technology has the potential to live up to HTC’s claims of being revolutionary. That said, there is one substantial benefit to having a stationary virtual reality experience compared to one you can explore and that’s convenience. I can’t imagine many people have rooms they can dedicate entirely to this technology, or want to spend money on a host of kit, rather than just a headset. As it stands though this technology literally took my breath away at times and was the stand out tech of this year’s Mobile World Congress.' Victoria Woollaston . The 'full-body virtual reality system' was a surprise announcement at an event where HTC also unveiled it M9 handset and a fitness band. The M9 has added incremental changes compared to previous M8 (pictured) and these include taking the 4 Ultrapixel camera from rear of M8 and adding it to the front of the M9 . Handset: HTC has also unveiled its 5-inch HTC One M9 phone with 20MP camera and a fitness band . Beside this, however, the changes between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system. These include highly customisable themes and dynamic home screens. Using the phone's location, and by learning about a user's habits, the M9 will change which icons appear on the home screen throughout the day. For example, if it knows the user is at home it will prioritise gaming and social network apps, but when it senses the user is near a tube or train station it will push the National Rail app - or similar - to the front. It only suggests apps that the user has already installed, and the suggestions can be customised or switched off completely. Elsewhere, the M9 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon technology and features 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of storage with the option to extend this using an SD card, plus all customers get 100GB Google Drive for two years. MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston reveals her first impressions of HTC's new device. 'There is little to get excited about with the One M9. 'Its predecessors- the original One known as M7 and the One M8 - are well-made, well-built and were global successes. 'And the M9 is more of the same. 'This means it has the same great design and feels comfortable to hold - so is far from a criticism - but it hardly warrants spending money to upgrade, especially from the M8. 'The standout feature of the M9 is its cameras. 'HTC leads the way with smartphone cameras and has tapped into the growing trend of 'smartphone photography'. 'By adding the 4Ultrapixel camera from the M8 to the front of the M9, it also understands its customers love of selfies. 'Seeing the Dynamic Exposure in action does highlight how shots on iPhone and Android devices can sometimes fall short, but again, this isn't a reason to upgrade on its own. 'Beyond that the innovations are minimal. 'HTC prides itself on including features that add value rather than gimmicks, but without these there seems little incentive to switch - especially if you're a Samsung or Apple owner. 'Many of its software features, such as BlinkFeed and the new dynamic homescreen, will appeal to hardcore HTC fans, but may seem like bloatware to others. 'That's not to say the phone is poor, and if an M7 owner is looking to upgrade then the M9 seems like an obvious choice. 'But by tapping into its existing market rather than looking to expand, the handset may struggle to emulate its predecessors successes.' The phone will be available from 31 March in three colours - 'gold on silver', 'gum metal grey on grey' and 'gold on gold.' Prices are yet to be announced. HTC also used the event to launch its first fitness band in partnership with Under Armour. The partnership was announced in January and Under Armour’s team of designers, sports scientists and athletes have worked with HTC’s Connected Products to create the wearable. It will work with UA Record - an app that lets people record and analyse their activity levels from various other apps such as MyFitnessPal and Endomodo. The band  pairs with Android 4.3+ and iOS 7+ to also show phone notifications. It will additionally respond to gestures to make it easier to control when exercising, for example. HTC said the band launch in the US later this year and the company is 'evaluating' it in Europe. Again, no price details were given. The M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP. In addition to the new lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed to mimic the human eye. When a photo is taken this algorithm adjusts exposure, focus and depth accordingly. This is boosted by the dual-lens setup added on the M8 (shown) Beside the camera updates, the differences between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental, with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system. Many of the leaked specifications (pictured) before the event have been confirmed including 3GB of RAM, screen size, operating system and processor .","The devices were unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

The 31-year-old was inspired by the 1996 disaster film Twister, but didn't begin chasing storms until she witnessed a tornado in 2003 . Valentina Abinanti, one of few Italian storm chasers, risks her life to snap extraordinary photos of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes . Valentina has been photographing violent weather for more than a decade, and she has encountered more than 70 tornadoes and 400 storms. In May 2013, she survived a deadly tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma. The widest tornado in recorded history killed four fellow storm chasers and is remembered by the close-knit community as the darkest moment in storm chasing history. With a width of 2.6 miles, the record-breaking F-5 tornado destroyed everything in its path with extreme winds of nearly 300mph. In addition to the US, Valentina Abinanti chases storms in Italy; she spotted this massive waterspout in the coastal town of Vesima, near Genoa . The thrill-seeker voluntarily puts herself in front of storms that spawn twisters, enormous streaks of lightning and winds of more than 100mph . The teacher's photos are featured on her social media accounts, and they include many snaps from the feared Tornado Alley in the US . Valentina Abinanti has included some of her best photos in a new e-book, and she has set up a website to promote her work . By the time the tornado dissipated it left eight people dead and more than 150 injured. Valentina’s photos are featured on her social media accounts, and they include many snaps from the feared Tornado Alley that cuts through several south-central US states. Tornadoes in that region typically happen in late spring and occasionally the early fall, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Valentina Abinanti put her dream of becoming a storm chaser on hold while she studied to become a primary school teacher . This photograph snapped by Valentina Abinanti shows the early stages of a devastating tornado that struck El Reno, Oklahoma in 2013 . The 31-year-old decided to pursue her goal of becoming a storm chaser in 2003, when she witnessed a tornado in her hometown in Italy . Valentina has also produced her own e-book and has set up a website, tornadoseeker.com, to promote her work. She wrote on her blog: ‘Since childhood storms have always fascinated me. The sky darkens, the wind gets up, the threatening clouds thunder closer. ‘It was always a joy when I watched this show.’ Valentina Abinanti, from Galliate, Italy, said she has been fascinated by storms since she was a child .

"The Union Flag is to be plastered across big money projects paid for by the UK taxpayer to show the public where their taxes are spent. Ministers will announce tomorrow the plan to brand roads, flood defences and broadband hubs with the message 'Funded by the UK Government. It will be used on projects across the UK, but will prove provocative in Scotland where the move to highlight UK spending will be seen as a challenge to supporters of independence. The new logo will be unveiled by ministers tomorrow, and will be used on any project funded by the UK taxpayer . Treasury minister Danny Alexander, who is a Scottish MP, will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area 'from Cornwall to Caithness' Treasury minister Danny Alexander, who is a Scottish MP, will unveil the logo which will spring up in every area 'from Cornwall to Caithness'. Under the plan, any firm who wins a UK government contract will have to agree to display the logo on the finished work. Treasury insiders insist that the logo is not designed to challenge Scottish nationalists, but promote the need for investment across the UK. 'It is just a reminder to people that this is where their money is going.' a source said. The use of the logo will seek to emphasise that major investment in big money projects is only possible thanks to the strong economic growth, and Scotland as a result of remaining in the UK. However, some areas of infrastructure are devolved, so will not apply in Scotland. The logo will also draw comparisons with a similar image used on foreign aid sent around the world funded by Britain. It copies a long-standing Brussels agreement which sees the EU flag displayed on infrastructure which it has funded. The Treasury says that there is £466billion of new projects in the pipeline, which the Government is helping to fund using public money. Mr Alexander said: 'I've prioritised infrastructure in this government because only long-term investments will support UK businesses and get the public finances and economy on a firm footing. 'It's only right that we recognise the contribution of the UK taxpayer in supporting this economic growth, which is why I'm delighted to launch these Union Jack plaques, which will proudly adorn infrastructure investments from roads in Cornwall to broadband in Caithness.' The move will draw comparisons with a similar logo used on foreign aid sent around the world funded by Britain . The plan has been drawn up with Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who said: 'As part of our long term economic plan, this government is investing in our nation's physical and digital infrastructure. 'Whether it's High Speed 2 investment in the Northern Powerhouse or superfast broadband connecting Cornwall and Wales, all future infrastructure projects funded for by UK taxpayers will carry this simple UK flag branding.' In 2012 a similar logo was introduced for foreign aid funding, which included the Union Flag and the words: UK aid from the British people'. Under official rules, its use is not optional but 'is a condition of accepting funding from DFID'. Despite the insistence that the logo is not designed to counter Scottish independence calls, ministers are understood to be concerned about the rise in support for the SNP since voters in Scotland rejected independence in the historic referendum held in September. The use of the logo is seen as a small step in shoring up support for the UK north of the border, with the SNP set to make big gains in May's general election. In the event of a hung Parliament, Labour could be forced to depend on nationalist MPs for support, raising the prospect of a second referendum on independence. SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie described the plaques as a 'silly gimmick' which did not disguise the coalition's cuts to overall infrastructure spending and Scotland's capital budget. He said: 'Putting a sticker on projects is a silly gimmick by Danny Alexander and his Tory bosses, which can't cover over the fact that his government at Westminster has slashed infrastructure spending - destroying jobs and delaying economic recovery - including cutting Scotland's capital budget by a quarter. 'Despite this, the Scottish Government is delivering over £11 billion of investment over the three years to 2015-16. Instead of the huge cuts imposed by Danny Alexander and the Tories, people across the UK would prefer more infrastructure investment, and fewer gimmicks.'","Provocative Treasury move to put Union Flag on all state-funded projects .

"Spacewalking astronauts who ventured out for the third time in just over a week on Sunday have completed an extensive, tricky cable job at the International Space Station. But, dramatically, right before Sunday's spacewalk, engineers spotted problems with American astronaut Butch Wilmore's suit. While it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks, on Sunday morning, a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out. Scroll down for video . Maintenance: Barry Wilmore and Terry Virts begin their third spacewalk at the International Space Station . Work: Astronaut Terry Virts installs an antenna and boom during the third spacewalk outside the International Space Station Sunday . Space Station: An astronaut is pictured at the International Space Station, the spacewalk is the third in eight days for NASA, and is the 187th in the history of the space station . Repair: Astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, right, and Terry Virts carried out the work but both had problems with their suits before their mission but none during the task . A mechanical gauge, however, was operating fine. Mission Control told Wilmore that he would need to pay extra attention to how his suit was feeling throughout the seven-hour excursion. Meanwhile, Nasa said a small amount of water got into American astronaut Terry Virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurized on Wednesday. They were forced to spend two days analyzing his suit after the water leak  occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week. Engineers concluded it was the result of condensation, and a safe and well understood circumstance that had occurred several times before with the same spacesuit. Virts was never in danger, according to Nasa, so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks, Friday, to install cable. But in 2013, another astronaut nearly drowned because of a flooded helmet. Duties: NASA said another main part of the astronauts task was to route 400 feet (121 meters) of cable . Leak: In this file image made from video provided by Nasa, astronaut Terry Virts points to his helmet as he sits inside the International Space Station on Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2015, during an inspection for water in his suit. Virts reported the water while he waited in the air lock for Wednesday's spacewalk to formally conclude . Spacewalk: Nasa on Friday cleared Virts' spacesuit, pictured, for the last of three spacewalks to install cable . Italian astronaut, Luca Parmitano, barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk. The water escaped from his suit's cooling system and Nasa spent months investigating the mishap, before clearing the way for more spacewalks. On Wednesday, the amount of water seepage in Virts' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when Virts was already inside. 'They're very different occurrences,' said Alex Kanelakos, a spacewalk officer in Mission Control. Cable: American astronauts Terry Virts and Butch Wilmore had 400 more feet of power and data cable, as well as two antennas which they installed Sunday . Astronaut: Terry Virts is seen during the third spacewalk outside the International Space Station Sunday during the six hour, 45 minute outing, they plan to set up antennas and communications equipment . Nasa: Astronaut Terry Virts, left, and Barry Wilmore began the spacewalk at 6:52 am (1152 GMT) when completed the work will allow future crews launching from Florida on US commercial spacecraft to be able to park at the space station . The advance work, involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by Nasa. The work done by American astronauts Virts and Wilmore meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed, as well as two antennas installed on Sunday. A pair of docking ports will fly up later this year, followed by the capsules themselves, with astronauts aboard, in 2017. The astronauts successfully routed 364 feet on their first two excursions, on February 21 and last Wednesday. They carried out complicated work Sunday, yet the astronauts completed their task  an hour early  making it a five and a half-hour spacewalk. They spent 20 hours altogether on three outings. Neither Virts nor Wilmore experienced any more suit trouble during their task. Mission Control joked by radio: 'You guys have done an outstanding job even for two shuttle pilots.' The 260-mile (418-kilometre) spacewalk unfolded 50 years to the month of the world's first spacewalk by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov  on March 18, 1965. Nasa hasn't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days, and the amount of cable work is unprecedented. Work: In this image from Nasa television astronaut Terry Virts exits the Quest airlock hatch beginning the third spacewalk outside the International Space Station early Sunday morning March 1, 2015 . Even more spacewalks will be needed once new docking ports start arriving in June. Wilmore is due to return to Earth next week following a five and a half-month mission. Virts is midway through his expedition. A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carried them both up, with NASA paying for the multimillion dollar tickets. To save money and stop being so reliant on the Russian Space Agency, NASA has hired Boeing and SpaceX to develop spacecraft capable of transporting astronauts to the space station. The two contracts are worth nearly $7 billion. SpaceX already is delivering cargo under a separate agreement with Nasa.","Engineers analyzed a water leak in one of the astronauts' helmets'

"Switcheroo: Wisconsin governor Scott Walker changed his tune in an interview on Sunday . Governor Scott Walker once envisioned a world where the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally could embark on a path to citizenship. But now the Wisconsin Republican calls that position 'amnesty' and says his view has changed. 'I don't believe in amnesty,' Walker told Fox News Sunday. 'My view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. Candidates can say that.' Walker, who emerged this past week in the top tier of potential candidates for the Republican presidential nomination for 2016, says the U.S. needs to secure the border and ultimately put in place 'a legal immigration system that works.' That means, in part, putting the onus on employers and getting them the tools to do that, like E-Verify, an existing federal program that allows businesses to check the immigration status of new hires, Walker said. Walker told the Wausau, Wisconsin, Daily Herald newspaper in 2013 that 'it makes sense' when he was asked whether he could see a world where 'those people' could get citizenship, with the right penalties, waiting periods and requirements in place. At the time, he supported a bipartisan approach to overhauling immigration, with people waiting to get citizenship having priority and others having a legal pathway to live here legally. Walker also said Sunday that President Barack Obama or 'anybody else who is willing to put their name on the ballot certainly has to have the love for country to do that.' Walker drew criticism last month after former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani questioned Obama's patriotism during a speech at a Walker fundraiser.  When asked about the former mayor's comments, Walker sidestepped the question by saying he hadn't asked Obama about his love of country.","Wisconsin governor once favored plan whereby undocumented people could become US citizens .

"Despite claims that they are boozy or culturally ignorant abroad, British holidaymakers are now more adventurous than ever when it comes to local history and cuisine, new research suggests. A survey of UK tourists found that three-quarters of those polled are keen to learn 15 phrases in a foreign language while they’re abroad, and the average Briton wants to try six new local dishes or drinks. Homestay.com said its study reveals the typical British tourist is now more of a culture vulture than holiday resort recluse. British tourists are keen to learn about local culture while on holiday (pictured: Blue Mosque in Istanbul) The study by Homestay.com said the average Briton wants to try six new local dishes or drinks . Forty per cent of respondents said they want to learn about local customs and residents in the countries they are visiting this year. Just 14 per cent (or one in 10) said they would rather befriend fellow Briton during their getaway. More than two-thirds agreed it is important to learn about local culture whilst away, with the average Briton wanting to visit five local attractions. The study also found that 70 per cent want to head back to the UK with a better understanding of the country or countries they have visited. Staple British holiday meals such as fish and chips are also being turned down in favour of local cuisine. Of nearly 2,000 British adults who were polled, just nine per cent want to stay poolside to work on their tan, compared to 40 per cent who aren’t bothered about bronzing. The average summer holiday will last 10 days and tourists are planning to spend 20 per cent more on their getaway. Of nearly 2,000 British adults who were polled, just nine per cent want to work on their tan . Alan Clarke, CEO for Homestay.com, an online marketplace for hosted homestay accommodation, said: ‘The research clearly shows how much our priorities have changed when it comes to our summer holidays. ‘Millions of Brits now want to explore the country they’re visiting and really learn about their destination, as opposed to just lounging by the pool and topping up their tans.’ Homestay.com’s survey seems to support the findings of the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), which found that consumers are looking to spend more on their holidays in 2015. British holidaymakers have been accused of being too boozy or culturally ignorant when they head abroad . An ABTA survey found that 35% of Britons think they will visit a new country (pictured: Vilnius, Lithuania) The ABTA survey determined that 20 per cent of British holidaymakers anticipate spending more on holidays this year, compared to 15 per cent who say they will spend less. Of those polled, many are looking for new experiences, with nearly half (48 per cent) saying they are ‘quite likely’ or ‘practically certain’ to visit a new resort or city. A further 35 per cent said they think they will visit a country they have never visited before. It may come as no surprise that younger holidaymakers are the most eager to try new destinations, with half of 16-24 year olds (49 per cent) saying it is ‘quite likely’ and a further 16 per cent saying they are certain they will visit a new destination. Older consumers, meanwhile, prefer to return to familiar surroundings. More than half (56 per cent) of over 65s polled by ABTA and half of 55-64 year olds said they would definitely not or would be unlikely to visit a country they had never been to.","British holidaymakers are now more adventurous when they head abroad .

"Parents are being warned about the risks of amber teething necklaces after a young mother found her 15-month-old daughter almost strangled to death by one in her cot last month. When Ashleigh Ferguson came into her daughter Ellie's bedroom, she found her usually bubbly child face down and silent, with her amber teething necklace twisted around her neck. 'It was wrapped around her arm and neck with a twist in between and my stomach just dropped with a sickening feeling that something like this could even happen,' Ms Ferguson, 26, told the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Parents have been warned about using amber necklaces to relieve teething in children . 'If the pressure on her neck had been in a slightly different point, it’s unimaginable,' she said. The amber necklaces, which are widely available through health food stores and chemists are said to have been worn for centuries to reduce teething pain. Retailers claim that when they're worn close to the skin, the amber beads release succinic acid which relieves pain. But the Therapeutic Goods Administration states there is no evidence amber necklaces offer any relief from the symptoms of teething and in 2011, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission issued a warning on the necklaces. They posed two potential hazards strangulation and choking, the ACCC said. After testing several products, it found the necklaces could break and release small parts 'which could result in choking hazards to children under three'. Ashleigh Ferguson found her daughter Ellie with one of the necklaces twisted around her neck in her cot, face down . 'It is likely that unsupervised teething infants wearing amber teething necklaces or bracelets will mouth or chew the product,' the report warned. 'Is it worth the risk, especially when used unsupervised as in a sleeping environment?' Jill Green, National Manager of Education and Bereavement support at Australian non-profit organisation Sids and Kids, said. Australian not-for-profit organisation Sids and Kids and the ACCC have warned parents against the product . 'We need to need to  look at why they're promoting these products. 'If you go into a nursery store, you'll see so many products that say they will prevent this and that. We need to be very careful that we're not manufacturing anxiety and we need more evidence that it works and more information about the risks associated with it.

"Jihadi John, unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi, had an obsessive crush on Ahlam Ajjot when they were at school together (both pictured) Merciless killer Jihadi John dressed like a gangster rapper, smoked cannabis and had an obsessive crush on a girl at school, friends have revealed. The ISIS executioner, unmasked this week as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, was in a violent gang which used Tasers to target rich victims and 'borderline stalked' a girl he was fixated on. Ahlam Ajjot, 27, has spoken of her horror that the world's most wanted terrorist lusted after her when the pair were just 16 and both attended Quintin Kynaston school in St John's Wood. 'He never spoke to girls unless he had to. He was awkward,' she told Simon Wright and Dan Warburton at the Sunday Mirror. 'I never knew Mohammed liked me and I can't believe it now when I think about him feeling that way. 'I was so shocked when I saw the news that he was Jihadi John. I couldn't believe the pictures of him in a balaclava and in Syria.' Another former friend, who wished to remain anonymous, has exposed the killer's teenage past saying he took part in rowdy vodka drinking sessions and smoked cannabis despite being Muslim. She branded the University of Westminster graduate a 'hypocrite' and said the fact that he portrays himself as a strict Muslim is 'laughable and shameful' because of his past behaviour. 'He smoked drugs, drank and was violent towards other boys,' she told The Sun. 'He tries to paint himself as devout, but he doesn't know the meaning of the word. The fact that he portrays himself as a strict Muslim is laughable and shameful.' 'I never saw him pray or wear Islamic dress — he would not even mention religion at all.' It comes as sources revealed the extremist was tracked down in Syria after using a student discount code to download computer software online. He used a laptop in the war-torn country to download the technology with the code identifying him as the former University of Westminster computer student, the Sunday Express reported. Counter terrorism investigators were able to pinpoint his location from the slip-up. The ISIS executioner was revealed as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi earlier this week who is said to have dressed like a gangster rapper and smoked cannabis at school . His role as Islamic State's sadistic butcher is a far cry from the 10-year-old schoolboy who dreamed of being a footballer when he attended St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school (pictured) 'In today’s electronic age of social media and technology, we chase the digital footprint before we chase the person,' a source told the newspaper. 'Anyone who has a credit card, a Facebook page or a national insurance number has a digital footprint. 'The same goes for a student number, these records are unique to that person.' Emwazi who has featured in six ISIS beheading videos, moved to the capital from Kuwait at the age of six. It has been claimed he was 'never the same' after suffering a serious head injury when he ran into a goal post as a child, according to a former classmate. He is said to have attended anger management classes because of his violent behaviour towards classmates at school. The female friend, who met Emwazi in 2001 when they were both 12, said he proved himself as a 'capable brawler'. 'I saw him get into a fight in the sports hall. It was over a game of pushing and shoving,' she said. 'He was suspended from school for two days because of that fight, but he didn't seem to care — he was very rebellious.' Once they joined the same gang at the age of 13, he would skip classes and smoke cannabis outside a convenience shop. The ISIS executioner, pictured with British journalist David Haines, was part of a gang was was violent towards other boys at school . 'He would enjoy sit-sitting in the corner, smoking weed. It didn't bother him that it was illegal or against his faith,' said the friend. Instead of attending his local mosque, he started hanging out in shisha cafes and looked up to older Asian men who drove flash cars, smoked cannabis and bragged of womanising. The 'painfully shy' teenager developed an intense crush on Ms Ajjot and followed her around, according to a former friend. 'Everyone could see that he was making a fool of himself and that he was borderline stalking her. But he just didn't get it,' said the schoolmate. He said Emwazi had a habit of putting his  hand up to his mouth when he spoke after being teased about his bad breath. The teenager was bullied and was given the nickname 'Little Mo' as he was so short. By the time he got to the sixth form, Emwazi's only friend was a younger boy who's older brother was killed in a US drone attack on terror targets in Somalia in 2013. Emwazi is said to have attended the demonstration outside the Harrow Central Mosque in North-West London in 2009 to 'celebrate' the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Emwazi (front row, second from left) pictured with classmates at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in west London where he suffered a head injury . Emwazi (red circle) is said to have attended the demonstration outside the Harrow Central Mosque in North-West London in 2009 . The Londoner was radicalised by fanatical hate-preachers and is now on the Syrian battlefields killing in the name of religion. One of his old friends said she saw him on Edgware Road, West London, in 2012 and he was wearing long, white Islamic robes. His role as Islamic State's sadistic butcher is a far cry from the 10-year-old schoolboy who dreamed of being a footballer when he attended St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school. Describing his ambitions for his life in his primary school yearbook, he said: 'What I want to be when I grow up is a footballer', and said by the age of 30 he would be 'in a football team scoring a goal'. He listed his favourite band as pop group S Club 7 and said his favourite cartoon was The Simpsons. Kuwaiti authorities are closely monitoring several of Emwazi's relatives who  live and work in the Gulf emirate where the Islamic State executioner was born, according to reports. A number of the executioner's relatives are working in Kuwait and like him hold British citizenship, Al-Qabas newspaper reported. 'Security agencies have taken the necessary measures to monitor them round the clock,' the paper said, citing an 'informed source.' His father Jassem Abdulkareem, also a British national, is currently in Kuwait and is expected to be summoned by authorities.","Jihadi John smoked cannabis and dressed like a gangster rapper at school .

"Last night Justin Bieber saw in his 21st birthday with a showbiz bash worthy of one of the world's biggest singing stars. The Champagne flowed, he took selfies for his 21.3 million Instagram followers that included his rumoured girlfriend Hailey Baldwin, and tweeted to his 61 million Twitter followers, 'Grateful to be alive!!! Love u!!! 21' And the Ontario-born heartthrob has much to celebrate - not only has he been a pop sensation for eight years but recent behaviour that seems to suggest he's put his rocky teen years behind him to embrace a calmer, more reflective adulthood. As Justin turns 21 today, we take a look back at his ups and downs over the years - from his very first single and THAT iconic haircut to his brushes with the law and attempt at a comeback . Yet, the rapidly maturing Justin celebrating his birthday today, with estimated wealth of $200million (£130milllion) is very different to the angel-faced teen who sang his heart out as a 13-year-old on YouTube. Born in Ontario, Canada, and brought up by a single mother Patricia or Pattie Mallette, he was discovered by accident after she posted a video of her son singing Ne-Yo's So Sick at a school singing competition on YouTube for their friends and family to see. She added more videos of Justin singing various R 'n' B covers until one day, music executive Scooter Braun, who worked with Ariana Grande, Psy and Carly Rae Jepsen, was searching for another singer and stumbled on his homemade performances. So impressed, he located Justin's school and tracked down Pattie and persuaded her to let him work with her son. At the age of 13, Justin traveled to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record a demo tape and one week later he was singing for Usher. Justin signed a recording contract with the famous L.A. Reid and released his debut EP, My World, in November 2009 which went platinum in North America. Justin poses with a fan on the Ellen DeGeneres show on February 19 . Last month, it was revealed that Justin will be the subject of a roast on Comedy Central - a sign that he may finally be ready to stop taking himself so seriously. Pictured: A still from the roast . Justin has a target 'tattooed' on his back to symbolise he will be the target of jokes for the night . TV appearances followed including a performance for President Barack Obama and the first family at the White House  and in 2010 he joined the remake of We Are The World to raise money for Haiti, singing the opening line - originally sung by Lionel Richie. Meanwhile Justin was  gaining a devoted following of Beliebers, girls who express their devotion to their idol on social media and travel the world following his every move. Even going through puberty couldn't change their devotion and Justin talked openly about having a deeper voice in his second album and remarked: 'It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and have the best vocal coach in the world.' Justin launched into fame in 2010 with the help of his mentor Usher (left) and talent manager Scooter Braun (right) He released his debut EP, My World, in November 2009. The album went platinum in the U.S attained double platinum recognition in the UK . Since then, Justin has become a wildly successful international superstar, with millions of devoted fans who call themselves 'Beliebers' The teen sensation began breaking into acting, playing a troubled teen in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in September, 2010, . His third album Believe, which came out in 2012, marked a different musical direction. Meanwhile, Justin may have been known for his angelic smile and saccharine lyrics, he started to earn himself something of a bad boy reputation. In 2013, at the age of 19, a video was leaked that appeared to show Justin urinating into a mop bucket and launching into a bizarre verbal attack on Bill Clinton. And while his 21st birthday today marks his status as a legal adult in the US., Justin has been indulging in adult pleasures since he was a teen. Fans are pictured in London waiting for him to arrive at the premiere of his 2011 movie Never Say Never . Justin throws his coat into the crowd as he performs at the 2010 Much Music Video Awards in Toronto . From 2010 to 2013,  Justin maintained an on-and-off relationship with singer Selena Gomez - but it seems even she couldn't keep up with his unpredictable behaviour . In January 2014, he was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, on suspicion of driving under the influence and drag racing, reaching an eye-watering 136mph in his rented Lamborghini. He was ultimately charged with driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. Just days later, Justin was accused of assaulting a limo driver in December 2013. The charges were later dropped. And that summer, in July, the controversial pop star faced a misdemeanour vandalism charge for egging his neighbour's home - an incident that resulted in the neighbour taking out a restraining order against him. In 2011, Justin got rid of his iconic bowl-style haircut and began to add more street style to his look .

Throughout all the drama, Justin maintained an on-and-off relationship with singer Selena Gomez - but it seems even she couldn't keep up with his unpredictable behaviour. The pair officially broke up in 2013, and now she is dating DJ Zedd. Clean-cut Selena, 22, has remained tight-lipped about their time together but she recently admitted in an interview on Norway's NJR radio: 'I definitely have so much respect and love for him,' She said: 'And he has heard [the song] and he has seen the video, and it's something that I feel like girls need hear, and it's something I'm willing to share with people. She admitted her single The Heart Wants What The Heart Wants is about him. 'He thought it was beautiful [but] I think it is really hard at first.' She added: 'I support him, I think I always will. I'm upset when he is upset, I'm happy when he's happy. I don't want anything to every happen to him, it hurts me.' In January 2014, he was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, on suspicion of driving under the influence and drag racing, reaching an eye-watering 136mph in his rented Lamborghini . Justin is pictured playing basketball with Chris Brown, who is infamous for his violent behaviour . Justin shared a picture of a private jet he chartered for a trip in December 2014 . Yet as the world seemed to tire of his antics, early this year Justin began making an effort to turn over a new leaf and win back his fans. His new career moves seemed designed to introduce to the world a new, mature Justin - someone who didn't mind laughing at himself and who might want to be more than a teen idol. First in January, he made his debut as a ripped, muscled underwear model for Calvin Klein showing off a six-pack and copious tattoos and in a pair of tight white briefs. The campaign made such an impact that Calvin Klein has amassed more than 3.6million followers across its social media channels ever since the photos were released. He appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which aired on January 29 with a new blonde hairdo and a humble attitude. 'Honestly I haven’t been on TV in a while so I’m a little nervous,' he admitted. The singer has long been close to his mother Patty Mallette, who was 17 when she had him. Pictured: The pair in May 2014 at a basketball game . Justin Bieber strips down onstage at Fashion Rocks 2014 in September in New York City . Justin opened up about his troubled past and how he has a positive outlook for the future. They also touched on the Comedy Central Roast airing on March 30 on the US cable channel, a brutal hour in which comedians write and perform eye-wateringly close-to-the-bone jokes about the celebrity subject. Both Pamela Anderson and Michael Hasselhoff have been good natured victims of the televised ritual. The event, which will be hosted by Kevin Hart, apparently was put together entirely on Justin's urging. A source at the network told Ryan Seacrest's website: 'Justin has been asking us for years to roast him, so we kept telling him to create some more material and we're thrilled he listened.' Justin told Ellen: 'I think it’s just cool to be able to laugh at yourself so. I’ve done some things. That might not of been the greatest. 'I just want to be able to ya know. And kind of just kind own up to some of the things.' In September, Justin was seen hanging out with models-of-the-moment Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner . Indeed, after the interview was taped, Justin posted a video online to apologize for his behavior over the past year and a half. He  said in the video  that he doesn't want to appear 'arrogant or conceited or basically how I've been acting the past year, year and a half... I'm not who I was pretending to be.' He added: 'Often, we pretend to be something we're not as a cover up of what we're truly feeling inside. And... just being young and growing up in this business is hard.' The star made another appearance on the show on February 20, showing talking about his new role in the ABC show Repeat After Me and then posing for pictures with one of his fans Jacqueline Melanson, from Boston, who was ecstatic to pose for pictures with her idol. He is also seemingly making an effort to downsize his lifestyle. Last week it was revealed that he has moved from a $60,000 (£40,000)-a-month mansion to a $35,000 (£22,700)-a-month house in Beverly Hills. With a new girlfriend, a sophisticated new celebrity clique that includes Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid, more acting roles in the pipeline, it's clear the man famous for his hit Baby is ready to be grown up.","Justin Bieber, who turns 21 today, has been a superstar for eight years .

"Islamic State murderer Jihadi John had links to the 2005 bomb plotters who tried to blow up London's tube system just weeks after the horrific July 7 attack which killed 52 people, it has been revealed. Mohammed Emwazi, who was unmasked as Islamic State's cold-blooded executioner last week, was a member of a terror cell that was known to have links to the failed July 21, 2005 attacks on London. Documents have revealed a key figure of his London-based terror cell talked to one of the terrorists on the day of the attempted tube bombing - the would be terrorist was later jailed for life over the failed attack. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Emwazi (pictured) who was revealed as Islamic State's cold-blooded executioner Jihadi John this week, was a member of a terror cell that was known to have links to the failed July 21 attacks on London . The revelation has raised even more questions over how Emwazi, the Islamic State extremist behind the beheading of western hostages, was able to run away from Britain and the scrutiny of the security services despite being a member of the watched terror cell. Emwazi, who was brought up in west London, was subject to a no fly order and was on a terror watch list but still managed to leave without detection. It was revealed this week that he was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab. MI5 was also aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014. And now, even more worryingly, it has been revealed at least one member of his network had a connection with the worst terrorist atrocity to take place on British soil. The failed July 21 attacks came just two weeks after four men blew themselves up on London's tubes and a bus, killing 52 people and injuring more than 700 in 2005. CCTV footage of failed July 21 bomber Hussein Osman (circled in green) at Clapham Junction train station . Metropolitan Police footage  showing Ismail Abdurahman with Hussein Osman at Vauxhall train station . Court documents seen by The Observer reveal a leading member of Emwazi's network had a phone conversation on the day of the attacks with Hussein Osman, who was later jailed for life for placing an explosive at Shepherd's Bush tube station. The documents show that security services were aware that associates of the 12-strong west London terror group had joined the four July 21 bombers at a training camp in Cumbria a year before the attempted terror attack. On Friday, Boris Johnson lashed out at Home Secretary Theresa May for watering down strict anti-terror powers which may have helped Emwazi escape the net and travel to Syria. The London Mayor accused his Tory leadership rival of giving the 'benefit of the doubt' to terror suspects like Emzawi. Mr Johnson's attack comes amid the growing controversy over who is to blame for MI5's failure to stop 'known wolf' Emwazi leaving Britain for the front line in Syria in 2013. The Government's independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson admitted MI5 may have 'slipped up'. But he said: 'One won't know until there's been an inquiry or a report of some kind.' But experts believe Emwazi was helped to escape Britain by his terror associates who had been allowed back to London by the Government in 2011. Mayor of London Boris Johnson (pictured right) lashed out at Home Secretary Theresa May on Friday for 'watering down' strict anti-terror powers which may have helped Emwazi escape the net and travel to Syria . It is understood that three members of Emwazi's network were made subject in 2011 to control orders brought in by the last Labour government, which meant they had to live outside London. But the control orders were disbanded by the coalition and they were instead subject to Tpims – terrorism prevention and investigation measures – which allowed them to return to London and re-engage with Emwazi. Two of the men on these weakened orders – known only as BX and CC in the court documents – aided with money, a false identity and bogus travel documents by the London jihadi cell. The power to relocate terror suspects was reintroduced a fortnight ago, under growing pressure from the security services. Mr Johnson slammed the 2011 'mistake' to scrap the 'internal exile' powers contained in Labour's control order regime. The Mayor of London said: 'We need to keep a very, very close eye on these people. 'The decision to modify the control orders, to water them down I think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able, when you are controlling these people to be able to relocate them, to take them away from their support networks and look after them, to monitor them properly. 'We are now back on the right track and it just confirms to me the vital importance of us being able to monitor these people, to keep tabs on them, to look at what they are saying to each other in their email, their electronic contact. 'This whole thing needs to be tackled very, very robustly. 'We need to have a very strong security response that gives our people, gives our security services and the police the surveillance powers that they need.' British Journalist David Haines (pictured) who was killed by Jihadi John - believed to be Mohammed Emwazi . Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette cooper shadow backed the London Mayor's attack on Mrs May. She said: 'We warned the Government from the start not to abolish control orders. I said in Parliament many times that those relocation powers were immensely important and that removing them would make it easier for terror suspects to organise.' The Labour shadow minister added: 'At the very least, the Prime Minister should ask the Intelligence and Security Committee to examine the period following the scrapping of relocation. 'Parliament needs to know whether the legislation to alter counter terror powers affected the UK's ability to prevent people travelling to Syria. 'The Home Secretary has a duty to protect national security, so if the decisions she made on legislation against expert advice have weakened national security instead, the public and Parliament have a right to know.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'Control orders were not working and were being struck down by the courts. 'Tpims have been endorsed by the courts, counter-terrorism reviewers, the police, and the Security Service. 'Following a review of the powers available to manage the terrorist threat, the range of measures available under the TPIM Act is being extended including a measure to allow Tpim subjects to be relocated to different parts of the country. 'Additionally the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, which became law this month, will bolster our already considerable armoury of powers to disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight, reduce the risks they pose on their return and combat the underlying ideology that feeds, supports and sanctions terrorism.'","Mohammed Emwazi was revealed as Islamic State's executioner last week .

"A 21-stone man who was bullied for his looks has opened up about how he dropped 8st in two years and completely turned his life around - by using Big Brother star Josie Gibson's exercise DVD. In his late teens, 27-year-old Adam Brown, from Southport, Merseyside, wore XXXL clothes and tipped the scales at 21st, and he saw no end in sight to his unhappy and unhealthy lifestyle. He said: 'Eventually I just learnt to block the bullies out. But then when I got home, the days' events would all go through my mind and I would sit and just eat countless packs of crisps, chocolate bars, big bottles of fizzy drink and ice cream.' Adam Brown has always been 'on the large side' (left) and was bullied at school for his weight. Over the past two years he has dropped eight stone and completely turned his life around (right) Two years ago Adam decided it was time to make a change. He gave up junk food and fizzy drinks and began walking his cousin's dog, which was the physical activity that kickstarted his weight loss . Even after he left school, the bullying continued and the stress of it all made him turn to food for comfort. 'I have even been refused entry to a busy bar because of my size,' he said. 'I took up the space of two people, so they refused my entry, which then resulted in me getting a big takeaway and going home.' He took a job at a bar, which kept him on his feet for hours at a time, but his love of alcohol and penchant for partying meant he gained even more weight. Finally, things began to turn around when Adam confided in a close friend that he was gay. 'She didn't judge me in anyway,' he said. 'She was there for me in every way a friend could be, she was my rock.' When he was bigger (left), Adam would be refused entry to a busy bar because he 'took up the space of two people'. The stress led him to turn to food for comfort . Adam lacked confidence and thought he would be single and overweight forever . After school Adam took a job at a bar, which kept him on his feet for hours at a time, but his love of alcohol and penchant for partying meant he gained even more weight (left) Not only has he transformed his lifestyle, but he is also now dating Ant Hookway, the love of his life (left). The couple got engaged this Christmas . Adam lost the weight with the help of Josie Gibson's workout DVD 30-Second Slim . From then on, Adam decided it was time to transform himself. He gave up junk food and fizzy drinks and began walking his cousin's dog, which was the physical activity that kickstarted his weight loss. Then he came across a workout DVD that changed his life forever - 30 Second Slim, starring Big Brother's Josie Gibson. 'I could do this from the comfort of my living room with nobody watching me,' he said, admitting that at first, he was so out of shape that he could only do parts of the DVD at a time. But as the weeks and months went by, the workout got easier and easier, and Adam began to see the weight slip off. The former Big Brother star event took to Twitter to voice her support for her number one fan, tweeting at him last week: 'You are so cute!!! Xxx I wish I could give you a little cuddle x'. Now, two years later, Adam is an incredible 8st lighter and 'completely over the moon' with his transformation. He has finally found the confidence to launch his own event-planning company, and he regularly gives advice via Twitter to others who are struggling with their weight issues. What's more, while he once believed he would remain single forever, Adam has recently found his true love Ant Hookway, who has supported him in his weight loss journey. The couple got engaged this Christmas.

"These pictures of Boris Nemtsov chatting on his mobile phone at a radio station are believed to be the last images of him before he was shot dead in a 'contract hit'. The 55-year-old former deputy prime minister was gunned down on a Moscow bridge on Friday in a 'politically motivated' attack which has sparked outrage and public mourning. The pictures show Mr Nemtsov talking animatedly on his mobile phone ahead of a radio interview to promote an anti-Kremlin rally, just hours before he was killed. Scroll down for video . Mr Nemtsov was seen speaking on his mobile phone at a radio station, just hours before he was killed . The images of Mr Nemtsov at Ekho Moskvy radio station are believed to be the last before he was killed . Footage emerged last night showing the killing, with a person jumping into a car and driving off . He can be seen sitting in the studio of Ekho Moskvy - the Echo of Moscow - an alternative Russian station which has been criticised by the Kremlin in the past. He had been invited on to the talk show to discuss the latest opposition march he had organised, which was due to go ahead today but will now be used to protest his death. The station has previously been reprimanded by the Russian authorities for accounts of the conflict in Ukraine which were deemed to have contained 'information justifying war crimes'. The images were taken on the day Mr Nemtsov was shot dead after taking his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya to dinner. Dramatic footage of the killing surfaced last night, with Russian media reports claiming the killer emerged on foot after loitering on the Great Moskvoretsky Bridge waiting for Mr Nemtsov. The clip appears to show the killer appear as Mr Nemtsov and Miss Duritskaya walk along the bridge which overlooks St Basil's Cathedral. Mr Nemtsov was seen in the studio of Ekho Moskvy - the Echo of Moscow - an alternative Russian station which has been criticised by the Kremlin in the past . Mr Nemtsov was shot four times on a Moscow bridge after taking his Ukrainian model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya to dinner . The alleged attacker is then getting into a passing car, driving off shortly before midnight. Critics have attributed blame for the murder to the Russian President, claiming his government feared that an incriminating report Mr Nemtsov had been working on would be made public. The findings are said to present evidence linking Putin's regime to the Ukrainian crisis which has seen thousands slaughtered. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fingered the Russian leader as the culprit of Mr Nemtsov's death, with mourners at the scene where he was shot also alluding to his murder as having been politically engineered. Opposition supporters will march through Moscow today, passing the spot where the politician was killed. The procession follows yesterday's protests which saw hundreds of mourners lay flowers and hold up signs reading 'we are all Nemtsov' - a reference to the Je Suis Charlie movement following the terrorist attacks in Paris in January. In the days before his death, Mr Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, said he feared being killed by the Russian leader. 'I'm afraid Putin will kill me. I believe that he was the one who unleashed the war in the Ukraine. I couldn't dislike him more,' he said in an interview with Russia's Sobesednik news website. The white car (pictured) that carried the assassins has reportedly been found by police not far from where the leader was murdered. Footage released on Sunday suggested his shooter may have been on foot and driven away after the killing . The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River . More than 20,000 protesters marched through Moscow in a mass demonstration against the killing of Boris Nemtsov, organisers said . Dozens of protesters with Ukrainian flags also gathered outside the Russian Embassy in London to voice their anger at Mr Nemtsov's death . He also revealed his 86-year-old mother's fears that he was be assassinated because of his outspoken views. '""When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that."" She was completely serious,' he added. She received a telegram from the Russian president which described her son's murder as 'vile and cynical'. 'We will do everything to ensure that the perpetrators of this vile and cynical crime and those who stand behind them are properly punished,' it said. 'Please accept my deepest condolences in connection with this irreparable loss. I sincerely share your sorrow. 'Boris Nemtsov has left his mark in the history of Russia, in its political and public life. He occupied significant posts in a difficult time of transition in this country. He always openly and honestly voiced and upheld his views.' He has now assumed 'personal control' of the investigation and his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the shooting could be a 'provocation' for the planned protest rally. Russia's Investigative Committee said it was following several lines of inquiry including the possibility someone from Mr Nemtsov's own party had carried out the killing in order to raise support for a forthcoming anti-government rally. Investigators also said the 'meticulously planned' assassination  may also have possible links to Ukraine events as well as Islamist extremist attacks. Earlier today around 20,000 marched through Moscow to protest at Mr Nemtsov's death. The huge crowd waved Russian and Ukrainian flags as they held up banners which read: 'I am not afraid.' Meanwhile dozens, including the widow of murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, gathered outside the Russian Embassy in London to voice their anger at the Putin government. Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55 . Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55. His 87-year-old mother Dina had a premonition that her son would be killed, according to the politician. He told earlier this month how his mother warned him: 'When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.' Nemtsov studied physics at State University of Gorky and earned a PhD in Physics and Mathematics. In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, Nemtsov organised a protest movement in his hometown, which prevented the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the region. The liberal reformer rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin and became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin. Nemtsov first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British premier Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia. She praised his market reforms after visiting Nizhny Novgorod where as governor in the early 1990s he led spearheaded reforms. The father-of-four, 55, was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail in January 2011 after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012. He was a prominent and vocal critic of Mr Putin and wrote a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and his inner circle to corruption. It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown. He has written more than 60 academic publications about quantum physics, thermodynamics and acoustics and  designed n of antennas for space apparatuses. Jewish advocacy website AJC named Nemtsov as one of the most prominent Jews in Russia thanks to his mother's heritage. In his 1997 memoir, The Provincial Man, Nemtsov revealed that he was baptised Russian Orthodox in secret. He leaves behind his wife Raisa Akhmetovna and four children.","Boris Nemtsov pictured in a radio station's studio just hours before death .

"British people are becoming more and more sleep deprived - and it's all down to bringing laptops and tablets into the bedroom. According to a new survey, bingeing on TV box sets is now our top 'lights on' bedroom activity with 34 per cent delaying much-needed kip just to watch their favourite shows. As a nation our average bed time is 10.43pm, but we're busy for nearly an hour (52 minutes) before we actually go to sleep, according to new research. Binge-watching box sets is number one sleep-stealers with 34 per cent watching DVDs in bed . The survey of 1,000 adults, which excluded sex as an option, found that binge-watching DVDs or streamed programmes from the internet is now the number one sleep-stealer. Checking social media feeds was still a high second at 30 per cent, followed by writing emails or working (17 per cent), online shopping (11 per cent) and reading at just four per cent. Guilty pleasures such as eating biscuits, having a cuppa away from the rest of the family and playing addictive games like Candy Crush also sneaked into the top answers in a poll by The Fine Bedding Company. Although 83 per cent questioned claimed to love sleep, and that it was more important to them than food (66 per cent), we're actually getting less and less every year. According to the survey, the average amount of sleep is now six hours 28 minutes, compared to our grandparents' generation who got a good eight hours every night. Although 56 per cent of us claim to be unsatisfied with the amount of sleep we have every night, but we can't seem to tear ourselves away from our favourite shows. Some respondents admitting that it was all too easy to press play again and miss out on beauty sleep. A minority will enjoy a snack in bed and a moment alone, while one per cent of us admit Candy Crush keeps them awake in bed when they should have turned their lights out . 1. Internet TV/streaming/box sets 34% . 2. Checking Facebook/social media 31% . 3. Working/emails/accounts 17% . 4. Online shopping/browsing/magazines 11% . 5. Reading Kindle/books/mags 4% . 6. Drinking/eating/snacks/treats 1.2% . 7. Playing online games/gambling 1.2% . It seems there is also a male/female divide when it comes to going to bed times, with the majority of men questioned saying they go to bed between 11pm and midnight, but most women were already snuggled up an hour earlier between 10 and 11pm. Sara Wadsworth of The Fine Bedding Company said: 'It seems we are becoming a nation of binge-watchers, unable to wait another week for the next episode. 'Perhaps it's time to bring a bit of balance back into the bedroom and try some sleep-enhancing activities a few nights a week. Instead of switching on a screen; try some gentle yoga stretches, listening to soothing music or even meditating. 'There are lots of apps available designed to enhance sleep and can easily be listened to in bed, putting that mobile phone to good use.'

"Ukip is to delay publishing its manifesto for as long as possible, party leader Nigel Farage revealed today. The party’s detailed pitch to voters had been expected to be set out at its spring conference in Margate this weekend. But Mr Farage today insisted he wants to release it as ‘late as practicably possible’ in the election campaign, which would give voters less time to challenge the party on its contents. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage today insisted he wants to release his manifesto as ‘late as practicably possible’ in the election campaign . Mr Farage has previously been forced to disown the party’s entire 2010 manifesto as ‘drivel’ which he claimed he did not read, despite writing its foreword. It included pledges to improve Britain by painting trains in traditional colours, deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers. Since then, the party has enjoyed a surge in support, topping the polls in the European Parliament elections and securing two elected MPs who defected from the Tories. As a result, Ukip has faced closer scrutiny of its policies, with splits emerging over key areas of tax, spending and social policy. Now it has emerged Mr Farage plans to keep the party’s policy pitch to voters secret for as long as he can. He told BBC One’s Sunday Politics: ‘My view on our release of the manifesto is we should do it as late as practicably possible because I think by then people will want to see something fresh, new and positive.’ Bizarrely, he said he did not want to release his manifesto yet because the ‘general election campaign has already gone on for far too long as far as most of the public are concerned’. He added: ‘People are getting bored to death. Every day there are all sorts of pronouncements being made by Labour and the Conservatives to appease all sorts of special interest groups. I think most of what’s being said is already going in one ear and out of the other.’ Tim Aker was been replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time. Ukip's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans was put in charge of the manifesto process, with the final document to be unveiled in Margate this weekend . Nigel Farage has disowned the whole of the 2010 Ukip manifesto, despite writing its foreword. Some of the more eye-catching policies in Ukip's 2010 manifesto include: . Parliament is due to be dissolved on March 30, with the general election held on May 7. In January it emerged that Tim Aker had been replaced as the Ukip policy chief after failing to complete the party's manifesto in time. Ukip's deputy chairman Suzanne Evans was put in charge of the manifesto process, with the final document to be unveiled in Margate this weekend. Asked why it was not published, Mr Farage said today: ‘No, no. That was never, ever said. The idea we would publish a manifesto so long before a general election.’ But Miss Evans made clear in January: ‘'I relish the task of putting together the final details and presenting a sensible, radical and fully costed manifesto at our spring conference in Margate.' Mr Farage has previously insisted all of the party’s manifesto will have been full costed, but suggested voting Ukip is about ‘a state of mind’ rather than detailed policies. However, policy splits have emerged. Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming that privatising large parts of the NHS was 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to' if the health service was going to stay affordable. But Ukip's health spokesman, Louise Bours, insisted her leader was out of touch with the public when it came to the NHS. She insisted the party’s policy on the NHS would contain ‘not a whiff’ of privatisation. Mr Farage also clashed with his economics spokesman Patrick O’Flynn, after he suggested a 'Wag Tax' on designer shoes and handbags. The UKIP leader tore up the plan for 25 per cent VAT rate for top-end goods insisting: 'It's dead.'","Ukip leader over-rules manifesto chief who said it would be public by now .

"A 26-year-old teacher from Oregon has been jailed in Japan after receiving a bottle of prescribed Adderall pills in the mail for her attention deficit disorder. Carrie Russell has been held at a detention center near Nagoya since February 20 over the pills, the Oregonian reported. Amphetamines - which include Adderall - are illegal in Japan. Russell's mother, who is a doctor in Portland, originally sent her daughter's prescription to South Korea which the 26-year-old then forwarded on to Nagoya where she was moving for an English teaching job, according to the newspaper. Carrie Russell has been jailed in Japan after receiving a bottle of Adderall pills in the mail in order to treat her attention deficit disorder. The drug is illegal in Japan . Authorities found Russell's pills tucked inside a Tylenol bottle, the Oregonian reported. Dr Jill Russell told the newspaper she put the pills in the Tylenol bottle so as not to draw the attention of thieves wanting to sell them. She also said that she acted out of concern for her daughter's social standing if anybody saw the pills. She said in an affidavit obtained by the newspaper: 'My repackaging was not an attempt to break or circumvent the law. It was intended to preserve Carrie's privacy and dignity around a sensitive issue regarding medication to treat a disorder which falls under the area of mental health.' Miss Russell's family said that she has been in a detention facility near Nagoya, Japan since last month . The 26-year-old was arrested at a Tokyo restaurant where she was dining with friends on February 20 and jailed, the Oregonian reported. Authorities are holding Russell on suspicion of trying to sneak in amphetamine drugs, according to the newspaper. The newspaper noted that a few notices, including a document from the Consulate General of Japan in Seattle, appear online and say not to carry Adderall into the Asian nation. Amphetamines were banned by Japan in the 1950s. The Oregonian also pointed out that there is a mental health stigma in the country. Russell's family learned about what happened on February 21 - one day after her arrest - according to the newspaper. The family's attorney in Portland, Loren Podwill - who is Carrie Russell's stepfather - told the NY Daily News that her family was working with the State Department to find a 'quick and successful resolution'.","Carrie Russell has been held at a detention center near Nagoya, Japan since February 20 .
