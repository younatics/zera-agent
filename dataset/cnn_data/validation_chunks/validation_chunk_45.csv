"An unusual time-lapse video made by a Washington, D.C. nonprofit fundraiser and his friends shows former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton aging from her teen years to the present. Clinton, 67, is the presumptive Democratic White House front-runner and would be 69 years and 86 days old if she were to become president after the 2016 elections. That would make her the second-oldest chief executive to move into the White House behind only Ronald Reagan, who took office 17 days before he turned 70. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . BORN IN 1947: Hillary Clinton, shown Tuesday at the United Nations, kept a grueling schedule as secretary of state but she would be the second-oldest president ever inagurated if she were to win in 2016 . JUNIOR CLASS VICE PRESIDENT: In this 1964 Illinois high school yearbook photo, the future US first lady was likely 16 years old . When then-Senator Clinton ran for president in 2008, she was 61 . A 73-year-old Reagan famously quipped in a 1984 debate against Democrat Walter Mondale, then 56, that he wouldn't make age an issue in his re-election campaign. 'I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience,' he said during a memorable debate. The new video, from a trio calling themselves the 'Calculating Clinton' project, shows Mrs. Clinton in 28 separate photos, each morphing into the next at 2-second intervals. One of the project's creators told Daily Mail Online that his partners include a social media executive and a professional videographer. 'I don't think her age disqualifies her from becoming president, but her politics and tactics are definitely relics of the 90s.' he said, requesting anonymity because his job doesn't involve partisan politicking. 'Our video is simply an exercise in branding. We have no money behind us,' he added, calling the effort 'just three young professionals interested in reaching people using nontraditional tactics and messages that break through the noise and stick with people.' He said there will be more videos hitting the project's YouTube page if Mrs. Clinton takes the plunge and runs for president. There's no indication most Americans today believe age should be a disqualifying factor for a presidential run. One poll even indicates Clinton has hid hers well. A Pew Research Center survey released a year ago found that 'the public tends to underestimate Hillary Clinton’s age,' with 60 being the median guess. A whopping 53 per cent of young voters, those under age 30, told Pew's pollsters that Mrs. Clinton was in her 50s. Another 16 per cent said she was younger than 50. Age perceptions appeared to be the least of her problems on Tuesday. TWENTIES AND BEYOND: Clinton in 1969 at Wellesley College (left), in a 1975 portrait (center) and four years later in 1979 (right), when she was 32 years old . WHITE HOUSE YEARS: Then-first lady Clinton pictured (left to right) in 1993, 1995 and 1997 . After a United Nations session on women's global progress where a South African diplomat introduced her to cheers as a 'future president,' she faced a gauntlet of hungry reporters in an attempt to explain an email scandal that has brought her an undesirable form of public attention. Mrs. Clinton told them that she had used only a personal email account hosted on a private server during her four years as secretary of state. She also said more than 30,000 personal emails were deleted, none of them vetted by the State Department for materials subject to the Federal Records Act. That law requires public servants to preserve an archive of all communications related in any way to their jobs. Clinton, who has been an attorney, the first lady of Arkansas and the United States, a U.S. senator and America's top diplomat, is expected to make a decision on running for president – or staying on the sidelines – next month. IN THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT: Clinton spent eight years as a US Senator (left, in 2001), ultimately conceded a presidential primary race to Barack Obama in 2008 (center), and led the State Deartment for four tumultuous years (right, in 2013) 1. Ronald Reagan: 69 years, 349 days . 2. William Henry Harrison: 68 years, 23 days . 3. James Buchanan: 65 years, 315 days . 4. George H. W. Bush: 64 years, 222 days . 5. Zachary Taylor: 64 years, 100 days . 6. Dwight D. Eisenhower: 62 years, 98 days . 7. Andrew Jackson: 61 years, 354 days . 8. John Adams: 61 years, 125 days . 9. Gerald Ford: 61 years, 26 days . 10. Harry S. Truman: 60 years, 339 days . Source: 'The Presidents of the United States of America' by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey . The grueling schedule of a White House run could take its toll no matter how fit Mrs. Clinton is, according to National Journal columnist Charlie Cook. 'In Secretary Clinton's last year at her post, particularly the last few months at the State Department, the position clearly took a toll on her health; she experienced an episode of fainting or passing out, and suffered a head injury,' Cook wrote last month. 'None of this necessarily is to argue against her running, but she would be undertaking something that, as she well knows, is considerably more physically demanding even than her previous position, and at an older age.' However history unfolds, the new time-lapse video's soundtrack seems to describe the inevitable outcome of the 2016 campaign just right. 'When the band stops playing,' a soulful singer intones on the video's backing track, 'only one will be left dancing in the round' – or in this case, in the Oval.","Video produced by nonprofit fundraiser and two friends shows former secretary of state's changing looks through the years .
Hillary Clinton would be 69 if she were to become president in January 2017, making her the second oldest to be inaugurated and less than a year younger than Ronald Reagan when he took office .

"Univision host Rodner Figueroa who was fired after making a racially insensitive remark about Michelle Obama now claims that the first lady's office may have played a deciding role in his dismissal. According to Figueroa's representatives, no one from the network complained when on Wednesday he compared a makeup artist who transformed himself into Michelle Obama to a cast member of The Planet of the Apes franchise. But later that night, hours after Figueroa's entertainment news show El Gordo Y La Flacaa aired, a Univision executive reportedly contacted the TV presenter and informed him that the first lady's office had made a complaint about the remark. Scroll down for video . Bold claim: Rodner Figueroa (left) claims First Lady Michelle Obama's (right) office got him fired from Univision after he compared her to a character from Planet Of The Apes on live television . The revelation implicating the First Lady’s team in the firing, first reported by TMZ, comes after a seemingly contrite Figueroa penned an open letter to Mrs Obama apologizing for his outburst. In the missive, the sacked TV host wrote that as a bi-racial, openly gay man, he is no stranger to discrimination and has long been fighting for minorities. He also stated: 'I voted openly twice for your husband, Barack Obama.' Mrs Obama has not publicly addressed Figueroa’s claim that her staff got the Univision host fired for mocking her. Venezuelan-born Figueroa, an Emmy-Award winning host at the Spanish-language network Univision, made the Planet of the Apes remark in a segment discussing the work of make-up artist Paolo Ballesteros who posts photos of himself transformed into female celebrities. Rodner Figueroa, left, made the racially insensitive remark on the entertainment news show El Gordo Y La Flaca on Wednesday . Figueroa, 42, was talking about how Ballesteros had transformed himself into the First Lady when said: 'Well, watch out, you know that Michelle Obama looks like she's from the cast of Planet Of The Apes, the movie.' When hostess Lili Estefan countered with 'What are you saying?' and host Raul de Molina said Obama was very attractive, Figueroa defended his remark, saying 'but it is true.' The show aired live on the East Coast, but his remarks were edited out of the version broadcast for the West Coast, reports Latino Voices. Later Figueroa co-hosted the evening gossip show Sal Y Pimienta, but by Wednesday night his photo had already been removed from the network's website. In a statement on Thursday, Univision called Figueroa's comments 'completely reprehensible' and said they 'in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision.' 'Yesterday during the entertainment show El Gordo y La Flaca, Rodner Figueroa made comments about First Lady Michelle Obama that were completely reprehensible and in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision. 'As a result, Mr. Figueroa was fired immediately,' read the statement. Venezuelan-born Figueroa made the remark in a segment discussing the work of make-up artist Paolo Ballesteros who posts photos of himself transformed into female celebrities such as the First Lady . On Thursday he issued an open letter apology to Michelle Obama. In it he claimed his comments were taken out of context and that as a member of a 'bi-racial Latin family' he isn't a racist, reports Latin Times. 'I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years,' he said. 'I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino. I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that is openly gay and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities, that have been discriminated against just like me.' Figueroa had won the award for Outstanding Daytime Talent in the Spanish category at the Daytime Emmy Awards last June. Univision is the largest Spanish-language network in the United States, reaching an estimated 94 million U.S. homes. It ranks fifth among all television networks in the U.S. Figueroa, who won the Outstanding Daytime Talent in Spanish category at the Daytime Emmy Awards last June, issued an apology on Thursday . Dear First Lady Michelle Obama, . I offer my sincerest apologies for a comment that I made about the characterization from a make-up artist that I made about you in the Univision entertainment program El Gordo y La Flaca. I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and it was directed personally to you, but to the characterization of the artist, that left a lot to be desired. The clip in full context is proof. I feel embarrased, I ask for forgiveness, because there is no excuse for a professional like me to make those types of comments that can be interpreted as offensive and racist in a volatile moment that we live in our country. I take responsibility for this lack of judgement in my part, but I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years. I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino. I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that is openly gay and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities, that have been discriminated against just like me. I openly voted twice for your husband Barack Obama, because I consider him a great man that respects minorities, like me, in this country. I worked on two Univision shows where I commented about celebrity style, including the real family and Latin first ladies and I have never offended anybody because of their skin color, sexual orientation or nationality. I am a decent person, but a human in the end that makes mistakes like this one. Although the comment was unpleasant and out of line I do not deserved being called a racist and I have to defend myself for respect and love to my family, my father, my fans and my community. I was notified verbally that due to a complaint from your office I was fired. An information leak from Univision executives, I was condemend in social media, trying to destroy my career in an unfair manner, without letting me know personally and without an investigation that would allow to clear up the situation. Again, I offer my humble forgiveness for the misinterpreation and I assume the responsibility. Yours respectfully, .

"A medical student on trial for stabbing a Georgetown law student to death has used a rare defense - claiming his girlfriend committed the murder, despite his initial confession. Rahul Gupta, 25, is charged with second-degree murder after Mark Waugh, 23, was found stabbed to death in Gupta's apartment in Silver Springs, Virginia in 2013. Gupta initially confessed to the crime saying he did it because Waugh was cheating with his girlfriend. But this week in court, Gupta's attorneys have claimed he only made the confession as he was protecting his now ex-girlfriend Taylor Gould, who had in fact killed Waugh, reports the Washington Post. 'This was an act of violent, crazy rage,' one his attorneys, Jennifer Page, told jurors, later adding, 'You bet she was capable.' Rahul Gupta (right), a medical student on trial for stabbing Mark Waugh,  (left) a Georgetown law student to death has used a rare defense - claiming his girlfriend committed the murder . But this week in court, Gupta's attorneys have claimed he only made the confession as he was protecting his now ex-girlfriend Taylor Gould, who had in fact killed Waugh (both pictured) Gould who has not been charged with anything and is not on trial, testified  last week, telling jurors that she'd been too drunk on the night in question to remember what happened. 'I had no reason to hurt anyone,' she said. Gupta, his 23-year-old girlfriend, Waugh and one other had spent the night celebrating Gupta's birthday. Gould consumed at least six drinks, including red wine, a whiskey-and-cranberry, an Irish coffee, and a margarita. Dark turn: The group spent a Saturday night out celebrating Gupta's birthday. The first three later returned to the girlfriend's apartment where they continued to drink shots . After drinking, Gupta and Waugh returned to Gupta's girlfriend's apartment in Silver Springs at 1:30am where the three continued drinking shots of alcohol. Taylor Gould says she was too drunk the night of the murder to remember anything clearly . Neighbors later reported hearing loud noises coming from the apartment, like people were moving furniture. Shortly before 3:30am Sunday morning, police responded to a 911 call made by the girlfriend. When they arrived on the scene, police reported hearing movements and yelling inside but no one answered the door when they knocked. Police opened the locked door and Gould approached the officers with blood on her and said: 'I don't know what happened. Can you tell me?' Officers noted seeing blood on the walls of the kitchen and living area and Gupta lying on the floor, covered in blood. They asked Gupta if he was hurt but he said: 'I don't think so'. Prosecutor Patrick Mays told the court that when asked what had happened, Gupta told them: 'My girlfriend and my buddy were cheating. I walked in on my girlfriend and my buddy cheating. I killed my buddy.' Officers found Waugh lying on the floor unresponsive and he was pronounced dead - he had been stabbed six times  and slashed five times. His lung was punctured and his jugular vein cut. The prosecutor said: 'Mr. Waugh did not die immediately.' 'He could have lived for several minutes before dying from loss of blood.' Mays told jurors that a palm print and fingerprint — in Waugh’s blood — also implicate Gupta. At police headquarters, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake, but added: 'He tried to kill me, though'. Who to believe? While Gupta says he was woken up by his girlfriend yelling, the girlfriend told police she was woken up by Gupta's yelling. She says she found him kneeling next to a bleeding Waugh and he told her to call police. Above, a picture of Waugh . Defense? While being questioned by police, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake but also said that Waugh tried to kill him . Gupta's attorneys argue the reason he was covered in blood was because he had been performing CPR on his friend. Defense attorney Philip Armstrong told the court that Gould, who is now a biomedical engineer in Washington, had got blood on the red dress she was wearing and then changed her clothes before the police arrived. He asked Gould why one of her contact lenses was found stuck to the back of Waugh’s pants. Waugh had graduated Magna Cum Laude from James Madison University in May 2012, and went on to spend the following year in Daegu, South Korea teaching debate. Waugh had started his first year of law school at Georgetown, and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honors society. Gupta had a similarly bright future. He earned his undergraduate degree from George Washington University and was back at the school studying to become a doctor. He also earned a master's degree in physiology from Georgetown. Fellow Langley High School-alumnus David Barton spoke about both men in The Breeze - James Madison University's student newspaper. He remembers both men for being extremely intelligent in their respective fields, Waugh in liberal arts and Gupta with science and math. 'It's very shocking when something like this happens when you know each person involved,' Barton told The Breeze. 'You think that - how can people you think to be rational have something like this take place. You just hope that the situation could have de-escalated'.","Rahul Gupta, 25, is charged with second-degree murder after Mark Waugh, 23, was found stabbed to death in Gupta's apartment in Virginia .

"Suspicious fires twice destroyed financial records of Reverend Al Sharpton (pictured) Suspicious fires twice destroyed the financial records of Reverend Al Sharpton, a report has claimed. The civil rights activist was running for office at the time of the fires, which were six years apart and in separate buildings in New York. It has been reported that Sharpton subsequently failed to comply with tax and campaign filing requirements. According to the National Review Online, the first fire happened in 1997 as Sharpton was running for mayor while the second happened while he was running for president in 2003. The fires destroyed ‘critical financial records’, the report said. The first blaze, on April 10, 1997 - five days before Tax Day - started in a hair and nail salon below Sharpton’s headquarters at West 125th Street in New York and investigators treated it as an arson/explosion case. At the time, the Reverend’s spokesman said the campaign had lost its ‘entire Manhattan operation’ while the mayor at the time, Rudy Giuliani, said the investigation centred on the salon rather than Sharpton’s campaign . The National Review reports that Sharpton said he was unable to file certain financial documents and blamed the fire for the destruction of the records. On January 23, 2003, a fire caused extensive damage in the offices of his non-profit organisation National Action Network on Madison Avenue. It happened a day after Sharpton submitted documents to create a presidential exploratory committee, the website reports. Investigators initially treated the blaze as suspicious but later put it down to ‘NFA (Not Fully Ascertained) – heat from electrical equipment’. But National Review Online reports that ‘significant oddities’ surrounded the fire and the investigation. The civil rights activist (pictured) was running for office at the time of the fires, which were six years apart and in separate buildings in New York . It quotes supervising fire marshal, James Kelty, who attended the scene, as saying that he found it ‘unusual’ when he was unexpectedly relieved from investigating the blaze. When Mr Kelty was told that the report into the fire was only six pages long with 38 pictures from the scene, he said that such a document would generally be ‘much more exhaustive’ given Sharpton’s high profile. The website also quotes sources about one of Sharpton’s former employees J. D. Livingston. It says Mr Livingston, who immigrated to the United States from Guyana, was first on the scene as the fire took hold. The report says Livingston claimed he was in a reception room when the fire broke out but that a major fire had developed by the time fire crews arrived. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton is pictured in April last year with US President Barack Obama . Mr Kelty is quoted as saying that this was ‘odd’ and ‘not normal fire behaviour’. Mr Livingston is said to have had Sharpton’s lawyer with him when he was speaking to authorities. The report says that the maintenance man, who died in 2014, had, at some point, been living in the US illegally. In an interview with the National Review Online, Sharpton confirmed that Mr Livingston had done some ‘side work’ with him, but dismissed allegations he was paying him ‘under the table’. When asked whether the fires were a case of bad luck, NRO quotes Sharpton as saying: ‘I would say that you could speak to people that would certainly, whoever they are, could have their views.’","Reverend Al Sharpton was running for office at the time of both of the fires .

"A 28-year-old Wall Street businessman is being investigated over $250million losses made by the insurance empire he set up. Alexander Chatfield Burns amassed a huge number of businesses, including several insurance companies, in his mid-20s. Colleagues said he would regular attended cigar clubs, the finest restaurants and even donated wine to the Guggenheim museum in the city. Alexander Chatfield Burns, 28 (pictured with friend Andrea Johnson) amassed a huge number of businesses, including several insurance companies, in his mid-20s. But is now facing an investigation after his companies reportedly lost $250million . Colleagues said he would regular attended cigar clubs, the finest restaurants and even donated wine to the Guggenheim museum in the city . But the financier is facing growing questions after he booked himself into Bellevue Hospital in New York a year ago and resigned from Southport Lane Management LLC, leaving a series of unusual asset transfers behind, the Wall Street Journal reported. Regulators in Delaware say Southport under Mr. Burns siphoned off millions of dollars of mainstream insurance holdings and swapped them with assets that are either over-valued or worthless. Among them is a painting Mr Burns initially believed to be by Caravaggio, but was later discredited as a copy by three art experts. Since the probe he has moved into a historic building in downtown Charleston, South Carolina. The Journal reported that Mr Burns had two insurance companies, two offshore reinsurers, a brokerage firm and a web of dealings with other insurers. His massive portfolio left him in charge of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in additional assets. Regulators seized control of the two main insurance companies last April. One based in Delaware is being liquidated, one in Louisiana has been sold. The insurance-company losses total nearly $250 million. Regulators in Delaware say Southport Lane Management under Mr Burns siphoned off millions of dollars of mainstream insurance holdings and swapped them with assets that are either over-valued or worthless . According to court documents obtained by the Journal, the companies still active have tens of millions of dollars in questionable assets. James Denlon, a Louisiana Insurance Commissioner, told the newspaper Mr Burns 'apparently is convincing and good at snookering regulators.' Jeffrey Leach, a former president at Southport, told the Journal he wanted to be a 'superrich guy'. 'His goal was to build this into a multibillion-dollar insurance operation,' he added. In statements sent through his lawyer, Mr Burns has called a lawsuit started against him by former employees Southport is 'baseless'. He blamed 'highly unexpected' events at the insurance companies which prompted a restructuring. He added that Southport complied with all relevant laws and that he doesn't face any litigation. Mr Burns has not been accused of any wrongdoing and is not party of any criminal or civil proceeding.","Alexander Chatfield Burns built a portfolio of businesses in his mid-20s .

"A 19-year-old man has been indicted on murder and other charges in the shooting death of a Las Vegas mother of four in a neighborhood gunbattle. The indictment filed Friday accuses defendant Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. of murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle. The shooting was initially characterized as road rage but was later found to involve more complex relationships. Scroll down for video . Erich Nowsch Jr. (pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom February 23) was indicted Friday on charges of murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle in the killing of Tammy Meyers . The indictment doesn't name a getaway driver in the February 12 killing of 44-year-old Tammy Meyers. Her husband, Robert Meyers, says she took their daughter home after a late-night driving lesson and fetched her 22-year-old son with his gun to find a driver who frightened her earlier. The 19-year-old's defense team hope the request to the coroner's office will be able to determine whether Meyers, 44, or somebody next to her fired a gun before she died . Police say the son fired several shots at Nowsch during the fatal shootout in a cul-de-sac outside the Meyers home. The 44-year-old Meyers was wounded in the head February 12 and died two days later. Nowsch was arrested on February 19. Nowsch's defense team said in court today they are trying to obtain surveillance video from Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers was allegedly teaching her daughter to parallel park the night before the shooting. They also want police to turn over radio recordings from the night of the shooting and the day of Nowach's arrest, reported Las Vegas Review Journal. The 19-year-old is being held without bail. He is due back in court March 12. Many questions remain after conflicting accounts from authorities and Meyers' family about what initially was characterized as a road rage attack. Following Nowsch's arrest late last month, his lawyers said he was high on marijuana while he was being questioned, and police knew it. He surrendered to the authorities after a stand-off in suburban Las Vegas. Claus said he plans to argue in court that anything Nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial. It's not clear what Nowsch told detectives after his arrest. 'People tend to say things that aren't entirely credible when they're under the influence,' he told the Associated Press. Attorney Augustus Claus said 'not only' did the police let Nowsch smoke, they 'watched him do it' as they tried 'to talk him down' during a standoff that involved a helicopter and a SWAT team. Last week, Claus said he may consider using a fractured skull Nowsch suffered as an infant at the hands of his abuse father in his defense. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson will consider Nowsch's childhood injury while deciding whether to seek the death penalty against him. Nowsch has been accused of shooting 44-year-old Tammy Meyers dead during an act of road rage. It has since been revealed that the Meyers family knew the suspect . The Meyers family initially claimed that Meyers had gotten into an argument with Nowsch while giving her daughter a driving lesson on the night of the February 12 shooting. They said Nowsch followed them home and shot at them. It has since emerged that Meyers went home and recruited her son Brandon, who brought his gun. Meyers was shot in the head and died after two days on life-support. Claus said he believes Nowsch will be able to claim self-defense because Brandon Meyers was armed. Last month, it was revealed that the Meyers family actually knew Nowsch.","The indictment filed Friday accuses Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. of murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle .

"Racing is usually a serious business for the royal family but at Ascot today, Prince Charles was met  a  sight so comical it triggered a fit of giggles. He and Camilla, Duchess of Cambridge, joined onlookers at the Lamb National, in which agile Herdwick sheep hurtle around a specially-built course, leaping over special jumps on a grassy course.

Scroll down for video . Prince Charles catches sight of the sheep hurtling over jumps at the Lamb National in Ascot .

And each one had a little  'rider', a cuddly toy dressed a jockey's uniform, holding on to the sheep's reins . The couple were flanked by Conde Nast president Nicholas Coleridge and Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, who looked equally amused by the fluffy runners.

Clutching her headgear with both leather gloved hands, Camilla, who looked elegant in a tweed coat with velvet trim, a silk scarf and knee-high brown suede boots, found her coat whipped open. And as the rain fell, she opened up her clear umbrella as protection against the elements. The couple, who recently returned from a tour of the US, seemed delighted by the rural display and as well as the sheep, the pair marvelled at stalls displaying traditional English wares such as slabs for dry stone walling. The Prince of Wales cheers the sheep competing in the race designed to raise awareness of his Campaign For Wool group to raise awareness of British wool .

"Lord Evans quit his role with the National Crime Agency to keep a lucrative directorship with scandal-hit HSBC . A former intelligence chief has quit his role with Britain’s top crime fighting agency to keep a lucrative directorship with scandal-hit HSBC. Baron Evans of Weardale, the former director-general of MI5, has resigned from the board of the publicly-funded National Crime Agency (NCA) after just a year, due to a ‘perceived conflict of interest’ as the bank has come under fire over tax-dodging allegations. In a statement, the crossbench peer admitted there has been ‘a lot of controversy’ over claims that HSBC enabled clients of its Swiss private banking arm to avoid tax. But he chose to keep his £3,000-a-day role with the financial giant rather than stay with the law enforcement agency which is Britain’s equivalent of the FBI. His decision to quit the NCA and stay with HSBC could put further pressure on Rona Fairhead, who is clinging on to her well-paid positions as a director of the bank and chairman of the BBC’s governing body. Lord Evans, who was director-general of MI5 from 2007 to 2013, wrote in his resignation letter: ‘There has been a lot of controversy over the alleged actions of HSBC clients and of the bank itself in recent weeks. I believe that though there is no actual conflict of interests there could be a perceived conflict of interests between my two roles.’ His resignation was ‘reluctantly’ accepted last week by the head of the NCA, Keith Bristow, who said: ‘I have accepted the resignation of Lord Evans with great regret. While I do not believe there is an actual conflict of interests, any perception of one has the potential to adversely affect the reputation of the NCA. Jonathan has made an enormously valuable contribution to the NCA over the past 15 months.’ After more than 30 years in the security service, Lord Evans retired in 2013 and soon afterwards became a non-executive director of HSBC, earning £125,000 for 40 days work a year. He also became a member of a committee the bank set up to combat financial crime, in the wake of the scandal that saw it fined £1billion in the US for allowing Mexican drug gangs to launder money through its accounts. Other members of the team include Bill Hughes, a former head of the NCA’s predecessor the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and the former head of HM Revenue & Customs, Dave Hartnett. But despite their efforts, HSBC has been dragged into another scandal that could lead to a police investigation. Baron Evans of Weardale esigned from the board of the publicly-funded National Crime Agency, pictured during a training exercise . Earlier this year leaked documents emerged that suggested HSBC’s Swiss private bank helped clients dodge millions of pounds in tax. The French authorities have since agreed that the account data, now held by the taxman, can be shared for the ‘purpose of investigating criminal offence’ and a meeting to discuss a probe has been held at which the NCA was present alongside the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Crown Prosecution Service, City of London Police and EuroJust. The NCA, set up to tackle organised crime across the country, has said it has no ‘live role’ in any probe into the bank’s activities. Lord Evans was appointed a non-executive director of the newly established NCA in December 2013. Its annual accounts show he was paid less than £5,000 in its first few months and would be paid less than £15,000 a year. HSBC will come under fresh attack from MPs tomorrow when the Public Accounts Committee quizzes former taxman turned bank adviser Mr Hartnett. Chairman Margaret Hodge said there was still a lot of work to be done in exposing tax-dodging by British companies. ‘I would be amazed if HSBC were alone.’","Baron Evans of Weardale has resigned from the  the National Crime Agency .

"As the author of the modern classic A Clockwork Orange and a famously outspoken cultural pundit, he is one of the greatest names of post-war British literature. Yet Anthony Burgess has been refused a commemorative blue plaque by English Heritage because, it claims, his significance and profile are 'not strong enough' for recognition. Now the snub has been criticised by leading figures in the literary world, who insist that the author is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century. Leading literary figures described Anthony Burgess (pictured) being snubbed for a blue plaque as 'pathetic' Malcolm McDowell  starred at the lead character Alex (pictured) in Stanley Kubrick's controversial adaptation of A Clockwork Orange . Last night Burgess's biographer Roger Lewis called the decision 'pretty pathetic'. And bestselling author David Lodge, who was a friend of Burgess, said: 'Anthony was a remarkable man. He was a polymath who was extraordinarily gifted in many areas.' Burgess was nominated for a blue plaque – which are erected on buildings to recognise where famous people lived and worked – by staff at the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in Manchester. They wanted it placed on a property in Glebe Street, Chiswick, West London, where the author lived between 1963 and 1968. They were confident of success as Burgess met all the criteria for the scheme – which is funded by public donations – including the stipulation that candidates must be well known and must have been dead for at least 20 years. Burgess wrote 33 novels but is best known for his 1962 dystopian work A Clockwork Orange . But on December 2 last year, English Heritage wrote to confirm the author had not been shortlisted, adding: 'The [blue plaques] panel noted his many achievements but… they felt his overall significance and profile were not yet strong enough to make a case for a blue plaque.' Documents obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws show the panel made its decision at a meeting on October 29. The minutes state: 'The panel agreed that Anthony Burgess was a prolific and energetic writer, but that it was too soon after his death to evaluate the merits of shortlisting.' However, members did agree that his name could be submitted for consideration again in five years rather than the usual ten. Burgess, who died in 1993, wrote 33 novels but is best known for his 1962 dystopian work A Clockwork Orange, which was turned into a controversial film by director Stanley Kubrick, with Malcolm McDowell in the leading role. Professor Andrew Biswell, who is based at the Anthony Burgess Foundation, said he hoped the panel would reconsider in light of activities planned for 2017 to mark the centenary of Burgess's birth. English Heritage confirmed a proposal to commemorate the author had been considered last October. 'The panel agreed that it was too soon after his death to arrive at a definitive assessment of his lasting reputation,' a spokesman added.","English Heritage blasted for refusal to grant Anthony Burgess blue plaque .

"Kelly Tilley has been jailed after she burgled a disabled pensioner's home to steal £550 in cash, leaving her baby waiting outside in its pram . A mother went into the home of a disabled pensioner who had previously looked after her children to empty his wallet while she left her baby outside in the street in its pram. Kelly Tilley snuck into the Stockport home of the 74-year-old after he had left his front door open and stole £550 in cash from his wallet. She then ran away, pushing her child in the pram. The pensioner, who has mobility problems, had been saving the money to pay household bills and had previously helped Tilley in the past by lending her money and looking after her children. Tilley, of Southport, was jailed for two years as a judge said it was a 'mean offence' in which she had intentionally targeted a disabled old man. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Tilley had stolen her way into the man's home at about 2pm on March 31 last year. Andrew Sinker, prosecuting, said: 'He went to the toilet and when he came out the defendant was stood in the hallway. 'He said 'what are you doing?' She asked him for a drink and some money. He refused and told her to get out.' The victim then went into his bedroom and realised his wallet had gone. Mr Sinker said: 'He went out to speak to her but she was running off down the road. Due to mobility problems he was unable to chase after her.' Police searched Tilley's home and found the wallet, with the 31-year-old claiming she had only gone into his home to ask for a loan. Tilley, a drug user, then fabricated a claim that he had agreed to lend her cash, but only if she performed a sexual favour for him. Judge Brian Lewis said: 'The victim had been a friend to you, he had lent you money in the past and he had even looked after your children. 'All of which makes it even more mean that you targeted him. 'When you went through that door you knew perfectly well you were not there to borrow money. You were there to steal. Kelly Tilley went into the house in Wavell Avenue in Stockport, leaving her baby in a pram outside . 'You knew he was no match for you physically and as you ran down the road pushing your pram, there was no prospect of him being able to catch you.' Judge Lewis said her unfounded allegation also caused him great distress and the public would be 'outraged' if she was not sent to prison for the offence. Tilley pleaded guilty to burglary and admitted breaching bail conditions. She was jailed for two years and 10 months and was given a four-year restraining order preventing her from contacting her victim. She had numerous previous convictions including theft.","Kelly Tilley snuck into Stockport home of a 74-year-old disabled pensioner .

"Caught in the act: A couple were photographer in a compromising position as the male drove a motorbike down a main road in the bustling tourist destination Goa . A couple were caught on camera in a rather intimate position - while riding a motorbike down a busy highway in India. The pair were snapped as they rode down Mandovi Bridge in Goa, and police have now tracked them down after an outraged politician shared the eyebrow-raising picture of Twitter. In the photo, the male appears to only be wearing a t-shirt and socks, while his lady friend can only be identified by her legs wrapped around him. MP Vishnu Surya Wagh, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said the picture was tantamount to a 'broad daylight sex show', although it is not clear whether the two love birds were having intercourse while travelling through Goa. After the Facebook post received hundreds of re-posts and likes, officers traced the couple and interviewed them in a Goa police station, where they admitted it was them who had been snapped riding indecently on the motorbike along the Mandovi Bridge, a popular tourist destination. Sharing the image, Vishnu Surya Wagh urged his followers to have their say. He wrote: 'HAVE SEX RIDING A BIKE... NO ONE WILL STOP YOU... THIS IS GOA... Disapproving: Mr Wagh urged his followers to have their say on the picture, which has been 'liked' more than 500 times on his page . Clocked: Politician Vishnu Surya Wagh sparked a police investigation after he shared the candid image of two people apparently having sex on a motorbike on his Facebook page . 'This broad daylight sex show took place right on the Mandovi bridge on Sunday afternoon. 'Not a single policeman on the way to stop them. 'A passerby happened to click this picture. 'What do you have to say?' Outraged: Mr Wagh used Facebook to criticise the fact that no police officers had spotted the pair driving the motorbike and taking part in a 'broad daylight sex show' Police tracked down the couple by firstly identifying the owner of the bike, which turned out to be a rental firm. When contacted they passed on the details of the couple, from the Indian state of Madhya Pradseh, who had rented the vehicle. After admitting it was them pictured, the pair were fined 1,000 Rupees - equivalent to £10 - by the police. When asked for an interview the man pictured refused to say whether or not he had only been wearing a T-shirt and a pair of socks, as the picture appears to show.","Pair snapped in an intimate position while riding through tourist trap Goa .

"Controversial CNN anchor Don Lemon has raised more eyebrows after inviting a member of the Ku Klux Klan to speak on his show about alleged racist chants by a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma. The news host interviewed James Moore, also known as Imperial Kludd of the Loyal White Knights, on his programme about race relations in America. The interview was conducted via Skype, with Moore in traditional KKK dress and sunglasses. CNN anchor Don Lemon interviewed a James Moore, also known as Imperial Kludd of the Loyal White Knights about race relations . It came as Mr Lemon attempted to talk to the KKK member about the controversy surrounding racist chanting by a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma and ongoing tension in Ferguson, Missouri. The exchange started with Moore claiming there were double standards when it came to race relations in unversities saying he had the right to freedom of association. The KKK member said: 'We have a right to associate with whoever we want. 'Is it a crime to have all white fraternities like there are all black fraternities?' However, when asked by Mr Lemon why he joined the KKK, he then attacked the news anchor, saying: 'By people like yourself who said I couldn't stand up for my people.' The interview saw people criticise CNN and Mr Lemon on Twitter for giving a plaftform to an organisation with such views. It is not the first time Mr Lemon has stoked controversy with his interviews on CNN. In November, he was forced to apologise after pressing an alleged rape victim of Bill Cosby on why she didn't use her teeth to avoid performing oral sex on the comedian. The interview was conducted via Skype with Moore in traditional KKK dress and wearing sunglasses . Mr Lemon said he had never intended to offend during his interview with Cosby rape accuser Joan Tarshis, adding that he too was a victim of sexual assault. The presenter said: 'As a victim myself I would never want to suggest that any victim could have prevented a rape. 'If my question struck anyone as insensitive, I’m sorry as that was not my intention.' Meanwhile in August, rapper Talib Kweli stormed off an interview with the host live on air after he criticized the media's coverage of events - including Lemon's own network CNN- - of the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown. The two ended up bickering over the coverage before the rapper walked away from the interview.","Don Lemon invited James Moore to talk about race relations on CNN show .

"The row over televised Election debates took a new turn last night following claims that David Cameron could take part in one after all. A senior television executive said ITV may ‘break ranks’ with the other major broadcasters in an attempt to include the Prime Minister in its debate. ITV won the right to screen the first of two proposed debates featuring seven party leaders. The BBC is scheduled to broadcast the second while a final head-to-head clash between Cameron and Ed Miliband would be shown on Sky and Channel 4. Breaking ranks: ITV could lure Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured here delivering a speech in northern Londo to mark two months until the General Election, to the televised debate . All the debates are planned take place in April but Cameron insists he will take part in only one debate involving seven party leaders – and only if it takes place before the end of March. So far the broadcasters have adopted a united stand in an attempt to ensure all three debates go ahead. But there were claims last night that ITV could agree to the PM’s request to bring the first debate forward. Original screening: The first UK tv election debates featuring the then opposition leader David Cameron (left) Nick Clegg and Prime Minster of the time, Gordon Brown . The source said: ‘There are bound to be voices in ITV saying that if the only chance of getting the PM in a TV debate is to advance it a few days, then ITV would be irresponsible to refuse to do so.’ But a source at a rival broadcaster said: ‘It would be a disgrace for ITV to stab us in the back.’ James Forsyth – Page 39 .","ITV won the right to screen the first of two proposed debates .

"A former teacher and his girlfriend who streamed depraved sex sessions with an underage girl live on the internet have been cleared of pornography thanks to a legal loophole. William Hanna, 65, and Dianne Whitehouse, 59, were previously convicted of causing or inciting involvement in child pornography for their offences with a 'damaged' 15-year-old girl at a Birmingham hotel. Both were also convicted, and jailed, for sexual activity with the vulnerable teenager. Cleared of charge: William Hanna, 65, and Dianne Whitehouse, 59, had their convictions of causing or inciting involvement in child pornography overturned as their live streaming of sex sessions was not permanent . But after the pornography ruling was quashed by the Court of Appeal, a retrial at Birmingham Crown Court ended with a jury being directed to return not guilty verdicts. The ruling came after it was judged the live streaming of the pair's sex sessions with their victim did not fit the legal definition of pornography, which must be recorded in a permanent form. Directing the jury to clear the pair, Judge Richard Bond said: 'These defendants have been convicted of sex offences. 'In regards to these charges it is a legal technicality we are dealing with it is important if someone is going to be convicted there are convicted on what the law states. 'The law says this offence can only be committed if data being streamed is recorded. There was no recording in this case, and if there was no recording then the offence is not made out.' Also took part: Ian McGlasson, 49, of Reading, was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions . Former Frankley Community School teacher Hanna, previously of Acocks Green, Birmingham, was jailed for seven years in 2013 after being convicted of three charges of sexual activity with a child. Girlfriend Whitehouse was jailed for six years after being convicted of two charges of the same offence. Their trial heard how they met their victim online before 'degrading' her in sessions at the Etap Hotel, off Bristol Road, Birmingham which were streamed live on the internet. In one session a man dressed in a catsuit entered the room and had sex with the teen. Jailing the pair in 2013, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said Hanna and Whitehouse had taken advantage of an 'intensely troubled and damaged child' and 'relished' her young age. He told them: 'You treated her not as a damaged child who needed protection, but as somebody who could be simply used as you wished. 'You involved her in sexual activity which must have had the effect of damaging her even further.' Of the live streaming, the judge said: 'In addition to the degradation of that child, she knows an unknown number of people have had the opportunity to view that degradation.' A third man, Ian McGlasson, 49, of Reading, was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions. He admitted six charges of sexual activity with a child, two of meeting a child following grooming and possessing and taking indecent images.

"The uncle of a boy killed by a school minibus who went door-to-door making a fake collection in his nephew's name, has avoided jail. Neil Stokes asked people for donation to go towards flowers for the funeral of 15-year-old Ashley Talbot. However, the teen's parents knew nothing of the £75 collection which was then pocketed by the 42-year-old recovering heroin addict. Stokes' own mother inadvertently reported him to the police after learning someone was knocking on doors asking for money - unaware the person was in fact her son. Neil Stokes, 42, pictured left, set up a fake collection after his nephew Ashley Talbot, 15, pictured right, was knocked down and killed by a minibus . The 42-year-old of Porthcawl, South Wales, later handed himself in the following day and initially told officers he needed to pay off a drugs debt. However, he later changed his story saying he wanted to keep the collection a surprise for his grieving sister. Following a trial at magistrates court, he was convicted of fraudulently making false representations. Stokes' nephew, Ashley died after he was accidentally hit by a minibus  being driven by PE teacher, Chris Brooks, at Maesteg Comprehensive School, in Bridgend, just before Christmas. At the time his family described him as a 'typical teenager, a practical joker with a wicked infectious laugh'. They said: 'He would brighten the darkest of rooms with his smile and sense of humour. Ashley will be missed so much by everyone, but will be with us forever in our memories.' Stokes' had previous been warned that he could face jail - but magistrates' decided against custody after being told his sister had suffered enough already. Defending barrister David Sedgwick said: 'She is the victim in this....she has lost her son and now does not want to lose her brother to a jail sentence.' After being released from custody, the court heard Stokes gave the money to his sister and the money was spent on flowers for Ashley's funeral. Presiding magistrate Jane Thorpe said Stokes had acted dishonestly and had 'ample opportunity' to hand over the money sooner. Ashley's family described him as a 'typical teenager, a practical joker with a wicked infectious laugh.' Pictured: Ashley Talbot . He was handed a 12-month community order as well as being told to pay £250 costs towards the prosecution. Speaking after the sentencing hearing Ashley's mother, Melanie, described her brother's 'betrayal' as 'disgusting.' 'The last time I saw him was when his bail restrictions were relaxed,' said the 43-year-old. 'He came up to the house and said he wanted to apologise at Ashley's grave. 'So I took him to the grave and he placed some flowers and said nothing. 'At that point I told my husband I didn't want him around us again. Ashley was hit by a minibus in the grounds of Maesteg Comprehensive School, Bridgend . The devastated woman discovered what her brother had been doing through friends who had generously reached into their pockets. 'He is an idiot for doing what he did, I am absolutely disgusted that he was using the money to pay for drugs,' she said. 'Years ago I knew he was taking drugs but I thought he had been clean for a number of years. 'I have barely seen my brother since it all happened. My mother begged me to go and see her on Christmas Day, but I told her I couldn't because he was there.'","Ashley Talbot,15, died after being run over by his school minibus .

"Sierra Leone's top sprinter, who went missing after the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last summer, has been arrested after he was found living rough on the streets of London. Jimmy Thoronka, 20, disappeared at the end of the Games and failed to return to the Ebola-hit west African country. The Guardian said it had interviewed him before he was detained for overstaying his visa and that he was held at 7pm yesterday while in an emaciated state. Jimmy Thoronka carrying the Commonwealth baton in Sierra Leone. He has been arrested for overstaying his visa and claims all his immediate family are dead from Ebola so he cannot return home . When Thoronka, the country's number one 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola. 'I couldn't stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on.' He is not working illegally, nor claiming benefits or housing, and understands the legal implications of remaining in the UK after his visa has expired, but said his situation is hopeless. After the Games, he stayed for a while with friends in Leicester - and found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by Ebola. Later he went to London and began sleeping in parks and on night buses and begging for £1 from passers-by to buy chips. Hampden Park in Glasgow was the venue for the track and field events during the Commonwealth Games . 'Some days I get no food at all. I wash in public toilets and sleep in the park,' he said. 'I wake up around 4am and if I've got a bus pass I get on the night bus and sleep there until morning. 'I met a man who sometimes lets me sleep at his house but I have to wait outside for him to come home at 10 or 11pm and I get very cold. 'We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England. Some days I don't think I'm going to make it and just feel like killing myself. 'My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don't see how that can happen now.' The newspaper said hundreds of people have been in touch to offer support, and a petition has been set up on change.org to support him. A GoFundMe page set up in his name only yesterday has received more than 700 donations totalling nearly £13,000. A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, but there is assistance available for people to return home when they are not entitled to remain in the UK.'","Jimmy Thoronka does not want to return to his Ebola-hit west African homeland as his entire immediate family has succumbed to the disease .

"The Queen is famous for her love of Launer London handbags while the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge rarely ever carry bags at all. One royal who has no such qualms about hand luggage is Spain's Queen Letizia who arrived to chair a charity meeting cheerfully toting a black leather number by one of her favourite brands, Hugo Boss. The 42-year-old was chairing the annual committee meeting of the Spanish arm of UNICEF - an event that she has attended nearly every year since marrying King Felipe. Hard at work: Spain's Queen Letizia was all business as she chaired a UNICEF meeting today . Serious though the business at hand was, Letizia's choice of ensemble proved a treat for fashion fans with the Spanish Queen combining a neat bouclé with a silk shirt and tailored trousers. Rounding it off was a chic tote by Hugo Boss and one of her trademark pairs of spike-heeled court shoes. Letizia, who attended the meeting with the Spanish Secretary of State for Welfare and Equality, Susana Camarero, is UNICEF Spain's honorary president and has long championed charitable causes. As well as her work with UNICEF, the royal is president of the Royal Board on Disability, which works to make life easier for the physically and mentally handicapped in Spain, and is patron of a slew of culture and media charities. The latter comes as no surprise given Letizia's own journalistic roots, with the 42-year-old enjoying a lengthy career in TV and newspapers before marrying Felipe in 2004. After a stint at Asturian daily paper, La Nueva España, she went on to work for ABC, a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in Spain. Glamorous: The royal opted for a businesslike ensemble comprised of a boucle jacket and silk shirt . Important: The Spanish Queen has been involved with UNICEF since marrying King Felipe in 2004 . Next came a spell at Spanish news agency EFE before a move to Guadalajara in Mexico saw her take on a role on local paper, Siglo 21. Back in Spain a year later, she worked for the Spanish version of Bloomberg, a news channel and agency specialising in economics, before moving to CNN+. By the time she met her husband-to-be, Letizia was working for popular TV channel 24 Horas, where along with anchoring the popular Telediario 2 evening news bulletin, she reported on a wide range of breaking news events, among the 9/11 attacks. Perhaps as a result of her reporting background, Letizia is one of the most enthusiastically pro-newspaper royals in Europe and regularly turns out for media awards ceremonies. By contrast, Prince Philip is notoriously mistrustful of the media and once quipped to the matron of a Caribbean hospital he was visiting: 'You have mosquitoes. I have the Press!' Queen of journalists: Letizia is also patron of several media charities and regularly attends writing awards . Predecessor: Letizia's mother-in-law Queen Sofia preceded her in the honorary president role . When asked by Guardian journalist Polly Toynbee whether he read the paper during a Buckingham Palace reception, an affronted Prince Philip allegedly replied: 'No fear!' Others to complain about the Press include Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - all of whom have run into difficulty with the media. Prince William, who last year threatened a pair of photographers with legal action after they were spotted taking photos of Prince George, is fiercely protective of his - and his wife's - privacy. Although the British media has agreed to follow guidelines laid out in the Editor's Code, foreign newspapers have printed a slew of controversial images, among them one taken as a gust of wind blew the Duchess of Cambridge's skirt up in Australia. Most notorious of all was an incident in which a French paparazzi photographer took photos of a sunbathing Duchess as she relaxed outside a secluded farmhouse from a road a mile away using a long lens. The resulting pictures, which were then published by the French version of Closer magazine in September 2012, left Prince William furious and he later took legal action against the offending photographer for invasion of privacy.","Queen Letizia, 42, chaired a meeting of the Spanish branch of UNICEF .

"Hundreds of children were exposed to meningitis, measles and other diseases after vaccinations were stored in a faulty fridge (file image) Hundreds of children were left exposed to meningitis, measles, mumps and rubella after vaccinations to protect against the diseases were stored in a faulty fridge. A letter has been sent to the parents of children treated at the Brierley Medical Practice, near Barnsley, revealing the vaccinations were stored incorrectly for five years. It warns that while a vaccine stored at the wrong temperature was not harmful, it may be less effective than normal. Staff cannot therefore be certain that children vaccinated at the practice from January 2009 and June 2014 are adequately protected. NHS England said a total of 515 children are affected, but only 351 are still registered at the surgery. Those no longer registered at Brierley will receive a letter from their new practice. Jodie Hardwick's daughter Scarlett Brown, one, will need every injection she's had since birth re-doing. These include vaccines against polio, whooping cough, meningitis, pneumonia, measles, mumps and rubella. Ms Hardwick, 23, said: 'I was disgusted. It's upset me knowing we are going to have to go through that again with her. 'It's disgusting that from 2009 to 2014 they could not have found a fault in all that time - they should have picked it up before now. 'I'm not happy at all and I'm in the process of changing to another doctor because of this situation.' Another mother, Marie Seargent, recently left the Brierley practice. But her 16-month-old daughter Skylar-Jade Hill was vaccinated at Brierley. Ms Seargent, 36, said: 'I've not even received a letter. I phoned Brierley surgery and was told to contact my health visitor. 'But my health visitor didn't have a clue about it. I phoned my own GP and they weren't aware of it. 'I'm worried because I don't know if my daughter is covered or not.' The surgery was taken over by a new health care team in July. A statement on the practice website reads: 'The practice has already benefited from various improvements since the take over and the Trust is continuing to try and improve the practice buildings as well as planned vast improvements in patient care.' The surgery was previously run by Dr Magdi Selim and partners. Dr Selim had been the subject of several private hearings of the Medical Practitioners' Tribunal Service and restrictions to his practice had been made. NHS England said a total of 515 children are affected. A letter sent to parents of the affected children warns that while a vaccine stored at the wrong temperature was not harmful, it may be less effective than normal. Among the vaccines stored incorrectly was one for meningitis, pictured under the microscope . Among the restrictions imposed was that Dr Selim be monitored by another doctor. Fiona Jorden, consultant in public health for NHS England, Yorkshire and Humber, said: 'We would like to offer our apologies for any concern that has been caused to patients and their families by this incident. 'Once the problem was discovered, all affected patients were identified and contacted as soon as possible. 'The vaccinations given to patients will not have caused them any harm and may have provided some protection against infections. 'However, as a precautionary measure and to ensure they have the optimum protection the vaccines have to offer, all affected patients have now been encouraged to make an appointment to receive further vaccinations as required. 'NHS England is committed to commissioning high-quality primary care services for patients.' A number of sessions for re-vaccination have been organised for registered patients throughout March.","Letter sent to parents of children treated at Brierley Medical Practice .

"Jasmine Coleman, 12, has been found safe and well some 50 miles from her home . A 12-year-old girl who went missing from her family home at 2am amid fears she was driven away by an 'older man' has been found safe and well. Jasmine Coleman was reported as missing this morning after disappearing from her home in Lancing, West Sussex. The child was found this afternoon following a police appeal some 50miles away in Croydon, south east London. Police feared she may have been driven to London by an older man when they launched an appeal for information this morning. The schoolgirl had not been seen since 11.30pm on Friday night. Sussex Police said she may have been talking with someone on FaceTime before disappearing at around 2am. The force launched a public appeal for information on her whereabouts on Saturday morning. In it, she was described as fair with long, blonde hair and as having possibly been wearing black riding trousers and a polo shirt or a Paisley pattern dress. On Saturday afternoon the force confirmed she had been found safe and well in Croydon but could not confirm the circumstances under which police located her. No one has been arrested in connection with her disappearance. Shortly after 4pm a spokesman said: 'Jasmine Coleman, the 12-year-old girl from Lancing reported missing from home during the early hours of Saturday (21 March) was found safe and well later the same day in Croydon. 'Police would like to thank the media and members of the public for help given during efforts to trace her.

"Saudi Arabia is pushing ahead with plans to complete building work on a new megacity in the desert. The King Abdullah Economic City, or KAEC (pronounced 'cake'), will be slightly larger than Washington DC and home to approximately two million residents. Covering 70 square miles, the metropolis is costing £67 billion ($100 billion) and lies 100km from Jeddah, the commercial hub of the kingdom, near the Red Sea. Scroll down for video . Covering 70 square miles, the metropolis costs £67 billion ($100 billion) and will reinvigorate the country . The entrance of King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) which will have a industrial complex and financial centre . The late king had pinned his hopes for his country's future on the new-build, although at the moment it resembles a dusty building site dotted with cranes and work is not likely to be completed for ten years, at least. So far 15 per cent has  been built, as public facilities and residential areas are still under construction. Plans include a port, industrial complex, a financial island, beach facilities and residential neighbourhoods. KAEC is one of four new cities being built to diversify an economy that is overly dependent on oil. Already it has its own website showing plans, maps and including details on how to invest. Fadi Al-Rasheed, the managing director of Emaar Economic City, the publicly traded Saudi company that runs the entire KAEC project, told the BBC: . Only 15 per cent has been developed, as public facilities and residential areas are still under construction . KAEC has its own website showing plans for the city, including details on how to invest in its growth . 'We're building with the 65 per cent of the population who are under 30 in mind,' he explains. 'And we have almost 200,000 Saudis studying abroad. Inevitably they are going to change things when they come back.' Given that more women than men graduate from university, it is likely the Saudi landscape will shift over the coming years in more ways that one. Cranes stand beside new high rise buildings under construction in the King Abdullah financial district of Riyadh . There are 90 km of roads in use in KAEC but, under present deeply held religious beliefs prohibiting it, no women in the country are able to drive on them. The  city's future hinges on many things including the complex relationships between health, education, housing and employment requirements and infrastructure. It will also open up transport links around the kingdom and internationally. A group look at a model of the planned city which aims to create one of the world's largest ports . 'We aim to create one of the world's largest ports,' Rayan Bukhari, a young manager at the King Abdullah port told the BBC. 'We're not competing with Jeddah's Islamic port - but we are going to take business away from Jebel Ali in Dubai. That's because of our quicker, more automated offloading and customs procedure.' The late King Abdullah had pinned his hopes for his country's future on the innovative city as oil runs out . 'Freight arriving at the port will be taken directly to the capital via the new land bridge,' he says, 'At the moment lots of products destined for Riyadh are shipped to Dubai, but that will change. They'll be shipped here as it is cheaper - and can be delivered more quickly within the Kingdom.' KAEC is also expected to become an important tourist stopover for pilgrims, aided by the fact Mecca and Medina are on the high speed train network that links KAEC with the two holy cities. At the moment Mecca is one hour and twenty minutes drive away and Medina is three hours by car. The Haramain train station will open at the end of this year and has been designed by British architect Norman Foster, also the man behind London's 'Gerkin' skyscraper and New York's Hearst Tower. The station will provide acceleration to area's developmental plan and will reduce the journey to Jeddah to 30 minutes.The megaproject on KAEC was announced in 2005. The project is largely privately funded and the government has set up an Economic Cities Authority overseeing the four megacities able to deal swiftly with every licence, construction permit and approval needed.","The King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) will be home to two million people in total .

"Scott Walker's children plan to skip college next fall to talk about their dad with New Hampshire voters, but the Wisconsin governor has stopped short of formally saying he is running for president. So, too, has former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He carefully avoided declaring himself a candidate for the Republican nomination even though his two-day visit to this early nominating state had all of the marks of a White House bid. Welcome to cagey and often absurd early stages of this campaign for president. Walker delivered remarks on Saturday, in which he called for more state and local control over education - as well as a stronger U.S. foreign policy. Scroll down for video . Presidential run? Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker greets fellow Republicans at a training workshop for the state Republican Party on Saturday inside Concord High School . Changes: In his speech, Walker called for more state and local control over education . Walker, Bush, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas all are afoot in New Hampshire this weekend, meeting with party activists and elders. And each, like the others who have been or soon will be coming, are taking great pains to avoid stating the obvious and triggering the headaches that come with being a full-blown candidate. But there are plenty of slips along the way, such as when Walker disclosed Saturday that his 19- and 20-year-old sons plan to ditch college this fall. 'They twisted our arms to figure out a way to maybe take part of a semester off next year, next fall, to come to New Hampshire, to come around the country and talk to young people like themselves,' Walker said. Walker also promised he would return to New Hampshire often, even though he was circumspect on why the governor of a Midwestern state would take such a shine to New Hampshire if he weren't running for the GOP nomination. 'We'll be back many more times to New Hampshire,' he promised. Not waiting for Walker to make official his candidacy, union members rallied outside the political event. Walker as governor has dramatically rolled back union rights in his state and labor groups are already running their own campaign against his bid. A similar wink and nod came from Bush, who drew a large number of out-of-state reporters to his meetings with business leaders in southern New Hampshire on Friday. Walker made his appearance in New Hampshire, a launching pad for presidential election campaigns because its primary is the first in the country, a week after signing a so-called 'right-to-work' bill. The law prevents labor unions in Wisconsin from forcing workers to pay dues, but opponents contend its underlying goal is to undermine organized labor. Walker has embraced the issue of limiting the power of unions as his signature cause, making him the target of a failed recall campaign three years ago. Before Walker’s speech at Concord High School, union members protested outside, holding signs that said, 'Stop the war on workers,' and 'Scott Walker: stop trashing the middle class.' Speaking in a full auditorium, Walker said he would not be cowed by those who disagreed with him. 'They seek to intimidate,' Walker said. 'But we never lost focus. We did what we had to do, and that’s what’s needed in America today.' Overseas interaction: Walker also called for a stronger U.S. foreign policy, calling 'radical Islamic terrorism' the greatest security threat facing the United States . Walker made his appearance in New Hampshire, a launching pad for presidential election campaigns because its primary is the first in the country, a week after signing a so-called 'right-to-work' bill . Walker has embraced the issue of limiting the power of unions as his signature cause, making him the target of a failed recall campaign three years ago. Protesters are seen outside his Saturday event . The 'right-to-work' issue has been contentious in New Hampshire. Legislators have sponsored several bills to make union membership optional, but the legislation failed to clear both chambers and would have faced certain vetoes by Democratic governors. In his speech, Walker called for more state and local control over education, a position that distinguished him from Bush, who has backed the controversial Common Core national standards. Walker also called for a stronger U.S. foreign policy, calling 'radical Islamic terrorism' the greatest security threat facing the United States. Walker was quoted by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as saying 'We need a president who will do whatever it takes, whatever it takes. Who understands we have an ally in Israel and we should start acting like it. Who understands that radical Islamic terrorism is like a virus and if you don't take it out entirely, it's like a virus in your computer that will keep coming back.' The Republican governor also reportedly said at the event that he was wearing a $1 Kohl's sweater and also described a teenage job at McDonald's. Walker, the Journal Sentinel reported, 'earned an enthusiastic response from the crowd in Concord.' Walker also took aim at Democratic President Barack Obama and polices he said measured success based on how many people were dependent on the government. 'We should measure success on just the opposite, on how many are not dependent on the government,' Walker said. Maurice Tandy, 81, a resident of the nearby town of Franklin, said Walker’s message resonated with him. 'He wants to bring government closer to the people, back to the towns and cities.' Jennifer Horn, the New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman, told the Boston Herald 'It was a great day for the Republican Party, no question about it. We had 400 grass-roots activists together, energized, excited. Obviously, Gov. Walker was very well-received.' Ex-New Hampshire state senator and Walker supporter Jim Luther told WKOW 'He just comes across as a very straightforward guy and I think he has a very unique voice to speak to the center.' The television station reported that the majority of people present haven't picked a GOP primary candidate to back yet. TIME reported that Walker also dismissed the the idea he's a 'flip-flopper' on issues Saturday, saying the term is 'Just a narrative from the other campaigns that are frustrated with the fact that we've got a strong reputation of keeping our word.' According to the news outlet, Walker did acknowledge changing his immigration views. Competition: Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush speaks with members of the media after visiting a packed house party on Friday, March 13, 2015, in Dover, New Hampshire . Meanwhile, Bush said 'I have brought all my friends from outside of New Hampshire to come do their part to enhance the economic climate of Nashua.' And when asked how he, as president, would confront Islamic State militants, Bush made a point of saying he was not yet a candidate for the office. 'I get really nervous about not triggering a campaign with all of these people around,' Bush said. Each of the likely candidates is coached to couch their ambitions in hypotheticals. Walker's 'not being a declared candidate' caveat and Bush's 'I'm considering the possibility of running' statements are merely formalities at this point. Several candidates are likely to start taking the next steps in April, and most have been laying the groundwork for a campaign for months if not years. For instance, Walker was tardy for a state party training session Saturday morning because he was held up in private meetings with those he hopes will back his campaign in waiting. On his dance card on this trip: former Gov. John H. Sununu, former Sen. Scott Brown, Manchester Mayor Ted Gatsas, state Senate President Chuck Morse and county party chairs. 'There are so many people hoping to get a few minutes with the governor,' New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn told waiting activists on Saturday. When he eventually arrived to a warm reception, Horn introduced him: 'We're so grateful he's made time for us.'","Scott Walker's children plan to skip college next fall to talk about their dad with New Hampshire voters .

"Health bosses in north Wales are urging patients to buy simple painkillers, laxatives and hayfever treatments rather than relying on free prescriptions . Patients in the Welsh NHS are being told not to use their free prescriptions – because of Labour's 'funding cuts'. Hundreds of thousands of people who live in north Wales were yesterday urged not to ask their GP to prescribe a range of medicines for minor complaints, such as painkillers, laxatives and hay fever treatments. Instead, patients are encouraged to 'self-care' and 'purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments'. The restrictions are being imposed because of the 'economic climate' and to 'cope with the funding cuts', the largest health board in the principality said yesterday. Labour, which runs the Health Service in Wales as a result of devolution, has cut health funding by more than 8 per cent since 2010. But in England, where the NHS is under the control of the Coalition, spending has risen slightly in real terms since the election. The Daily Mail has focused on some of the adverse effects of the cuts including longer waits for ambulances, far more people waiting more than four hours in A&E than in England, and poor cancer care – with some Welsh patients being forced to move to England to get cancer drugs. In January the strain on the Welsh NHS was highlighted when the furious wife of a paramedic posted online a photograph of at least ten ambulances – together with three rapid response cars – waiting outside Morriston Hospital in Swansea to unload patients at its overwhelmed A&E department. Last night the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew Davies, said: 'Welsh Labour's savage cuts to the NHS have come at a time when spending has been protected in other parts of the United Kingdom, with obvious consequences. 'Not only have we recently witnessed the worst ambulance response times since records began, more patients than ever are waiting over 12 hours in A&E, and Welsh cancer patients continue to be denied access to life-saving drugs which are available in England under the Coalition's Cancer Drug Fund.' Prescriptions are free to all in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but in England a charge of £8.20 is applied unless the patient is exempt. How the Mail exposed the crisis: Ten ambulances queue to unload patients at an A&E in Swansea . Pensioners and children are among those who do not pay for their prescriptions in England. Yesterday Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which covers much of north Wales, urged people no longer to ask their GP to be prescribed medicines they could buy over the counter at their local pharmacy. Betsi Cadwaladr has asked GPs to reduce 'unnecessary prescribing of simple medications', including painkillers, laxatives, vitamins, hayfever and head lice treatments. They say patients can purchase these drugs at a 'minimum cost', often more cheaply than it would cost the NHS to supply the drugs. The board said in a statement that, with the 'current economic climate putting a sharp focus on public spending', the local NHS needed to take 'tough decisions' to help address 'gaps in funding'. Dr Berwyn Owen, clinical director of pharmacy and medicines management, said: 'Many of these [over-the-counter] products can be purchased at a minimum cost and often much more cheaply than it would cost the NHS. 'We spend £4million every year on over-the-counter medicines and this year we are experiencing a significant growth in their cost. A 2 per cent reduction would reduce our costs by an estimated £80,000, which at a time when the NHS is under constant pressure is a significant amount. 'We can make savings through encouraging patients to 'self-care' and to purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments.' He added that community pharmacists are highly trained and are in 'an ideal position to assist with 'self care', and offer advice on the most appropriate product for patients. They say patients can purchase these drugs at a 'minimum cost', often more cheaply than it would cost the NHS to supply the drugs. The board said it spends four million pounds a year on over the counter drugs . Dr Owen added that the board have asked GPs in the area to reduce unnecessary prescribing of these simple medications. 'However, be reassured that if your GP considers it essential that you take the medication for your condition, it will be prescribed to you,' he said. 'This will not only free up your GP's time, but will also reduce waste through the prescribing of additional quantities for use on a future basis or 'just in case'. Conservative shadow health minister Darren Millar seized on Dr Owen's comments, telling the BBC they are 'recognition that Labour's universal free prescriptions policy is unaffordable and wastes vital funds which could be spent improving patient care'. Geoff Ryall-Harvey, chief officer for the North Wales Community Health Council said: 'Our members welcome this drive by health boards, both locally and nationally, and see it as a positive way forward in reducing the huge amount of waste that comes from repeat prescriptions and stockpiling of medications by patients. 'However, it is also reassuring that in some situations the doctor can still prescribe these medicines on the NHS.' ÷Doctors from the Clwyd North division of the British Medical Association have passed a vote of no confidence in the same Welsh health board over its plans to downgrade the maternity unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan for 12 months.","Betsi Cadwaladr health board urge patients to buy over the counter drugs .

"A crystal with a ‘forbidden symmetry’ that was once thought to be impossible to form naturally has been found. The so-called quasicrystal was discovered in a 4.5 billion-year-old meteorite in a remote region of northeastern Russia. And studying it could help scientists find out how mysterious materials like this formed in the universe. Scientists at Princeton University, New Jersey studied an ancient meteorite (shown) and found a quasicrystal with a structure that it was once dubbed 'impossible'. It was thought such material could not naturally occur in nature because the crystal has a symmetry in which atoms shouldn't form . The discovery was made by a team from Princeton University, and is the second natural quasicrystal ever found - both in this meteorite. Prior to the team finding the first natural quasicrystal in 2009, researchers thought that the structures were too fragile and energetically unstable to be formed by natural processes. ‘The finding of a second naturally occurring quasicrystal confirms that these materials can form in nature and are stable over cosmic time scales,’ said Dr Paul Steinhardt from Princeton University. On the outside, quasicrystals are solid minerals that look like quite normal, but it is their inner structure that fascinates scientists. Instead of the regularly repeating clusters of atoms seen in most crystals, quasicrystals contain a more subtle and intricate atomic arrangement involving two or more repeating clusters. As a result, a quasicrystal’s atoms can be arranged in ways that are not commonly found in crystals, such as the shape of a 20-sided icosahedron with the symmetry of a soccer ball. The difference between crystals and quasicrystals can be visualized by imagining a tiled floor: Tiles that are six-sided hexagons can fit neatly against each other to cover the entire floor. But five-sided pentagons or 10-sided decagons laid next to each will result in gaps between tiles. The team published the findings in the journal Scientific Reports. Dr Steinhardt said the discovery raises the possibility that other types of quasicrystals can be formed in nature. Quasicrystals are very hard, have low friction, and don't conduct heat very well - making them good candidates for applications such as protective coatings on items ranging from airplanes to non-stick cookware. The newly discovered quasicrystal, which is yet to be named, has a structure that resembles flat 10-sided disks stacked in a column. This type of structure is impossible in ordinary crystals, in which atoms are packed closely together in a repeated and orderly fashion, earning it the ‘forbidden symmetry’ moniker. ‘The structure is saying '”I am not a crystal, but on the other hand, I am not random either,”’ Dr Steinhardt said. Crystals with these ‘forbidden symmetries’ had been created in the laboratory, but it wasn't until 2009 that Dr Steinhardt and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal, now known as icosahedrite, in a rock that had been collected years before in Chukotka, Russia. On the left, the top panel shows the symmetry of the first natural quasicrystal called icosahedrite. The lower panel shows the symmetry of the recently discovered quasicrystal, which has not yet been named. Right is the ordered yet non-standard pattern of the quasicrystal revealed by an electron beam . Crystals with these ‘forbidden symmetries’ had been created in the laboratory, but it wasn't until 2009 that Dr Steinhardt and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal, now known as icosahedrite, in a rock that had been collected years before in Chukotka, Russia (shown) The researchers confirmed that the quasicrystal originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about 4.57 billion years ago - around the time our solar system formed. They published those results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012. ‘Bringing back the material and showing that it was of natural origins was an important scientific barrier to overcome,’ Dr Steinhardt said. This new quasicrystal was found in a different grain of the same meteorite and has 10-fold, or decagonal, symmetry. It is made up of aluminum, nickel and iron, which normally are not found together in the same mineral because aluminum binds quickly to oxygen, blocking attachment to nickel and iron. The researchers confirmed that the quasicrystal originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about 4.57 billion years ago, which is around the time our solar system formed (artist's illustration shown) The researchers are now exploring how the mineral formed. ‘We know there was a meteor impact, and that the temperature was around 1,000 to 1,200 degrees Kelvin, and that the pressure was a hundred thousand times greater than atmospheric pressure, but that is not enough to tell us all the details,’ said Dr Steinhardt. ‘We'd like to know whether the formation of quasicrystals is rare or is fairly frequent, how it occurs, and whether it could happen in other solar systems. ‘What we find out could answer basic questions about the materials found in our universe.’","Scientists at Princeton University, New Jersey studied ancient meteorite .

"Modern British men are more hands-on than ever before when it comes to household chores, according to a new survey. Researchers found that millions of men are more than happy to tackle a range of tasks their fathers would rarely encounter, with one in ten doing the bulk of the cleaning, polishing and dusting in the home. In fact, one in five men are in charge of cooking dinner every night, while one in ten regularly do the family washing. A new survey has found that British men are more involved in household chores than ever - with 60per cent happy to prepare dinner every night and do the washing up afterwards as well . The study of 2,000 modern couples found the gender roles in the home are now being rewritten, with more than three quarters of women saying they are happy to tackle jobs that might previously have been tasked to the man of the house such emptying gutters and mowing the lawn. The research, conducted by Karcher, also found two thirds of women will actively attempt jobs around the home their mum might have avoided or just left to the man of the house. Suzi Perry, star of F1 and former presenter of The Gadget Show, commented on the findings: 'The times really are changing and so it probably wouldn't come as a surprise that more men are helping out around the home compared to several decades ago. 'Nowadays, relationships are more like teamwork and we help our partners with the upkeep of the house and garden. 'Brits are working longer hours now as well so if domestic chores were only to fall on the lap of one person, they may find family life harder and their day more stressful. 'We all know that a problem shared is a problem halved, and this should also reflect the thoughts of many towards household chores. one in five men think they do a better job at the cleaning than their wife or girlfriend, while one in three think they are far superior at the hoovering and cooking . 'So it's encouraging to see so many Brits taking on tasks they wouldn't once have been expected to do.' The study revealed more than half of men feel they do much more domestic work around the house than their fathers ever did in terms of chores. TV presenter Suzi Perry, star of F1, knows what it's like to be a woman in a man's world . Meanwhile, 41 per cent of women confessed to doing less around the house than their mum did, which is believed to be because gender roles in the home were much stricter. It was also revealed that more men are happy to do the hoovering round the house as well as the washing up and the gardening. And six in ten men said they would be willing to sort the dinner every night and the washing up afterwards as well. Other jobs that men are happy to do around the home were found to be ironing, tending to the kids and cleaning. But they'll also gladly wash the patio or use the pressure washer when it's needed - although this is a job they'll share with their wife or partner. Not only are men happy to take on the tasks their fathers once would have declined to do, they also believe they are better than their partner at completing them. In fact, one in five men think they do a better job at the cleaning than their wife or girlfriend while one in three think they are far superior at the hoovering and cooking. Furthermore, one quarter of men think they are better at doing the washing up than their partner, and one in six even think they can do the ironing more efficiently. So it may not come as a surprise that 84 per cent of UK adults in a relationship believe the modern generation of men should be happier to do any of the kind of cleaning, washing or other domestic chores around the home. Suzi Perry added: 'The modern generation of Brits are keeping up with modern views of daily living.' Phil Springall, Karcher UK Home and Garden Marketing Manager said: 'It's interesting to see just how gender roles have evolved in the home and how we're all a bit more open to sharing the load. 'The results show that both men and women alike are up for swapping jobs in a way that maybe the generations before weren't.'","New survey by Karcher found that British men do more  chores than ever .

"Edmond Alexandre has been fined more than $7,000 after his fury over a reclined seat saw the plane he was on diverted . A passenger who forced a plane to divert after becoming furious with a woman in front of him who had reclined her seat has been fined more than $7,000. Edmond Alexandre, 61, became irate after a woman reclined the seat in front of him on the Miami-to-Paris flight in August last year. A U.S. District Court in Boston heard how the man began to argue with the woman and other passengers, before chasing a flight attendant down the aisle where he 'grabbed his arm'. The federal judge decided to impose a a $1,000 (£675) fine and restitution of $6,303 (£4,300) to American Airlines. Alexandre, who is a Haitian national, was flying back to  Paris, where he lives, when the plane was forced to divert to Logan Airport in Boston. Two undercover federal air marshals aboard the plane then subdued Alexandre and handcuffed him, the U.S. attorney's office said. Massachusetts state police arrested Alexandre when the diverted plane landed. Four hours later the American Airlines flight resumed its journey onwards to France. U.S. media agencies report that Alexandre could have been facing 20 years in prison. The incident came just days after a United Airlines flight diverted to Chicago following a fight between two passengers over a reclined seat. United Flight 1462 from Newark, New Jersey to Denver was forced to make an emergency landing at O'Hare International Airport Sunday after a female passenger threw water at a man seated behind her who used a device known as Knee Defender to stop her from reclining her seat on the four-hour flight. The two passengers, both age 48, were interviewed by Chicago police, who deemed the incident a 'customer service issue,' according to Transportation Security Administration spokesman Ross Feinstein. Edmond Alexandre's anger saw him force an American Airlines plane to make an unscheduled landing . The plane then continued to Denver without them, arriving 1 hour and 38 minutes late, according to the airline's website. The Federal Aviation Administration can impose a civil fine of up to $25,000 for passengers who are unruly. In this case, no arrest was made, according to airport spokesman Gregg Cunningham. And then just days after the incident involving Mr Alexandre, a row between two women over a reclined seat led to the diversion of a New York to Palm Beach Delta flight to Jacksonville. According to the airline, the diversion was 'due to safety reasons in regard to a passenger issue' but Florida television station WPTV reported that the plane rerouted due to a dispute over a reclining seat. A man used a 'seat defender' on board one flight last year that prompted the woman in front to throw water over him - and that flight was also diverted (devices circled) Passenger Aaron Klipin told the station a woman sitting next to him got into an argument with a passenger behind her. The woman reclined her seat so she could knit while the other passenger was trying to sleep on the tray table. Klipin said the woman who was trying to take a nap started screaming and swearing, drawing the attention of the flight crew. According to the passenger, when a flight attendant came over, the dispute between the two women became even more heated, and the woman with her head on the tray table demanded that the plane be diverted. The stewardess went to talk to the pilot, who made the decision to land the plane 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a Delta spokesman. A few minutes later, the flight touched down in Jacksonville, where it was met by local law enforcement officials who removed the unruly woman from the plane. The three incidents in the space of some nine days on U.S. airlines became known as legroom wars.","Edmond Alexandre argued with a woman in front who had reclined seat .

"Vinod Hindocha, 65, was standing in a lift with his arm extending out of the cage when a chain slipped, dropping him to the ground floor . The father of  Anni Dewani, the bride murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa,is recovering in hospital after having his right arm torn off while fixing a lift. Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor. However his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. According to The Mirror he was then taken to hospital in Gothenburg, in the country's south, where surgeons spent 13 hours reattaching the limb. Mr Hindocha's family said he has recovered movement in his elbow, and some warmth in his fingers, but it will be 18 months before doctors will know the full extent of the damage. The accident comes after Anni's husband, Shrien Dewani, was dramatically acquitted of ordering her killing when his trial in Cape Town collapsed late last year. Mr Hindocha's brother Ashok, 54, said: 'He’s such a good person, he’s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes. 'He has movement in his elbow, which surgeons say is the most important thing, and his finger tips are getting warmer. 'He may not get 100 per cent movement below the elbow, but they have all sorts of techniques to help with his hand movement.' Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail. Scroll down for video . Mr Hindocha (centre) told family members he saw his severed limb one storey above him after falling. Surgeons reattached the limb, but it will be 18 months before they know whether he will get movement back . The tragedy came after Mr Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed) Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while driving in a cab with her new husband through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town. The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack. However he also claimed that Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage. Shrien was acquitted of ordering his new wife's killing after his trial in Cape Town collapsed, with the judge saying prosecutors' evidence was contradictory (pictured, Shrien during the trial) After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year. During the short case the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies. The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence. Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal.","Vinod Hindocha, 65, fixing lift in Sweden when tragedy struck last week .

"A teenager and her boyfriend who were bogged in a ute for 30 hours during Cyclone Nathan survived by eating her chocolate mud birthday cake. Shannon Veltman had been in Darwin celebrating her 18th birthday with her boyfriend Aayden Price, 20, and the couple were driving more than 1,000km to their hometown of Nhulunbuy on Sunday – the day the tropical cyclone hit. Ms Veltman and Mr Price had to be rescued by helicopter after they got stuck while driving on the unsealed Central Arnhem Highway with their two dogs, the ABC reported. Shannon Veltman (left) her boyfriend Aayden Price (right) got bogged in a ute driving from Darwin to Nhulunbuy . The couple, who were travelling back from Ms Veltman's 18th birthday, had only chocolate mud cake to eat . 'We knew there was a cyclone and that. But mum and dad said it was over,' Ms Veltman told ABC. The 18-year-old said the road was 'sloppy' and was obstructed by fallen trees, forcing the couple to stop and move them with rope. 'We thought the cyclone must have come through here pretty hard… It was pouring down with rain and we were freezing,' she said. The couple had two near-misses while crossing flooded rivers but more than 20 hours into their drive – on a road that ordinarily takes eight hours to cover – their ute got bogged.

"The poster for play, Bad Jews, which has been banned by London Underground . Adverts for a Jewish play which received five-star reviews in one of the religion's newspapers have been banned from the London Underground because they 'could cause offence'. Transport for London (TfL) decided that posters of Joshua Harmon's acclaimed production, Bad Jews, contravened its policy following an investigation by an advertising regulator. The poster for the comedy, which is about a family brought together after the death of their Holocaust-survivor grandfather, shows four characters in a quarrel on the floor. One complaint was made to the the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) during the play's first campaign, but the regulator concluded that the poster did not breach rules. However, TfL disagreed with the ASA's ruling and told the Evening Standard it would not clarify the precise reason for the rejection. A TfL spokesperson said in a statement: 'The advert ""Bad Jews"" was previously displayed on our network as our advertising contractor approved it without consulting us. 'It was subsequently submitted for display again and has been rejected as it contravened our advertising policy, which states that adverts will not be approved if they may cause widespread or serious offence.' Producer Danny Moar has blasted TfL's decision, saying it seemed like 'censorship', despite the play winning a five-star review for the Jewish Chronicle. He told the paper: 'Half the cast are Jewish, I'm Jewish, the writer is Jewish and the word ""bad"" in the title, in so far as it matters, doesn't mean ""evil"" — it means ""non-observant"". 'This is a form of censorship which is so weird and ironic when, in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo events, everyone marched against censorship.' Producer Danny Moar (pictured right, with actor Colin McFarlane) has blasted the decision by TfL, describing it as a 'form of censorship' The play is about three cousins who have had to come together after the death of their Holocaust-survivor grandfather. It involves rows and quarrels between the family members, told in a hilarious comedy . ★★★★ ‘Exhilaratingly abrasive…A terrific family comedy’ Sunday Times . ★★★★ ‘Ferociously clever…a visceral thrill’ Evening Standard . ★★★★ ‘Hilariously, exquisitely edgy’ The Times . ★★★★ ‘Scaldingly funny’ Daily Telegraph . ★★★★ ‘Vivid, raw, brilliant.’Financial Times . ★★★★ ‘Exquisitely hilarious’ Independent . He admitted that the rejection shouldn't have too much of an impact on the show, but that they are being prevented from reaching as many people as possible. The play is due to be transferred from the St James Theatre in Victoria to the Arts Theatre on March 18. The transport company has previously rejected bus posters from Christian group, Core Issues Trust, which suggested gay people could be helped to change their sexuality. In a separate incident, Sainsburys removed all its kosher food from shelves in Holborn, central London, in August last year, over fears anti-Israeli protesters outside would attack it. The transport company decided the advert could cause 'widespread offence' after an investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) The poster was previously advertised and one complaint was received, but the advertising regulator said it did not breach their rules.

"Scotland Yard detectives swooped on the family home of Field Marshall Lord Bramall of Bushfield, the former chief of the defence staff and a D-Day veteran . At 91, Lord Bramall – the latest VIP to be dragged into the sex abuse inquiry – is the oldest and most respected of Britain's eight living Field Marshals. He stepped down as Chief of Defence Staff in 1985 after four decades spent climbing the ranks from 2nd Lieutenant right to the pinnacle of Britain's armed forces. Lord Bramall first saw action on the Normandy beaches the day after D-Day, when he was shelled. Everyone else in his vehicle died but he managed to crawl out. At first he thought he was on fire, but in fact he was badly wounded and was sent back to Britain for treatment. Lord Bramall returned to his unit just five weeks later and was leading a patrol on the Dutch-Belgian border when he was ambushed. Rather than flee, he led a counter-attack, and managed to wound two Germans and take another one captive. He was later awarded the Military Cross for his actions by Field Marshal Montgomery himself. He led the Royal Green Jackets in Borneo in 1965, commanded British forces in Hong Kong in the 1970s and was made head of the Army in 1979. Lord Bramall held that role during the Falklands War of 1982, and was a strong admirer of Margaret Thatcher. 'A wonderful war leader,' he said, 'probably even better than Churchill'. Born in 1923, Lord Bramall's father came from a merchant family in the Potteries in Staffordshire, while his mother hailed from impoverished aristocracy. She would forever call him 'my baby' – even when phoning his office while he was head of the Army. He captained Eton's cricket team, had two pictures displayed at the Royal Academy, and to his mother's chagrin, turned down a place at Oxford to join the Army. He married his wife Avril in 1949 and they have two children. The couple are still together. After he retired, festooned with decorations, he became a life peer – and has never been afraid to speak his mind in the Lords – opposing the second war in Iraq and what he termed 'mission creep' in Afghanistan. More recently, Lord Bramall has also been a vocal critic of defence cuts, which he fears could weaken the Army. He told peers that when it comes to dealing with threats you 'have to prepare for the unexpected'. Eton-educated Lord Bramall commanded a platoon at the D-Day landings and led the Army as chief of the general staff during the Falklands campaign.He was awarded the Military Cross in 1945 . The headline to an earlier version of this article wrongly stated that Lord Bramall had been arrested. While the article made clear that this had not been the case, we are happy to set the record straight and apologise for any confusion caused.","Police searched home of Lord Bramall, a decorated former soldier .

"Ada Ng, 28, posted this selfie from the cockpit of the Cathay Pacific flight from Taipei to Hong Kong . A 28-year-old Chinese woman has set tongues wagging online after bragging of being allowed up into the cockpit of a flight. Ada Ng was able to take a video of the flight landing in Hong Kong from just behind the captain after he invited her to join him at the front of the plane. The Cathay Pacific flight was reportedly full and he wasted no time inviting the young lady into the cockpit for her return journey from Taipei to Hong Kong. According to shanghaiist.com, she posted several pictures to her page on the Chinese social networking site Weibo, gushing about how much she had enjoyed the experience of takeoff and landing. Responding to the posts,  some Weibo users expressed fears about security because most airlines have made it virtually impossible for passengers to access the cockpit post-9/11. The photos continued to circulate online despite Ms Ng subsequently removing them from her profile. Ms Ng was meant to be sitting in a jump seat in business class, according to an image of her ticket which she put up online. Such seats are sometimes used by trainee pilots or off-duty crew members travelling between airports or by cabin crew during takeoff and landing and they can also be offered to the family of crew members. It is unclear whether Ms Ng fell into that category. A pilot and a flight attendant were dismissed from Cathay Pacific in 2011 after photos emerged of them indulging in oral sex in the cockpit.

"A student recorded vice principal Joseph Defillipo having a discussion with one student and saying: 'I just don't like the black kids' A school vice-principal has been suspended after making a racist remark which was caught on video. Joseph Defillipo from Scandinavian Middle School in Fresno, California, was recorded by a student's cellphone, saying: 'I just don't like the black kids.' Defillipo had been in the middle of a discussion with several students about who he didn't like at the school. The 20-second clip cuts off after the teacher's racially-insensitive comment. The vice principal has taught in the district for 18 years and has been at the middle school since 2010. The video was posted to YouTube on Friday where it has been watched more than 4,000 times. It was brought to the school's attention by a parent of the student involved. Scandinavian Middle School refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Wednesday. Daily Mail Online was also waiting on a comment from the school district. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday the school said Defillipo had been put on paid administrative leave while an third-party, external investigation took place. A school statement read: 'Fresno Unified takes great pride in providing a positive learning environment for all students and staff. The interaction between the Scandinavian student and our employee has been brought to our attention and we are conducting an investigation. 'Fresno Unified takes this matter very seriously and we will take any necessary actions pending the results. During our investigation, and as a matter of practice, the employee is on paid administrative leave.' Several parents whose children attend Scandinavian Middle School told The Fresno Bee that they want Defillipo fired. A group of former students gathered outside the school premises on Tuesday to protest, chanting: 'I love black people' and 'black power'. Around 10 per cent of students at Scandinavian Middle School are black, The Fresno Bee reported. The vice principal earns around $87,000 a year, according to public records. The YouTube video attracted a number of comments, both attacking and in defense of the senior teacher. One commenter, Kevin Hill, wrote: 'I'd withhold any judgment until the rest of the video comes out. First, he was talking to black mids [sic], most likely joking, inappropriate, yeah but not racist. Second, the way the video cuts immediately out indicates that there was more said which in context would've shown he was joking.' Alyssa Hochstetler wrote: 'why would he say that? im so glad i left that school.'

"From Paul the psychic octopus to Big Head the  sea turtle, the bookies are no stranger to calling in animals to help with working out the odds. Now one is hoping a pack of corgis will give betting on the royal birth a boost, while giving the public a clue to the sex and name of the new fourth-in-line. The 'Barkingham Palace' Gold Cup saw 10 dogs face off in race across London's Bedford Square, with a pooch named Alexandra taking first place. Scroll down for video . Winning ways: Corgi Alexandra took the title in the Barkingham Palace Gold Cup . Five of the runners taking part in the race were male and five female, with each chosen by bookmakers Ladbrokes because their names are among the most popular with punters betting on the new royal baby's name. A dog called Alexandra, a name that is currently running third in the betting, took the honours followed by Camilla (100/1) and Victoria (10/1). Among the boys, Spencer came first, despite boasting real-life odds of just 25/1, followed by James (8/1) and Boris (200/1). 'Alexandra romped to victory and it looks like Kate will soon be giving birth to a little girl next month,' said Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge, tongue firmly in cheek. Prediction: The race was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to predict the name and sex of the new royal baby . Ready for action: The pets were put through their paces in a tiny parade ring beforehand . And they're off! The dogs emerge from the traps with Spencer (fourth from left) taking an early lead . Sprinting ahead: The pets are on their way, although Boris (left) doesn't seem too bothered . 'Royal baby betting is booming and the arrival of a new heir to the throne is sure to see a record amount of wagers placed.' Alexandra, who won with a time of 4.32 seconds, was then treated to a winner's ceremony that included a trophy and a rendition of the National Anthem. Although corgi Elizabeth rolled home last in the Barkingham Palace Gold Cup, the name is currently the odds-on favourite should the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a girl. Other popular choices include Charlotte, the second-favourite at 6/1, and Diana which comes in at 12/1. Streaking ahead: A sprinting Alexandra leaves the competition trailing in her wake . Well ahead: Alexandra charges down the final furlong followed by second-placed Camilla . Good work: Alexandra enjoys her trophy and a special rendition of the National Anthem . Should the new royal baby prove to be a boy, it is James that is the hot favourite followed by Arthur, Henry, Charles and Thomas. While the majority of names put forward by punters are sensible, others have had a flutter on more outlandish names, according to Bridge. 'Elizabeth and James are currently the most popular girl and boy’s names,' she explains. 'But that hasn’t stopped punters from betting on outsiders, including Sapesan and Mercedes at 500/1 apiece.' Less favoured names in the running include Ruprecht, Chardonnay, Kevin and Wayne, all at 500/1, and Ruth, Justin and Colin at 200/1.","Alexandra came first, beating Camilla in second and Elizabeth in third .

Google and Mattel have re-designed the View-Master toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver visual trickery. The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’. The plastic body of the device has been given a sleek and less angular look than previous models, but still includes a slot for film reels. To release the phone’s VR features, an Android phone running Mattel’s app is needed. The phone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel, meaning parents will have to surrender their handsets. The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make  scenes feel immersive. Mattel said its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ‘engaging field trips’ so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in ‘photospheres’. By pairing an ‘experience reel’ with a smartphone, children ‘will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,’ according to Mattel. The device itself is set to be released in autumn in the US and next year in the UK for $30 (£20), with reels sold for $15 (£10). ‘We think it’s a genuinely unique try-before-you-buy experience.’ In the shop, which opens its doors today, customers will be able to use a giant immersive screen called the ‘Portal’ to ‘fly’ over different parts of the world.

"Mapbox, a popular custom online map tool used by companies including Pinterest and Uber, has created a new set of maps that are out of this world. The amazing maps of Mars were made using data from Nasa and Esa spacecraft. They are in high-resolution, and allow users to zoom in to the surface and see key features across the red planet. Scroll down to use both maps . Washington DC-based Mapbox have created interactive maps of the surface of Mars. They use data from Nasa and Esa spacecraft to create the high-resolution detailed maps. The Mars Satellite map, shown, uses black and white imagery taken by the Mars Orbiter Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) The maps are named Mars Satellite and Mars Terrain, and were created by data analyst and mapping strategist Matt Greene at Mapbox. In December 2014 it was announced an instrument on the Curiosity rover had identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria-like organisms on the surface. The discovery, reported in the journal Science, followed studies of gas samples by Curiosity's Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) - an instrument that uses intense light to carry out chemical analysis. ‘We love space, and we think it's amazing how much detail is mapped of our distant neighbour,’ said Mapbox on their website. ‘That's why we're using Mapbox's tools to make it possible to explore Mars from anywhere.’ The Mars Satellite map uses black and white imagery taken by the Mars Orbiter Camera on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), provided by Nasa and Malin Space Science Systems. Nasa’s MGS was operational in orbit around Mars from 12 September 1997 to 2 November 2006. It was a global mapping mission that examined the entire planet, including its atmosphere and surface. Data from the MGS mission has been used to identify landing sites for rovers and landers on the surface. The whole surface of Mars is then rendered in high-resolution, with landing sites and geological features on the surface highlighted.

The photograph, which dates from a trip to Tripoli, Libya in September 2011, was even adopted by the former Secretary of State herself for her Twitter profile picture. But it seems the picture, which inspired hundreds of comedy memes, could be no laughing matter for Clinton as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun. Indeed, Clinton herself has removed the image removed from her Twitter account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in Libya. For more than a year, the former Secretary of State had used the monochrome image of her using a Blackberry on board a C-military plane around a month after Colonel Gaddafi's regime fell. Switcheroo: Hillary Clinton swapped out a picture of her using a Blackberry on her way to Libya for a silhouette promoting a gender equality initiative . The picture, regularly seen by her 2.9 million followers, was removed Sunday -  to promote a political campaign for gender equality, timed to coincide with International Women's Day. The image was once a symbol of Clinton's funny side as the face of the Texts From Hillary meme, which she said had given her 'many LOLZ'. But the change also comes at a time when senior figures in Congress are intensifying scrutiny of Hillary's communications from 2009-13, which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official State Department accounts. Proof? The chairman of the House Committee on Benghazi mentioned that he has seen no emails from Clinton's time in Libya, despite pictures such as this one from 2011, showing her using a Blackberry . The picture  inspired hundreds of comedy memes posted on a parody Tumblr account last year. This one refers to Carly Rae Jepsen's pop song Call Me Maybe . A lot of the memes make a joke about how serious Clinton looks and speculate about what she's doing on her phone . The image of Clinton staring at her smartphone with her dark sunglasses and stony expression make her look like she doesn't have time for anyone . Clinton has handed over swathes of communications from the time, but it has been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'. The image was mentioned by the chairman of a House committee into the 2012 attack on U.S. diplomats in Benghazi to suggest that vital communications from Clinton's involvement in Libya were being kept from public view. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina), today told CBS's Face the Nation that he has been provided with no emails from the September 2011 trip - despite Clinton being clearly pictured communicating while aboard the plane. He said: 'There are gaps of months and months and months. And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip. Users couldn't resist creating memes that make Clinton look like she receives lots of invitations to parties . Some make a joke out of  those intending to run against Clinton, like Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren . Others imagine Clinton talks to other famous internet faces over youth behaviour including grumpy cat . Clinton made this entry into the Texts From Hillary account herself - the entry does not insult any political rivals, but just ribs the site's creators. 'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress. 'So, there are huge gaps. And with respect to the president, it's not up to Secretary Clinton to decide what is a public record and what's not.' Gowdy also said the records don't include anything from around the dates of the Benghazi attack itself, in which the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed. Suspicions: Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-South Carolina) mentioned the pictured of Clinton while contending that emails from her time in Libya had not been handed over . As of Sunday evening, Clinton's profile still featured the Blackberry image, but as the 'header photo' displayed at the top of the Twitter page. In order to see it, users have to access her profile directly. The image will not appear in the timelines of her followers, nor when she is retweeted or appears in search results. Clinton herself tweeted to explain the change of profile picture. She wrote: 'See my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide.' She also included a link to Not-There.org, which is sponsored by the Clinton foundation she runs with her husband, former President Bill Clinton.","Former Secretary of State swapped out phone picture for blank silhouette .

"Saddened: Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, the fourth book in the Millennium series . Stieg Larsson's partner has hit out at plans to release a fourth installment in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series more than a decade after the journalist's death - dismissing it as nothing more than a money-making scheme. Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, which will hit the shelves in August to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the hugely successful Girl with a Dragon Tattoo. Gabrielsson -  the left wing journalist's partner of more than three decades - has not only questioned the motivation of the publishing house, but been hugely critical of the author chosen to follow in her late partner's footsteps. David Lagercrantz, a journalist and author best known as footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic's official biographer, is 'a completely idiotic choice' in her view. 'They say heroes are supposed to live forever. That's a load of c***, this is about money,' she said. 'It's about a publishing house that needs money, (and) a writer who doesn't have anything to write so he copies someone else.' Larsson had, in fact, begun work on a fourth book centering on protagonists Lisbeth Salander, a feisty rebel hacker-turned-detective, and Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter, before his untimely death in 2004. Aged just 50, he suffered a heart attack as he walked the seven storeys to his office, where he worked as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine Expo. The books were published posthumously, so Larsson never saw how successful the books were to become: so far, they have sold more than 75million copies in more than 30 languages, according to publisher Norstedts. However, Gabrielsson, 61, has dismissed any idea he had an overarching plan for the novels - a theory which has been used to justify the publication of this latest 500 page tome. She also revealed Lagercrantz had not seen the fourth manuscript, and 'started over from zero'. 'Everyone thinks there was some grand scheme but no, he had no plan for the first three books and when he started writing the fourth one, it was spontaneous. He still didn't have a plan,' she said. If it were up to her, none of this would have happened. 'I wouldn't have continued Stieg's work. It was his language, his unique narrative.' Furious?: Stieg Larsson - who died in 2004, before his trilogy became successful - had started work on the next book, but David Lagercrantz, who has picked up the baton, has started from scratch with his version . Gabrielsson says she views Lagercrantz is 'a completely idiotic choice' to continue Larsson's work, with even the 'very literary' title sitting badly with her. She said: '[He] comes from a completely different background. Everything has always been easy for him. He's never been an activist. Everything is wrong.' Gabrielsson, who met Larsson as a teenager, added: 'Let him dig his own grave.' For Gabrielsson, the publication is a bitter blow - the outcome of a bitter battle against her partner's family to manage his work. Success: The books, which have sold millions around the world, have been made into blockbuster films . Following his death, Gabrielsson wanted to manage his authorship to avoid its commercialisation, but she says she never reached an agreement with Larsson's brother and father and they now manage his estate. She says now 'there is nothing left to protect'. But Gabrielsson, who only recently moved out of the home they shared as she tries to rebuild her life, believes the wrong things have happened - especially when it comes to the new book. 'The worst thing is how saddened Stieg would have been. He never let anyone work on his literary texts. 'He would have been furious. Who knows, maybe he'll send a lightning bolt at the book launch.'","Fourth installment in the Millennium Trilogy due to be published in August .

"Researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes. They say indoor spaces could be the fastest growing biome, a word used to describe the different realms of life on Earth. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, researchers say. A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants. It found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa. Another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders . An examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. A review paper published March 19 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution serves as a call for research in the emerging field of indoor biome ecology and evolution. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, for example, from the pest management field, or public health perspectives on microbes. The paper came out of a 2013 workshop that included the evolutionary biology of the built environment, which included evolutionary, microbial and plant biologists, entomologists, architects, scientists who study better building design, and others. 'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin of Cornell, the paper's first author. 'But given the number of species found indoors, it is likely there's a lot more going on that we don't know about.' A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa; another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders; and an examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. 'I've been noticing more species inside my house since I went to this working group,' Martin said, referring to the 2013 workshop. Co-author Robert Dunn, of North Carolina State University, discovered a species of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside cockroaches in his house. 'The radical diversity in abiotic environments, such as in water heaters, freezers and on kitchen counters, is vast and could parallel microclimates found on forest floors,' said Martin. The paper notes that the first human houses date back 20,000 years and that today's indoor environments most closely resemble caves. The emerging field also holds potential for studying rapid evolution, as the development of human-built environments has been recent. Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches: Researchers called for more research into pests, saying the home was an untapped resource. Close up of a bedbug on skin.'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin, the paper's first author and a graduate student in the field of natural resources. Researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution -  such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species. They also hope to compare species in Alaska, for example, with species in Texas; whether outdoor environments determine what happens indoors; which indoor species are healthful to have; and how home design can contribute to health and indoor species compositions. 'We are interested in reframing the dialogue away from what gross or dangerous pests live in houses to what biodiversity exists in houses,' Martin said.","Researchers say homes are a hotbed of undiscovered species .

"A Scout leader who was found with boys' underwear under his bed and a cache of child pornography has walked free from court with just a community order after a judge said it was the best way to protect him from the public. Eliot Easterby, a former parish councillor and the author of 'teenage' books, had hundreds of indecent images of underage boys stored in a hard drive and three memory sticks at his house. The 44-year-old from Hamble, Hampshire, also had a collection of child pornography DVDs showing young boys in paddling pools and a hidden stash of underwear left behind when he took young boys in Scouts trips. Eliot Easterby, 44, was convicted of a string of child pornography offences after police discovered more than 600 indecent images and a haul of boys' underwear at his home in Hamble, Hampshire . Following a major international operation which involved Canadian police Easterby was charged with a number of offences including the making of and possession of child pornography. Despite being convicted of 13 charges relating to boys aged eight to 15 he walked free from court with a community order. Sentencing at Southampton Crown Court, where jurors took less than an hour to convict Easterby of the charges brought against him, Judge Peter Henry said he felt it was the best way to both punish the man and protect the public from him. The former teacher and author walked free from court (above) with a community order . During an investigation which began with a tip off from Canadian police, officers discovered more than 600 indecent images at Easterby's home. Around 300 had been viewed and deleted with another 374 downloaded and stored on memory sticks and a hard drive. A stash of child pornography was also found. Easterby, who denied all the charges, claimed the images were not of an indecent nature, a claim Judge Henry later rejected. 'You say you have no sexual attraction to boys. That is a matter of some concern because all the images of the boys linger on the area of genitalia,' he said. 'These boys are victims, filmed for the sexual gratification of you and others. 'It is not a victimless crime.' But with no evidence Easterby had had any sexual contact with the children he was spared jail. Instead he was sentenced to a community order, the 'best way' of punishing him and protecting the public, the judge added. He was given a ten year prevention order restricting his use of the internet and was banned from having contact with boys aged under 16 without their parents or guardians' permission. He was also placed on the sex offenders register for seven years and ordered to attend a sex offender treatment course. Easterby has written several books aimed at teenagers based on the ghosthunting adventures of two adolescent boys. He also taught at Sholing Technology College in Southampton. Another teacher from the college last month admitted owning child and animal porn. Jurors took just one hour to convict Easterby of 13 charges relating to child pornography at Southampton Crown Court (above)","Eliot Easterby was convicted of 13 offences relating to child pornography .

"Driver distractions are at an all-time high, according to new research. The use of phones, text messaging and heavy urban traffic means people concentrate less than ever while driving. And this is extremely dangerous, warn the researchers, as taking your eye off the road for just two seconds can increase the risk of an accident up to 24 times. Researchers from Oregon State University studied driver distractions. They found texting, eating and other tasks were more distracting than ever. And they warned that young drivers are unaware of the dangers. A previous study found that text-driving (stock image shown) was equivalent to being drunk . The researchers, led by Oregon State University compiled findings that showed so-called 'distracted driving' was a bigger problem than ever. The research was published in the Journal of Transportation Safety and Security. The striking sight of a solar eclipse will capture the attention of commuters across Britain on their way to work this Friday. It will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush-hour in the UK, and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment. Experts have warned that drivers may be distracted as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter. RAC spokesman Simon Williams told MailOnline: ‘The biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist’s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness.' He said that distraction is a major cause of accidents on the road and was a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013. 'Based on recent studies, anything that takes your attention away, any glance away from the road for two seconds or longer can increase the risk of an accident from four to 24 times,' said Dr David Hurwitz from the university. 'This is a dramatic increase in risk, with inexperienced drivers who are least able to handle it.' According to OSU, a previous study found that texting was equivalent to being drunk. 'The absolute worst is texting on a phone, which is a whole group of distractions,' added Dr Hurwitz. 'With texting, you're doing something besides driving, thinking about something besides driving, and looking at the wrong thing.' In their study, the researchers found that interactive presentations administered to young drivers in a classroom or auditorium can raise their awareness of the problem. They concluded that more young people should be educated in this manner. While many young drivers understand the risks of texting, Dr Hurwitz said they are much less aware of other concerns that can be real. These include eating, drinking, talking on a phone, smoking, adjusting the radio, changing a CD, using a map or other controls. While many young drivers understand the risks of texting, Dr Hurwitz said they are much less aware of other concerns that can be real. These include eating, drinking, talking on a cell phone, smoking, adjusting the radio (stock image shown), changing a CD, using a digital map or other controls . 'Automobile manufacturers have made cars significantly safer, but in the interests of passenger comfort they also continue to add more pleasant distractions within the vehicle,' Dr Hurwitz said. 'More experienced drivers learn how to control these distractions, but we're finding the most problems with the very young driver, within six months of getting a license.' Aside from lack of experience, he said, young drivers also have a higher risk tolerance, use seat belts less, and choose higher speeds. The recent research found that 27 per cent of respondents changed clothes or shoes while driving, and some worked on homework. However, they added that it was 'reasonably safe' to talk to other passengers in the car. 'For one thing, if an incident happens that requires a quick reaction, everyone in the car may see it, stop talking and pay immediate attention,' said Dr Hurwitz. 'And you literally have more sets of eyes on the road to see upcoming problems.' There are some gender differences among young drivers, too. Females are more likely to use a phone while driving, and males are more likely to look away from the road while talking to others in the car. The project was funded by the Pacific Northwest Transportation Consortium, an initiative supported by OSU, the University of Washington, University of Idaho, Washington State University and the University of Alaska-Fairbanks.","Researchers from Oregon State University studied driver distractions .

"At first their mother put it down to coincidence: one of her twins was performing tasks with her right hand, the other using her left. But when Naomi and Hannah Moxon’s baby teeth started falling out on opposite sides of their mouths, their mother Karen made a surprise discover - her girls were mirror twins. The rare condition, which is thought to occur in around 25 per cent of identical twins, refers to twins who are mirror images of one another. Scroll down for video . Mirror twins: Naomi (left) and Hannah Moxon (right) do everything the opposite way around . Sister act: Naomi (left) and Hannah Moxon (right) with their mother Karen . Like in many cases, Naomi is left handed, while Hannah writes with her right. When they eat, Naomi uses her cutlery the traditional way, while Hannah’s knife and fork are held in reverse. And their hair naturally parts on opposite sides of their heads – Hannah’s on the left, Naomi’s on the right. Yesterday the 19-year-olds, from Peterborough, who are currently competing in BBC talent show The Voice, opened up about their unusual situation. Naomi said: ‘Our mum noticed quite early on that we were doing things with the opposite hands. She would say raise the hand you use to draw and I'd raise one and Hannah would raise the other. 'Then mum mentioned it at one of our check-ups and that's when they said about mirror twins. I don’t think many people know what it is.' ‘There were other things like I use my knife and fork the wrong way round,’ Hannah added, ‘our baby teeth fell out on different sides as well, one of mine would fall out and then within a few days Naomi lost the same tooth on the other side. Also our partings are naturally opposite, although we sometimes wear it the same.’ Hannah (left) and Naomi are starring in the BBC TV show The Voice . Bundles of delight: Although identical, tiny tots Hannah and Naomi are known as mirror twins . The twins, pictured Naomi, left, and Hannah, aged two . In other respects, Hannah and Naomi are remarkably similar, made even more so by the fact they like dressing alike. They share a bedroom – and wardrobe – and they do their make-up in the same way. When they made it through the blind auditions round of The Voice as singing duo Classical Reflections, they wore matching white dresses to perform Nella Fantasia by Sarah Brightman. Hannah said: ‘We like dressing the same, but not always. It's part of our performing act. What's good is that I can ask her to try something on so I can see what it looks like. And we always talk about what suits “us” not what suits “me”.’ ‘We started off as half a person,’ Naomi joked. The pair often finish each other’s sentences, have never spent more than a few hours apart and claim to know what the other is thinking – ‘If someone’s being annoying we can share it with each other with a look,’ Naomi said. Speaking about their close bond, Hannah said: ‘We rely on each other a lot, we’re very protective of each other. At school we had a bad experience, we were teased quite a lot for being different to the other children, because we were twins. People would try to tell us apart by being like ""oh you're the one with the fatter face"" and ""you're the one with the longer face"", So we were very shy.’ So much alike: The girls have different hair partings and one is left handed and the other right handed . Talented: The girls' mother, Karen, discovered her daughters were different from an early age . However they left that school for an arts-based sixth form college where they developed their singing act, performing at local community events and weddings. And tonight the Moxon twins, who live with their mother Karen, 50, and father David, 48, will perform on The Voice on BBC1. When they first appeared on the programme they divided opinion on Twitter, with dozens of viewers writing mean spirited remarks about the twins. Some likened them to the ghostly twins in horror film The Shining. However, last night Naomi said their past experience of being teased at school meant they didn’t take the messages to heart. She said: ‘I think sometimes it is a bit difficult for people because we are different, as twins, and sometimes people don’t know how to take that, so there was the odd slightly mean comment, like about The Shining, but the vast majority were lovely. Close sisters: Hannah (left) and Naomi, pictured aged eight, are appearing on BBC1's The Voice . 'Also I think because of our past experiences we’ve become really strong people and those sorts of comments don’t really affect us anymore. 'I think a lot of the time people don’t realise what they’re saying could be hurtful, like with the comments about The Shining – they are twins, we are twins, it’s a fact. 'We would always say to people just be careful what you write online, you might mean it harmlessly but it could be taken differently. But even those comments we just have to laugh at them really. We looked up the film because we’d never seen it before and it didn’t actually offend us.’ She added: ‘We feel really, really thankful for the response on social media. It’s been so lovely. Such a high percentage of the comments have been so positive and even the slightly negative ones, they weren’t aimed at our singing at all.’ Mirror twins, though rare are not unheard of and occur when a fertilised egg splits late. The girls enjoy slicing the cake - holding the knife in different hands to each other . Normally, eggs split around two or three days after fertilisation happens, causing identical twins. However, if the split doesn’t occur until day seven, it can lead to mirror twins. Later splits – at around day 12 – cause conjoined twins. Around a quarter of identical twins are thought to be mirror twins. Yesterday Jane Denton, director of the Multiple Births Foundation, said that investigating mirror twins was difficult. ‘It is difficult to research this because it happens in utero so you can’t observe it outside the body,' she said. But we think it happens in about 25 per cent of monozygotic (identical) twins. It’s usually the right hand in one, the left hand in the other, sometimes it’s the hair wall, the crown of the head, which way round it goes. ‘Research indicates that in identical twins it is usual for the teeth to grow in the same place in the mouth, within a day or two of each other. 'But with mirror twins you may find that it will be on the other side of the mouth in one child, but in the same sort of pattern.’","Naomi and Hannah Moxon are mirror images of each other .

"Footage has emerged of the incredible moment an apparently intoxicated man fell between two moving subway carriages in Washington D.C. only to come out unscathed. Security cameras inside Metro's Mount Vernon station captured the incident around 5pm on Sunday March 1. The man can bee seen stumbling around the platform, obviously unsteady on his feet, before tumbling straight through the gap between two subway cars. The fall occurs right as the doors are closing the the train is preparing to leave the station. Unsteady: This is the moment the apparently intoxicated man (left) loses his balances and goes to fall into the cap between the two carriages . Fall: The video shows the passenger falling straight into the space between the connected carriages . Down: The man slips straight into the gap, as fellow passengers (right) watch on with shock . As the man falls, shocked onlookers try to help, only to realize the train is alighting. One man can be seen in the video panicking and holding his hands in the air. However, one the train passes and people scurry to the platform's edge, believing a tragedy has just occurred, they suddenly see the man get to his feet and continue stumbling. He somehow fell into the zone outside of the rails known as the 'area of refuge'. The fellow passengers quickly pull the man up to the platform. Police arrived to assist the man. He suffered only minor injuries from the fall. Safe: People on the platform can be seen pulling the man back up onto the station after the train departs . Perhaps more startling is the fact that incidents such as these happen every week, according to a Metro spokesman. 'It's important for riders to monitor themselves and also look out for their friends,' Metro spokesman Dan Stessel told NBC Washington. 'If you go out for drinks with a group and someone is clearly not able to walk properly, maybe that's the time to order a cab or an Uber, that sort of thing.' Encouraging a fallen passenger to roll into the area of refuge is a 'last resort', Stessel told The Washington Post. However in this case it seemed to be accidental.

"Truly, it is a terrifying development. The great religious fissure between Sunni and Shia Muslims that dominates the Middle East has erupted into open conflict  in Yemen, the region’s poorest country, threatening to engulf the entire area in a wider war. In a dramatic escalation of the stakes, a Sunni coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels who have swept south through the country. As Yemen veered towards political disintegration, the conflict exploded into a region-wide crisis that could have far-reaching and unpredictable international consequences. Scroll down for video . Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels, pictured people  gather at the site of an explosion near Sana'a Airport . Brent crude oil prices increased by 6 per cent, for example, since many of the world’s oil shipments pass through or past the Bab el-Mandab Strait linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. But the far more pressing concern is whether we are now seeing a proxy war in Yemen between its neighbour Saudi Arabia, the leading Sunni power, and Iran, the leading Shia power, explode into a regional conflict that could sweep us all up in its wake. Saudi warplanes targeted Houthi positions in the country’s capital Sana’a killing 18 civilians and injuring many more. Britain and America supported the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen as the coalition deployed 100 fighter jets and amassed 150,000 soldiers to fight in the region. Another nine Sunni states joined the offensive, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, pledging to send aircraft to bomb targets, with Egypt deploying ships. Anticipating the worsening situation, British elite soldiers — in Yemen to train government troops to fight Al Qaeda, which has established its most dangerous branch in the country — pulled out last Friday. This followed a decision by the U .S. to evacuate their remaining military personnel as the country teetered on the brink of civil war between the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. As Western forces left, the rebels — trained, armed and funded by Iran — made further advances in the south of the country. The Yemeni president, who is backed by the U.N., was forced to flee his palace in the former British colonial port of Aden on the southern coast and there were reports last night that he had left by boat for the Saudi capital, Riyadh. This week, Aden — once one of the British Empire’s most important ports for ships heading to imperial India, and a haven of stability patrolled by officers in pith helmets and colonial shorts — was raked with the sound of gunfire. Just 35 miles to the north, Shia rebels had seized Al Anad air base, which until recently had been used by American counter-terrorism forces to fight terrorists. Yemen sits on the extreme end of the Arabian peninsula, with Saudi Arabia to the north — where the 150,000 Saudi troops are now amassing on its border. An armed member of Houthi militia stands over the rubble of houses which were allegedly destroyed by a Saudi air strike in Sana'a, Yemen . A fierce, tribal society, Yemen has long been torn apart by tribal conflicts. Governing the country has been compared with dancing on the heads of snakes. The Houthis — who belong to a relatively obscure branch of Shia Islam — were largely confined to the north of the country and were contained by the country’s longtime president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a wily Arab strongman, until he was overthrown in the course of the Arab Spring in 2011. President Hadi, his weaker successor, never managed to reassert central control, and in September the Houthis took control of the capital Sana’a. In the vacuum created by President Hadi’s weak leadership, Iran saw the opportunity to taunt its old rival by backing the Houthis and establishing its influence in the Saudis’ backyard. But the recent Houthi advances have proved too much for Saudi, whose primary aim is to re-establish order in Yemen. It amassed a formidable coalition — Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Morocco, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt — of Sunni-led states and sent in its fighter jets to send a powerful message to Iran: stop meddling in Arab affairs. The Saudis also regard Iran’s influence in Yemen as evidence of a much larger drive by Shia Iran for regional dominance. They claim that Iran is using armed proxies to take over other states. Nothing happens in Lebanon, for instance, without the approval of the Iranian-backed Shia militia Hizbollah, which also provides Syria’s beleaguered President Assad with his light infantry. Houthi fighters manning a heavy machine gun fixed on the back of a pick-up guard a rally protesting Saudi-led airstrikes . For its part, Iran has condemned the air strikes. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said the country ‘considers this action a dangerous step’, adding that military action would complicate and worsen the crisis in Yemen. ‘This invasion will bear no result but expansion of terrorism and extremism throughout the whole region,’ she said. And the truth is that she may well be right. Yemen has a chronic terrorism problem, simply because such a failed state is an ideal operating ground for terrorists. Yemen is not only home to the most tactically lethal branch of Al Qaeda but now ISIS has a foothold there too. On March 20 four ISIS suicide bombers killed 137 Shia outside their mosques in Sana’a. Before the U.S. military moved out of the country, they were allowed to launch drone strikes on Al Qaeda. But now, in their absence, terrorists are no longer being targeted so effectively, and will only flourish as a result. To make matters still more precarious for the West in its fight against terror, Iran and the Shia militias it backs are proving an increasingly vital component of the ground war against ISIS in Iraq, with Iranian commanders directing them and supplying them too. This means the West is walking on diplomatic eggshells. What if Iran took over much of Iraq, whose government and population is largely Shia as well? Would the Saudis stand for that? And if a Shia Houthi government succeeds in Yemen, then wouldn’t Saudi Arabia’s own downtrodden Shia population, some 10-15 per cent of them in the kingdom’s oil-rich Eastern Province, want some independence? The western response to this chaos is understandably hesitant. Washington is unsure whether Iranian strategy is really to establish proxy Shia governments all over the region or simply to use the Houthi in Yemen to taunt Saudi Arabia and pacify the country’s own hardliners. We now have a bizarre — and potentially very dangerous — situation in which U.S. warplanes are providing air cover for Iranian-backed militias in Iraq in a joint effort against ISIS, while 1,200 miles to the south in Yemen, the Americans are helping Saudi pilots bomb Shia insurgents supported by Iran. So the U.S. is bombing Iran’s enemies in one country, while helping to bomb its allies in another. On top of all this, American and Iranian diplomats are resuming their talks about how to restrain Tehran’s nuclear programme. Such is the chaotic and complex nature of affairs in the Middle East. And as the Saudis pledge to resolve their own local difficulty, we can only hold our breath.","Religious fissure between Sunni and Shia Muslims erupted into conflict .

Acting US Attorney John Horn said: 'Best we know from the evidence is they just shipped it back in boxes. It was all cash' According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the duo stole $2.7 million in 2006 through withdrawals in June and August, and sent the money home, according to Georgia Newsday. Both have been ordered to pay more than $2.2 million in restitution. The theft was uncovered in a Department of Defense audit. Acting US Attorney John Horn said: 'Best we know from the evidence is they just shipped it back in boxes. It was all cash. 'This was an egregious abuse of trust by two former U.S. Army soldiers who had access to millions of dollars of government money.

"The National Rifle Association has taken aim at former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords just as she is seeking to push for bipartisan legislation on gun safety. Giffords spoke on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and called for expanded criminal background checks on all commercial firearms sales including at gun shows and internet sales. 'Gabby Giffords: Everyone Should Have to Pass Background Check My Attacker Passed,' tweeted the NRA, which isn't in favor of the legislation, in response on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Giffords spoke on Capitol Hill on Wednesday and called for expanded criminal background checks on all commercial firearms sales including at gun shows and internet sales . The tweet, sent to the organization's 264,000 followers, included a link to an article published on the right-wing Breitbart website that argued that background checks don't reduce gun violence . Giffords was shot in the head in an assassination attempt by crazed gunman Jared Loughner. He murdered six and wounded 18 other people, including Giffords, when he opened fire at an event near Tucson, Arizona in 2011. The tweet, sent to the organization's 264,000 followers, included a link to an article published on the right-wing Breitbart website that argued that background checks don't reduce gun violence. The story noted that Loughner had passed a background check. 'Stopping violence takes courage,' said Giffords on Wednesday. 'Now is the time to come together and be responsible. Democrats, Republicans, everyone. We must never stop fighting.' Giffords won a tremendous amount of public sympathy and admiration for her brave fightback from serious injury and up until now the NRA has refrained from attacking her. Several lawmakers have blasted the NRA over its tweet mocking Giffords. NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre isn't in favor of Giffords legislation calling for expanded criminal background checks . 'Gabby Giffords is a fighter,' Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a friend of Giffords, told The Daily News. 'Personal attacks on Twitter are not going to stop her from working hard every single day to pass common sense gun safety laws that save lives.' 'The NRA's brazen response is as predictable as it is pathetic,' said Rep. Kathleen Rice, who is among the co-sponsors of the bill. She called the attack 'blatant fear-mongering and desperate intimidation' aimed at derailing common-sense laws. Supporters of the law say that even though the likes of Loughner passed background checks, a uniform federal requirement would help stop many other dangerous people from buying gun and reduce gun violence rates. 'No one can deny the fact that it will help prevent violent criminals from buying guns,' Rice said.","Giffords spoke on Wednesday calling for expanded criminal background checks on all commercial firearms sales .

"A  killer newt the size of a small car which roamed lakes and rivers in the time of the dinosaurs has been discovered in Portugal. Described as 'like something out of a bad monster movie', the Metoposaurus algarvensis once took the place of crocodiles as one of the Earth's top predators when they lived more than 200 million years ago. A distant relative to today's salamander, the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern Portugual which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered a giant newt which would have terrorised lakes and rivers during the rise of the dinosaurs . Dr Steve Brusatte, from the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who led a study of Metoposaurus published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, said: 'This new amphibian looks like something out of a bad monster movie. 'It was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head, which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut. It was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water, long before the glory days of T. rex and Brachiosaurus.' The family of giant salamander-like amphibians to which Metoposaurus belonged included other species found in parts of modern-day Africa, Europe, India and North America. All were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago, long before the death of the dinosaurs. A distant relative to today's salamander or newt (pictured) the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern Portugual which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures . Described as 'like something out of a bad monster movie', the Metoposaurus algarvensis were the same size as a small car, such as this Fiat 500 . This event marked the end of the Triassic Period, when the super landmass of Pangaea, which included all the world's present-day continents, began to break apart. The extinction killed off many groups of vertebrates, including giant amphibians, and paved the way for dinosaurs to take over the Earth. Members of the Portuguese Metoposaurus colony are thought to have died when the lake they inhabited dried up. Only a four square metre fraction of the site has been excavated so far, and work is continuing in the hope of unearthing more fossils. Co-author Dr Richard Butler, from the University of Birmingham, said: 'Most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless. But back in the Triassic these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be.'","Fossilised remains of a giant newt has been found in a lake in Portugual .

"As the dust starts to settle following the hotly anticipated release of Fifty Shades Of Grey, the film's protagonist has responded to criticism that it glorifies and romanticises abuse against women. Speaking in a video interview with  Kjersti Flaa for TV2 about criticism that Christian’s treatment of her character is abusive, Dakota Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, said: 'I think that is an uneducated opinion. 'Maybe because I know more about the BDSM world, so it makes sense to me, but everything that these characters do, they make the decision to do it.' Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, retaliated to criticism that Christian Grey's treatment of her character is abusive in a new video interview . Domestic violence campaigners in America and the UK called for a boycott of the film when it was released last month because they believed it 'glorified' and 'romanticised' abuse against women. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation  launched a campaign titled Fifty Shades Is Abuse, which urged people to donate to local women's shelters instead of buying movie tickets. In London, feminist campaigners, Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse, said the novel dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men. Dakota, left, with Jamie Dornan in the film, and, right, at the Academy Awards, said: 'Maybe because I know more about the BDSM world, so it makes sense to me, but everything that these characters do, they make the decision to do it' A handful of men and women stood outside the central London premiere in Leicester Square when it was released on Valentine's Day, unfurling a banner calling Christian Grey 'a rapist' as stars made their way along the red carpet. Defending the film, she added: 'Christian doesn’t abuse Ana. She’s not a victim. She’s not a sad, weak-minded, passive person. 'She’s strong and confident and is exploring her body and her sexuality in a private environment with somebody that she loves. And, you know, it’s a movie.' Ahead of the release of the controversial film, activists called on the public to consider whether they should endorse the movie. Defending the film, Dakota added: 'Christian doesn't abuse Ana. She's not a victim. She’s not a sad, weak-minded, passive person' In London, feminist campaigners, Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse, said the novel dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men and protested at the premier . Natalie Collins, who runs campaign group Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse, said the story portrays an abusive relationship. She said that if readers consider Christian Grey's behaviour out of context, it would appear extremely alarming rather than alluring. She said: 'Is it romantic when somebody tracks your phone, when somebody knows where you live before you tell them, sells your only means of transport, or buys the company you work for? 'How can you marry that with being romantic?' Ms Collins, who is a consultant working to end the abuse of women, said that after reading all three books, she was left 'deeply concerned about the amount of domestic violence that was being romanticised and celebrated'. She added: 'The thing that I would say to people who are reading the books, who are going to see it, is, if he wasn't rich and very attractive, would this behaviour be normal?' Domestic violence campaigners in America and the UK called for a boycott of the film when it was released last month because they believed it 'glorified' and 'romanticised' abuse against women . The books, written by EL James, follow the sado-masochistic sexual relationship between the two protagonists, Seattle billionaire Christian Grey and demure student Anastasia Steele. Ms Collins said the campaign group were not against the sexual nature of the book but there were other far more worrying themes in the novel . 'We are not against BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism), it is the other issues in the books and films which we say glamorise domestic violence. 'I have spoken to people who have said that he (Christian Grey) was abused as a child and that is why he is the way he is. 'It is also very dangerous to suggest that people abuse because of their childhood and that women can fix broken men with enough love.'","Dakota was speaking in response to campaigners against the film .

"Our love affair with mobile phones, iPads and other gadgets is ruining our sex lives, research shows. In-depth interviews with couples from across England revealed that modern technology is playing havoc with our relationships.

Another said: ‘Sometimes I’ll be on Facebook and he’ll be on a sporting app while we are both in bed; we realise that we are sitting next to each other but living in different worlds.’ Researcher Dr Mark McCormack, who carried out detailed interviews with 15 couples, said that taking phones and laptops into the bedroom has ‘potentially serious costs to relationships’. His study, commissioned by Durex, also revealed more than a quarter of couples had filmed themselves having sex and that 40 per cent had sent sexy pictures to each other.

"Older women are dying needlessly from breast cancer because they are not offered screening on the NHS, MPs warn. They say it is wrong that women are no longer invited for mammograms once they reach 70 when they are more likely to die than those in their 50s and 60s. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer also warns that an age-bias in the NHS is denying thousands of older women life-saving surgery and chemotherapy. They say attempts by ministers to end this culture have been ‘limited’, ‘disappointing’ and ‘too slow.’ The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer says it is wrong that women are no longer invited for mammograms once they reach 70 when they are more likely to die than those in their 50s and 60s (file image) Although the risk of breast cancer slightly declines once a women reaches 70, she is actually more likely to die from the illness than younger age groups. This is because the illness is often diagnosed in the late stages when it has already spread to the liver, brain or lungs and is difficult to treat. Experts say older women are less mindful of the symptoms than younger generations and tend to have a stoical attitude so don’t want to bother their GP . The NHS’s screening programme invites women for three-yearly mammograms between the ages of 50 and 70. Older women can still have X-rays for free but they must go to the trouble of finding a clinic and booking an appointment on their own initiative. MPs also fear that thousands of older women are being denied life-saving surgery or chemotherapy . Tory MP Steve Brine, chairman of the group, said this led women to wrongly assume that once they had passed 70 they were ‘in the clear’. He added: ‘There are generational issues. Young women are quite comfortable about talking about this whereas the older generation aren’t. ‘We are concerned at the slow pace of change. Whilst some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support that is most appropriate to them. 'Women should be given treatment on their fitness, not their age.’ There are 8,300 cases of breast cancer in the UK a year in women in their 70s, compared to 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s. 'But more than half of the 12,000 women who die of breast cancer a year are over 70. Dr Fran Woodard, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Too often older people don’t get treatment when they need it. 'Also, older women are more likely to have the perception that they are wasting a doctor’s time, which means they can delay visiting a doctor and are therefore more likely to be diagnosed later.’ Scientists have developed a scoring system to predict the risk of developing heart disease or a stroke within ten years. The Globorisk calculator, developed to work out risk in any country, can be used for adults aged 40 and over using information about their individual health and from national databases. The US team that developed the system tested it in 11 countries, including England, where the proportion of men found to be at high risk of having a fatal heart attack or stroke within ten years is 12.9 per cent and of women 10 per cent – on a par with Mexico. Dr Goodarz Danaei, of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston, who led the research, said the system could help identify those at risk who are most likely to benefit from lifestyle changes or preventive drugs. The study, using data from 50,000 people, was published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal.","MPs warn it is wrong that women are not asked for mammograms from 70 .

"Most afternoons I can be found huffing and puffing my way up Primrose Hill in North London, pushing what feels like the world's heaviest baby in a buggy. The view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days I swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the Italian Dolomites. After a two-hour car journey from Innsbruck we were greeted at Rosa Alpina - a five-star, family-owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of San Cassiano - with a local speciality: a sweet and comforting hot apple juice. Impossibly neat: Rosa Alpina is nestled in the green foothills of the Italian Dolomites . In the sunshine, the village looked pristine, with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow-covered in winter but were now a vivid green. The grass was impossibly neat and as I wondered how many cows it must take to maintain, I spotted sit-on mowers weaving up and down the slopes. Completing the alpine scene was a hefty-looking herd with jangling cowbells. Having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby, with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car. As the cable car lurched, my four month-old daughter Romilly wobbled in my lap, lip trembling; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off. I began to doubt my fitness for what was my first post-baby trip away - billed as a Yummy Mummy healthy strolling break. I had feared craggy paths at the summit, precariously winding round the mountain, but found gentle, undulating trails. There was a restaurant, playground, park and fountain. It was as family friendly as the nursery department at John Lewis. Families and groups were starting out or finishing walks, with children in backpacks and buggies, or just jogging alongside their parents, perfectly content without a gadget in sight. Some were Nordic walking, others speed hiking. Would this sort of family outing happen back home? Not likely and what a shame. Instead of craggy, unforgiving trails, Sarah found undulating trails in the mountains perfect for buggies . The views were awesome and the air so pure I took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my London-worn lungs. We could have easily taken a different trail each day of the week. At one hilltop restaurant, deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach, and children played on swings. For a different view of the mountains, the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel. It makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children (and their parents) and Rosa Alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna, plus answer questions on their surroundings. Sarah and her four month-old daughter Romilly enjoy the alpine views from the cable car . Tucked up inside at Rosa Alpina, the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet-smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire. Perhaps it was the mountain air, but bedtime passed without a murmur from Romilly, who was spoilt with a beautifully made-up cot and goodie bag including baby slippers, towelling robe and a cuddly bear. Adults get treats too - of the culinary variety. Rosa Alpina boasts St Hubertus, a stunning Michelin-starred restaurant, where chef Norbert Niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables (no tomatoes in winter) and 90 per cent local produce. Romilly and I sank into a neat routine: a walk after breakfast, a swim after lunch. The peace was enough to move me to tears. For my daughter to experience so little intrusive sound apart from cockerels, cowbells and church bells was bliss. My ideal partner (apart from my partner) on the trip would have been my mother. The walks here are challenging enough to invigorate but easy enough to be a comfortable, Clare Balding-type ramble. I began to wonder if Romilly would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities, of escaping and exploring. As a quote from Fred Astaire painted on the wall of the pool said: 'Old age is like everything else - to have success in it you have to start young.' Rosa Alpina (rosalpina.it) offers double rooms from £235 per night including breakfast.

Another view of the massive entertainment room where the champion boxer entertained friends and hangers-on during his glory days . Photographer Mr Joo, from Cleveland, Ohio, said: 'My journeys have taken me to some strange places but nothing quite like the abandoned home of a former professional boxer. 'It felt cold, rather empty and eerie - not so much a creepy eerie but a more interesting one. 'I knew Mike Tyson had once just hung out here and now I stood staring down everything that had been left behind. 'I loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the Jacuzzi tub. 'But the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time. 'The room was bigger than three of my houses, it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end. Everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust. 'As I wandered the halls and rooms I imagined the wild parties which must have taken place within these walls. 'I looked across a living room once full of life but now empty of parties, tigers and celebrities.'

The boxer was taken into custody in 1991 on allegations of rape and in 1992 a jury found him guilty with the ruling committing him to a six year prison sentence with four years of parole. In 1995 Tyson was granted parole and released from prison, returning to rural Southington in hope of escaping the media which ended up following him. Because of his increasingly desperate financial situation he put the mansion up for sale and sold it in 1999 for $1.3m (£870k). It has since had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an FBI investigation when he tried to sell it - and is now set to be converted into a church. The current owners bought the property in December 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015, allowing Johnny to explore before the work takes place.

The mansion's descent into disrepair could be said to mirror the former heavyweight champion boxer's own fall from grace . The current owners bought the property in December 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 . He added: 'I've seen a few restorations throughout my work but nothing so contrasting as this. 'But it's definitely one of the more well-preserved structures I have been in through years of exploring and photographing abandoned places. 'It makes a perfect candidate for the church to move into and build their sanctuary. Structurally the home is wonderful and I can't wait to see the restoration completed over time. 'The group would like for Mike to attend the first gathering inside the churches sanctuary. 'I hope to help by sharing this story far and wide, maybe bringing his attention to this matter.

"The last thing Sophie Guidolin expected to discover when she was busy raising two young boys, and advocating a healthy lifestyle to hundreds of thousands was that she was pregnant again - with twins. Six years ago and 28 kilograms heavier than she is now, Sophie saw how her pregnancy with her first two children had affected her body. The 25-year-old from the Gold Coast then decided to turn her life around with an incredible fitness and diet regime that transformed her into the best shape of her life - and a national bodybuilding champion. But despite the shock of having twins, Ms Guidolin is determined to maintain her super-fit lifestyle with the same regime she honed using household items such as chairs, stairs and filled water bottles. Sophie Guidolin is 12 and a half weeks pregnant with twins and aims to stay fit and healthy throughout her pregnancy . 'Twins were a huge shock,' Sophie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We had been trying for a while and there are twins in the extended family, but we never even considered it was an option for us.' But even though she is nearly 13 weeks pregnant, 25-year-old Sophie is dedicated to keeping the weight off in an effort to have a more positive pregnancy than she had in the past. By previously cutting out processed foods, starting a strict fitness regime and going on to win nationals in body building, Sophie plans to keep her body in tact this time. 'My eating habits are not changing at all, I don't eat processed foods, soft cheeses or drink alcohol anyway so I haven't needed to cut anything out which is great,' she said. 'I'm going to listen to my own body.' According to the National Association of Specialist Obstetricians and Gynacologists (NASOG) a diet during pregnancy should be high in fibre and protein while maintaining two litres of healthy liquid a day. Sophie was informed by her obstetrician that she can keep up any form of exercise as long as she consumes water and keeps her heart rate under 160 beats per minute. Sophia Guidolin, 25, lost almost 30 kilograms after the birth of her two young sons, while working full-time and bring up the boys on her own . Sophie and her husband Nathan, who is also a champion body builder, are aiming to help those who struggle to find information on pregnancy that does not generalise . Sophie does not consumer any processed foods, soft cheeses or drink alcohol . 'We had been trying for a while and there are twins in the extended family, but we never even considered it was an option for us' 'I can run, jump and do whatever,' she said. 'They told me not to exercise before they assessed me but they soon realised that I am very fit so it's completely fine.' Sophie is closely documenting her workouts, healthy recipes and lifestyle changes through her social media channels and with 300,000 Facebook likers, her advice is reaching a lot of people. Sophie and her husband Nathan, who is also a champion body builder, are aiming to help those who struggle to find information on pregnancy that does not generalise. She is showing others how she is adapting her training through her Youtube channel which shows her favourite exercises to do during her second trimester. She plans to keep her fitness and diet unchanged through pregnancy . 11 and a half weeks pregnant with twins, Sophie flaunts her flat stomach .

After having mostly negative experiences with the pregnancy of her first two children, Sophie is aiming for a tranquil natural delivery with her twins. 'I want to avoid having a caesarean as they are common with twins,' she said. Sophie's advice to other mothers who are seeking to keep up a strict fitness regime while pregnant is to not be afraid and ignore the myths.

"NHS chief executive Simon Stevens today revealed a £200 million scheme aimed at providing better care for the most vulnerable patients . Elderly and vulnerable patients will be offered longer GP appointments – including at weekends – in an attempt to reduce the chances of them ending up in hospital. They will have 30-minute in-depth appointments with a family doctor in the hope that any underlying problems will be picked up before they require emergency admission. As part of a £200million scheme aimed at providing better care for the most vulnerable, some patients will also undergo consultations with A&E nurses via webcams to establish whether it is really necessary for them to go to casualty. Simon Stevens, the NHS’s chief executive, yesterday announced the pilot scheme, which will be rolled out in 29 areas covering a total of five million patients. It is hoped the scheme will gradually expand across England with the aim of treating more patients at home, or at their GP surgery, rather than in hospital. The idea is to bring together hospitals, GPs, community services and care homes to provide more joined-up care. Mr Stevens said the set-up of the NHS is too ‘fragmented’, meaning patients are passed ‘from pillar to post’. Specialist doctors, GPs, nurses and physiotherapists do not work closely together nor spend enough time on preventative care, trying to avoid patients’ conditions deteriorating. The present system also means that patients with several long-term conditions may have to go to a different hospital outpatient clinic 20 or so miles away, several times a month. In an interview for BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, he said: ‘In England we’ve got a growing population and an ageing population and one of the big tests is can we provide compassionate, high-quality care for older people who have several different health problems at once. ‘Too many parts of the service are quite fragmented. Increasingly that’s a problem. People aren’t getting preventative care they need. Often people are being passed from pillar to post, or ending up in accident and emergency departments when they could have avoided it.’ Eventually, Mr Stevens wants many of the complex procedures provided by hospitals to be routinely available at GP surgeries a few miles from patients’ homes. Each area involved in this first phase of the scheme offers slightly different services depending on the needs of the population. In Airedale, West Yorkshire, patients in care homes will be offered consultations via webcams with nurses in A&E units at any time of the day and night. If they suffer a fall, rather than calling an ambulance, staff at the care home will set up the internet consultation with a nurse at the hospital. The nurse will then liaise with a senior doctor and decide if the patient needs to come to A&E immediately or can wait for a GP home visit. In Northamptonshire, the 7 per cent of patients deemed to be the most vulnerable will be offered 30-minute appointments with their GP rather than the standard ten minutes. In West Yorkshire, patients in care homes will be offered consultations via webcams with medics working in A&E units at any time of the day or night, as part of the trial scheme announced today . These patients may have several long-term conditions such as dementia, diabetes and heart disease and doctors will use the time to make more thorough assessments. In Northumberland, patients are being offered GP appointments at the weekend to prevent them going to casualty. Surgeries will form local groups and ensure that at least one is open every Saturday and Sunday. Although the appointments will be offered to all patients, they will most benefit the elderly and those with underlying conditions who see their doctor more often.","Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive, announced £200 million scheme .

"A New Hampshire woman accused of jumping out a second-story window with her baby twins, killing one and severely injuring the other, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Patina Welch, 29, from Lyman, told investigators there were men with guns in her house trying to kill her boy-girl twins and she was trying to save them, reports WMUR-TV. Her son, who was four-months-old, died from his injuries after she landed on him and her now one-year-old daughter was severely injured. Patina Welch, accused of jumping out a second-story window with her four-month-old twins, killing one and severely injuring the other, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity . The 29-year-old Lyman resident Patina Welch told investigators there were men with guns in her house trying to kill her boy-girl twins and she was trying to save them . A psychiatrist testified last month that Welch was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and was psychotic when she jumped last summer. People with schizoaffective disorder experience a combination of the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Moods can swing from deep depression to extreme elation while at the same time causing sufferers to have hallucinations, or even make them paranoid that inanimate objects such as a television are trying to harm them. The baby boy was taken to a local hospital, but he died from his injuries.His sister was treated for her injuries and was released in July (both babies are pictured here, but not being held by Welch) The attorney general's office says Welch has struggled with mental health problems since she was 13. A dangerousness hearing is scheduled for April 8 - it will determine if she should be committed to the state secure psychiatric ward. If a person has symptoms of psychosis and symptoms of a mood disorder, this diagnosis is given. People with schizoaffective disorder experience a combination of the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Moods can swing from deep depression to extreme elation while at the same time causing sufferers to have hallucinations, or even make them paranoid that inanimate objects such as a television are trying to harm them. Schizoaffective disorder usually begins in the late teen years or early adulthood, often between the ages of 16 and 30. Officials said that on the day before the incident, family and friends told investigators Welch was delusional and paranoid, saying she thought people were trying to hurt her, reports WCVB. Prosecutors say police received a 911 call from a couple in Lyman, a town of 550 people in northwest New Hampshire, reporting their son was in medical distress. An emergency crew responded to Welch's home at 4:50 a.m. on June 18 and discovered that the male infant was in 'medical distress.' The baby boy was taken to a local hospital, but he died from his injuries. His sister was treated for her injuries and was released in July. WCVB reports that the little girl is doing well and now living with family. In June, Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeff Strelzin identified the occupants of the home as Linda Tellier, Trevor McGuire and Welch. He also said McGuire and Welch were the parents of the twins, who were not identified by the attorney general's office. Welch threw the twins out of this window. Welch also jumped out of the window and landed on her son, who died from his injuries .

"Islamic State's children have taken centre stage in the latest propaganda video from the terror group purporting to show the apparent beheading of eight Syrians. The video, posted on social media today, claims to show ISIS fighters cutting off the heads of men said to be Shi'ite Muslims. The eight men, wearing the orange jumpsuits which have become associated with the group's sick propaganda, were said to beheaded in the central Syrian province of Hama. Blindfolded and with their hands bound behind their backs, the captives are seen being led forward in a field by teenage boys. Scroll down for video . Sick: Islamic State's children have taken centre stage in the latest propaganda video released by the group . Bound: The men wear the orange jumpsuits which have become associated with the group's sick propaganda . They are then seeing being handed over to a group of masked fighters and each is given a knife from a smiling boy before the hostages are forced to face down on the ground before being butchered. An Islamic State fighter speaks in the video, using a derogatory term for Shi'ites and calling them 'impure infidels.' The fighter says the current military campaign against ISIS will only make them stronger. 'Our swords will soon, God willing, reach the Nuseiries and their allies like Bashar and his party,' he says - a reference to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group which is fighting on his side. Slaughtered: With their hands tied, the hostages are seen being led forward in a field by teenage boys . The word Nuseiry is a derogatory term to refer to Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam. Lebanese media have reported that one of the murdered men is Younes Hujairi, who was kidnapped from his hometown of Arsal near the Syrian border in January. The country's state-run National News Agency quoted Mr Hujairi's family as saying he had been beheaded. Members of Mr Hujairi's family said they have seen pictures of an IS fighter carrying his severed head on social media, it was reported. It is not clear if Mr Hujairi was one of one of the men beheaded in the video - as is a Sunni, while the video states that all the beheaded men were Shii'tes. The border town of Arsal, where Mr Hujairi was kidnapped, was also the site of a bold joint raid by the Islamic State group and Syria's al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front last August. Smiling: A young boy is seen cheerfully handing out knives to each one of the masked fighters . Killed: The eight hostages are then forced to face down on the ground before being butchered . They captured 24 Lebanese soldiers and policemen. Four of those hostages have been killed so far, two of them beheaded by ISIS. The video could not be immediately independently verified, but it appears to be genuine. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said that the video is authentic. The terror group has beheaded scores of captives from across the world since capturing large parts of Iraq and Syria last year. Earlier this month, a video was released showing the beheading of three Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.","New video shows fighters cutting off the heads of eight Shi'ite Muslims .

"The Northumberland Church of England Academy is the second school in the country to adopt a 'cradle to university' policy by offering childcare for newborns . An academy school is now accepting pupils from birth after launching a 'cradle to university' scheme to help youngsters get ahead. The Northumberland Church of England Academy (NCEA) in Ashington, Northumberland, is only the second school in the country to offer childcare for newborn babies. It was a government initiative first adopted by St Bede Academy in Bolton, Greater Manchester, to help tackle issues in early years, including speech and language acquisition. The scheme, known as childminder agencies (CMA) and set up by the Department for Education in September last year, also helps self-employed childminders find work. Childminders will volunteer with the school and in return receiving training and business advice, while parents are offered affordable childminding in a home environment. Headteacher at NCEA, Andrew Day, said: 'We want to be able to do the best for every single child and believe that having children from cradle to university is the best way to do this. 'Up to 50 per cent of our children starting school have speech and language acquisition issues and we hope that this will help address such issues. 'Evidence suggests that educational outcome is set from the age of two for the vast majority of children. 'We are working in partnership with our parents, we want to change the outcomes for our children.' Mr Day, who oversees a school of more than 2,400 students, added: 'Often our parents come as single parents, with jobs and are busy. We need to take the pressure and burden off them. 'It's not about patronising people, it's about giving them an extra layer of support. The Northumberland Church of England Academy (pictured) has launched the government and Ofsted-approved scheme, known as childminder agencies or CMA to help children with their transition to nursery . 'They will be cared for by childminders in a home environment, but we will work with parents and childminders to ensure that each child can be the best that they can be.' CMA is self-funded by the school, which then charges childminders a fee when they register and also to the parents who use their services. The academy, which caters for pupils up to the age of 19, has a centre for children with profound and severe learning difficulties. It also recently opened three new early years centres offering 120 free nursery places for eligible two-year-olds. Clare Lishman, the academy's director of early years, said: 'This is an exciting expansion to our early years provision. 'Research shows that it is the quality of the provision, whether it is in a nursery setting or with a childminder, that delivers the best long term benefits for a child's development. 'Rapid development takes place between the ages zero and three and investing in early years provision is vital to equip children with the skills they need to start their education. Childminders will volunteer with the school and in return receiving training and business advice, while parents are offered affordable childminding in a home environment . 'Childminders who join the agency will receive lots of support from the academy and be part of the early years provision in the school.' The Ofsted-approved scheme was first piloted in the summer 2013 with 20 organisations nationwide, including primary schools, nurseries and councils. St Bede Academy was the only school to continue the trial at the end of last year. Headteacher, Jack Hatch, said at the time: 'Achieving our goal of being the first CMA to be registered in the UK means a lot to our childcare organisation. 'It should help to provide more of our families with excellent-quality affordable childcare and give even more flexibility than we can offer at the present time.'","Northumberland Church of England Academy offers childcare to newborns .

"Sex advice was a lot more simple in the Eighties, says psychotherapist Philippa Perry in the BBC4 documentary Sex, Lies & Love Bites . The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: ‘These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it’s all about submission and domination when of course it isn’t. ‘People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I’m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.’ This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said ‘it’s worse now, but I’m an old person so I would say that.’ She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that ‘it’s a huge problem in society.’ Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine’s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society’s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: ‘There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn’t know what was going to happen. They didn’t have sex education, mainly at schools.’ Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers’ ‘big sister’ imparting advice. This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers’ queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them. Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm . He told the programme: ‘Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You’re in an odd position, where you’re meddling in strangers’ lives and you’re judging a whole situation by one side, you don’t get the other side. ‘Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy. ‘Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don’t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.’ One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes. She said: ‘There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.’","Psychotherapist Philippa Perry has made a documentary on sex advice .

"A small town in Upstate New York stands divided after their high school's decision on Wednesday to broadcast the Pledge of Allegiance in Arabic. It was meant as a way to celebrate National Foreign Languages Week--each day, the announcements and pledge at Pine Bush High School would be recited in a different tongue. However, the outrage it caused in some students and parents quickly forced administrators to issue an apology and a promise to henceforth only recite the Pledge of Allegiance in English. Now, lines have been drawn in Pine Bush (pop. 1,600) as some students and teachers are outraged that an apology was issued at all while others applaud the decision and say the pledge should never have been recited in a language other than English. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Pine Bush High School in Upstate New York celebrated National Foreign Languages Week by reading the pledge in different tongues and caused outrage Wednesday by reading it in Arabic . School Superintendent Joan Carbone told the Times Herald-Record the controversy has 'divided the school in half.' 'Something that was supposed to be good but turned out not to be,' Carbone admitted. The attempt at teaching a lesson in multiculturalism caused a backlash almost immediately. The Herald-Record reports that the broadcast by student assembly president Andrew Zink was 'greeted by catcalls and angry denunciations in classrooms throughout the school.' By Wednesday afternoon, Principal Aaron Hopmayer had apologized in a schoolwide announcement. The school would also soon post an apology to its website. 'The intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than English still pledge to salute this great country,' the statement read. 'We sincerely apologize to any /students, staff or community members who found this activity offensive. In our school District the Pledge of Allegiance will only be recited in English as recommended by the Commissioner of Education.' 'It's the right thing to do': Student assembly president Andrew Zink did the reading and says he would do it again. However, administrators were quickly forced to apologize . Students came out both against the reading and against the backlash as Superintendent Joan Carbone said the controversy had 'divided the school in half' Though he didn't make the decision to make the day's announcements in Arabic himself, according to TWC News, Zink says he was perfectly okay with reading the Arabic script for the day, though he knew it would be controversial. 'I knew exactly what would happen,' he told the Herald-Record. 'I knew many wouldn't support it.' That includes many of the student politician's constituents at Pine Bush. 'Here's my issue. You made the decision to turn the school against itself, a move you knew would make Pine Bush look bad,' student Alan Bavolar tweeted to Zink. Student Alex Krug also opposed the recitation. 'It's the Pledge of Allegiance, we're saying it to the American flag. I think it should be said in English. It is foreign language week but we don't even offer Arabic in Pine Bush High School,' he said. Others supported Zink's decision and were appalled by the backlash, like senior Miranda Monroe, who tweeted: . '""I go to Pine bush but I'm not racist"" *Me introducing myself to new people*' Despite all the controversy, Zink won't apologize for his decision to read the pledge in Arabic. 'It's the right thing to do,' he said. Zink was bombarded online by his detractors and his supporters Wednesday but says he supports what was initially a gesture of multiculturalism . . .","Pine Bush High School in Upstate New York celebrated National Foreign Languages Week by reading the pledge in different tongues .

"The chief White House spokesman denied having any knowledge of the criminal charges that are reportedly being brought against New Jersey lawmaker Bob Menendez on Monday and used the lack of awareness as proof positive that the alleged investigation is a form of political payback. 'I cant speak to the accuracy of those claims,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said when asked about a news report claiming that federal prosecutors are  preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against the Democratic senator. And just because its been reported in the press, well, 'that's not proof of them being a fact,' he said. 'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation.' 'If there is a criminal investigation on the way, it is one that had been done wholly separate and apart from any sort of political interference,' he stated. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . CNN reported on Friday that a grand jury probe that has lasted two years was reaching a crescendo, and prosecutors, under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out, would soon bring charges against Menendez that stem from his relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. The senator has fiercely denied he has done anything illegal, and one of his conservative colleagues in the Senate, Ted Cruz, has suggested the investigation is politically motivated. Menendez told reporters on Friday, I have 'always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law. 'I am not going anywhere,' he promised. Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement that 'the facts will ultimately confirm' that his behavior was in no way improper. 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. 'The timing seems awfully coincidental,' Cruz said of the probe on Saturday while speaking to reporters. 'The very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' Cruz said. Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran. Speaking to reporters on Saturday after an appearance at the Iowa Ag Summit, Cruz said the timing of the charges 'seems awfully coincidental.' COY: Asked Monday about the alleged probe, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, 'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation' The same week Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'came to Washington, spoke in Congress about the enormous threat of President Obama's misguided deal with Iran,' he said, and 'the very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' the Texas lawmaker said. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham made a similar observation at Saturday's event, according to CNN. 'They leaked a story about an impending indictment right after the [American Israeli Public Affairs Committee] conference, right after Bob Menendez said, to his great credit, stood up and said I want to look at any deal you with Iran,' Graham charged. 'As to Bob Menendez, like every other American, he's innocent until proven otherwise. He's a friend. But this whole behavior around the Obama administration regarding the law is very disturbing.' Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Asked Monday about the alleged investigation, Earnest said, 'We don't know whether or not they're true.' 'I'm not going to comment on them for that reason.' 'The other reason I'm loathe to comment on this is that there is a principle this administration takes very seriously,' and that is 'ensuring that prosecutions are kept separate and apart from political interference or even the appearance of political interference.' 'That undermines the claims of a lot of people, including apparently Sen. Cruz,' he stated. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez’s re-election campaign. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the president's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate matter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment – principally cargo-container x-ray machines – to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing what news reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.","New Jersey Sen.

"A controversial Spanish aquarium trainer who was accused of abusing dolphins has been found dead following a suspected suicide. Jose Luis Barbero, 59, who was due to arrive in the US to work at the Georgia Aquarium at the beginning of March believed to have taken his own life in Spain after he started receiving death threats when video emerged of him apparently kicking and hitting the animals . The 59-year-old was working on the resort island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean Sea  when he vanished on Friday after the damning footage surfaced. Scroll down for video . Dolphin trainer Jose Luis Barbero, who was just hired by the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been found dead in Spain following a suspected suicide . Before he vanished, videos of Barbero, 59, (rear) allegedly hitting and kicking dolphins surfaced on the internet . After the videos (pictured above) started popping up on the web, Barbero began receiving death threats . A statement from management at the Atlanta attraction sent to Fox 5 following his death paid tribute to the expert trainer and accused people of rushing to judge him. 'It was with sadness, outrage and frustration that I received the news this morning that Jose Luis Barbero was found dead in Spain. 'Initial reports suggest that he allegedly ended his own life. He was a husband, a father and a grandfather who dedicated nearly four decades to caring for animals. We at Georgia Aquarium were proud to have had him serve periodically as a consultant to our organization over the past eight years. His service with us was exemplary. 'After allegations were levied against him, we took the situation very seriously. Georgia Aquarium began a search for truth in hopes of disproving these unsubstantiated claims. 'Sadly, he and his family received death threats, and groups and individuals rushed to judge him. He was not given the right or the privilege to be considered innocent until proven guilty, a principle I hold dear. His death is untimely, unnecessary and unjust. 'We were not given the chance to thoughtfully and thoroughly review the allegations against him before activists, consultants and some in our own community tortured him with enough hatred to cause him to allegedly take his own life. 'I hope the death of Jose Luis Barbero teaches those who were quick to condemn him a lesson about being hasty to charge and indict. 'We will continue to operate Georgia Aquarium with dedication, devotion and pride in how we care for and about our animals -- as well as the people affiliated with our organization. We will continue to serve the community and be advocates for animals around the world, as we have done since our founding. We will never condone any injustice, such as the one done to Jose Luis Barbero. 'We mourn with his family, his friends and all those who must contend with this terrible loss.' A former FBI agent was also hired by the Georgia Aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation . Officials from the Atlanta attraction have issued a statement defending Barbero and accused his critics of being too quick to judge him . Barbero went missing before another video  accusing him of abusing dolphins was released on Friday, according to11 Alive. He was last seen on Tuesday leaving his home, WSB TV reported. Balearic Islands emergency services are continuing to search for him. Georgia Aquarium CEO Mike Leven said, 'We are very concerned. 'We hope he turns up soon and that everything is all right. Our thoughts are with him and his family.' According to Leven, Barbero received death threats after the videos surfaced. The embattled trainer did respond to the videos on Facebook. In a translated post he said: 'I believe a response is needed to this brutal and cowardly campaign against my profession. 'I can only say from my lawyers' recommendations that this video is a montage created to provoke a campaign challenging my professionalism over 35 years.' Barbero of Spain went missing before another video accusing him of abusing dolphins was released yesterday . The most recent video allegedly shows Barbero being aggressive towards dolphins during a training session at a theme park in Spain. Animal advocacy group SOSdelfines said the videos are 'meant to show how captive dolphins are treated', according to the Dodo. The aquarium has questioned whether the videos of Barbero are authentic and used the terms 'extremely questionable' and 'crudely edited' to describe them. Aquarium leaders claimed to have 'thoroughly reviewed and vetted' Barbero as a candidate and also cited that he has 35 years of professional experience. Experts were brought in to analyze the content of the videos. A former FBI agent was also hired by the aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation. It is unclear what Barbero's job status is at the  moment, but he it appears he is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium. The Georgia Aquarium maintains that it has a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals . Animal advocacy group SOSdelfines said the videos are 'meant to show how captive dolphins are treated' The aquarium released a statement about the Barbero investigation on Friday afternoon. It said: 'Our search for truth into the allegations against Jose Luis Barbero continues. 'Until our investigation is complete, we will not make any decisions regarding his employment, so at this time, Mr. Barbero remains in Spain. 'We are committed to making decisions based on factual information and very thorough analysis. 'We have a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals and continue to investigate every aspect of this matter. 'We appreciate your patience and support as we sort through this difficult situation.'

"TV presenter Dr Michael Mosley will eat black pudding made from his own blood for a new documentary. In a variety of tests, Dr Mosley will take an in-depth look at blood for a medical series on BBC Four. He will undergo six experiments on his own blood, including injecting it with snake venom to see how it can clot within seconds and starving it of oxygen. Scroll down for video . In a new BBC show, Dr Michael Mosley (pictured) will taste a black pudding made from his own blood . The Wonderful World of Blood, which features specialist photography to look at blood 'as never seen before', is one of several new science shows announced today. Dr Mosley will also chart the journey from single cell to human being in 9 Months That Made You for BBC Two. In the show, he will look at the 'minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour' development of a baby in the first 280 days of life from a single cell. The series will examine the moment the face forms, the first beat of the heart and the day the nerves set off their first signals. Previously, Dr Mosley, a former City banker, has explored the benefits of high intensity exercise and intermittent fasting. He was credited with popularising the 5:2 diet via the Eat, Fast, and Live Longer documentary. This involves fasting for two days a week and then unconstrained eating the other five days. The diet has since been followed by celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez. In his most recent show, Oxford university educated Dr Mosley looked at the world of parasites and deliberately infested himself with them. The BBC screened a Horizon documentary, The Nine Months That Made You, in 2011, which looked at how much of a human being's health has been determined by the time we get out of the womb. The presenter will undergo six experiments on his own blood for the upcoming BBC4 programme .

"Branko Loncar, 55, won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder . A man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in Britain – after judges refused to extradite him. Branko Loncar, 55, has won a long legal battle against being returned to Croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder, despite committing further crimes, including an assault, while living in London. He earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee Croatia because of anti-Serb discrimination – and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting. Last week’s High Court ruling is a sharp reminder that while the Government talks of ejecting foreign criminals, in practice the criminals routinely win the right to stay here. Loncar, who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in Britain with his two sons in 1999, made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away. In any case, his lawyers claimed, she died as a result of hanging herself, not because of the 14 bullets he ‘accidentally’ fired into her defenceless body. A Croatian court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence, sentenced him to four years in prison, and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from Britain. His lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds, arguing that he had a new Serbian ‘partner’ in Britain – who actually lives a hundred miles away – and that he now had grandchildren in London. And last week British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free here, after ruling it ‘oppressive’ to send him back to prison in Croatia after so long. He was also commended for raising his children alone after shooting his wife. Speaking in broken English to the Daily Mail last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable Camden in North London, Loncar said he had every right to remain in Britain, adding: ‘Croatia is dangerous – they still want me there.’ The case began in 1994, amid the chaos of the Balkan wars, when Loncar, an ethnic Serb and former soldier in the Yugoslavian army, lived with his wife Mirjana and two sons in the village of Ostrovo. The area was declared part of a Serbian republic but was also claimed by Croatia. UK court documents note: ‘After a quarrel with his wife Mirjana, she went out of the house, stood on a ladder, took a rope and indicated she intended to kill herself. As she stood from the ladder and the noose tightened around her neck and rendered her unconscious, the defendant fired a number of bullets into her body. ‘The cause of death was determined to be by strangulation but was accelerated by the injuries inflicted from the defendant’s gun. The defendant was charged with murder.’ The subsequent trial – by a Serbian court – heard that Loncar had fired 14 shots from his handgun ‘causing a number of injuries’. Last week, British judges finished off the extradition bid for ever, giving Loncar the right to remain free in the UK, by ruling in the High Court (pictured) that it would be ‘oppressive’ to send him back to prison in Croatia . He told the court ‘that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder, he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away, but did not know in which direction.’ After a single pathologist claimed Mrs Loncar had already died of strangulation before being shot, he was initially cleared of murder. In 1999 he then flew to England with his children and successfully claimed asylum, saying that his ethnic Serbian children were discriminated against by Croatians at school – but also complaining of ‘local antipathy resulting from the death of his wife’. While he began a life on benefits here, Croatia’s supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial, with Loncar’s village now a part of Croatia, and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder. Four doctors said Mrs Loncar was still alive when her husband shot her. He was given a four-year prison sentence on the grounds that he ‘had an intention to kill’. Croatia, a member of the European Union, some years later sought Loncar’s extradition, and in 2006 British police arrested him. A UK court swiftly rejected the request, noting with sympathy that he had to bring up his children alone after shooting his wife. But in 2014 he was arrested again, and although he was immediately freed on bail the case was sent to the High Court in London. Last week’s High Court judgment in Loncar’s favour, by judges Lord Justice Aiken and Mrs Justice Popplewell, the conclusion of the long legal battle, noted: ‘The offence for which the extradition of Mr Loncar is sought is undoubtedly a very serious one. Moreover, Mr Loncar has not led a blameless life as a British citizen. ‘He has a caution for theft in 2012 and a conviction for common assault in 2013. Nevertheless we have reached the firm conclusion that it would be oppressive to extradite Mr Loncar by reason of the passage of time.’ The ruling was also sharply critical of the Croatian legal system, and observed that he had served a year in prison before being initially cleared almost 20 years ago. And in reference to the Human Rights Act’s ‘right to a family life’ clause, judges said Loncar had ‘been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006, although they do not live together’. Far from living together, the Daily Mail has discovered that ‘partner’ helping provide him with a ‘family life’ to maintain here is an ethnic Serb born in Britain and living 100 miles from him in Leicester.","Branko Loncar, 55, moved to UK after being cleared of murdering his wife .

"A 16-year-old schoolboy hanged himself in a ‘horrible mistake’ as he experimented to see how Hollywood legend Robin Williams died, an inquest has heard. Temidayo Joseph died in his bedroom in August last year just hours after collecting his GCSE results. The talented footballer, known to his friends as Temi, was found hanged in his bedroom by his mother Kate Ibok. Temidayo Joseph, 16, was found hanged in his bedroom by his mother hours after collecting his GCSE results . An inquest at Essex Coroner’s Court today heard that in the days leading up to the teenager’s death, the ‘lively and popular’ youngster had spoken with a cousin in Nigeria about the actor. The court heard no suicide note was found and a police report concluded that the youngster had no intention of killing himself. Essex Coroner Eleanor McGann said: ‘There was a conversation which took place about big news in the media about the death of Robin Williams. ‘Temi had said ‘I don’t understand why somebody would do this to themself’.. ‘It’s perfectly possible that he did not have any idea how easy it is to hang yourself by mistake.’ She added: ‘That would seem to fit with this happy little boy with an enquiring mind who has made a horrible mistake. An inquest at Essex Coroner’s Court today heard that in the days leading up to the teenager’s death, the ‘lively and popular’ youngster had spoken with a cousin in Nigeria about the death of actor Robin Williams (pictured) Detective Sergeant Tara Barnes told the inquest she had concluded her report into the death by saying: ‘I had no information that his intention was to kill himself.’ Tragically, a fellow student at his school - The Ockendon Academy in Thurrock, Essex – was found dead in South Ockenden just two weeks ago. An inquest into the death of Toni Connell, which was opened and adjourned today, heard that the 15-year-old was also found hanged. Her mother Amanda Connell, 46, has blamed exam pressure for the death of her daughter. She said last week: ‘I have lost a big part of my life and I put it down to the school putting so much stress on my daughter.’ But the coroner today ruled out the same reason as the cause of Temi’s death. Although he had gained just three C grades, the inquest heard that academy staff had taken steps to warn Temi, who dreamed about becoming a professional footballer, about what kind of grades he would be getting. Essex Coroner Eleanor McGann recorded a verdict of accidental death and said the teenager had 'everything to live for'. Pictured, Temi as a child (left) and with his mother Kate Ibok (right) His family said he had been looking forward to enrolling at college. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mrs McGann said: ‘It is very easy to jump to the conclusion someone has got their GCSE results and think he has hanged himself. ‘That conclusion, in this case, would be wrong. ‘He got the results he expected to get - he knew what pathway he would follow.’ She added: ‘There was no evidence at all that Temi wanted to kill himself - quite the contrary this was a young man with everything to live for. Temidayo's father Vincent Joseph (pictured today) said his son was a 'lovely young man' ‘He had a loving and sound extended family, lots of support and was very popular at school, not just with pupils but teachers as well. ‘Why on earth would he intend to kill himself? ‘I am not satisfied, so that I am sure, that he intended to kill himself that day and therefore I am not returning a verdict of suicide. She added that although he had discussed the death of Robin Williams, ‘there is nothing to show he intended to die’. She concluded it was a ‘tragic accident of a young boy simply trying to work out how something has been done and it went horribly wrong.’ After the verdict, Temi’s devastated father Vincent, 54, from Waterloo in London, wept as he described his ‘talented son’. He said: ‘I did not know about the link to Robin Williams before we went into the inquest. ‘Temidayo was a lovely young man and a great character. ‘He did not intend to kill himself - he was a very talented boy and lived for his football - that’s all he wanted to do. ‘I was so happy when I stood by him to hear him call me father. I have lost a good friend.’ Temi’s mother, who was not present at today’s inquest, has temporarily moved back to Nigeria with his 12-year-old sister, Christiana, 12, to cope with her grief.

"A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed the creature's incredible tongue acrobatics. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill. To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds. Scroll down for video . A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket . The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes. This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed. Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius. Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. Lifespan: Two to five years . Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth. The tongue’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself. In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion. The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved. Previous studies didn’t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said. When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics.

"President Obama got angry during the Saturday Night Live cold open this week, and it seems that when President Obama gets angry he turns into someone very different - The Rock Obama. President Obama (Jay Pharoah) sat down to have a talk with John Boehner (Taran Killam), Tom Cotton (Kyle Mooney) and Ted Cruz (Bobby Moynihan) to talk about how he believed the three men had  undermined his authority. And when they mocked him over and over again, he attacked the men. Scroll down for video . The Saturday Night Live cold open this week had President Obama (above) speaking with John Boehner, Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz . He criticized Speaker Boehner (above) for inviting the Prime Minister of Israel to speak to Congress without consulting him . He criticized Senator Cotton (above) for his leader to Iranian leaders . He also attacked Senator Cruz (above) for praising Netanyahu .

'And that's hard to do when you, Senator Cotton, are sending letters to the Iranian government behind my back.'

Obama then turned to Boehner and said; 'Or when you, Speaker Boehner, invite the Prime Minister of Israel to speak to Congress without consulting me.' Here he is referring to Boehner having Benjamin Netanyahu speak earlier this month. He continued with Cruz, saying; 'Or when you, Senator Cruz, call Netanyahu an extraordinary leader and side with him over your own president.'

"France has rejected imposing a ban on super-skinny fashion models - beause a law would risk discriminating against 'thin people' in the workplace. Left-wing MPs had demanded six-month prison terms or fines of £60,000 for fashion bosses who 'glorify anorexia' by hiring underweight girls. They had called for models to carry medical certificates showing their body mass index - calculated by dividing one's weight in kilogrammes by the square of one's height in metres. Scroll down for video . Unhealthy: France has rejected imposing a ban on super-skinny fashion models.

Socialist politician Olivier Veran told French daily Le Parisien: 'It's intolerable to promote malnutrition and to commercially exploit people who are endangering their own health. 'A level of acceptable body mass index should be set and enforced. Websites encouraging young girls to lose weight should also be banned.' But the nation's parliament yesterday rejected the socialist MPs amendment to France's new health bill on the grounds that it would 'discriminate against jobseekers on the grounds of their weight'. Mr Veran and fellow MPs said they would now re-write their amendment in the hope of incorporating it into the bill, which will be debated again later this year. Thin:  Olivier Veran had demanded that all models be forced to present a certificate of good health before being allowed on the catwalk. France said such rules would risk discriminating against 'thin people' There are now 40,000 people in France suffering from anorexia, around 90 per cent of whom are adolescents, according to the latest health ministry figures. French socialist politician Olivier Veran had led calls for a change in the rules over super-skinny models . In Norway, MPs have proposed that images of airbrushed fashion models should come with a 'cigarette-packet' style health warning in a bid to tackle eating disorders. One suggested text for the Norwegian warning would read: 'This advertisement has been altered and presents an inaccurate image of how this model really looks.' Spain has already barred models below a certain body mass index from the Madrid fashion shows. Italy has insisted on health certificates for fashion show participants. And Brazil is considering demands to ban underage, underweight models from its catwalks. Medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models, and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner, which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six. Fashion guru Giorgio Armani said two years ago that the fashion industry had a duty to 'work together against anorexia'. He added at the time: 'The industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women.'","Socialist politician Olivier Veran said skinny models 'glorify anorexia'

"Death by drugs: Luke Goodman, 23, died in Colorado over the weekend after he took too many marijuana edibles and shot himself in the head . A popular college graduate died this past weekend in Colorado, after his family say he took too many marijuana candies and killed himself. Luke Goodman, 23, of Tulsa, Oklahoma ate four times the prescribed amount of a peach tart marijuana edible candy in addition to a THC-laced red velvet cookie and proceeded to shoot himself in the head with a gun he brought on the trip for protection. Goodman's family say he was a charismatic and outgoing young man who never showed signs of depression or suicidal thoughts before. They blame his death solely on the edibles. 'It was 100 per cent the drugs. It was completely because of the drugs - he had consumed so much of it,' his mother Kim Goodman told CBS Denver. Goodman was on a two-week ski trip with his family and friends when his parents dropped him off at the bus stop Saturday to go snowboarding with his cousin, Caleb Fowler. Goodman's parents were on their way back to Tulsa, and their son was going to spend the rest of the trip with his cousin. During their day out, Goodman and Fowler went to Silverthorne where the two purchased $78 worth of pot and edibles. They then went back to their lodgings and proceeded to get high. Fowler says his cousin started off by eating two peach tart candies at the same time - despite the fact that the suggested dosage is just one candy. Each candy contains 10mg of THC - the active ingredient in marijuana. When Goodman didn't immediately feel the effects of the drug, he took two more and also ate red velvet cookie baked with marijuana (his cousin had three cookies). Goodman's mother fears her son didn't read the warning label on the candies, which say the effects can take hours to kick in. Scroll down for video . Too much: Goodman's cousin Caleb Fowler says he ate five peach tart edibles, which is five times the suggested dosage. Above a stock image of a peach tart edible. It's unclear the specific brand Goodman ingested . Several hours later, Goodman's behavior changed drastically and he became jittery, incoherent and started talking nonsensically. 'He would make eye contact with us but didn’t see us, didn’t recognize our presence almost. He had never got close to this point, I had never seen him like this,' Fowler said. Apparently unaware of his serious condition, Fowler left Goodman in the condo to hop in the hot tub with other members of their vacation party. Only his cousin's mother was in the apartment, when Goodman grabbed his handgun, which he traveled with for protection, and shot himself. The single shot was fired just five minutes after Fowler left Goodman to use the hot tub. The Summit County Coroner says toxicology reports due back in a few weeks will shed more light on the edibles impact on Goodman's death. However, his family are certain that it was the edibles and edibles alone are what caused their son to take his own life. Out of character: Goodman's parents say she was a happy young man who never showed signs of depression of suicidal thoughts before the tragic incident on Saturday . 'It was completely out of character for Luke...there was no depression or anything that would leave us being concerned, nothing like that,' Mrs Goodman said. 'I was very, very close to him,' Mrs Goodman added to Daily Mail Online. 'He would share heart and soul with me.' Mrs Goodman says her son had just graduated from Oral Roberts University in December with a degree in marketing and had his whole life ahead of him. She says he had been going to the gym five or six days a week, working out for the snowboarding trip with his cousins who were some of his best friends. 'He was such a well-adjusted young man,' Mrs Goodman told us. 'He lit up people's world.' Goodman was certainly well loved, since his Facebook page was flooded with heartbroken notes from friends and family on his passing. 'Luke, your light shined so bright to everyone you came in contact with. I know your legacy will shine even brighter. You were hated by no one and loved by all. That smile and the joy you carried with you was contagious,' one friend wrote.","Luke Goodman bought $78 worth of edibles and marijuana with his cousin on Saturday and the two went back to their condo in Keystone to get high .

"The saying 'Rome wasn't built in a day' couldn't be more apt for super slimmer Kirste Crompton who has recently lost ten stone. It has taken one year, and lots of hard work, but the mother-of-five has transformed her body after running 1,820 miles on a treadmill at home – the exact distance from Scotland to the Italian capital. The 42-year-old has also lost seven dress sizes in the process, taking her from a dangerous 21st and dress size 24 to a healthy and happy 11st and size 10. Scroll down for video . Kirste Crompton, 42, from Bootle, Liverpool has lost an incredible 10 stone in her own living room . At her heaviest, Kirste, 5.8"", was too 'embarrassed' to work out in public and instead paid £65 a month to rent a treadmill from the comfort of her home. Today, the housewife and mother runs an amazing 35 miles a week, has recently completed her first marathon and is now hoping to compete in a triathlon. She has also raised over £600 for The April Jones Trust, after befriending April's mother, Coral, on Facebook. Speaking at her home in Bootle, Liverpool she says: 'I can't believe how far I've come. 'Less than a year ago I could barely walk, now I'm running marathons and am as fit as a fiddle. 'What's more, I'm an active mum and can actually play with my kids and take them swimming without my huge tummy getting in the way. I'm a new person.' In April 2010, Kirste, then 38, was diagnosed with postnatal depression after giving birth to her youngest daughter, Honey, now four. The mother-of-five rented a treadmill for £65 a month and turned her dining room into a home-gym . She recalls: 'Up until then I'd been around 13st and a size 12 to 14. But following Honey's birth I fell into deep depression and struggled to get out of bed in the morning. 'I turned to food for comfort and would lock myself in my room for hours eating.' Kirste's devoted husband David Crompton, 36, a former soldier, looked after Honey and Kirste's other four children from a previous relationship: Stockard, 9, Pacey, 11, Hermione, 13 and Darcy, 16. At her lowest ebb, the mother-of-five was eating family-sized bags of crisps, drinking three bottles of white wine and eating saucepans full of pasta for dinner. 'Food was becoming an addiction,' she continues, 'It was all I thought about.' Within the space of four years, Kirste had ballooned from a size 12 to a 24 and was tipping the scales at 21 stone. She says: 'I was morbidly obese and was so ashamed of my wide girth I couldn't face looking in the mirror or getting dressed in the mornings. Kirste, pictured on her wedding day, says she was once 'an embarrassment to my kids,' 'More importantly, it was preventing me from being a good mother. I was so overweight I couldn't pick Honey up or play with my kids because my gigantic tummy was in the way.' Kirste explains that she was caught in a vicious circle: she felt guilty about her size which made her feel depressed and then turned to comfort food to make herself feel better. She says: 'I hated dropping the kids off at school because the other parents would stare at me and exchange looks. 'I was obese and it was an embarrassment for my kids.' Kirste's wake-up call came in February 2014, nearly four years after giving birth to Honey. She says: 'I was at home preparing dinner when another parent knocked on my front door. 'There had been an altercation between our kids and we were trying to resolve it. But during her rant she called me a 'fat cow'. 'I went bright red and felt like I was going to burst into tears, it was horrible.' In that moment, Kirste realised it was time to ditch the greasy snacks and calorific booze. Too ashamed to be seen outside or exercise in a gym, she rented a £65 treadmill and turned her dining room into a home-gym. She says: 'It suited me perfectly because no one could watch me working out. 'I downloaded a running training pack from online and started to do interval training. 'Walking for five minutes and then running for two. But it was very hard as I was so unfit. Tosay the size 10 mother says that eating wholesome food also helped her to tackle her depression . In just five months Kirste lost an incredible four stone and dropped from a size 24 to a size 16, gaining the confidence to start running outside . 'I tried to use it whenever I could, and when my fitness improved I started running for half an hour a day – covering 5km each time.' On top of her new exercise regime, Kirste totally changed her diet. She traded family-sized portions of spaghetti bolognese, cheese on toast, crisps and chocolate for fruit, yoghurt and low-calorie meals, and saw the weight start to drop off. On top of this, she stopped drinking white wine altogether, instead drinking water and fresh juice. She says: 'The exercise lifted my mood and I felt like a new person. 'I was no longer suffering from sugar crashes and eating wholesome food evened out my moods and helped with my depression.' In just five months she lost an incredible four stone, dropping from a size 24 to a size 16 and developing a new hobby in the process. 'I loved running,' she says, 'I'd developed a hobby and was becoming a good runner.' In July 2014, weighing 17st, Kirste ran her first 10km race for Bupa in 85 minutes. She said: 'It was a really hot day but I felt incredible afterwards.' Today Kirste, now 11st, runs up to 35 miles a week and says that some people barely recognise her . In the space of one year, Kirste has run 1,820 miles on her home treadmill, the equivalent of the distance from Scotland to Rome. She said: 'It's incredible when I look at it like that. 'This weekend I ran the Wrexham marathon in six hours and 15 minutes. 'Before I would only run in the privacy of my home but now I run outside and feel great. 'People barely recognise me, I've changed beyond belief. 'More importantly, I'm healthy and happy and am an active mum to my kids.'","Kirste Crompton of Bootle, Liverpool slimmed from a  size 24 to  size 10 .

"A school assistant who barricaded young children inside a classroom before stripping naked and fighting with staff did it because she thought Satan was outside, her lawyers said today. Linda Lira, 31, is facing four years in jail after she was arrested at Lemon Grove Academy in San Diego yesterday for locking a group of nine to 11-year-olds into a classroom. Police initially thought Lira, who is from San Diego, had taken hallucinogenic drugs, but tests came back negative and her lawyers now say she was trying to protect the children from demons. Linda Lira, 31, was arrested yesterday after locking a group of nine to 11-year-olds into a classroom, then fighting with school staff as they tried to free the youngsters, while 'undressing and dressing repeatedly' Police initially thought Lira, who is facing four years behind bars, had taken drugs, but test came back negative and her lawyers now say she locked the room because she thought demons were outside . The strange incident began in a classroom at Lemon Grove yesterday at around 4pm when Lira began 'acting bizarre' before locking herself and a group of students inside a room. One child was slapped an two others pushed to the floor when they tried to escape, suffering minor injuries, as Lira began barricading the door. The quick-thinking youngsters used Lira's unguarded campus radio to call for help, and when other staff arrived and broke into the room, Lira began fighting with them. The children managed to slip out of the room, leaving Lira behind, at which point she began 'undressing and dressing repeatedly', according to one Sheriff's Deputy. She was initially arrested for 14 counts each of child endangerment and false imprisonment, but this was later revised to three charges of false imprisonment and one of resisting arrest. The incident happened yesterday at Lemon Grove Academy (pictured). Lawyers say they are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but think the breakdown was triggered by something in Lira's past . Today defense attorney Corey Wlodarczyk said Lira had suffered a 'breakdown' inside the classroom, telling NBC 7 that she 'suffers from emotional issues'. While Mr Wlodarczyk said he is still trying to piece together exactly what happened, he said the behavior was 'uncharacteristic' of Lira, and was likely triggered by something in her past. He added that Lira was scared, having never been arrested before, and said she was taking her ordeal 'one day at a time'. The suspect’s sister, Cathy Lira, said her sibling had been making some strange comments about Lucifer and warriors guarding her in recent weeks, but declined to say more. Lira was initially being held on bail of $2.1million, but that has now been cut to $500,000 after prosecutors dropped charges.","Linda Lira, 31, arrested at Lemon Grove Academy, San Diego, yesterday .

"Britain is set for a chilly start to the week with a cold air mass blowing from eastern Europe bringing temperatures as low as -2C. After a crisp weekend in which parts of the UK saw freezing overnight temperatures, the tail end of a cold blast means spring will continue to be put on hold. Clear skies at night will bring the coldest weather and will affect regions including East Anglia, with areas of high altitude, such as the Pennines, possibly seeing a dusting of snow. Scroll down for video . Cold predicted: Two people prepare their boat for sailing at Hill Head beach in Hampshire today as Britain prepares for a chilly start to the week . Kirk Waite, forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'At the moment we're looking at things not changing much over the next few days with a lot of cloud and the odd bit of rain - but it will be mostly dry. 'It will be cloudy tonight with low temperatures of around 3C. Monday will see a cool, cloudy, grey start with the easterly cold air mass easing a little. We expect to see temperatures of around 9C in the North of the country and it will be a touch warmer in the South. 'Monday night could be the coldest night of the week where the cloud clears and in places such as East Anglia the temperature may fall to -2C. 'Throughout the week we're going to see an increasing amount of sunshine. It will generally be quite dry and settled. 'On Tuesday and Wednesday the temperature will move up to around 13C to 14C. It will still be just below average at night, but it's fairly normal to get these variations in spring.

"Photographs of Yosemite's iconic Half Dome peak have revealed the astonishing extent of California's historic drought. The images, which show the peak in the third week of March each year between 2011 and 2015, reveal how swiftly snowfall has depleted year to year. The snow is typically at its deepest in the area in late March and, as seen in the 2011 photograph, it previously covered peaks including the Half Dome. But this year, the fourth consecutive year of drought in California, the 9,000-foot peak doesn't bear a single flake of snow. Earlier this month, officials reported that the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which gives an indication of upcoming water supply, is just five per cent of its normal depth - and barely above the record low set in 1991. The lack of water comes after the winter of 2014 was the hottest on record for California. Scroll down for video . Hidden: A photo taken by a Yosemite Conservancy webcam on March 19, 2011 shows Yosemite's Half Dome peak covered with snow . Depleting: The following year, in March 2012, the iconic peak is similarly covered in deep snow . In response, state regulators voted earlier this month to impose a new set of water conservation rules, such as bans on watering yards and stopping restaurants serving customers water unless they specifically ask for it. Farmers have said they expected to leave as much as a million acres unplanted, nearly twice the amount of last year, the New York Times reported. 'It looks like we are on our way to the worst snowpack in history,' state climatologists Michael Anderson told the Times. 'Unless we end up with some particularly good snows here in March, we are going to end up with a new lowest rank here.' But the Half Dome peak is likely to stay clear of snow because there are no major snowstorms forecast for the rest of the month. Earlier this month, the United States Department of Agriculture noted that as well as California, droughts are ravaging Nevada and Utah and also parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington and Oregon. The photographs were taken by the Yosemite webcam provided by Yosemite Conservancy, which is funded by donations. While all years show the peak on March 19, the 2014 image shows it on March 17 as a March 19 photograph was not available. Warming temperatures: But by March 2013, the peak is drastically different - with far less snow as temperatures stay higher . Depleting: The following year, 2014, also shows far less snow than in previous years as drought ravages states on the West Coast .

"Britain has evacuated its last . special forces from Yemen because of the deteriorating security . situation there. The move was confirmed by a source familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters today and follows an announcement by US officials on Saturday that the country had evacuated its own remaining personnel, including about 100 special operations forces. US State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said in a statement: 'Due to the deteriorating security situation in Yemen, the US government has temporarily relocated its remaining personnel out of the country.' Anti-Houthi protesters demonstrate in Yemen's southwestern city of Taiz today. Iran-backed Houthis took over the city on Sunday as violence intensifies with the group's continuing push south .

Pro-Houthi police troopers use tear gas to disperse anti-Houthi protesters in Taiz in violent clashes today . US forces evacuated al Annad airbase near the southern city of al Houta, which was captured by al Qaeda militants on Friday. Their British counterparts are understood to have been airlifted from the capital Sana'a over the weekend. The Ministry of Defence does not comment on special forces matters. Britain withdrew staff from its embassy in Yemen last month . and temporarily suspended operations there as  northern-based Houthi rebels continued their march south. Washington and Paris also closed their embassies last month as the country teeters on the brink of all-out civil war. The latest withdrawal came as pro-Houthi police troopers used tear gas to disperse anti-Houthi protesters in Yemen's southwestern city of Taiz. Iran-backed Houthis took over the city on Sunday in an escalation of a power struggle diplomats say risks drawing in neighbouring oil giant Saudi Arabia and its main regional rival Iran. The Houthis agreed to share power with Hadi after they seized Sana'a in September. Troops belonging to the Yemeni special forces loyal to General Abdel Hafedh al-Sakkaf protest at the entrance of their command in the southern city of Aden  demanding outstanding wages be paid .

Anti-Houthi protesters run as pro-Houthi police open fire in the air to disperse them in the city of Taiz . That split the army, parliament was dissolved in February and violence continues to intensify between the two sides. Also today soldiers loyal to Yemeni president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi fought off dozens of Shi'ite Houthi militiamen heading for the Sunni leader's seat of power in the southern city of Aden, militia sources and a local official told Reuters. Mr Hadi fled to the southern city of Aden in February after escaping from house arrest in Sana'a. The Houthis have taken control of the capital and six provinces. On Friday, Islamic State affiliates claimed responsibility for two bombs at mosques in Sana'a. As many as 150 people were killed in bomb blasts in the capital last week and 345 people were injured during the rush for Friday prayers. If the group was behind the attacks, it would mark its first large-scale foray into the country and could raise the prospect of a bloody Shia versus Sunni conflict. Bodies of people killed in a suicide attack during the noon prayer are covered in blankets in a mosque in Sana'a on Friday. Triple suicide bombers hit a pair of mosques crowded with worshippers in the capital . Yemenis carry a body of a man killed in a bomb attack at a mosque in Sana'a. The attackers targeted mosques frequented by Shiite Houthi rebels, who have controlled the capital since September .

A 2011 strike killed influential cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was the motivator behind many terrorist attacks against the West and is said to have influenced the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Gulf Arab countries will take necessary measures to protect the region against 'aggression' by the Houthi group if a peaceful solution cannot be found to that country's turmoil, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said today. Prince Saud, who also remarked that the kingdom opposed Iranian 'interference' in Yemen, was speaking at a joint news conference in Riyadh with visiting British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. Hammond said Britain would discuss with Saudi Arabia and the United States how to reinforce the position of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, adding: 'None of us wants to see military action.'","Troops airlifted from capital Sana'a amid deteriorating security situation .

"Most property listings feature the usual, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, the size of the garden. But this one is a little different. A woman in Indonesia whose husband has passed away has decided to offer an extra little incentive for buyers interested in her house... her hand in marriage. Wina Lia, 40, poses outside her house. She is selling the property but has also offered herself up for a potential marriage with it . Single mother Wina Lia, 40, is selling her house for around £51,000 but she stipulates in her advert that, 'Buyers who don't negotiate the price can ask the owner to marry (terms and conditions apply).' And although it started as a small ad, the offer has now gone viral. Indeed, Wina's estate agent says that they have been inundated with calls. Dian Purna Dirgantara told Time that the advert had been, 'quite successful.' He said: 'Since yesterday morning there are continuous calls, I don't count how many, there must be dozens or even hundreds.' And he clarified that should they choose, the new owner could buy the property without having to take Wina along with it. Wina's house - which she is selling for around £51,000 - has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fish pond and a parking space . Wina said that she was looking for a husband anyway so didn't mind putting herself in the advert with the house . 'If someone just wants the house, they can have that,' he told TIME. Wina told her local news site Kompass that she had been hoping to find a new partner anyway. She said: 'Dian suggested I put up the tagline ‘Buy the house and marry the owner at the same time.’ And I said O.K. to it. I’m looking for a husband anyway.'

"A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'","Works include pictures of Presidential Palace and Yangtze River Bridge .

The young driver managed to crawl out with minor swelling and pain, but was otherwise uninjured. Duty Supt Jorgensen said the bees were more of an issue than the wreckage when they arrived on the scene, as emergency services aren't equipped with bee-keeping hats as part of their personal protection. According to police, the scene was safely cleared and no charges are expected. Police say the bees were a bigger problem than the wreckage when they arrived on the scene because emergency services aren't equipped with bee-keeping protective gear .","A teenager has been attacked by an angry swarm of bees after rolling his car on a Northern Territory highway .

"Ever wondered why we go grey or most men's beards have a reddish, ginger tinge? Or why a young child's golden locks often disappear before the age of 10? Here, one leading expert, Rodney Sinclair, Professor of Dermatology at the Epworth Hospital and University of Melbourne, explains the science of hair colour - and why some of us are cursed with more greys than others... What determines the colour of hair? Hair colour is produced by cells known as melanocytes, which migrate into the hair bulb as the hair follicles develop in utero. The melanocytes produce pigment that is incorporated into the growing hair fibres to produce hair in a bewildering array of natural shades. Hair colour depends on the presence and ratios of two groups of melanins: eumelanins (brown and black pigments) and pheomelanins (red and yellow pigments). While variations in the ratio of these pigments can produce an large number of colours and tones, siblings often have strikingly similar hair colour. The Duchess of Cambridge battles with grey hair, as these pictures reveal. Genetic factors appear to be important in determining when we turn grey, rather than lifestyle, says Professor Sinclair . Most of us find our first 'greys' by the time we turn 30, usually at the temples, then later, across the scalp . How hair colour varies according to body site . For example, eyelashes are the darkest because they contain high levels of eumalanin. Scalp hair is usually lighter than pubic hair, which often has a red tinge, due to the presence of more phaeomelanin pigments. A red tinge is also common in underarm and beard hair, even in people with essentially brown hair on their scalp. Hormones such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone can darken light hair, as can high levels of oestrogen and progesterone, which are produced in pregnancy. Certain drugs, such as those to prevent malaria can lighten hair, while some epilepsy medications can darken it. Why do blonde children often go dark? Blond children tend to see their hair darken around the age or seven or eight. The mechanism for this is unknown and probably not related to hormones, as the darkening precedes puberty by a number of years. New parents often find the first coat of their baby's hair is darker than expected. It is not until this first hair is shed and replaced, at around eight to 12 months of age, that you get a clear indication of their hair colour. Blond children tend to see their hair darken around the age or seven or eight.The mechanism for this is unknown and probably not related to hormones, as the darkening precedes puberty by a number of years, says Professor Sinclair . How much does hair grow? Human hair growth is cyclical. During the anagen phase, hair grows continuously at a rate of 1cm per month. Anagen can last three to five years on the scalp and produce hair that grows to between 36 to 60cm in length. At the end of the anagen phase, the follicle turns off, hair growth stops and remains off for the three months. Towards the end of this resting (telogen) phase, the hair is shed and the follicle remains empty until the anagen phase of the cycle restarts. Pigment production also turns on and off in rhythm with the hair cycle. When pigment cells turn off at the end of one hair cycle and fail to turn back on with the onset of the next, hair becomes grey. How grey is really grey? Most of us find our first 'greys' by the time we turn 30, usually at the temples, then later, across the scalp. While many people find the salt and pepper look appealing, others go to great lengths to conceal these locks. The grey hair 'rule of thumb' is that by the age of 50, half of the population have lost the colour in 50 per cent of their hair. When researchers tested this rule, they found that 74 per cent of people aged between 45 and 65 had grey hair, with an average intensity of 27 per cent. Generally, men have more grey hair than women. Asians and Africans have less grey hair than Caucasians. By the age of 50 (Ben Affleck, 42, is pictured left and Colin Firth, 54, right), half of us will be 50 per cent grey, says Professor Sinclair. Generally, men have more grey hair than women . What causes grey hair? Genetic factors appear to be important in determining when we turn grey. Identical twins seem to go grey at a similar age, rate and pattern, however we're yet to identify the controlling genes. There is no evidence to link the onset of greying to stress, diet or lifestyle. Certain autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo and alopecia can damage pigment cells and induce greying. However, these conditions are uncommon and can explain only a tiny fraction of greying. Early greying occurs in premature ageing syndromes such as Hutchinson's-progeria and Werner syndrome, where every aspect ageing in the body is accelerated. Premature greying can also be seen in people affected by pernicious anaemia, autoimmune thyroid disease or Down syndrome. So, why doesn't pigment production turn back on? At the end of each hair cycle, some pigment-producing melanocytes become damaged and die. If the melanocyte stem cell reservoir at the top of the hair follicle can replenish the bulb, this keeps pigment production going. But when the reservoir of stem cells is exhausted, pigment production stops and the hair turns grey. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence to link the onset of greying to stress, diet or lifestyle . How can we prevent hair changing colour? Scientists have long known that in order to prevent hair from going grey they would need to either prolong the life of the melanocytes in the hair bulb – by protecting them from injury – or expand the melanocyte stem cell reservoir in the upper or top region of the hair follicle so they continue to replace lost pigment cells. A group of French scientists have identified a new series of agents that protect hair follicle melanocytes from damage at the end of the hair cycle. This enables pigment production to restart as soon as the next hair cycle begins. The agents work by mimicking the action of an enzyme called DOPAchrome tautomerase. This enzyme is the naturally occurring antioxidant in the hair bulb that protects melanocytes from oxidative damage. By duplicating the effects of DOPAchrome tautomerase, melanocyte metabolism and survival improves. The new agents are being formulated into a product that can be applied as a spray-on serum or shampoo. But they won't re-colour grey hair or bring back the dead cells that produce hair colour. Instead, they protect your melanocytes. So for those who cannot find it within themselves to embrace the salt and pepper look, new options are on the horizon.","Rodney Sinclair is a Professor of Dermatology at University of Melbourne .

"The International Prototype Kilogram (pictured) shed 0.0001g last century, leading scientists to come up with a more accurate measure of mass . It’s a problem that has been weighing on scientists’ minds for years – how to redefine and accurately measure the kilogram. Currently the unit of measurement is based on a metal cylinder - which should weigh precisely 1,000 grams - that is kept under lock and key in Paris. But the cylinder is gradually losing mass, leading German researchers to look for a new formula to create the most accurate definition of a kilo. The International Prototype Kilogram shed 100 micrograms (0.0001g) last century, which although is around the weight of dust particle, means the official kilogram is becoming slowly less accurate. Scientists at the German Nation Metrology Institute (PTB) in Braunschweig have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass, which involves counting the number of atoms needed to make up a kilogram, instead of relying on a piece of metal. But in order to win the international race to redefine the kilogram, they must perfect the method by developing the world’s roundest sphere. Horst Bettin, head of the PTB's kilogram project, said: 'Our goal is to have PTB master the realisation of the future kilogram completely anonymously.’ After years of research, they have created a method of making incredibly pure circular crystals made from tiny vortices of silicon gas. From incredibly pure silicon, they are able to grow a flawless single-crystal whose inner structure is completely regular and without fractures. The company said: 'Both being free of impurities and having a regular structure are preconditions for the success of the experiment.' 'From the round-bodied, cylindrical single-crystals, PTB produces crystal spheres that are rounder than anything else in the world.’ Scientists at the German Nation Metrology Institute (PTB) in Braunschweig have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass, but they first need to perfect their technique by counting the atoms in the world's rounded spheres (pictured) The aim is ‘to produce the connection between the mass of the sphere and the mass of an atom,' by counting the atoms. Physicist Peter Becker told The Local: ‘We work out the number of atoms in the sphere, weigh the sphere and therefore work out how much an atom weighs.’ This mathematical method has enabled the mathematicians to discover the Avogadro constant. The company said: 'Already at this point, PTB scientists miscount only twice every one hundred million atoms. Kilograms of different materials are based on the measurement of the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK). ‘The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram,’ according to Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The cylinder, which is meant to weigh exactly a kilogram, has a diameter of 3.9cm. The cylinder, which is meant to weigh exactly a kilogram, has a diameter of 3.9cm. It’s made from an alloy that is 90 per cent platinum and 10 per cent iridium. An illustration of the cyclinder is shown . It’s made from an alloy that is 90 per cent platinum and 10 per cent iridium. It’s been looked after in Paris by the BIPM since 1889 and replacements have been made to maintain its accuracy. The unit of mass is disseminated throughout the world via ‘official copies’. ‘With these copies and via further transfer standards, we teach weighing instruments how heavy a kilogram is,’ PTB scientists explained. But the official IPK has shed 100 micrograms (0.0001g) in the last century, prompting experts to find a more exact way of defining the kilogram. ‘At worst, the international prototype of the kilogram could be destroyed or stolen all of a sudden [if an alternative isn’t created]. Then the definition would be lost for all time,’ the PTB said. ‘The goal is to miscount only by one atom for every one hundred million atoms.’ The method could be used to work out how many atoms are needed to make up a kilogram, but leaves the challenge of counting how many atoms make up an object. In the case of the sphere, it is possible because the 3D shape is composed of a regular crystal lattice. The researchers who created the sphere know the dimensions of the sphere and the individual layers of lattices, so they are able to calculate the number of atoms by dividing the larger dimension by the smaller one. They believe they will have the answer in 2018.","International Prototype Kilogram shed 100 micrograms last century .

"It may still be dreary outside but Lorraine Kelly is getting into the springtime spirit in her latest fashion campaign. The 54-year-old is the star of mature fashion retailer JD Williams' latest campaign. The Scottish TV star showcases the new collection of floral dresses, bright separates and statement jumpsuits, including pieces from Lorraine’s own range for the retailer. Lorraine Kelly is the star of JD Williams' new TV advert and showcases the brand's floral and feminine spring designs in the promotional video and imagery . The advert - a multi-million pound campaign by JD Williams - was filmed on location in Cape Town, South Africa and features Lorraine at a lively summer garden party dancing with friends to the Gipsy King’s salsa track, Bamboleo. The brand hopes to convey its mission to put the fun back into shopping and fashion, based around their guarantee of clothes that 'fit to flatter' the mature figure. The advert was filmed on location in Cape Town, South Africa and features Lorraine at a lively summer garden party dancing with friends . Lorraine’s dance moves were inspired by her Zumba fitness classes, which she enjoys three times a week, along with walking regularly to keep fit and healthy. Speaking about her latest campaign, Lorraine said: 'The shoot for the spring TV advert was so much fun and we all had such a giggle! 'Not only were we able to enjoy the beautiful surroundings of Cape Town, we loved the upbeat music and dance routine, and we were dressed in gorgeous outfits to boot. 'The women looked so summery and stylish. I hope the collection will be big hit for women looking for great fashionable styles and fit.' Speaking about her latest campaign, Lorraine said: 'The shoot for the spring TV advert was so much fun and we all had such a giggle! In January, Lorraine channeled her styling expertise into designing her own range. Lorraine’s first collection for JD Williams was targeted at the 50-plus female and came on the back of research by the brand that revealed just 20 per cent of mature women feel well catered for on the high street. 'It was really about what I want to wear as well as a lot of feedback from viewers over the years. I wanted classy but comfortable clothes that look stylish and are also flattering,' she said. Lorraine, who served as the face of JD Williams before designing the range for the brand, believes that there's a big untapped market of 50-plus women who are 'in their prime and want to look fashionable'. She said: 'Women of 50-plus look better than ever and as a 55-year-old, I know that I want to look chic and on trend but also have the comfort factor.' Lorraine spent hours in the design studio curating chic Burberry-esque raincoats and Issa-esque wrap dresses, as well as a jumpsuit that you could 'wear around the house' or team with 'sassy high heels on a night out'.

"A woman who was accidentally overpaid more than $94,000 worth of benefits by Centrelink over 10 years will only have to repay the government 18 per cent of the money. Hearing documents from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Australia reported that the woman had received more than she was eligible for due to 'an error by Centrelink', even after she had inquired whether she was still getting the correct payment. Tribunal member Mr C. Ermert wrote that 'incorrect coding on her computer record' meant she continued to receive benefit payments 'even though her income exceeded the level at which they ceased to be payable'. A woman received $94,219.84 more than she was eligible for from Centrelink over 10 years due to a computer error . In early 2011, the woman reported to Centrelink that her and her partner's estimated combined annual income had increased to $274,479. However a senior practitioner confirmed that she was still eligible to continue receiving the same rate of Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Benefit and Schoolkids Bonus. It was not until April of 2014 that a Centrelink worker noticed the error and ordered the woman to repay a total of $94,219.84 worth of debts. Despite the woman admitting that 'a debt recovery plan would not cause her financial hardship', she challenged the decision, claiming that 'she was not responsible for debts caused by the Department's errors.' The Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Australia has ordered that she must repay $17,248.18 . The Tribunal documents stated that she 'answered consistently that she noticed nothing untoward about the level of benefits until 2011, when her husband's salary increased significantly, giving them more disposable income. 'It was then that she raised the issue with Centrelink. Up to that time she trusted the Department to make the correct payments.' While the errors were recognised as being solely the governments fault, the Tribunal still ruled that she had to repay the $17,248.18 that she received from 2012 onward due to legislation regarding timeframes. Repayments for over $77,000 that she received before 2012 were waived.","The woman was overpaid for 10 years due to an error by Centrelink .

"The BBC have confirmed Top Gear's £10million live world tour will go ahead next month with Jeremy Clarkson at the helm alongside fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said they will fulfil the series of gigs which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide - but added that the shows will be stripped of all BBC branding and content and billed as Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. That means the shows, which will take place in venues as far afield as Australia, Norway, and South Africa as well as the UK, will not be able to use clips from the show or feature The Stig. The move comes less than a week after Clarkson was dismissed from the BBC  for an 'unprovoked' attack on a Top Gear producer. Scroll down for video . The BBC confirmed they will fulfil the gigs (previous live tour pictured) which have already sold 200,000 tickets - but said they will be stripped of all BBC branding and will be billed as Clarkson, Hammond and May Live . The tour starts in Australia next month and fans have paid between £35 and £200 for tickets to the live shows. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: 'So as not to disappoint the thousands of people around the world who have already purchased tickets, BBC Worldwide has agreed with our joint venture partner Brand Events that the remainder of the tour can continue. 'These events will not however feature any BBC Top Gear branding or content. 'We believe this is a sensible approach in the circumstances.' Some of the dates have already had to be rescheduled and tour organisers believe it may not even make a profit by the time those costs have been taken into account. James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson at the Top Gear Live show in Prague, Czech Republic - the 2015 tour starts in Australia next month and fans have paid between £35 and £200 for tickets . A spokesman for Brand Events said: 'This is a great solution for the fans. We'd like to thank our ticket holders for their continued patience. 'The fans are the most important people to Jeremy, Richard and James so we're delighted to be able to say ""we're still coming"". 'We're sure it'll be something you won't want to miss.' The move is likely to spark rumours that the three men intend to team up to continue their careers together after Clarkson's exit from the corporation, but sources close to the tour say it is just a matter of fulfilling commitments to the fans. The future of the show's other presenters - Richard Hammond and James May - is unclear, with both men's contracts running out today. Contract discussions with the show's stars were put on hold after the BBC suspended Clarkson when it emerged he had been involved in what was initially described as 'a fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. Contract discussions with the show's stars were put on hold while the BBC suspended Clarkson when it emerged he had been involved in what was initially described as 'a fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon . Earlier today Top Gear producer Andy Wilman was forced to deny reports he has quit the hit show in the wake of Clarkson's sacking. An email sent to Top Gear staff congratulating them on making 'one of the most iconic programmes in TV history' was published yesterday and widely reported as a resignation statement. In it, he said: 'Our stint as guardians of Top Gear was a good one, but we were only part of the show's history, not the whole of it. Those two words are bigger than us.' But today Mr Wilman, whose friendship with Clarkson dates back to their school days, said the email was 'not a resignation statement, and nor was it meant for public consumption'. He said: 'It was a private note of thanks to 113 people who have worked on the show over the years, but clearly one of those 113 is a bit of a tit, because they shared it with a website. Jeremy Clarkson was looking cheerful yesterday (pictured) as he picked up a new car . 'I don't get this modern obsession with sharing, linking, forwarding, retweeting; whatever happened to a private moment? 'And if I were to resign, I wouldn't do it publicly, I'd do it old school by handing in my, er, notice, to someone upstairs in HR. 'I work behind the camera and I wouldn't presume for one moment to think people are interested in what I do. Now, everyone back to work.' A spokeswoman for the show said: 'Andy's email was intended as a heartfelt message to people who had worked with him and Jeremy, to recognise the fact that with Jeremy leaving it was the end of an era. 'It was not a farewell but a thank you to people who have been important to the show over the last 12 years. It was bringing down the curtain on the Clarkson era, not announcing his own departure.' Police are still investigating threats to kill BBC director-general Tony Hall, which are thought to be linked to his decision to axe Clarkson. Scotland Yard confirmed it was looking into allegations made when Mr Hall confirmed he would not be renewing Clarkson's contract because of his unprovoked attack on Mr Tymon at a North Yorkshire hotel. The Mail on Sunday reported that the director-general and wife Cynthia have been under 24-hour guard since the threat was received. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police in Westminster are investigating an allegation of threats to kill. 'The allegation was reported to police on Wednesday March 25. Inquiries continue. No arrests have been made.' Mr Hall, former chief executive of the Royal Opera House, took over the £450,000 BBC post in April 2013 to replace George Entwistle, who left the corporation in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Last Wednesday, he announced that Clarkson, a popular but divisive figure during his time at the hugely successful BBC2 motoring show, would not be retained, saying 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Mr Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in a 30-second assault on March 4 and took himself to hospital with his injuries. He was also verbally abused by the former Top Gear presenter. Clarkson reported the incident to the BBC five days later and was suspended on March 10.

"A 'quiet pint' at the local pub turned into a 7,000-mile trip to Thailand for two British men – armed with just a Tesco carrier bag containing some clothes. Company director Phillip Boyle, 33, had decided to go for a beer at the Southern Cross pub in Middlesbrough with friends for a relaxing Friday night. But one turned to two and then three and more - and at 1am Mr Boyle, along with friend Jamie Blyth, 33, decided to go home. However, their decision soon led them halfway around the world. Phillip Boyle, 33, (far left) and friend Jamie Blyth, 33, (second left) pictured with friends they met in Thailand . After leaving the pub they stopped off for some more beers from the petrol station along the way. It was back at Mr Boyle's house where the two, in their drunken stupor, decided to book a taxi to Manchester Airport in the morning and fly to Thailand. Mr Boyle said: 'After lots of jokes, at around 11am the next day with a hangover, Jamie asks if I had my passport handy and came up with the idea of us going to Thailand straight away. The pair flew from Manchester Airport to Pattaya, Thailand with a stopover in Abu Dhabi . 'Quiet drink': Mr Boyle had decided to go for a beer at the Southern Cross pub (pictured) in Middlesbrough with friends for a relaxing Friday night . 'I thought he was joking at first and then he pointed out how there are quite a few lads from Middlesbrough over there we hadn't seen for a while. Travelling light: Mr Boyle admitted he only took a Tesco bag with a few pairs of boxers and T-shirts . 'Then we got into a taxi he'd phoned and - apart from the short delay of picking up Jamie's passport - we were off to Manchester Airport. When we got in the taxi we didn't even have flights. 'It's a last minute bad idea - but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea.' Mr Boyle revealed that while battling a hangover, he managed to pack a Tesco carrier bag with some boxer shorts and a few T-shirts. The journey to the airport saw Mr Boyle come close to cancelling as the alcohol started to wear off, but once they arrived at Manchester, the pair managed to book flights to the Far East. The key protagonist may have been rigger Mr Blyth, who was recognised by the taxi driver as having splashed out on these last-minute trips numerous times in the past. It was then that the taxi driver revealed that it wasn't the first time Mr Blyth had done a similar flit - having used him several times before to make similar last-minute trips. Mr Boyle said: ‘The taxi driver told me how Jamie had done this same last minute thing four times now, with him being the same driver to take him to Manchester in each case. I thought that was hilarious and then said “OK, I'm in”.’ Flights from Manchester to Pattaya were secured. With a stopover in Abu Dhabi it amounted to two seven-hour trips. 'Some of the lads have serious girlfriends and kids and it's been pretty intense for some of them,' added Mr Boyle. A few quiet beers in Middlesbrough ended up with a trip to Thailand (above) for Mr Boyle and his friend . 'I wouldn't like to be facing the grief that some of them will be inevitably going home to. 'But no-one's misbehaved to be fair. I think it's a place where younger lads would perhaps go crazy. I'm single right now - so no consequences to face for me.' The pair are making their way back to Middlesbrough today. Mr Boyle added: 'I'd never fancied Thailand before - so going last minute for a few days is perfect.

"Battlelines have been drawn for the only major TV debate of the election campaign, when seven party leaders will go head-to-head in a two-hour marathon. Tory leader David Cameron, Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg will share a platform with Ukip's Nigel Farage, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the Green Party's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. Strict rules released by broadcaster ITV for Thursday's night's event spell out in minute detail who will speak when, and for how long, with host Julie Etchingham trying to keep order. Scroll down for video . From left to right the line up will be: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Lots have been drawn to decide the order in which each leader will speak, including the opening and closing statements and giving one-minute answers to the four studio audience questions . Lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The agreed line up behind the podiums will be, from left to right: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first, with Ms Bennett opening proceedings and Mr Cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks. The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm on Thursday night. Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people. They will then be allowed to deliver an uninterrupted one-minute answer to each question, before 18 minutes of debate on each question. There will be just four 'substantial election questions' covered during the night. Each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras, before the programme ends at 10pm. ITV newsreader Julie Etchingham will be keeping keep order as moderator during the debate on Thursday night . The seven-way debate is a long way from the 2010 contest, when Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron went up against Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown . Mr Cameron will speak last, enabling him to have the last word. He is likely to repeat his refrain that a vote for anything other than a Tory majority will mean 'chaos'. Producers insist that the leaders will not see the questions in advance and an 'experienced editorial panel' will select them. Polling company ICM has chosen the 'politically-balanced' audience, with around 20 per cent said to be undecided voters. During the entire two-hour programme there will be just one advert break, a highly unusual move for Britain's biggest commercial broadcaster. The live programme is the only debate involving all of the main leaders scheduled for the campaign, after months of protracted negotiations between broadcasters and the parties. Ukip's Nigel Farage today unveiled an anti-immigration poster in Dover (left) while Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood launched the party's manifesto in Cardiff . Mr Clegg, who emerged as the surprise winner of the 2010 debates, today said he was spending less time preparing for the contest this time. 'I'm not spending nearly as much time trying to think through every twist and turn, I'm not preparing nearly quite as methodically as last time,' he told reporters on his bright yellow battlebus. 'The longer I've been in politics the more I think you can over-think these things. And it will be very different - there'll be seven of us. 'The last time nobody knew who I was, so I had nothing to lose. In a sense this time I dont have much to lose either, as everyone appears to have their mind made up one way or the other. 'I'm not going to triumph in these debates - that's just self-evident. What I learnt about the debates with Farage is you might marshal the best arguments but if there are people who play better to the gallery they are going to do well. 'I've been in politics long enough to know its not a beauty contest and it tends to be the case that newcomers or people not well known to the public tend to do best, so I enter with quite sober realistic expectations. But I intend to enjoy it. In the driving seat: David Cameron today climbed behind the wheel of the 2 millionth Mini Off a production line in Oxford . 'I'm not disillusioned, I think you just have to keep what debates can and cant do in perspective.' Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg boarded his plush battlebus to visit Watford and Cardiff as he continued campaigning . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Green leader Natalie Bennett complete the seven-strong line-up . Mr Farage said he was disappointed to be placed near the middle of the line-up for the debates, rather than near Mr Cameron. Speaking on a visit to the Coastguard pub, close to the White Cliffs of Dover, Mr Farage said: 'I'm disappointed that Mr Cameron is so far away from me but we'll make the best of it.' In the run-up to the 2010 election there were three debates, in which Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg took on Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown. However, other parties including Ukip and the Greens demanded a slot, while Mr Cameron refused to take part in several debates once the campaign got underway. Labour have accused the Tory leader of being 'chicken' for refusing to go up against Mr Miliband. On April 16 the BBC will host a 'challengers debate' with only the leaders of opposition parties including Labour, Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Then on April 30 there will be a special of BBC's Question Time, with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing separately to answer questions from a studio audience.

Police said that both Hamilton and Smith have been charged with murder and robbery, and each have confessed to carrying out the murder, according to Action News. However, officers have not yet located the murder weapon, but have received information on where it is located. Stuhlman was out walking his dog at 8:30 p.m. last Thursday on the 6400 block of Woodcrest Avenue when police said he was approached by three juveniles attempting a robbery. The father-of-one allegedly pleaded for his life saying, 'Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me.' But he was shot once in the chest. The suspects did not manage to get anything from him. Philadelphia Police Captain James Clark said: 'It is even more senseless, and even more troubling that nothing was taken at all and he lost his life.' The boys were all caught on surveillance camera as they ran off into the night. They were all wearing hoodies and backpacks, raising suspicions that they could be schoolboys. Scene: The father-of-one allegedly pleaded for his life saying, 'Please don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me.' But he was shot once in the chest, however, the suspects did not manage to get anything . Crime: Neighbors told Action News Stuhlman, a landscaper, usually walked the dog at night with his 13-year-old daughter, but was alone on the night that he was shot, effectively saving her life . Senseless: Philadelphia Police Captain James Clark said: 'It is even more senseless, and even more troubling that nothing was taken at all and he lost his life' Police apprehended a group of boys fitting their description and searched the home where two of the boys lived at 64th Street and Girard Avenue. There, they recovered numerous assault rifles and hand guns and charges were filed against the teens. The boys allegedly told police that they were out playing basketball, and came up with the idea that they wanted to commit a robbery. As they walked down the street, they initially targeted another man, police said, but settled on Stuhlman because he looked 'less intimidating.' Neighbors told Action News Stuhlman, a landscaper, usually walked his dog at night with his 13-year-old daughter, but was alone on the night that he was shot. Captain Clark said:'My understanding is that his daughter goes for a walk with him almost every night. 'For whatever reason he said to her, 'It's a little late tonight. I don't want you walking with me.' So in effect, he possibly saved his daughter's life as well.'","Tyfine Hamilton, 15, turned himself in on Friday in connection with the murder of James Stuhlman, 51 .

"Sharron O'Neill always knew she had something. Even before she was diagnosed with cancer as a teenager, she knew her family had a stronger link to the deadly disease than others. When Ms O'Neill was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome in her late 20s, a genetic condition that makes someone more likely to get cancer, she said it wasn't surprise. Sharron O'Neil and her mother, Jilian Carter, both have Lynch syndrome. It is a genetic condition that makes someone 85 per cent more likely to get cancer . 'Our family always knew there was something; we just didn't know it was a gene and a specific thing,' Ms O'Neill said. 'But, once I found out about Lynch syndrome and knew what it was, it all started to make sense.' Mrs O'Neill was diagnosed with bowel cancer when she was just 19. A week earlier, her grandmother had died of pancreatic cancer. Her mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 39. Her family history with cancer extends back much further, with Ms O'Neill saying she tracked it back more than 200 years. 'The farthest back I have been able to go is to a relative who came to Australia on a boat as an orphan in the early 1800s,' she said. 'It covers six generations that I know of.' Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that makes people more susceptible to a number of cancers including bowel cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, and stomach cancer, among many others. People with the gene have an 85 per cent chance of developing cancer before the age of 70. Ms O'Neill's great-grandmother died of cancer. Just five years later, her grandmother's sister did too. She said the family was 'on notice' from that point. In the following years, four of the five remaining children, including Ms O'Neill's grandmother,  faced three of more Lynch syndrome cancers, averaging out to almost one person per decade. Family ties: Mrs O'Neil's grandmother in the arms of her great grandmother . Lynch Syndrome Australia spokeswoman Beth Fairbank said approximately 20,000 Australians have the genetic condition, but only five per cent of people were diagnosed. 'There's 95 per cent of people walking around with it and they have no idea,' Ms Fairbank said. 'A lot of families that have a history of cancer think it's just a bit of bad luck and there's nothing that can be done about it, but in some cases it isn't bad luck and there are things that can be done. 'If there is such a thing, it can be a good cancer story. There are a lot of things that you can do and it really makes people aware and alert against it. 'People who know about the condition get checked much more regularly, which greatly reduces the overall risk from cancer.' Ms O'Neill said the most important thing is for people to start asking some potentially tough questions. 'There are a lot of factors that go into it, but everyone should be asking questions and looking at their family history,' she said. 'If a lot of people in your family under 50 have or had cancer, head to your GP and ask.' Lynch syndrome not only makes someone more likely to get cancer, but it also means they will likely get the disease earlier in life. In addition to that, Ms O'Neill said she had seen each person in her family get cancer at an early age than their parent or relative of the previous generation. That trend was one of the driving factors in why her and her husband decided against having children of their own. 'There are a lot of factors that went into it - our geneticist actually said it shouldn't stop us from having kids,' she said. 'But, it was a personal decision. I had seen people in my family get cancer at younger and younger ages. 'I was diagnosed at 19. The thought of having a child who would battle with cancer while they were or a teenager or at school was too much.' March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day and Australians are being urged to become aware of their family's cancer history . Lynch syndrome Australia director Eve Raets promoted the day at Rundle Mall in Adelaide over the weekend . March 22 is Lynch Syndrome International Awareness Day, and Mrs O'Neill said the day should be used to make sure people know about the condition. 'The key thing is that we really need to be raising awareness. 'There are a lot of people who don't want to know, but it has such a huge impact on families. 'Ask the questions.'","Sharron O'Neill can track cancer in her family back to the early 1800s .

"Prosecutors in the capital murder trial of an Alabama woman charged in the death of her granddaughter compared her to a drill sergeant for forcing the 9-year-old girl to run nonstop for three hours in opening statements today. Joyce Garrard is accused of punishing 9-year-old Savannah Hardin for lying about eating candy on the school bus by making her run while carrying sticks and firewood at the family's home in Etowah County in 2012. Garrard, 49, could face the death penalty or life without parole if convicted. Scroll down for video . Accused: Joyce Hardin Garrad, who is accused of capital murder, is pictured entering an Alabama courtroom today dressed in a pale green jacket and a striped blouse, with a heart-shaped pendant around her neck . Victim: Garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter, Savannah Hardin (pictured left and right), nine, to run to her death at her home in Etowah County in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates . Assistant district attorney Marcus Reid said during opening statements in a standing-room-only courtroom that jurors would hear from neighbors who say they heard and saw what happened to Savannah the day she died. Defense attorney Dani Bone tried to raise doubt about medical evidence in the case by showing jurors a version of the indictment, which mentioned severe dehydration and seizures. However, Bone said Savannah died because of a fatally low sodium level. He said the evidence will show the girl had too much water in her system, not that she was dehydrated. Bone told jurors that prosecutors ‘have oversold their case to the world.’ ‘They're trying to hoodwink you with junk science,’ he said. ‘Make them prove their case.’ According to prosecutors, neighbors said Garrard yelled at the girl as she ran, forcing her to continue ‘like some kind of drill sergeant.’ At one point, a neighbor saw the girl vomiting on her hands and knees, begging to stop, Reid said. When paramedics arrived, they found Savannah on the ground, ‘freezing cold to the touch,’ her clothes and shoes soaking wet, Reid said. Garrard never told the medics that the girl had been running; she said only that the girl collapsed in the yard. The 9-year-old was rushed to a Birmingham hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium, a condition common in marathon runners. Savannah wasn't supposed to eat chocolates because she was on medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a bladder problem, but she had eaten candy on the school bus the day before she died. Garrard was angry that Savannah ate the candy – ‘but she was more upset about the lie,’ Reid said. Mother and daughter: Savannah (pictured with her mother in a Facebook photo) eventually collapsed and started fitting. She was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from dehydration and low sodium . Arrests: Garrard (pictured, left, in her police mugshot) was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin (right). The former's trial begins today . Surveillance video from a school bus shown to a jury showed Garrard talking with the bus driver, Raenna Holmes, about Savannah taking candy without paying from another student who was selling it. Garrard told Holmes: ‘She's going to run until I tell her to stop. She's gonna learn.’ The women then talk about a bladder condition the girl had and a procedure she had related to that condition. The driver then asks, ‘Is she OK?"" Garrard replies: ‘She might be when I get about four more bottles of water in her.’ Garrard said Savannah was 'in double trouble' because she took the candy without paying and because she lied about it. Holmes said in court that she saw the girl picking up sticks in the yard but did not see her running. ‘I feel partly responsible. I should have paid for those candy bars,’ Holmes said. Opening statements followed a jury selection process that lasted nearly three weeks. The judge in the case has refused the defense's request to move the trial to a venue where it less well known. This morning, Garrard was seen entering a county courtroom dressed in a pale green jacket and a striped blouse, with a heart-shaped pendant around her neck. Around 15 family members watched as the defendant was led in handcuffs to her seat at the Etowah County Courthouse. The trial is expected to last a week. Scene: Gerrard allegedly made her granddaughter carry sticks of wood as she ran to her death at her home (pictured). But defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third-grader's death was not Gerrard's fault . Run to death: Savannah (pictured) suffered from unspecified medical issues that resulted in frequent doctors visits, court documents state. Defense attorneys have said it was her medical condition that caused her death . Security is tight for the start of Garrad's trial. Etowah County deputies were pictured using a metal detector to screen anyone entering the courtroom today, while all cellphones have been banned. This afternoon, prosecutors will put forward their allegations against Garrard, who was charged in the fatal February 2012 incident alongside . Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin, is awaiting trial on a murder charge in the girl's death. Authorities said she failed to intervene while the older woman forced the girl to run. Savannah lived with her father, who was out of town at the time of her death.","Joyce Hardin Garrad, 49, accused of murdering nine-year-old Savannah Hardin .

"Researchers have uncovered the mystery of Mercury's 'stealth' colour scheme. The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury black over billions of years. It solves the mystery of Mercury's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists. The say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted Mercury with a dark 'stealth' coating over billions of years. Cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight, so Mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets. Using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at Mercury, researchers calculated suggest that after billions of years of bombardment, Mercury's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon. 'It's long been hypothesized that there's a mystery darkening agent that's contributing to Mercury's low reflectance,' said Megan Bruck Syal, a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who performed this research while a graduate student at Brown University. 'One thing that hadn't been considered was that Mercury gets dumped on by a lot of material derived from comets.' On average, Mercury is much darker than its closest airless neighbour, our Moon. Airless bodies are known to be darkened by micrometeorite impacts and bombardment of solar wind, processes that create a thin coating of dark iron nanoparticles on the surface. But spectral data from Mercury suggests its surface contains very little nanophase iron, certainly not enough to account for its dim appearance. As comets approach Mercury's neighborhood near the sun, they often start to break apart. Cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight, so Mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets. Using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at Mercury, Bruck Syal was able to estimate how often cometary material would impact Mercury, how much carbon would stick to Mercury's surface, and how much would be thrown back into space. Her calculations suggest that after billions of years of bombardment, Mercury's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon. The next part of the work was to find out how much darkening could be expected from all that impacting carbon. For that, the researchers turned to the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range. The 14-foot canon simulates celestial impacts by firing projectiles at up to 16,000 miles per hour. Experiments show that impact material is significantly darkened when impacts occur in the presence of complex organics - shown here on the right . For this study, the team launched projectiles in the presence of sugar, a complex organic compound that mimics the organics in comet material. The heat of an impact burns the sugar up, releasing carbon. Projectiles were fired into a material that mimics lunar basalt, the rock that makes up the dark patches on the nearside of the Moon. 'We used the lunar basalt model because we wanted to start with something dark already and see if we could darken it further,' said Peter Schultz, professor emeritus of geological sciences at Brown and a co-author of the new research. The experiments showed that tiny carbon particles become deeply embedded in the impact melted material. The process reduced the amount of light reflected by the target material to less than 5 percent -- about the same as the darkest parts of Mercury. Importantly, spectroscopic analysis of the impact samples revealed no distinctive spectral fingerprints, again similar to flat spectral signatures from Mercury. 'We show that carbon acts like a stealth darkening agent,' Schultz said. 'From the standpoint of spectral analysis, it's like an invisible paint.' And that paint has been building up on Mercury's surface for billions of years. 'We think this is a scenario that needs to be considered,' Schultz said. 'It appears that Mercury may well be a painted planet.'","Dusting of carbon from passing comets has made Mercury darker .

"It might be one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar but some of the arrivals at Cheltenham Festival today appeared to have dressed for the club rather than the parade ring. Although rural staples such as tweed, fur and Hunter wellies were present and correct, other race goers opted to take advantage of the bright Gloucestershire sunshine and stepped out in wool mini skirts, worn with knee-length boots. Print also proved a hit, with one brave lady choosing a cheerful ensemble comprised of a leopard print bag combined with a matching coat, boots and tights, while another opted for head-to-toe zebra print.

Others, however, chose to take a more traditional approach to racing get-ups and were well-wrapped up against the biting March breeze as they flocked into the racecourse for the first day of racing action. Warm coats in an array of colourful hues proved particularly popular, with feather-festooned millinery used to ramp up the glamour along with opulent fur cuffs and collars. Blue appears to be an early contender in the racing season style stakes, with scores of ladies opting for the colour in a whole range of shades, from cornflower to cobalt. Whatever the colour, the vast majority appeared cheerful as they arrived to see the action on day one of what is one of the most prestigious events on the British racing calendar.

Despite the large royal contingent, the real highlight, on the track at least, is set to be Friday's Gold Cup, which will see veteran jockey AP McCoy make his final attempt at the classic race aboard Carlingford Lough. McCoy also featured in the first day's racing at Cheltenham and piloted the hotly-tipped Jezki, a dark bay six-year-old gelding, in the Stan James Champion Hurdle this afternoon. Unfortunately for McCoy, the race was taken by hot favourite Faugheen, with the Irish six-year-old battling home to give jockey Ruby Walsh his third winner of the day. Off the course, most of the entertainment came from Gloucestershire's increasingly fashionable style set, who had pulled out all the stops on a very sunny day one. With most eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots,  the race meeting is usually a masterclass in country chic, complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two.

Unlike Ascot - and from this year, Aintree - organisers at Cheltenham refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress. While fancy dress does creep in on St Patrick's Thursday, Gloucestershire's most fashionable tend to opt for a glamorous take on rural, with oversized sunglasses, pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante. Fur is a recurring motif, as are hats that take inspiration from rural life. Like the stylish effort unveiled by Zara Phillips on day one of the 2014 event, many come festooned with pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite. Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of country style either, with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie.

He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field. Worth a flutter: Faugheen, pictured here on the gallops yesterday, is a popular choice among punters betting on the Champion Hurdle . Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him. WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE . HORSE: Dodging Bullets . ODDS: 4/1 . All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting. THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE . HORSE: Saphir du Rheu . ODDS: 9/2 . Paul Nicholls' stranglehold at the top of the World Hurdle betting has tightened again following Rock on Ruby's withdrawal. It's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite, but with Saphir Du Rheu back over hurdles it can only be a good thing. Veteran: AP McCoy makes his way into the Cheltenham Festival for the very last time as a jockey . He gallops and jumps well, and his Cleeve Hurdle win shows he can do it at Cheltenham . FRIDAY - GOLD CUP . HORSE: Carlingford Lough . ODDS: 10/1 . It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey. There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy.

"A 16-year-old boy has been banned from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in Syria. The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London today. A judge made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region. The teenager, who cannot be named, was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London (pictured) today. Social services feared he could follow in his brothers' footsteps . Barrister Martin Downs, representing the council, told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-Nusra Front - a group with links to al-Qaeda. Two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in Syria. A friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting. Mr Downs added that his family had an 'extraordinary history' and he also had an uncle who had been held in United States' detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ruling prevents the teenager, who has dual Libyan and British citizenship, from leaving England and Wales. Mr Justice Hayden, who said the four fighters could not be named, added: 'The local authority's anxiety here is that (the teenager) may wish to follow the path which his brothers have walked.' He also heard that council staff had learned that family members were making plans for the teenager to go on a trip to Dubai during the Easter holiday. Mr Justice Hayden said he was concerned to 'keep this lad alive' and said an order which barred from travelling abroad was proportionate. '[The teenager] is a vulnerable young person. He has grown up in modern Britain in an extraordinary family - a family where the male members are patently committed to waging Jihad in war-torn Syria,' he said. He told the court he had balanced the teenager's human rights and added: 'The balance falls clearly in protecting this young man, ultimately from himself.' Mr Justice Hayden made the ruling after social services at Brighton and Hove City Council (headquarters pictured) raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers' footsteps and travel to the war-torn region . The boy's mother, who he lives with, is said to be was 'exhausted by grief' and there were concerns that she was unable to place 'proper boundaries' around him. Mr Justice Hayden said the council had considered asking for the teenager to be taken into care but given the boy's age, staff thought making him a ward of court would be a better option. The judge said by becoming a ward of court the youngster would come under the protection of a judge and added: 'A child who is a ward of court may not be removed from England and Wales without the court's permission.' Mr Downs said the teenager's father was thought to be in Libya and that the teenager was 'disaffected' and was not 'properly engaging' at school. He told the court the boy had been involved in fighting and was currently on police bail after being arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. The judge was told that the mother was aware of her son's planned trip to Dubai. She hoped that the trip would 'get him away' from his local area where he had been getting into trouble. Mr Downs said it was thought that the teenager's brothers had left the UK after telling their mother that they needed passports for a 'school project'. Mr Justice Hayden said he was 'sympathetic' to the teenager's mother, adding it was not difficult to see why the teenager might feel aggrieved and have a sense of injustice. Lawyers said it was thought this was the first time a family court judge had been asked to take such an approach to prevent a boy going to fight in Syria. The group, which is also referred to as Jabhat al-Nusra, formed in January 2012 during the Syrian Civil War and made its announcement as extremists through an online video. It quickly rose to prominence among rebel organisations in Syria for its reliable supply of arms, funding, and fighters from a combination of foreign donors and AQI. Al-Nusra, which means support in Arabic, was also the first Syrian force to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks that killed civilians. In 2013 the militant group, designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, made an allegiance to al-Qaeda commander Ayman al-Zawahiri, claiming it was part of its network and denying any affiliations with ISIS. Despite Zawahiri's public denial of the merger, a number of al-Nusra fighters defected to ISIS, furthering tension between the groups. By March last year, over 3,000 fighters had been killed in battles between ISIS and al-Nusra. The group's videos and statements are regularly posted to social media such as Facebook and video-sharing sites through media group, al-Manara al-Baid. There were rumours last month that the group was planning to separate from al-Qaeda but it is yet to formally declare it.","Teenager's brothers were killed while waging jihad in war-torn Syria .

"Twitter has ruthlessly mocked Starbucks campaign for the company's new anti-racism campaign in which baristas talk to customers about race issues while serving their coffee. One user tweeted, 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train', while another pointed out, 'y'all realize there are no coloured hands in the press photos right'. A third speculated, 'maybe Starbucks actually wanted to get people of all races & ethnicities to join hands and make fun'. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Starbucks boss Howard Schultz has instructed staff to write 'RaceTogether' on cups in an effort to draw customers into a discussion about the state of race relations in America . Talking point: Although Starbucks says that nobody will be forced into a discussion, baristas are attempting to speak to customers about racism in America by writing slogans on their coffee cups. But Twitter has branded the campaign 'cringe-inducing' and 'patronizing' Humiliation: Corey duBrowa, Starbucks' Senior Vice President of Global Communications was forced to delete his account due to 'a cascade of negativity' Corey duBrowa, the company's Senior Vice President of Global Communications, was forced to delete his Twitter account, before re-activating it the next day. 'Last night I felt personally attacked in a cascade of negativity,' he said in a post on Medium. 'I got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion, and I reacted'. Staff at the 4,700 cafés across America now have the option to write 'RaceTogether' on cardboard cups, which is the slogan of a Starbucks anti-racism campaign. It was hoped that customers who encounter the slogan on their coffee cup would be inspired to discuss the deeper issues affecting America, in an attempt to 'create a more empathetic and inclusive society - one conversation at a time'. But many customers found the campaign 'patronizing'. '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ""white man's burden"" crisis,' one user tweeted. Another took a sarcastic approach, tweeting a picture of a white barista, with the message: 'Here's your macchiato! Let's discuss the historic disenfranchisement of your people that has allowed me to prosper.' The campaign was the brainchild of Howard Schultz, 61, the company's boss, who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics, from gay marriage to gun control. His decision came in response to the escalating racial tension that emerged when grand juries failed to indict white police officers involved in the killings of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, in Staten Island, New York. Last year, Schultz travelled to Starbucks branches in the cities most affected by racial tension, including Los Angeles, St Louis, Chicago, New York, Oakland and Seattle. Mr Schulz met about 2,000 Starbucks staff on the tour, and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address. 'It's an emotional issue,' he said. 'But it is so vitally important to the country.' Last week, the company ran full-page advertisements in the New York Times and USA Today, highlighting race tensions in the country. The page was black, with the words 'shall we overcome?' in the centre, and the company logo at the bottom. The campaign will continue on Friday, when every copy of USA Today will carry an insert about racism, which will also be stocked at branches of Starbucks. Schultz kicked off the campaign last December with a letter that appeared in TIME magazine. 'Last week, one thing became clear: we cannot continue to come to work every day aware of the difficult and painful experiences facing our nation, and not acknowledge them, together, as a company,' he wrote. 'Indeed, despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues, we at Starbucks should be willing to talk about them.' Schultz has a track record of using his public profile to highlight issues close to his heart. In 2013, he wrote an open letter requesting customers to leave their guns at home when they visited his stores, even in states where they can be carried legally. 'We believe guns and weapons should not be part of the Starbucks experience,' he said. He also spearheaded a petition to end federal shutdown in the same year, and launched a scheme to boost job creation in the U.S. by selling bracelets in its cafés in 2011. Starbucks is also intending to employ 10,000 former members of the armed forces and their partners over five years. It is not known whether Starbucks is considering pulling the RaceTogether campaign. Traditionally, those who oppose Schultz' views get short shrift: in 2013, when an investor said that the company's open support for gay marriage was harming sales, Schultz responded by suggesting that he sell his shares.","Howard Schultz, boss of Starbucks, told baristas to write 'RaceTogether' on  cups in an effort to stimulate debate about racism .

"Single mothers have lost their Supreme Court challenge against the Government's £350-a-week benefit cap. Britain's highest court narrowly ruled by three judges to two that the benefit cap restricting welfare to the equivalent of a £35,000 a year salary was not unlawful. Two women forced into temporary accommodation after suffering domestic violence said the cap violated their human rights. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, pictured in Downing Street this morning, welcomed the Supreme Court ruling . They claimed the cap disproportionately hit women, especially those trying to escape violent partners. But the Supreme Court said the cap, introduce by the Coalition government to clamp down on spiralling welfare bills, was legally okay. The benefit cap limits the amount of benefits a household can receive to £500 a week for couples and £350 a week for households of a single adult. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'I am delighted that the country's highest court has agreed with this Government and overwhelming public opinion that the benefit cap is right and fair.' He added: 'I am proud to say that it is one of the most significant reforms we've implemented over the past five years. 'A key part of the long-term economic plan, the benefit cap is encouraging people to change their behaviour and motivating them to find work.' The two lone parents went to the Supreme Court, along with a representative child from each family. Their lawyers argued that the cap unjustifiably discriminated against abuse victims, who are predominantly women, and failed to have regard to the best interests of the child. Lady Hale - one of the dissenting judges - ruled that the Government had failed to take proper account of 'the best interests of the children', as it was obliged to do under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child . They said the cap substantially reduces weekly income and puts the mothers at risk of losing their safe homes. The justices hearing the case included Supreme Court deputy president Lady Hale, Lord Kerr, Lord Reed, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hughes. Lord Reed, giving the lead judgment, said he accepted that the cap was 'a proportionate means' of meeting legitimate Government aims, which include deficit reduction and incentivising parents to find work. He noted that the cap for households with children was equivalent to a gross annual salary of £35,000, which is higher than the earnings of half of the UK's working households. Although the short-term savings were a small proportion of the total welfare budget, they nevertheless contributed towards deficit reduction, and were also intended to change behaviour over the longer term. But Lady Hale - one of the dissenting judges - ruled that the Government had failed to take proper account of 'the best interests of the children', as it was obliged to do under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Lady Hale said UNCRC was relevant even though it was not yet generally part of domestic law. She ruled that the cap deprived some children of provision for their basic needs, which could not be in their best interests. The cap's aim of incentivising parents to seek work discriminated against lone parents as they were the least able to do so, said Lady Hale.","Britain's top court narrowly ruled  that the Benefit Cap was not unlawful .

"He may have finally signalled the end of the search, but AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes says the airline is not giving up on finding the missing victims from crashed flight QZ8501. A total of 60 bodies still remain missing since the plane, en route from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, crashed into the Java Sea on December 28, killing all 162 people on board. Speaking in Sydney, Mr Fernandes said the airline was giving it 'one last shot' at recovering those still missing. AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes maintains he refuses to give up hope of finding those still missing. Mr Fernandes was speaking at a press conference in Sydney on Thursday . Rescuers wave at an Indonesian Air Force helicopter while standing around the rescued tail section of flight QZ8051 . 'Our message is we're not giving up,' he told reporters on Thursday. They (the families) know that because I am speaking to them every day.' The airline's message to families was 'keep hoping, keep going', he said. 'It is our responsibly to look after those families as best as we can,' Mr Fernandes said. Mr Fernandes, in Australia to announce an airfare sale, said the QZ8051 recovery work would continue round the clock for seven to 10 more 'operational days' before being shut down. The tail section of crashed AirAsia Flight QZ8501 is taken away by at the Crest Onyx ship . The AirAsia plane crashed into the Java Sea on December 28, killing all 162 people on board . AirAsia X acting CEO, Ben Ismail, listens to a question during a press conference announcing an airfare sale in Sydney on Thursday . He said he was in 'constant dialogue' with the families of those still missing, and that ""contingencies"" would be put in place should not all the bodies be located. 'QZ8051 was probably the worst moment of my life and it continues to be something that will haunt me forever,' he said. Mr Fernandes would not be drawn on why the preliminary official report into the crash was not being made public. Indonesian investigators earlier this year submitted the report into the plane crash to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, keeping its contents secret. An Indonesian search and rescue helicopter prepares for landing on the Indonesian navy vessel KRI Timur Yunusov Aceh during operations in the Java Sea . Mr Fernandes said it was 'not right for him to say whether they should have or whether they shouldn't have"" publicised the report, adding there must have been a 'valid reason' for the decision. He also defended AirAsia's safety record. 'All I can say is that we're regulated by lots and lots of authorities and no one has banned us from coming to their country,' he said. Mr Fernandes also said he supported better aircraft tracking technology amid the ongoing mystery about the whereabouts of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. Mr Fernandes supports the move for better aircraft tracking technology . 'I can't see why data can't be sent to the cloud every five minutes for instance,' he said. 'It's ridiculous in this day and age that you can find your iPhone but we can't find an aircraft.'","Search for victims of AirAsia plane crash is finally coming to an end .

"NBA star Richard Jefferson helped the FBI find $2million dollars after he claimed that his manager stole it from him. The Dallas Mavericks player accused Ted Kritza, his former business manager, of taking the $2million from his bank credit line without his permission. Jefferson reportedly helped in an FBI investigation by recording a phone call he had with Kritza in which he confessed to taking the money. Dallas Mavericks player Richard Jefferson helped the FBI in an investigation over $2million dollars that was taken from his bank credit link without out his permission . Jefferson, 34, had reported the crime before the investigation began, according to documents obtained by TMZ sports. During a recorded phone call with the basketball player, Kritza 'confesses to wrongdoing', according to the documents. Jefferson believed his former business manager Ted Kritza took the money. In a recorded phone call Kritza confessed to Jefferson . The recording is now in the hands of the FBI. A bank has apparently sued Jefferson for part of the $2million, according to TMZ. Jefferson, however, wants the court to put a hold on the case until the federal investigation into Kritza is finished. Jefferson started his NBA career in 2001 with the New Jersey Nets, where he stayed until 2008. The NBA forward then moved through the Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors and Utah Jazz before landing at the Mavericks last year. This comes days after a most recent filing from former L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling's lawyers claimed that his wife Rochelle and two doctors worked 'secretly' with NBA commissioner to strip him of his team. 'The NBA and Silver isolated Rochelle from her husband and scared her into undertaking certain conduct hereinafter alleged, including the signing of papers... that she did not understand,' the complaint reads. 'All of this conduct constituted elder abuse.' Silver, who is also named as a defendant in the suit, banned Sterling from the NBA for life last year and hit him with a $2.5million fine after tapes were released of Sterling speaking racist slurs.","The Dallas Mavericks player accused Ted Kritza of taking the money .

"This bronze statue put up in memory of murdered Sarah Payne was stolen this morning from Burhill County Primary School in Hersham, Surrey . A bronze statue erected in memory of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne was stolen from her school this morning. The 2ft tall statue was presented to Burhill County Primary School in Hersham, Surrey, to commemorate Sarah, who was murdered by Roy Whiting in 2000. Three people are believed to have been involved in the 'reprehensible' theft, with a van spotted leaving the area at around 1am. Her mother, Sara, said today: 'I implore the public to help me and the police bring my Sarah's memorial statue back where it belongs.' She fears the statue could end up at a scrapyard and melted down and appealed for such businesses to look out for it. She said: 'Monetary-wise it's not worth that much. It's worth far more to the school. The residents feel sick and I feel sick about it.' Eight-year-old Sarah was abducted by paedophile Roy Whiting as she played with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte  in a field outside her grandparents' rural home in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex in July 2000. Michael Payne and his then wife Sara made a series of heart-rending appeals for her safe return, but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away. Whiting was sentenced to life behind bars in January 2001, and is held at HMP Wakefield, dubbed the Monster Mansion due to the number of high risk sex offenders imprisoned there. Her mother, Sara, said today: 'I implore the the public to help me and the police bring my Sarah's memorial statue back where it belongs' Eight-year-old Sarah was abducted by paedophile Roy Whiting as she played  in a field outside her grandparents' rural home in West Sussex in 2000 . It later emerged that Whiting was already on the Sex Offenders Register after abducting and sexually attacking another eight-year-old. Her brutal death remains one of Britain's highest profile child murders and led to the introduction of Sarah's Law following a lengthy campaign by her mother. The rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. Sarah's father, Michael, died aged 45 last October after a long battle with alcoholism. Her mother was awarded an MBE in 2008 for her campaign work. Following the theft of the statue today, Elmbridge neighbourhood sergeant Marc Nettleingham said: 'We are carrying out a number of enquiries to identify the offenders responsible for this theft, which is particularly reprehensible given that it was presented to the school in memory of Sarah Payne. 'I am appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time of the offence, or with any other information, to come forward straight away.'","Statue presented to Burhill Primary School, Hersham, stolen this morning .

"The United States announced Wednesday that it is sending small unarmed drones, armored Humvees and other assistance to Ukraine in its fight against Russian-backed separatists – but for the first time the White House said arming Ukraine hasn't been ruled out. Some lawmakers are upset that lethal weapons haven't already been included as part of $75 million in new aid announced Wednesday. Asked during a White House press briefing to confirm that the U.S. won't send weapons to the former Soviet nation, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, 'That's not necessarily accurate.' 'I can't,' he said. 'The President, I think, in his own mind, is continuing to evaluate the situation in eastern Ukraine,' Earnest told reporters, 'and continuing to assess the risk that's associated with providing additional lethal assistance to the Ukrainian military.' Scroll down for video . STILL ON THE TABLE: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the Obama administration hasn't ruled out sending lethal military aid to Ukraine . BROKEN DOWN: Ukraine's military vehicles are being repaired with COINS where bullet-holes have made them otherwise unfit for new duties on the front lines . NEW COSTS? Russian President Vladimiar Putin has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula . Obama is weighing the consequences of putting new lethal weapons in the hands of Ukraine's military, weighing the risks that it could further inflame a conflict in which more than 6,000 people have already lost their lives. 'That bloodshed is something that we're trying to avoid and de-escalate,' Earnest said. 'So the president is very mindful of the potential risk that's associated with providing additional lethal military assistance to the Ukrainians.' Members of Congress from both parties have repeatedly urged Obama to provide Ukrainian soldiers with lethal weapons to defend themselves. Cory Fritz, spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner, told the Associated Press that the new aid 'will be completely ineffective.' 'The Ukrainians are begging for help, and the Congress is begging the administration to provide the defensive lethal assistance we authorized in December. Our allies deserve better,' Fritz said. CHEWING IT OVER: Obama, seen Tuesday in Atlanta, Georgia, is said to be mulling the geopolitical pros and cons of standing up to Putin by sending new defensive weapons to Kiev . DEVASTATION:  Pro-Russian rebels last week inspected the rubble of a destroyed coal mine that was used as a Ukrainian army outpost . In the Senate, a bipartisan group of 13 lawmakers wrote on Tuesday to Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran and Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top dogs on the Appropriations Committee, asking them to set aside funds specifically for 'defensive weapons' earmarked for Ukraine. 'While these weapons would not allow Ukraine to outmatch the Russian military, they would enable Ukraine to better defend itself and increase the costs of President Putin’s aggression in Ukraine,' they wrote. 'By increasing costs for President Putin’s aggression, it would discourage future aggression in eastern Europe that could even more directly threaten U.S. national security interests.' Another pair of senators, Tennessee Republican Bob Corker and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez, reached across the aisle to jointly demand that the White House green-light new weapons allocations. 'Now is the time for the United States to provide Ukraine with the means to defend itself from continued Russian aggression,' the wrote in a letter to the president. 'We should not be misled by Vladimir Putin's repeated efforts to exploit nominal ceasefire agreements.' Putin, the president of Russia, has consistently denied arming rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which began in April after Moscow annexed the mostly Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula. Corker and Menendez said in their letter that providing defensive weapons to Ukraine could 'impose a greater military cost on Russia' for its aggressive movements. 'After countless broken promises by the Kremlin, it is clear that Moscow's aggression in Ukraine can only be stopped if Putin realizes that the United States and Europe are unequivocally committed to helping Kiev impose this military cost on Russia,' they insisted. HANGING ON BY A PRAYER:  Father Alexandr Matveev led his congregation in servcies held in his office on March 8; their Russian Orthodox church's main hall was destroyed by Russian shelling in 2014 . APPROPRIATIONS NEEDED: US senators from both sides of the political aisle want the White House to send weapons to Ukrainian soldiers, and they're willing to spend taxpayer dollars to do it . Word of Wednesday's new aid package came in a telephone call Wednesday from Vice President Joe Biden to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. The White House said Biden also expressed concern that Russian-backed separatists are violating cease-fire agreements in eastern Ukraine and keeping out international monitors. Earnest said the new aid includes unmanned drones to help defend Ukrainian forces and enhance their communication; radios and other secure communications equipment; radars to warn and protect against mortar and artillery fire; and medical equipment, including military ambulances. U.S. officials, speaking on a condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the aid on the record, said it includes small Raven drones systems, which can be launched by hand. The U.S. also will send 30 heavily armored Humvees and 200 other regular Humvees. It's not clear how many drones will be sent. Victoria Nuland, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that administration officials are discussing lethal assistance and are watching whether the agreements that led to last month's cease-fire are implemented. Nuland said that in the past few days, there have been new transfers of Russian tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery and rocket equipment over the border to the separatists in eastern Ukraine.","Obama spokesman cites 'risk assessment' and says president wants to 'de-escalate' military action, not ramp it up .

"A desperate mother has to watch in horror as her daughter becomes paralysed every other day. Sarah Firth, 39, watches while her daughter is unable to move a single bone in her body for up to 19 hours at a time. In this state Ms Firth's daughter, Mia Park, can only cry out for help and wait until drugs help her regain movement. Mrs Firth said: 'When it happens, it is absolutely horrendous. My little girl goes from being an energetic youngster to being trapped in a body that can't move. 'It is awful to watch. She is so frightened. Her eyes are full of fear as she desperately waits to feel any form of sensation again.' Sarah Firth, 39, has to watch helplessly as her daughter, Mia Park, 12, becomes paralysed every other day to a rare genetic condition . Mia has hypokalemic periodic paralysis which means she has periods where she can't move her body and has to be rushed to hospital (pictured) Mia, who is just 12, suffered her first petrifying episode of paralysis in January this year. Ms Firth, a nurse, said : 'She had woken up in the night complaining she couldn't feel her arm. I just thought she had slept on it and it had gone numb. 'But by the morning, Mia said she couldn't feel her arms or legs. Initially I thought she was winding me up and trying to get the day off school because it was snowing. 'It was only when she couldn't sit up, or even move, that I realised she was telling the truth. 'I knew she hadn't had a stroke as her face wasn't sloping but I knew something very serious was wrong. 'I used a needle to prick her fingers and toes and she didn't flinch a single inch. I felt absolutely terrible for doubting her. She looked so scared. I could see she was desperately trying to move her arms and legs but couldn't. 'I immediately dialled the NHS helpline who sent for an ambulance. 'It was only as paramedics were carrying out an ECG and checking her blood pressure and airways that it struck me what was wrong. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood. The condition is caused by a mutation on chromosome 17. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant disorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to you in order for you to be affected. Symptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement (paralysis) that come and go. There is normal muscle strength between attacks. Attacks usually begin in the teen years, but they can occur before age 10. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day. Others have them once a year. During attacks the person remains alert. The weakness or paralysis: . Other symptoms may include: . Source: US National Library of Medicine . 'My ex-husband, Mia's dad, and her grandad, also suffered from a condition that intermittently left them paralysed.' The extremely rare and potentially fatal condition, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, is caused by dangerously low levels of potassium. It took four paramedics to safely lift Mia, who had become a dead weight, onto a back board and into an ambulance. After initially being taken to Barnsley General District Hospital, she was rushed 20 miles to Sheffield Children's Hospital. It was there her potassium levels were checked and results showed they were extremely low and a neurologist, Dr Chris Rittey, diagnosed Mia with the debilitating condition. Mia was given potassium intravenously, but only after an agonising 14 hours, did she slowly regain movement. Ms Firth, a single mother, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire said: 'We were both just so relived. I never thought I'd be so happy to see Mia wriggle her fingers and toes. 'It is something you just take for granted, never imagining your child will literally freeze in her sleep, and lose sensation of almost every muscle from her neck down.' Over the following week, Mia fell into a state of paralysis every other day, each time it starting in her sleep. Ms Firth, 39, said: 'Every second morning she would wake up unable to move. Each time we were terrified. 'All we could do was wait for the IV potassium to flow through her body and pray it would take effect.' The condition, caused by mutation of chromosome 17, only effects one person in every 100,000 and is far more common in men than women. Ms Firth continued: 'That's why it never initially occurred to me that's what Mia had. Her dad had always told me it was a condition that affected males, not females, but obviously it does happen in girls too. 'Although Mia's attacks have slowed down to every couple of weeks at the moment, we have been warned the bouts of paralysis can happen at any time and could get more frequent. They generally happen when she is sleeping. 'If it happens when she is awake, Mia starts to slowly feel a tingling sensation in her fingers and she knows it's about to happen, and can take a form of potassium syrup to stop it developing. 'But when it starts in her sleep, she has no idea, and wakes up completely paralysed. 'It has had a devastating effect on our lives. I can't allow Mia to sleep over at friend's houses, something girls her age take for granted, or go on an overnight school trip without me in case she has an attack. 'As soon as it happens we have to get her straight to hospital in an ambulance so she can be treated immediately. If we don't we could lose Mia. Mia's attacks usually occur in her sleep, and she wakes up paralysed. Her mother must feed her, wash her and put a bed pan underneath her. In between attacks she can move normally . Mia was once paralysed for 19 hours. She finds relying on her mother difficult as she wants to be independent. She cannot stay at her friends houses in case she has an attack in her sleep . 'When it initially started I asked the consultant if it could be fatal, it broke my heart when he said yes. It's is horrendous to think I could lose my daughter. It's every parent's worst nightmare. 'It's very hard watching her go to sleep. I often check on her two or three times a night to see if she is moving. 'Every morning the first thing I do is check she can move hers arms and legs, only then do I breathe a sigh of relief. 'But of course there are times when she wakes up and is frozen to her bed. She is like a statue, completely still apart from her face.' The longest episode Mia has suffered has lasted 19 hours. Ms Firth said: 'During that time I have to feed her, wash her and put her on a bed pan. 'It's very frustrating for her. She's a young girl, just about to hit her teenage years and doesn't want to feel so out of control and dependant on me. 'She tries her best to put on a brave face but I know it's extremely hard for her. 'And because Mia is up and about a lot of the time and maintains a normal lifestyle as such, people do not realise how poorly she is and the severity of her illness. 'It can be a fatal if we don't act quickly.' Ms Firth and her daughter have no idea what the future holds and how much the condition will take over their lives. But they are taking each day as it comes and trying to remain positive. During an attack, Ms Firth is rushed to hospital where she is treated with potassium through an IV drip (she is pictured in hospital, left and right) Ms Firth added: 'We just have to take it in our stride and hope that we can manage the condition.' She is now fundraising for the Sheffield Children's Hospital Make It Better appeal, to build a new wing including plenty of private bedrooms so families can stay together at difficult times. When Mia was in hospital, Ms Firth kept vigil at her bedside, sleeping in a high-back chair. In the new wing, she would have her own pull-down bed, Mia would have more privacy, and would get better more quickly in a hospital designed with children in mind. David Vernon-Edwards, director at The Children's Hospital Charity, said: 'Mia is an inspirational girl, fighting a terrifying illness with such bravery. 'We are so lucky to have the specialist consultants at our hospital, such as Dr Rittey, who can help treat and control this condition. 'That is why we need to raise money for this appeal, to keep our specialist services special and bring world-class facilities to our already world-class hospital.'","Mia Park, 12, has a genetic disorder called hypokalemic periodic paralysis .

But Ms Welman says it all started by accident when her children - a three-year-old daughter and 18-month old twins - started climbing all over her when she tried to exercise. 'I would set them up for some activities outside, but of course they just wanted to jump around and on top of me,' she told Today. 'I figured, well, if this is what they want to do, then so be it. So while I was doing dips, I'd sit one of them on my lap. While I was doing some abs, they'd sit on my tummy. When I did bear crawls, they'd hop on my back.'

"The deep bass tones of singer Barry White have become synonymous with seduction among humans, but it appears horses find deep voices sexy too. A new study has found that female horses are more attracted stallions with deeper, lower pitched whinnies. The lower frequency 'voices' of stallions tended to be associated with larger males, who had a calmer temperament and their offspring tended to survive for longer. Scroll down for video . Stallions, like the wild mustang above,  use their deep voices to attract the opposite sex, according to research . The researchers say that mares seem to make their choices about unfamiliar males on their first meeting based on the depth of their voices. And just like humans putting on an album featuring Barry White's bass-baritone voice, the deeper whinnies from male horses also appear to get the mares more in the mood. The researchers say the findings could also be used to help horse breeders select the best stallions for mating in the future. The domestication of the horse some 5,500 years ago ultimately revolutionized human civilization and societies. Horses facilitated transportation as well as the circulation of ideas, languages and religions. Horses also revolutionized warfare with the advent of chariotry and mounted cavalry and beyond the battlefield horses greatly stimulated agriculture. However, the domestication of the horse and the subsequent encroachment of human civilization also resulted in the near extinction of wild horses. The only surviving wild horse population, the Przewalski's horses from Mongolia, descends from mere 13 individuals, preserved only through a massive conservation effort. As a consequence of this massive loss of genetic diversity, the effects of horse domestication through times have been difficult to unravel on a molecular level. Professor Alban Lemasson, a biologist at the University of Rennes in France, said: 'The lower pitched the stallion's voice, the slower its heart beat and the higher its reproductive success. 'Stallion acoustic signals may play a role in female attraction at the time of group formation, as well as a role in sexual stimulation or libido maintenance when a group is formed. 'This supports preliminary findings showing that females base their approach preference towards certain unfamiliar males on the amount of vocal signals uttered during their first encounter and some male vocal signals trigger mare behavioural preparation for mating, for example tail lifting and leg parting.' In the wild, horses tend to live in harems consisting of one to two male adults and two to three females who have established stable bonds. When female juveniles reach sexual maturity they leave their group and form their own harem with bachelor males or join an existing harem. This may explain why 'voice' has become such an important characteristic in horses as females will often choose which harem to join from a long way off. Sound is an effective way for males to convey information to prospective mates and may be a way of avoiding the often violent fights that wild male rivals can engage in to win a mate. In a study published in the journal Public Library of Science One, Professor Lemasson and his colleagues recorded the calls of 15 breeding stallions from stud farms around France. The singer Barry White was known as the Walrus of Love due to his deep voice and reputation for singing romantic songs, but it seems he may have been copying a style of seduction already employed by male horses . They took blood and sperm samples from each of the horses and measured their heart beat. The researchers then played the recordings to 40 adult mares aged between seven and 27 years old at the Haras National du Pin in France. The females were placed in a corridor with a speaker at either end, through which a pair of whinnies from different stallions were played. The researchers found that the females tended to move with preference towards the speak playing the deeper whinnie. They also found that the males with deeper whinnies tended to be larger - suggesting they were stronger and so better able to protect the harem. Male stallions will often show off in an attempt to win a mate but it seems their whinnie is also important . They also had slower heart beats, meaning they were calmer and fewer of their offspring tended to die before or shortly after birth. Professor Lemasson told Mail Online: 'Whinnies potentially convey a mix of information about the sexual and social qualities of a male. 'In the wild, mares stay all your long with stallions, so finding the best social partner - dominant, calm and fertile - may be important.' The preference among female horses for deep voices is not unique. Female humans have been found to find men with lower voices more attractive. Koalas, bison and giant pandas have also been found to be more attracted to males with deeper calls. Professor Lemasson added: 'Our data also confirm that not all male voices are equally attractive, opening new lines of bioacoustic research on mammal reproduction.'","Scientists at the University of Rennes, France, recorded stallions' whinnies .
Mares were drawn to deeper whinnies when played back through speakers .
Male horses with deeper voices were large, calmer and had higher fertility .

"The mother of comedian Tracey Ullman has been killed in a fire caused by the 'careless disposal' of a cigarette. Mrs Ullman has been left 'deeply saddened' after discovering Doreen Skinner died in the fire at her ground-floor retirement flat in Holtspur, Buckinghamshire, on Monday. The 85-year-old was discovered by firefighters around 11.20pm. The comedian allegedly visited the building - which has 28 flats for the over 55s - on Thursday to survey the damage, according to residents. Earlier this month it was revealed Mrs Ullman - left in 1982, right in January this year - is to make a new six-part BBC One series, The Tracey Ullman Show, almost 30 years after she moved across the Atlantic . She became a huge star in the UK and the United States in the 1980s. Earlier this month it was revealed the 55-year-old is to make a new six-part BBC One series, The Tracey Ullman Show, almost 30 years after she moved across the Atlantic. A spokesman for Mrs Ullman today said: 'Tracey and her family are deeply saddened by the death of her mother, Doreen. 'The family would like to thank everyone for the kind messages they have received and ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult time.' Mrs Ullman, who was born in Slough, Berkshire, described her mother in a previous interview as 'very funny'. She said: 'My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil. 'But she was very funny and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour. 'Mum worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption.' One of Mrs Skinner's neighbours said: 'The fire started in the middle of the night and the poor lady died. We are all very shocked.' Another added: 'One of her daughters was here. I don't know if it was Tracey Ullman because I didn't see her myself.' A spokesman for Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that a cigarette had started the fire in the bedroom late on Monday night. 'Crews from Beaconsfield and High Wycombe were called to an address in Kiln Court at 11.21pm after an automatic fire alarm activated. The fire had started in the bedroom. 'Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus entered the flat and dealt with the fire and discovered a body. The flat is one of 28 designed for over 55s in the area. Its windows are still blacked out from the smoke (above) 'Investigations  have concluded that this fire was caused by careless disposal of cigarettes. 'This covers a number of scenarios, including falling asleep while smoking and not putting cigarettes out properly.' Roger Brinklow, group commander at the rescue service, added: 'Our thoughts are with her family and friends, and the local community.' The investigation into Mrs Skinner's death has been passed to the coroner who opened an inquest yesterday.","Doreen Skinner died in her ground-floor  flat on Monday around 11.20pm .

"Things got very steamy this morning at the Today show studios when host Hoda Kotb and TV personality Regis Philbin took part in new charity dare The Twizzler Challenge live on air, and shared a passionate - if very one-sided - kiss. Hoda, 50, looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when Regis, 83, energetically took the lead on the act; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle. When Hoda's quick peck on Regis' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former NBC co-host, he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch, as Hoda froze up in surprise. Scroll down for video . Good cause: Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the Twizzler test has taken off, and benefits Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism . Magic moment: The stunt required Hoda and Regis to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle . Hoda and Regis were officially dared to take on the Twizzler Challenge last week by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves shared a series of rather awkward, perfunctory kisses during their on-screen moment. Once the concept, which aims to raise awareness for autism, was explained to Regis during his guest segment on the show this morning, he enthusiastically asked: 'Are we going to kiss?' 'I'm not sure,' responded Hoda, before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray. 'Let me look at your lips,' Regis exclaimed, leaning in. 'She could swallow me! I've never seen lips like that. Honest to God, something's going to happen.' And indeed it did. Hoda nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached Regis' lips, before issuing him a conservative peck. Too much? Today host Hoda Kotb, 50, (right) got more than she bargained for as part of this morning's Twizzler Challenge, when former co-host Regis Philbin, 83, (left) smothered her with an enthusiastic smacker . Not finished: Hoda gave Regis a quick peck, before jerking her head away from him . Regis then launched in for a full-on smooch, as Hoda darted her head away, only for Regis to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth-to-mouth smacker. 'Boy you look like you went in there!' squealed Kathie Lee, as Hoda recovered in stunned silence. 'It was pretty good,' attested Regis, lipstick smeared over his face. 'You got a boyfriend?' Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism. Last week at the NBC studios,  Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee were nominated by fellow Today correspondent Meredith Vieira. Meredith explained that she first took the challenge with Today co-anchor Willie Geist the previous week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide. Get away! Hoda tried to push Regis away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further . Recovery: Hoda was visibly shaken after the amorous display, which took place live on air . 'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show. Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said. Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. 'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.' Panic: Ironically, it was Regis who was most concerned about the challenge before it began, telling Hoda that he was worried she would 'swallow him' because of the size of her lips . Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.' 'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause. 'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained. Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner. 'Really aggressive,' Willie commented from the sidelines. Follow the leader: Hoda and Regis were officially challenged to take on The Twizzler Challenge by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves took part last week (pictured) Matt pulled away as Kathie Lee's lips brushed his, only to move back into to give her another kiss. 'I love you anyway,' he said. 'I would have done that for nothing.' Someone else joked: 'Who the Lady and whose the Tramp?' After their epic kiss, Kathie Lee nominated her former co-host Regis Philbin and her current co-star Hoda Kotb for the Twizzler Challenge. After their epic kiss, Kathie nominated Regis and Hoda for the Twizzler Challenge. But Matt had a different pairing in mind, noting that the cast of Mad Men would be on the show on Monday. Fun moment: Hoda's fellow Today show hosts Willie Geist and Meredith Vieira took the Twizzler Challenge on her talk show . New nominees: Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and Nina Parker also took the challenge on Access Hollywood Live . 'I'm available,' Savannah said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned. Matt ultimately chose actors Jon Hamm and John Slattery to take on the challenge. 'If John Slattery needs an understudy for that Twizzler Challenge with Jon Hamm, I am available,' Savannah reminded Matt again. The Twizzler Challenge started earlier this month at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism, which was hosted by Jon Stewart. When someone on Twitter dared Willie and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation, the Twizzler Challenge was born. Access Hollywood co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover also took up the same candy-based encounter on their show last Friday before nominating Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and his fellow guest Nina Parker to do the same. 'I got to say that was really enjoyable,' Piers said after they completed the challenge.","The Twizzler Challenge is a new charitable dare aimed at raising awareness about autism .

"While many of us will try and catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse tomorrow morning, the striking astronomical phenomenon may confuse animals. Experts have warned that darkening skies could make nocturnal animals such as owls more alert and cause creatures that are usually awake during the day, such as sheep, to find a place to sleep - as well as possibly silencing songbirds. While animals may not react as strongly as during a total eclipse, zoos are still preparing for the partial eclipse that will see skies darken slightly across the UK at around 9.30am tomorrow morning. Scroll down for video . The path of totality for Friday's eclipse will travel from just beneath the Greenland peninsula to the Arctic Circle. The left-hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse. The right-hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 March will travel over Europe . Dave Clarke, Head of Invertebrates at ZSL London told MailOnline: ‘A solar eclipse, especially a full eclipse, could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies - who use the light for navigation. ‘Here at ZSL London Zoo’s Butterfly Paradise, we’ll amend the lighting slightly to counter this during the partial solar eclipse on the 20 March.’ An expert from ZSL London told MailOnline that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies (an owl butterfly is shown) Tomorrow, the moon's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth. The proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near-total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the UK, so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in London, Manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, meaning that animals in Scotland may react more strongly than those in the south of England. The most ‘complete’ eclipse in the UK will be seen from Lerwick in the Shetland Isles. Timings will vary, so that in London, the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun's edge - will begin at 8.24am. The eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. By 10.41am, the moon will leave the sun's edge and the partial eclipse will end. For spectators in Edinburgh, for example, the eclipse will begin, peak and end four minutes later. Robin Scagell, vice president of the Society for Popular Astronomy (SPA) told MailOnline: 'It will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun,’ but anecdotes from past partial eclipses hint that animals will still notice the change. Donald Broom, Emeritus Professor of Animal Welfare at the University of Cambridge, told MailOnline that the most people will notice that many of the common birds might stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer.. 'Farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night,' he said, before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks, they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on. Professor Broom also said that pet dogs and cats will probably be 'sightly disturbed' by tomorrow's eclipse. They'll notice it will get dark,' he said, before adding: 'Although night happens every day, you don't have a substantial change in light intensity in the morning, so it's a bit disturbing for them.' Dogs, for example, will probably be more alert and pay more attention to what's going on around them more then usual because they will be 'sightly surprised'. The eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A partial eclipse will be visible across Europe, North Africa and Russia for about 90 minutes. This suggests that animals living nearer the arctic circle may react more strongly . Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘night-time’. For example, sheep (stock image) may find a place to sleep tomorrow . Projection: Place a pinhole or small opening in a card, and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away. Filters: The sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose. Such filters have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver on the surfaces. Telescopes with solar filters: There are sun-specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse. Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘night time’. She said: 'Diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night: sleep! ‘Dragonflies hide under a leaf, ants return to their nest, sheep walk back to their sleeping place, cattle egrets (heron-like birds) return to their nocturnal roost, diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop.’ ‘Nocturnal animals become active: owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on.’ Bees may become more active during the partial eclipse, based on a study conducted in India. Experts at the Zoological Survey of India studied rock bees during an eclipse in June 1955 and found that when the sun was hidden behind the moon, 150 bees buzzed out of a hive, instead of the normal 25 or so, The Atlantic reported. ‘It would appear that during the partial solar eclipse on the 20th June, the rock bees became distinctly restless and more active,’ ML Roonwall, who led the study said. During a partial eclipse in 2001, desert cicadas in Arizona fell silent in a break from their normal calling, suggesting similar insects such as crickets may do the same in the UK. The solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of Europe. On the morning of the 20 March the moon's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over Earth - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 August 1999 (pictured over Germany) ‘Nocturnal animals become active [during an eclipse]: Owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on,’ one expert said . Experts think this may have happened because of a drop in temperature under the eclipse’s shadow and because calling takes a lot of energy, it was impossible for the insects to keep up their method of communication. In 1973, researchers found that captive squirrels became restless in the run up to and during an eclipse, indicating that native squirrels may notice tomorrow’s unusual astronomical spectacles. In the study, the animals increased the length of this ‘non-stop running sessions’. There is also evidence that Blue bulls changed the amount of time they spent eating and resting, hinting that cows’ daily lives may be disrupted during tomorrow’s partial eclipse. During a 2001 solar eclipse in Africa, self-proclaimed eclipse chaser, Todd Thompson witnessed strange animal behaviour in Zambia. It is guesswork as to how some birds may react tomorrow. Some evidence points to blackbirds (stock image) singing during the astronomical event, while other other birds have fallen silent when the moon has blocked out the sun . The eclipse could disrupt solar power supplies across Europe, energy experts have warned. The spread of huge solar arrays across the EU means that more than 10 per cent of the continent’s electricity now comes from solar panels. With power supply so reliant on the sun’s rays, the solar eclipse on 20 March might lead to blackouts. Electricity system operators have warned that the eclipse poses ‘an unprecedented test for Europe’s electricity system’. The European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity, a group of power supply organisations, said: ‘The risk of incident cannot be completely ruled out. ‘Solar eclipses have happened before but with the increase of installed photovoltaic energy generation, the risk of an incident could be serious without appropriate countermeasures.’ The organisation said it had been planning so-called ‘countermeasures’ for months, with suppliers across Europe set to help balance the load with more energy from other power stations as solar electricity drops off. The eclipse is not expected to cause blackouts in Britain because so little of our power comes from solar power. Despite a boom in British solar arrays in recent years, particularly in southern England, solar power today provides just 1.5 per cent of our electricity needs. The National Grid said it expected solar power output in Britain to halve from an average March figure of 3,000 megawatts to 1,700 megawatts. He said in a blog post that birds went to roost as the sky darkened, crickets and cicadas fell silent and even mosquitoes vanished. Paul Murdin, visiting professor of Astronomy at Liverpool John Moores University, collected observations from 250 members of Wildlife and Environment Zimbabwe (WEZ) during the same eclipse. He wrote that hippos looked nervous and alert in a river, unsure if it was dawn or dusk and once the eclipse ended, there was a ‘crescendo of loud dawn chorus-like calls’ from turtle doves, after they had fallen silent though the event. ‘By contrast frogs in the river called at totality and ceased calling when the light reappeared,’ he wrote. This observation may suggest that birds could cease singing in parts of the UK tomorrow during the partial eclipse, while frogs may call loudly.","Eclipse will see skies darken across the UK at around 9.30am tomorrow .

"The grief-stricken owners of Jagger the Irish setter  have shared heartbreaking photographs of the dog with their nine-year-old son, in whose arms he died after being 'murdered at Crufts'. Aleksandra Lauwers will join her husband and 'devastated' son, Jeremy, tomorrow in scattering the ashes of her second ‘beautiful child.’ Just five days ago the family were celebrating after he was a medal winner at Crufts, the world’s most prestigious dog show. But a little over 24 hours later their life was ripped apart when without warning he fell into a coma and died in their arms. Now the family has released a collection of photographs of Jagger and his 'best friend', nine-year-old Jeremy as they vow to find the culprit of the dog's death. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Jeremy, now nine, runs Jagger round a competition field. The Irish setter died in suspicious circumstances last week, his owners convinced he was the victim of meat poisoning . Mrs Lauwers shook with emotion yesterday as she told the Mail ‘To the person who has done this I would say: I hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed my beautiful child. ‘He was our love, our family member and the very best friend to our son. ‘We are still in a state of shock. ‘My son is devastated. He does not know how somebody could be so cruel and do this to an innocent and helpless animal. ‘Why would anyone want to cause Jagger such a slow and painful death? She realised something was very wrong when Jagger’s jaw dropped and he started to tremble after they returned from Crufts to their large detached family home in the quiet village of Lauw in east Belgium on Friday evening. She said: ‘I thought he was having a heart attack but he fell into a coma. ‘The vet arrived very quickly, but it was too late. Within fifteen minutes Jagger was dead.’ Aleksandra Lauwers (pictured with Jeremy and the litter Jagger was born part of) said she and her son was struggling to cope with the dog's death . Jagger was born in Britain on 1 May 2011, the son of prize winning dog Mr Jingles who retired earlier this year. His pedigree name was Thendara Satisfaction, after the kennels run by his co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott. The Lauwers bought him as a 10-month old puppy for around £850. By then he was affectionately known to all as Jagger. At the time the Lauwers posted a picture of him on their website with the caption: ‘We are all looking forward to a great fun in the future with this stunning boy.’ Mrs Lauwers said: ‘He lived with us but knew he had a mum and dad in England too. He was a loyal and dedicated pet.’ From the start he won them over with his sense of adventure, and was particularly close to the couple’s now nine-year-old son, Jeremy. Other pictures show Mrs Lauwers and her son cuddling Jagger and the puppy larking about with decorations at his first family Christmas. Jagger followed in his father’s footsteps and was soon picking up awards and commendations at dog shows. At just over a year old he was crowned Luxembourg Junior Champion and a few months later finished second in the Junior Day Belgium competition. The following year he finished second in a category at the East of England Championship Show, prompting the Lauwers to post: ‘our boy did us proud.’ The three-year-old Irish setter was 'best friend' to the couple's son, Jeremy. The family have vowed to find the person responsible for his 'slow and painful' death . The family bought Jagger, whose pedigree name was Thendara Satisfaction, as a 10-month old puppy. Above, the animal with his litter . The Lauwers said when he travelled to Crufts he was in terrific form and there was no indication of any problems, and certainly no suggestion that anyone meant to harm him. Gillian Barker Bell, a judge at the show, said when she saw him for the mid-limit class at 2.30pm on Thursday he looked ‘absolutely fine’ and that his subsequent death was ‘incomprehensible.’ Mrs Lauwers said they would not let Jagger's death stop them from competing again in the future . She added: ‘He did not look ill. The rules say if you think a dog seems ill you excuse him the ring.’ Mrs Lauwers said the only time he was alone during the competition was when he was on the bench awaiting to perform. ‘That is the only time it could have happened. It was the only time he was unsupervised. ‘That is also the time people come and see the dogs, which is something we fully support.’ After Jagger’s death a vet found cubes of meat laced with a slow-acting toxin in his stomach and the family contacted local police. Toxology tests will be completed by the end of the week which should determine the cause of death, amid suggestions they could be rat poison or slug repellants. Before then Jagger will be cremated. Mrs Lauwers said: ‘We will hold a little memorial service with my husband and son to say goodbye. ‘We will then scatter his ashes over the fields and woods by our house where he used to love going for a walk. ‘I will be back at Crufts in the future. ‘I think he was just the wrong dog at the wrong place at the wrong time. ‘I won't let the pitiful actions of one mindless idiot put me off doing what I love. ‘I will return in future and I will compete in his honour. ‘I will win in Jagger's memory. ‘ . Mrs Lauwers and her husband William (above outside their home) said they believe their dog was in 'the wrong place at the wrong time'","Jagger the three-year-old Irish setter died after taking ill at Crufts last week .

"A Tory MP has urged his supporters not to 'mention the Conservative Party or David Cameron' when sending out letters in support of him. Gavin Barwell, who is fighting the key London marginal of Croydon, has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election. But Mr Barwell was left red-faced after it emerged he sent out 'sample' letters designed to make it look like they were written by ordinary constituents. Gavin Barwell, who is fighting the key London marginal of Croydon, has asked constituents to sign letters to friends and neighbours supporting his re-election . The letters, seen by the Evening Standard, all appeared to be written in exactly the same style. They were full of similar phrases – with each beginning with 'Dear neighbour' and went on to describe an incident where Mr Barwell helped them. They often ended with the phrase: 'I really can't recommend Gavin strongly enough.' In a letter to constituents asking them to endorse him, Mr Barwell writes: 'I'm not asking you to write a political letter — in fact, it'll be much more effective if it doesn't mention the Conservative Party or David Cameron.' Asked if he or his team wrote the sample letters, he said: 'People write their own letters, I've not written anything. These are genuine constituents that we have helped who wanted to write a letter. I think in one case we helped with the drafting. They are not fake letters.' 'I'm therefore writing to ask if you would be prepared to write to people in your neighbourhood saying why you think I am a good local MP.' One Labour MP compared his letter with the bungling Fawlty Towers manager Basil Fawlty telling staff 'don't mention the war' in front of German guests. Mr Barwell has urged his supporters not to 'mention the Conservative Party or David Cameron' when sending out letters in support of him . Labour MP Stephen Pound mocked: 'It's a case of 'Don't mention the Tories!' Mr Barwell insisted he just did not want the endorsements to be too political and that he had put Mr Cameron on his own leaflets. He said: 'The purpose is not to send political letters. The purpose of the letters is a personal endorsement of my work as MP. 'My own election leaflets will be full of mentions of both David Cameron and the Conservative Party. 'These letters are different. They are from ordinary people telling their story. I don't think people doing that will be comfortable making party political points.' But Sarah Jones, the Labour candidate for Croydon Central, told the Standard: 'It's a sign of real desperation that Gavin Barwell is actively telling people not to call him a Tory. He's trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. 'If people were wondering if the Tory brand had become toxic in Croydon, he's the proof you need. 'However hard he tries, he can't run away from his voting record — voting for deep cuts, privatisation of the NHS, the bedroom tax and trebling tuition fees.'","Gavin Barwell is fighting the key London marginal of Croydon in May .

"An eyesore bus station dubbed 'the mouth of hell'  was today dramatically razed to the ground by thousands of explosives. The dilapidated Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, a stark example of 1970s Brutalist architecture, was reduced to rubble in just six seconds after more than 2,200 explosive charges ripped through the redundant building, tearing it to the ground. The dramatic collapse came after a five-minute warning siren which had sounded out across the four-acre site, warning the hundreds of locals who had gathered for the occasion that the demolition was about to take place. Scroll down for video . This is the dramatic moment an eyesore bus station in Northampton dubbed 'the mouth of hell' was blown up to make way for redevelopment . The dilapidated Greyfriars bus station, an example of 1970s brutalist architecture, was reduced to rubble in just six seconds following the blast . More than 2,200 explosive charges were used to tear down the archaic building, prompting bangs, rumblings and car alarms to go off . The historic demolition was heralded by a five-minute warning siren which sounded out across the area before the blast took place . An audible gasp then spread across the crowd as a series of loud bangs and rumbling echoed around the area, prompting car alarms to spontaneously go off nearby. The historic event was also live-streamed online, after Northampton Borough Council pleaded with spectators not to watch it in person. Video footage taken from nearby shows the 20,000 tonne building crumbling downwards from left to right, before being enveloped in a cloud of dust, which slowly spread away from the demolition scene. The £5m operation had also seen residents evacuated from more than 400 nearby homes, as a precaution. The 574ft long, three-floor building was built in 1976 and has dominated the Northampton skyline for almost 40 years. But it faced criticism soon after it opened when mineral stalactites began forming inside. There were also concerns for safety in the 2000s when two people died after being hit by buses. The building, which includes a car park and offices which have not been used for years, was once described in the Lonely Planet guide as 'infamously ugly'. In 2005, it also featured on Channel 4 series Demolition, fronted by Kevin McCloud, as the third in a list of 12 buildings that the public believed should be demolished. Video footage taken from nearby shows the 20,000 tonne building crumbling downwards from left to right, before being enveloped in dust . The thick, grey smoke spread slowly away from the demolition scene. The clean-up could take until June, the council has warned . The historic event had been live-streamed online, after Northampton Borough Council pleaded with spectators not to watch it in person . It was during the programme that McCloud - who also presents Grand Designs - coined its moniker 'the mouth of hell'. The building was one of the most prominent examples of the Brutalism era, a style of architecture defined by concrete fortress-like buildings which flourished between the 1950s and mid-1970s. But the structure was costing taxpayers £500,000 in repairs per year, while the council claimed it would cost almost £30 million to renovate. Its demolition is part of Northampton's regeneration programme and plans for new retail and leisure schemes are being considered. David Macintosh, leader of the council, said: 'It's funny because in the last couple of months, people have said: ""We will miss it."" 'It's not very well-liked, and is now redundant. ""The mouth of hell"" sums it up perfectly.' The structure was costing taxpayers £500,000 in repairs every year, and the council claimed it would take almost £30 million to renovate . The building, which includes a car park and offices which have not been used in years, was described in the Lonely Planet  as 'infamously ugly' The building faced criticism soon after it opened when mineral stalactites began forming inside. Pictured: The remains of the eyesore building, left, and workmen beginning the mammoth clean-up operation (right) After the dramatic event, residents said they were glad the 'eyesore' had been finally removed from their city's skyline after 40 years . After the blast, residents said they were glad the 'eyesore' had been finally removed from their city's skyline. Lorry driver George Thompson, 43, said: 'I came down with the kids to show them the demolition because it isn't something that happens every day. 'It has a horrible reputation and has been a bit of an embarrassment for Northampton so it is definitely good to see the back of it. 'It was incredible to see it come down so quickly and cleanly, there were lots of gasps from the young ones watching.' Full-time mum Sandra Jones, 33, added: 'It was an eyesore of a building and is no use to anyone now there is the new bus station. 'I know people who have avoided using buses around here for years because they didn't want to go inside that grubby old building. Broadcaster Kevin McCloud had coined its moniker 'the mouth of hell' after it featured on the Channel 4 programme Demolition . 'I'm definitely glad it has gone and at least it managed to give everyone some pleasure with the dramatic demolition.' Alan Carr, who spent some of his childhood in Northampton, wrote on Twitter: 'Is that smelly cafe still there in the basement in Greyfriars bus station? You'd see people dry heaving before they got on their buses.' A huge clean-up operation will now take place to clear the streets and nearby buildings of dust before the site is considered for new retail and leisure schemes. Mr Mackintosh said it would take until the end of June to clear rubble left by the demolition. The demolition expert who was responsible for bringing the bus station to the ground said the job was one of his 'top ten ever'. Billy Young, project manager for DSM Demolition, added: 'The roads will accessible from mid to late afternoon on Sunday. Lady's Lane and Greyfriars will be one lane at first for the next few weeks but we hope to reopen them again fully after that.' A replacement bus station opened last year but it got off to a bad start when police were called in to direct traffic, after queues of buses formed.","Greyfriars station in Northampton, an example of 1970s brutalist architecture, was reduced to rubble in six seconds .

"Comic Relief has broken the £1billion barrier after raising more than £78million on this year's Red Nose Day alone. A host of celebrities including Rowan Atkinson and David Walliams performed one-off sketches while others completed crazy challenges for the annual event. The total before last night’s telethon stood at £960m but record-breaking donations smashed the charity's target of raising £1bn by its thirtieth year. Scroll down for video . Comic Relief has broken the £1billion barrier after raising more than £78million on this year's Red Nose Day alone. Fans were delighted when Rowan Atkinson (above) reprised his much-loved role as Mr Bean in his first Red Nose Day appearance in eight years . In the sketch, pictured above during filming, Mr Bean ends up attending the wrong funeral and causes a scene . Fans were delighted when Atkinson reprised his much-loved role as Mr Bean in his first Red Nose Day appearance in eight years. His sketch saw him attend the wrong funeral before causing a scene by knocking the coffin of its stand. He even paused to take a selfie of himself with the coffin during the skit. Host Lenny Henry thanked Atkinson for his 'amazing' work - although some people on social media were left claiming it was 'distasteful'. Viewers also saw David Walliams re-establish Little Britain character Lou. But while the carer is normally seen looking after Andy the role of his fraudulent sidekick was instead played by Stephen Hawking. The theoretical physicist turned his wheelchair into a Transformer to attack Walliams and Catherine Tate - who played a nun - in the comedy skit. Hawking even made a famous Little Britain line his own as he said 'computer says die' before zapping Lou off the planet. David Walliams (left) re-established Little Britain character Lou and the sketch saw theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking (centre) join him as his sidekick . Comedian Catherine Tate (left) also appeared in the skit, which saw Professor Hawking launch an attack by turning his wheelchair into a Transformer . In a separate challenge Walliams snogged Hollywood hunk Orlando Bloom as the pair prepared to beat the world record for the most amount of kisses received in 30 seconds. Bloom went straight for the comedian, who has recently separated from model wife Lara Stone. Emma Watson used her appearance with Dawn French in a Vicar Of Dibley sketch to mix her gender equality work with a little comedy. The UN Ambassador was one of a host of women - including Maureen Lipman and Ruth Jones - who were vying for the job of archbishop after being informed that women now qualified for the role. Dawn French (centre) appeared in a new Vicar of Dibley sketch, complete with Red Noses . Emma Watson (left) was part of the sketch, which saw a host of women vying for the job of archbishop after being informed that women now qualified for the role . The show kicked off with Radio 2 DJ Dermot O'Leary completing a 24-hour danceathon to raise £643,336. The 41-year-old completed his epic challenge by showing off his moves outside the BBC Broadcasting House in London. The X Factor presenter fought tiredness and pain to boogie his way to the finish line at the London Palladium, where the live coverage was being hosted, with help from celebrities including Caroline Flack and Jamie Oliver. During the danceathon, which saw him cover the equivalent of 53 miles, O'Leary was only allowed breaks to go to the toilet. After completing the event O'Leary took to Twitter to thank everyone who had donated. The X Factor presenter was joined by a host of celebrities including Caroline Flack (right) and raised a whopping £643,336 . O'Leary, who completed the equivalent of 53 miles during the danceathon, looked like he was putting everything into it. He was joined by X Factor winner Fleur East (left in red) and Jamie Oliver (back in red) He wrote: 'Good God. I had no idea how much I would raise. But it wasn't that. 641k! Thank you doesn't even begin to touch it. 24hrs I'll never forget.' He later added: 'Thank you for your unending messages of good will and for your donations. Thanks so much to my team. A varied and motley bunch. 'Wouldn't have come anywhere near that amount without them. And now... To nod.' Other highlights included a James Bond mockumentary that suggested Daniel Craig really sounds like a little girl, with his 007 growl the work of comic Alan Carr. Comedians Johnny Vegas, Patrick Kielty, Vic Reeves, Jack Dee and Mick Helm also took to the stage as  a spoof version of One Direction called No Direction.

Paul and Barry Elliott (left) - better known as The Chuckle Brothers - and Robbie Williams (right) also appeared in a sketch about being crowned National Treasure 2015 . In another sketch celebrities including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Robbie Williams fought for a fictitious 'National Treasure' title. A judging panel including Stephen Fry, Miranda Hart and Sheridan Smith saw model David Gandy strip down to his underwear and Russell Brand offer them a free copy of his book to try and get the crown. The show ended with the announcement that Comic Relief and Sport Relief combined had raised a total of £1,047,083,706. Host Claudia Winkleman said of the £78m raised last night: 'That's the highest total we have ever raised at the end of a Red Nose Day. Thank you so much.' Walliams said: 'We work hard to bring you the best comedy we possibly can on Comic Relief but for me the most memorable moments are always the appeal films.' Film-maker Richard Curtis, founder and vice-chairman of Comic Relief, described the moment he knew they had broken their target as 'very strange'. July 1985: Film-maker Richard Curtis and friends come up with the idea of using comedy to raise money and change lives in Africa and the UK. Christmas Day 1985: Comic Relief is launched by Curtis and comedian Lenny Henry for the first time on BBC One from the Safawa refugee camp in Sudan. February 1988: The first Red Nose Day is held to raise money for Comic Relief. Over 150 celebrities and comedians take part, raising more than £15million. July 2002: Comic Relief's sister charity event Sport Relief kicks off and more than £14m is raised. 2003: The first red nose to feature hair is launched and the day raised £61.6m. June 2006: David Walliams swims the Channel  raising £1m for Comic Relief in the process. 2009: Nine celebrities including Gary Barlow and Fearne Cotton climb up Mt Kilimanjaro and raise more than £3m for the charity. Comedian Eddie Izzard also runs 43 marathons in 51 days and raises in excess of £1.8m. The show in 2009 raised a record-breaking £65m and Sainsbury's, which sells the official Comic Relief merchandise, hands over more than £9m - the biggest single donation in the event's history. March 2015: The total before this year’s telethon stood at £960m but record-breaking donations smashed the charity's target of raising £1bn by its thirtieth year . Host Claudia Winkleman (left in both pictures) was joined by a variety of celebrities throughout the night including Russell Brand (left with Winkleman) and Jo Whiley (right with Winkleman) Throughout the night clips were used to show how donations would be used. One piece of footage, presented by John Bishop (third from right) and Richard Hammond (right) shows Iyolwa Health Centre in eastern Uganda . Other clips showed infrastructure being built by materials bought using donations from the annual event . The money raised makes a huge difference to communities and individuals across the world . He said: 'When a bunch of comedians got together all those years ago we dreamed of raising a million or two, and never imagined the generosity that would be shown by the British public for so many years. 'Figures tell us that the £1bn has helped around 50 million people in the UK and overseas, 50 million people whose lives have been changed or saved by the generosity of people they have never met. 'It is an extraordinary thing that we do in Britain and I am enormously proud to be part of it. 'Our thanks to every single person who has ever done their bit over the last 30 years - both the funny and the money.'","More than £78m was raised through this year's annual event alone .

"A chilling image has surfaced which claims to show the ghost of a young drowning victim. The spine-tingling photograph was posted on Facebook by Australian Kim Davison, but things began to get really spooky when it was revealed that a little girl died in the same spot 100 years ago. Ms Davison, from Queensland, posted the image, which was taken in 2014, on the 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook page. It appears to show two women and four children swimming. However Ms Davison and Jessie Lu, the other adult in the photo, are adamant they were with only three children when the photo was taken at Murphy's Hole in Lockyer River, south-east Queensland. Scroll down for video . Social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image, circled, shows a ghostly face . Photo was taken at Murphy's Hole which is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915 . Was it Doreen O'Sullivan' ghost? Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water . When examining the photo later, they were all shocked to see a fourth face in the background. The face that can be seen appears to be very white with dark eyes and two shapes on either side of its head. 'At the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us,' Ms Davison insists. 'I'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human, I can promise you that,' Ms Davison said. 'Its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter's arm. They are long skeletal type fingers.' The story became even spookier when researchers uncovered the story of Doreen O'Sullivan, a 13-year-old girl who drowned in the same creek in 1913. On the Facebook page, some commenters called these shapes 'horns', whilst others claimed to see two buns or two pony tails. A Brisbane Courier newspaper clipping from November 22 1913 has a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole. 'Doreen O Sullivan, aged 13 years, eldest daughter of Mr. James O'Sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the Lockyer Creek on Friday afternoon,' the notice reads. 'Nearly an hour elapsed, before the body was recovered. The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep. An admin from the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page posted a negative version of the image, saying: 'Light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted.. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child' Tragic Doreen O'Sullivan was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915 . 'The funeral took place on Saturday afternoon and was largely attended. The convent school children dressed in white, marching next to the hearse.' Disturbingly, Ms Davison claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water, which only firms her belief that a spirit was present. 'On this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water.' 'When I went back in for one last dip to cool off I did feel something behind me as I was walking out of water but tried to ignore it. Ms Davison claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915. She is convinced that it Doreen O'Sullivan is 'an entity that exists in that spot in the creek'. Some people commenting on the Facebook photo, including Ms Davison, claim there are multiple spirits captured in the photograph. 'There is a man with a beard near the girl I'm holding, near her feet. There are about four faces in the water. Ms Davison posted the photo on the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page . The administrators were shocked by the photo, writing 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' Ms Davison claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915 . Ms Davison was also of the opinion that the figure in the photo was a demon who tried to take her daughter . A cynic responded to Ms Davison's claims, pointing out another possibility. 'The eye sees what it wants to see. In my opinion, it's nothing more than a splash of water,' wrote Max Meara. 'Notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced, causing a splash.' Brad Glynn had another explanation: 'I think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun.' The 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook page administrators were not convinced by either explanation. 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' they wrote. The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep .","A chilling image has emerged on Facebook which  shows a ghostly figure .

"These pictures show the moment a weasel bit off more than it could chew when it made the unwise decision to attack a heron. The aggressive mammal was seen leaping up and biting the large bird's beak, with the move quickly backfiring for the weasel who did not live to tell the tale. After deciding enough was enough, the heron scooped up the critter in its mouth and flew to a nearby lake to drown it, dipping the weasel underwater twice to make sure it was dead. Clinging on: This aggressive weasel was drowned by a heron after the mammal annoyed the bird by attacking it and biting its large beak . Pick on someone your own size: The weasel was pictured biting the heron's beak as it bit off more than it could chew by taking on the large bird . Going down: The annoyed heron decided enough was enough, picking up the weasel in its beak and flying to a nearby lake to drown it . Dunk: The large bird plunged the mammal into the water twice, holding it underneath the surface until it had drowned . The photographs, taken by bird watcher Jonathan Forgham, show nature at its most brutal as the heron gobbled down the weasel in one gulp. Mr Forgham was leaving Elmley Nature Reserve on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, after spending three hours photographing owls when he spotted the weasel attacking the heron. He said: 'I got my car closer and could see the weasel attacking the bird. At that point the heron wasn't trying to eat it, it was just trying to get rid of it. But the weasel attacked its beak again and the heron picked it up and flew of to the pond. 'I drove the car round there in time to see the heron try to drown the weasel. It lifted it out of the water and then dunked it again to make sure it was dead. 'When the weasel was quite motionless the heron swallowed it. Afterwards it didn't do much, it just stood there looking quite smug. 'I have been bird watching all my life and have seen a heron eat ducklings and a snake before but never anything as big as a weasel. The photographs were taken by bird watcher Jonathan Forgham at Elmley Nature Reserve on the Isle of Sheppey, in Kent . Bird watcher Mr Forgham said the weasel's attack 'wasn't very wise', however they have a reputation for being aggressive . Gulp: The heron, seen with the weasel's bite marks on its beak, gobbled its motionless dinner down in one go once it was sure it was dead . Hold on! The pictures come days after a weasel was pictured clinging on to a flying woodpecker after pouncing on top of the bird . 'It wasn't very wise of the weasel to go after a heron but they are aggressive, never give up and fight to the death. You could see bite marks on the heron's beak. 'It was very lucky because it happened just as I was leaving. You can't wait around for something like that to happen, it is a once in a lifetime moment.' The pictures come days after a weasel was pictured clinging on to a flying woodpecker after pouncing on top of the bird as it battled to take it down. The astounding image went viral online after thousands of users shared the 'one-in-a-million' snap on social media, as well as dozens of hilarious parodies of celebrities riding on the bird's back. Martin Le-May, who took the incredible photograph in Hornchurch Country Park, east London, said the woodpecker managed to wriggle free and escape.","An aggressive weasel bit off more than it can chew when it took on a heron, clinging on to the large bird's beak .

"Jailed: Simon Rouen tried to arrange to abuse a woman while working at an Antarctic research base . A British scientist working in Antarctica tried to arrange to abuse an eight-year-old girl when he returned from the South Pole. Simon Rouen, 36, was based at a polar research station when he spelt out his desire in emails to two undercover detectives in a police sting. He thought his messages were going to another paedophile. The eight-year-old girl did not exist. Police tracked him down and arrested him when he landed at Heathrow last year as he returned from working with the British Antarctic Survey. A search of his computer found scores of indecent images of children. Detective Constable Jo Gordon, of Kent Police, said: ‘Throughout the course of the emails he sent, Simon Rouen demonstrated a very real desire to sexually abuse the child when he returned to England. ‘Fortunately, we were able to identify the risk he posed to children and intercept him before any child could be abused.’ Rouen was found guilty of arranging the facilitation of a child sex offence and ten counts of possessing indecent images of children. He was jailed for three years at Southwark Crown Court. The laboratory manager, of Redruth, Cornwall, was stationed at the Rothera Research Station, on Adelaide Island, which also serves as the capital of the British Antarctic Territory. The station has a maximum population of 130 in the summer falling to 22 in the winter. During his six months at the station he exchanged emails with officers from Kent Police’s paedophile online investigation team. Work: Rouen was based at the Rothera Research Station, where he was a highly skilled lab manager . Base: Rothera is the capital of the British Antarctic Territory and is a major centre of scientific research . His last message was sent from Chile as he flew back from Antarctica last March. His police mugshot shows him with the scraggly beard that he grew while he was working in Antarctica. Rouen will be subject to a sexual offences prevention order and will be placed on the sex offenders register. DC Gordon said: ‘We will use all the techniques available to us to apprehend people who prey upon children online, and who use the internet as a tool to find children to sexually abuse or to view indecent images of children.’ A spokesman for the British Antarctic Survey confirmed that Rouen previously worked for the company. She said: ‘The matter has been dealt with by the courts and we do not wish to comment any further.’ The BAS has been responsible for the majority of Britain’s scientific research on the Antarctic continent for the past 60 years.","Simon Rouen, 36, worked as a lab manager for the British Antarctic Survey .

"The young man who killed Thomas Kelly in a brutal one punch attack in 2012 has reportedly stomped on another prisoner's head. Kieran Loveridge, 21, and a 22-year-old inmate allegedly assaulted a 31-year-old inmate in a cell at the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre in Kempsey, NSW, on March 10. The 2GB Morning Show reported Loveridge trampled on the other inmate's head. Police told Daily Mail Australia the injured prisoner was rushed to Kempsey Hospital with head injuries. Scroll down for video . Kieran Loveridge, Thomas Kelly in a brutal one punch attack in 2012 is under investigation after reportedly stomped on a fellow prisoner's head . Kieran Loveridge's mother leaves court distressed after his High Court sentence appeal was denied in December 2014 . Thomas Kelly (pictured) was killed in a single punch when Kieran Loveridge assaulted him on the streets of Sydney's Kings Cross on July 7, 2012. The attack was unprovoked and Kelly died two days later . A Corrective Services spokesman said both of the alleged attackers had been segregated and 'will be moved to other centres'. The alleged attackers are already facing tougher security restrictions. Loveridge was 18 on July 7, 2012, when he felled Thomas Kelly, also 18, with a single blow while he was out with his new girlfriend in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district. Mr Kelly was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital but died two days later following emergency surgery. The attack triggered a huge uproar about alcohol-fuelled violence across Australia. It led Thomas's parents, Ralph and Kathy Kelly, to launch the Thomas Kelly Foundation - an organisation committed to fostering a more responsible drinking culture. Loveridge was initially sentenced to 5 years and 2 months in prison. His sentence was nearly doubled in July 2014 following a community backlash. Detectives are investigating the latest alleged attack. The assaulted inmate may not be co-operating with investigators, a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Police are continuing to pursue a number of lines of inquiry; however, it’s believed the injured inmate and witnesses are refusing to cooperate with investigators.'

Two men, identified as Alexander Green, 35, and  Dawud Joyner, 34, were arrested on a slew of drug charges. The search warrants of the five homes yielded more than 100 grams of ecstasy, two guns and more than $2,000 in cash. A car also was seized. Authorities say Green was the target of the three-month investigation by the prosecutor's office's narcotics task force, which culminated in Thursday's raids. According to prosecutors, just before 4pm Thursday officers executed search warrants at five addresses on Poplar Street in Trenton and Ward Avenue in Bordentown. In all, the drug bust yielded a .380 caliber semi-automatic handgun, a defaced .38 Special revolver and a black ski mask stashed inside an oven, as well as bags of marijuana, ecstasy and drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale and baggies . Rescued: Animal control officers arrived on the scene and removed the crocodile (pictured here is a stock image) The baby crocodile was discovered inside the basement of 43 Poplar Street where Dawdud Joyner lived with Richelle Ayers. Both were arrested on drug charges and outstanding warrants. A 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix was also seized by officials as drug proceeds. Lt. Mike Novembre, the commanding officer of the operation, said the estimated street value of the seized ecstasy was $3,180, while the value of the marijuana was $750. Alexander Green has been charged with multiple drug and weapons possession counts. He is being held on $150,000 bail.","Alexander Green, 35, and Dawud Joyner, 34, were arrested during drug raids, which also netted a baby crocodile .

"A weekend report claiming that a top adviser to President Barack Obama leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State is 'baloney,' the White House said Monday. The New York Post on Saturday claimed that Valerie Jarrett, a close confidant of both the president and First Lady Michelle Obama, divulged details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. The bad press was reportedly timed to become public just as Clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated to reporters on Monday that the report wasn't true, though. Scroll down for video . A new report claims that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's (above) own party leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and likely presidential candidate was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State . Valerie Jarrett (left), one of President Barack Obama's (right) top advisers, reportedly leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House . The story ran in the New York Post and was written by Ed Klein, who spoke last Wednesday about his belief Jarrett was involved on Fox and Friends . ‘It's utter baloney,' he said after a reporter asked him about the rumor at his regular briefing with the press. He did not comment further on the matter. According to the New York Post article, authored by Edward Klein, a source close to the White House disclosed that 'Obama and Valerie Jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent Hillary from becoming president.' 'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the Democrat Party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the Clintons, who she believed had begun 'marginalizing the president' and were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' She reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high-profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, the president and the first lady, reportedly sat down with Clinton and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett is reported to have been speaking to Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She’s promised O’Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' a source who spoke to Klein allegedly said. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016 . She has also reportedly reached out to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary . Klein, the author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also says he spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' And it's not over yet, as according to Klein, six additional probes into Clinton's performance are underway. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, having discussed it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' Klein claimed. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama’s longest serving advisers. She said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'","Weekend report claimed that Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, leaked the Hillary Clinton email scandal to the press .

"The chameleon’s ability to change colour and blend into the background is famous. Now engineers have created artificial ‘skin’ that could one day be used to make soldiers’ uniforms and give them the same ability as the colourful reptile. The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand, by  bending it. Engineers have created artificial ‘skin’ that could one day be used to make soldiers’ uniforms, giving them the  ability to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon . Researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies, colour-shifting camouflage, and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges and aircraft. ‘This is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon-like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it,’ said Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain, a member of the University of California Berkeley team that developed the material. They made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair. The markings enabled them to select the range of colours the material would reflect, depending on how it was flexed and bent. Engineers made the material (illustrated) by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair . The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand like a chameleon (stock image), by applying a minimal amount of force . Chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells. The colours we see in paints and fabrics, for example, occur when white broad spectrum light strikes their surfaces. The unique chemical composition of each surface then absorbs various bands, or wavelengths of light. Bands that aren’t absorbed are reflected back, with shorter wavelengths giving objects a blue hue and longer wavelengths appearing redder, with a rainbow of possible combinations in between. While autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make-up, the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light. Professor Chang-Hasnain said that such ‘structural colour’ is much less common in nature, but is used by some butterflies and beetles to create a an iridescent display. To make the material, the Berkeley team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon, which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility. Rather than spreading the light into a complete rainbow, the ridges reflect a specific wavelength of light. Other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards, active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate structural fatigue in bridges, for example. A stock image of Crescent City Connection Bridge in New Orleans is shown . By ‘tuning’ the spaces between the ridges, Professor Chang-Hasnain said it is possible to select the specific colour to be reflected. They realised it would be possible to subtly shift the spaces between the ridges, and therefore the colour, by flexing or bending the material. As the silicone is bent or flexed, the gaps between the ridges respond . Professor Chang-Hasnain said: ‘If you have a surface with very precise structures, spaced so they can interact with a specific wavelength of light, you can change its properties and how it interacts with light by changing its dimensions.’ The study, published in the journal Optica, says the material is easy to manufacture with the desired surface properties and is able to reflect very pure colours, reflecting up to 83 per cent of the incoming light. So far the experts have created a piece of material that’s one square centimetre, so more time and research is needed before clothes can be created, for example. Professor Chang-Hasnain said: ‘The next step is to make this larger-scale and there are facilities already that could do so. ‘At that point, we hope to be able to find applications in entertainment, security, and monitoring.’ She said the chameleon material to make a new type of billboard as well as create an active camouflage on the exterior of vehicles that would change colour to better match the surrounding environment. It could also be used to make sensors that would change colour to indicate that structural fatigue was stressing critical components on bridges, buildings, or the wings of airplanes. ‘This is the first time anyone has achieved such a broad range of colour on a one-layer, thin and flexible surface. I think it’s extremely cool,’ she said.","Engineers from the University of California Berkeley made the thin material .

"A 'zombie' parasite can turn animals to cannibalism, researchers have found. Researchers looked at cannibalism among freshwater shrimp in Northern Ireland. They found a tiny parasite, Pleistophora mulleri, not only significantly increased cannibalism among shrimp, but made infected shrimp more voracious, taking much less time to consume their victims. A tiny parasite, Pleistophora mulleri,  significantly increased cannibalism among shrimp - and caused them to eat in a frenzy . Dr Alison Dunn said: 'Our research does not suggest any link between parasites and human cannibalism. 'There is evidence that parasites can affect human behaviour. 'A study led by Dr Glenn McConkey, also of the University of Leeds Faculty of Biological Sciences, has shown that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii directly affects the chemistry of the human brain. 'However, cannibalism for the shrimp, unlike in humans, is a significant source of food even in uninfected animals. 'It seems unlikely that a parasite would be under evolutionary pressure to influence cannibalism in humans.' Researchers from the University of Leeds, Queen's University Belfast and Stellenbosch University in South Africa published their study in in Royal Society Open Science today. They found a tiny parasite, Pleistophora mulleri, not only significantly increased cannibalism among the indigenous shrimp Gammarus duebeni celticus but made infected shrimp more voracious, taking much less time to consume their victims. Dr Alison Dunn, Reader in Evolutionary Biology in the University of Leeds' Faculty of Biological Sciences, who led the study, said: 'Cannibalism is actually fairly common in nature. Our work is the first study to ask if cannibalism is affected by being parasitised.' The research, published in Royal Society Open Science today, reports that although consumption of juveniles by adults is a normal feature of the shrimp's feeding patterns, shrimp infected with the parasite ate twice as much of their own kind as uninfected animals. They attacked juvenile shrimp more often and consumed them more quickly than did uninfected shrimp. Mandy Bunke, a PhD student at the University of Leeds who was the key researcher on the study, said: 'Although the parasite is tiny—similar in size to a human red blood cell—there are millions of them in the host muscle and they all rely on the host for food. 'This increased demand for food by the parasites may drive the host to be more cannibalistic.' Dr Dunn added: 'The parasite is quite debilitating. It takes over huge areas of the muscle, so instead of a nice transparent shrimp you get quite a chalky appearance because of muscles packed with the parasite. 'Interestingly, our group has also found previously that infected shrimp may be able to catch and eat less prey of other animal species. 'Perhaps cannibalism of smaller shrimp is the only way these sick animals can survive.' The latest study also found that uninfected adult shrimp were less likely to cannibalize infected juvenile shrimp than uninfected juveniles. Researchers say their study does not suggest any link between parasites and human cannibalism . Dr Dunn said: 'The parasite is passed to its new host either when it dies and is eaten by another shrimp, or when one shrimp cannibalises another. 'But we observed that uninfected shrimp avoid parasitised food and that is good for the shrimp as it means that they can obtain food through cannibalism but still avoid parasitic infection. 'Infected shrimp don't avoid infected juveniles. 'They consume infected and uninfected juveniles. 'This may be is because they are more hungry or because they are already infected so there is no incentive to avoid eating infected juveniles.' Dr Dunn said: 'Our research does not suggest any link between parasites and human cannibalism. 'There is evidence that parasites can affect human behaviour. 'A study led by Dr Glenn McConkey, also of the University of Leeds Faculty of Biological Sciences, has shown that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii directly affects the chemistry of the human brain.

"Germaine Greer delivered an awkward moment on Q&A program on Monday night when she asked Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop if she would 'free the nipple' to save the lives of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman. The social media campaign, which gets its name from the 'free the nipple' hashtag it is associated with, aims to address the taboo surrounding women's nipples being exposed in film, television and photographs. It was raised by an audience member who was interested in learning the panel's view of how they felt about young women posing topless online. Scroll down for video . Feminist icon Germaine Greer asked Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop if she would consider posing topless to spare the Bali Nine duo . While Ms Bishop said it was not something she had ever had the desire to do and emojis were as 'radical' as she would get, the controversial feminist icon asked: 'What if it got you the commutation of two life sentences of two Australians?' In reply to this, Ms Bishop paused and shook her head in silence as the audience and panelists on the ABC program laughed. 'Please don't got there, Germaine,' the minister finally answered. This is Greer's second gaffe on the program. In 2012, the feminist icon said former prime minister Julia Gillard had a 'big arse'. Ms Bishop went on to say she was concerned about the concept of young women posting topless photos of themselves on the internet. Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukuraman (right) were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin in 2005 from Indonesia into Australia . Ms Bishop looked shocked when Greer quizzed her on the possibility and was speechless for a few moments . 'I just worry that the liberation of young women showing their nipple to the world leads to some perverted behaviour coming even more to the fore,' she said. Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman were arrested in 2005 for attempting to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin from Indonesia into Australia. Q&A viewers were as stunned as Julie Bishop when Ms Greer asked the question and took to Twitter to express their surprise. Some viewers joked that Ms Bishop should join the 'free the nipple' movement on the spot. The pair were sentenced to death and have spent the last 10 years in Bali's Kerobokan prison. Chan and Sukuraman are days away from being executed after they were moved to Indonesia's 'Death Island', Nusakambangan, on Wednesday. Ms Bishop has repeatedly asked the Indonesia government to spare the duo's lives. It was revealed last week that Ms Bishop tried to organise a prisoners swap in exchange for clemency. Annabel Crabb (left) hosted Monday's show in the place of Tony Jones, with writer Roxane Gay on the panel . Ms Bishop, along with Greer, was appearing on Q&A's first all-female panel to mark Sunday's International Women's Day. Other guests were writer Roxane Gay, Best & Less chief executive Holly Kramer and Youth Without Borders founder Yassmin Abdel-Magied. The show's regular host Tony Jones was replaced by the ABC's chief online political writer Annabel Crabb. Youth Without Borders founder Yassmin Abdel-Magied (left) and Best & Less chief executive Holly Kramer (right) were also very active on the panel . Ms Bishop also discussed the role of being foreign affairs minister and the challenges she would have faced if she had children while in the position. The minister said she spent a number of days over in the Ukraine following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which would have been difficult to maneuver if she had been children. 'I'm not suggesting for a moment that every person who's foreign minister should have no children,' she said. 'But the way I'm doing it, the way I fulfill the role as foreign minister, I do spend a lot of time away and I do focus 110 per cent on it.' .","Germaine Greer ran the possibility past Julie Bishop on Monday's Q&A .

"Jailed: Matthew Parkhouse was sentenced to 20 months in prison for stealing money from customer accounts while working at a Natwest call centre . A bank worker who stole a fortune from elderly customers after taking their account details over the phone was caught out when his own account rocketed from £8 to £36,000. NatWest telephone advisor Matthew Parkhouse asked a string of account holders for the security digits on the backs of their cards when he didn't need them for legitimate banking purposes. He secretly noted the numbers down and then used them to make payments of thousands into a business account he held. Had the scam succeeded, Parkhouse would have got away with over £50,000 - instead he has been jailed for 20 months. Manchester Crown Court heard how he was employed at the bank’s call centre in Manchester between April 2012 and March 2014 - where he was responsible for dealing with customer accounts queries over the phone . He was rumbled in December 2013 after his own bank - Barclays - became suspicious that his savings had shot up. Parkhouse, 30, of Hulme, Manchester had set up the Barclays account in the name of 'Megabyte Software', two months before he began the frauds. Prosecutor Lindsay Thomas said: 'It transpired that part of that agreement with Barclays involved allowing customers to process card payments without them being present - so long as all the card details, including the three digits on the back of the card - were presented.' When Barclays examined the transactions they found out they had come from six different bank cards - all issued to NatWest, where Parkhouse worked. Two days after Barclays first became suspicious, Parkhouse went into the Stockport branch of Barclays and withdrew £6,000 in cash. Parkhouse blamed another 'rogue' employee for the frauds when quizzed by bosses, but he was the only member of staff to have accessed all six of the victims' accounts and transcripts revealed he had asked for their security digits. Fraudulent activity: The 30-year-old was employed at the bank’s call centre in Manchester between April 2012 and March 2014 and would ask account holders for their three digit security pin without a legitimate reason . He later admitted six fraud charges and one charge of converting criminal property. Kate Harney, defending, said the offence had 'naive' characteristics, adding: 'This is a young man who set up a business account in his own name, to his own address, and there was a very clear audit trail within the bank. 'This is not a young man who had thought this through.' Miss Harney said the breakdown of his parents' marriage had caused difficulties for his mother and that Parkhouse had been hoping to help her with the cash, but ended up doing 'nothing to assist' her. Sentencing for the 'gross breach of trust' Recorder Suzanne Goddard QC said Parkhouse had received a good education and had 'thrown away the opportunities' given to him. Sentencing: Speaking at Manchester Crown Court, above, Recorder Suzanne Goddard QC said Parkhouse had received a good education and had 'thrown away the opportunities' given to him . Detective Constable Laura Watson, of GMP's Fraud Investigation Team, said: 'Parkhouse was employed by NatWest and placed in a position of trust, dealing with customer accounts. 'He abused this trust and stole a large amount of money from mainly elderly customers and used his position for his own gain. 'Both NatWest and Barclays were quick to act and worked in partnership with the police to help us to prosecute this man. I hope today's sentence serves the message that you will be caught and you will be prosecuted.'","Matthew Parkhouse, of Manchester, was employed at Natwest call centre .

"An Ohio family with a three-year-old daughter who has up to 1,000 seizures a day has moved 1,200 miles to Colorado in hopes of getting treatment in the form of medical marijuana. Addyson Benton, of Liberty Township, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old, which have delayed her communication and motor-skill growth. And though she's tried at least ten anti-seizure drugs, nothing seems to reduce her symptoms. Her parents, Heather and Adam Benton, researched a form of non-psychoactive medical marijuana that is illegal in Ohio, and decided it's in Addyson's best interest to give the drug a try. Young: Addyson Benton, of Liberty Township, Ohio, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old and has tried ten anti-seizure drugs with no result . Epilepsy: When Addyson (pictured here with her mom, Heather Benton) was diagnosed she was having up to 1,000 seizures per day . Development: The three-year-old girl (pictured here with her father, Adam Benton) has had delayed communication and motor-skills growth because of her seizures . The family already has two doctors in Colorado that Addyson sees once a year and both told the family that THCa would be beneficial, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. They intended to move in October 2014 but decided to stay in Ohio after being told they were on a waiting list for cannabidiol oil that would be shipped to them from Colorado. After being told that the oil - called Charlotte's Web CBD oil after halting seizures in a girl named Charlotte Fiji - shipped to them until the  October 2015, they decided to finally make the move. The family  had a chance to try the oil, which is usually taken orally through a syringe or an empty pill capsule, on Addyson before moving and said they can already see improvements in two weeks. Medication: Addyson's parents researched a non-psychoactive form of medical marijuana that they believe will help their daughter. Her two doctors in Colorado, who she sees once a year, also believe she will benefit from the drug . Big move: Addyson's family is moving 1,200 miles from Liberty Township, Ohio, to Castle Rock, Colorado, in hopes of helping stop their daughter's epilepsy . 'Her walking is better, her talking is better, her attention is better. It's phenomenal the changes we have seen in her these two weeks, but it has not controlled her seizures,' Heather Benton told the Enquirer. 'We really need to jump on top of that while she's growing.' Once the family reaches Colorado, her treatments will cost about $300 per month. Their move to Castle Rock, Colorado, comes after two years of planning, and Adam Benton secured a job in the state before leaving home. Trial run: Addyson was able to try the CBD oil two weeks before she left Ohio, and her family said they can already see improvements . Expensive: The family has been planning their move off-and-on for about two years. Once they reach their new home, Addyson's treatments will cost about $300 per month . Organizations are trying to get the legalization of marijuana on the Ohio ballot for November, but the Bentons said that Addyson needs help now. 'We need to get out to Colorado and come up with a plan and figure out what things are going to work for her. Once we figure that out, and Ohio's bill passes we can look at getting her on the same medication and then we can come back,' Heather Benton said. She added: 'Even if the bill passed tomorrow, if I went to my neurologist or our pediatrician, they wouldn't have a clue what to tell us about dosing and what's safe with her current medications. 'We just want to be surrounded by people who know what they are doing.' Visit the Benton family's GoFundMe page to donate toward Addyson's treatment. New bill: Though organizations in Ohio are trying to get the legalization of marijuana on the ballot for November, the Bentons said Addyson needs help now . Hope: Heather and Adam Benton's goal is that the move will help them find doctors 'who know what they are doing' and that Addyson's seizures can be reduced .","Addyson Benton, of  Ohio, was diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy at nine months old and has tried ten anti-seizure drugs with no result .

"This is the moment a group of 20 drunken thugs stormed a synagogue before hurling anti-Semitic abuse including 'Kill the Jews' at young worshippers inside. The dramatic brawl broke out after the group forced their way into the Ahavas Torah synagogue in Stamford Hill, north London, where young people were marking the end of the sabbath. The attack, which led to four men and two women being arrested, comes amid concerns about an increase of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe. A Jewish patrol group, which works to reduce violence against Jews, said it had stepped up patrols in the area. This is the moment a group of 20 drunken thugs stormed a synagogue in north London before hurling anti-Semitic abuse including 'Kill the Jews' at young worshippers inside . In a shocking video filmed at the scene, chairs are seen being flung against the double doors, shattering panes of glass, as men shout profanities at those desperately barricading the doors. Those inside then start to fight back by throwing parts of broken chairs around the synagogue. This morning, a mound of broken furniture and trails of blood could be seen strewn across the building. The incident is said to have taken place after the group attacked a young Jewish man outside the building, who is not a member of the synagogue. As he ran inside for refuge, the thugs chased him inside. Police said some of the men did manage to briefly break into the synagogue, but were quickly thrown out again by security staff. One man was injured as he sought to prevent the group from getting in. He sustained facial injuries, not believed to be serious. He was treated at the scene and did not require hospital treatment. Police said the attack  was not linked to Neo Nazis or Islamic extremists but was 'the completely unacceptable actions of a drunken group.' A spokesman for Scotland Yard said : 'At this early stage, there is no suggestion that this was a far-right or extremist attack but rather the completely unacceptable actions of a drunken group. 'Four men and two women were arrested for public order offences and assault. All were taken to a north London police station where they remain in custody. The dramatic brawl broke out after the group forced their way into the Ahavas Torah synagogue in Stamford Hill while young worshippers were marking the end of the sabbath . 'Shomrin volunteers provided assistance to attending officers, helping with statements and the recovery of local CCTV footage.' Several elders were convinced the attack was not religiously motivated and was merely a typical example of anti-social behaviour. David Mocha, 15, went down to the synagogue this morning to clear up after last night's violence. Many of his friends were inside the synagogue at the time and one had his head smashed with a broken window. He said: 'The Rabbi was telling me this was not an anti-Semitic attack but a fight outside that just got out of hand. 'But from what my friends have told me this was definitely an anti-Semitic attack. People were shouting 'kill the Jews'. I've seen videos of them chanting that. You can't say that's not anti-Semitic. In a shocking video filmed at the scene, chairs are flung against the double doors, shattering panes of glass. The men can also be heard shouting profanities at those barricading the building . 'One of my friends had a window smashed in his face. People were bleeding. There was blood and broken chairs all over the place when I came to clear up, it was much worse than it is now. 'I don't feel safe at all. My friends said they were terrified by what happened last night. I'm so scared sometimes I try to hide my Jewish identity.' Yuri Simon, also a member of the synagogue, said his friends were also inside the building when the attack happened. He said: 'This was obviously an anti-Semitic attack. My friends were inside the synagogue and I got a call from them saying what was happening. 'I was told there was an incident outside between a young man and a private party who were drunk. 'He went inside and they started attacking the synagogue, breaking the windows and forced their way inside. People were bleeding. The police arrested them. There were about 20 drunk people. 'There has been an increase in anti-Semitic incidents, people feel free to attack. There needs to be more security and tougher punishments. Some of the men did manage to go into the synagogue but were quickly thrown out again by security staff . Elders, including Rabbi Maurice Davis are convinced the attack was not religiously motivated and was merely a typical example of anti-social behaviour . 'My friends were terrified by what happened, it's shocking. I think more incidents like this is the future in Britain. I don't feel safe in this neighbourhood any more.' Meir Taub, who is a member of the local Shomrim, a Jewish patrol designed to crack down on violence against Jews, said he was called to the incident shortly after it began and was the first to call the police. He said: 'I came down and there was a huge group of people, men and women, trying to force their way into the synagogue. 'The window had already been smashed. Teenagers were shouting abuse. It was blatantly anti-Semitic, they came and attacked a synagogue. 'I was on the phone to the police all the time, I didn't interfere but others did. 'The number of these incidents has increased in the past few months, since before Charlie Hebdo. We're stepping up patrols and working with the police. The courts should take attacks like this seriously. A Jewish patrol designed to crack down on violence against Jews said it would be stepping up patrols and that attacks such as this should be taken seriously . 'I have clear footage which I'm going to show to the police which clearly shows there were anti-Semitic chants.' Bernard Grosskopf, who lives close to the synagogue, went to see what was happening after being woken up by the noise of the fight. He said: 'It was quite something. Both groups were going at each other. The fight was crazy, it was pandemonium. I didn't get the feeling it was anti-Semitic though, just a normal fight.' Rabbi Maurice Davis said the first thing he heard about the incident was when he was contacted by the media this morning and asked for a comment. He said he was '200 per cent' sure the attack was a normal Saturday night brawl and was not religiously motivated in any way. He said: 'I've spoken to the patrol and looked at videos. It was depressing what happened but it definitely wasn't anti-Semitic. There is no anti-Semitism or racism in this area. 'There was a party across the road, they are a nice family, I know them. They had a fight with a young man in the street who ran into the synagogue and took refuge in the toilet. 'He was Jewish but not a member of the synagogue. Some of the drunken partygoers tried to break in and attack him but they were beaten back with chairs. They smashed windows and threw all sorts of things. 'I don't know yet what the cost of the damage is, but we will have to replace the door.' Four men and two women were arrested for public order offences and assault. All were taken to a north London police station where they remain in custody. A police spokesman said: 'The disturbance began when a group of drunk males, believed to have walked to the area from a house party nearby, tried to gain access to the synagogue in Craven Park Road. 'One man was injured as he sought to prevent the group from entering the building. He sustained facial injuries, not believed to be serious, and was taken to hospital for treatment. 'A small number of the group did briefly gain entry to the synagogue before being removed by security staff.' They added: 'The incident is being treated as an anti-Semitic incident, due to remarks made by one of the group. However there is nothing to suggest that it was a planned or targeted attack. Inspector Jonathan Waterfield said: 'We are investigating to establish the full circumstances of the incident and to identify anyone else involved in the disturbance who has not yet been arrested. 'We have also increased police patrols in the Stamford Hill area to provide reassurance to the community.' The Community Security Trust, which monitors anit-Semitic incidents, tweeted: 'We are aware of alleged antisemitic assault at synagogue in Stamford Hill & are working w. Police & community. Suspects have been arrested.' Police have asked anyone with information which might assist the investigation to call Haringey CID via 101.

"A young woman was run over by two taxis and killed in front of her boyfriend as they walked home together following a drunken tiff. Megan Hoskins, 20, was heard to shout at soldier Mark Hughes: 'just watch... the next car that comes' before apparently laying down in the road. As Mr Hughes, also 20, tried to tend to her, a black Hackney cab ran over her, closely followed by a Skoda Octavia minicab which tried to brake but came to rest with the care assistant trapped underneath. Megan Hoskins, right, was out with boyfriend Mark Hughes, left, on the night she died on July 20, last . The inquest heard that Ms Hoskins had taken cocaine, alcohol and cannabis on the night she had died . She was rushed to hospital but died of multiple fatal injuries less than two hours later. The tragedy occurred on July 20 last year while Megan, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was spending the weekend with Mr Hughes, who was on home leave from duty in Afghanistan. An inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend's house where they drank a bottle of rosé wine each and three cans of Fosters lager. Ms Hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the Newtown Working Men's Club in Wigan. Trouble began when Mr Hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with Ms Hoskins. They left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home, where witnesses saw Ms Hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend. Mr Hughes told the Bolton hearing: 'A man had came over to dance with Megan and I said ""that's my girl, what are you doing?"" It did wind me up. I knew she wouldn't do anything but it did wind me up. We had a bit of an argument and decided to leave. Mr Hughes, right, got annoyed while out with Ms Hoskins, left, when a man approached her for a dance . A witness who overheard the row saw Ms Hughes lie down in the road, pictured, and shout 'watch now, the next car that comes' as a Fire Engine approached, which managed to avoid her but  was hit by a hackney taxi . 'We decided to walk home and were having a dispute, a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious. I was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other. At some point walking home I made a comment and she laughed. 'We were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right. I crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was. I saw her lying in the road and that's when the cars have come.' Mr Hughes said he didn't hear Ms Hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added: 'That's what I can't get out of my head. She would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she didn't have heels on. She didn't say anything. 'She would usually have a go at me if it was my fault. There was nothing.' Mr Hughes, pictured, said Ms Hoskins normally only ever fell over when out  if she was wearing high heels . Asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally, Mr Hughes replied: 'I have thought that but she wouldn't have any reason to do that. Ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend. She was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady. I had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her.' Eyewitness Amy Howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below. She said: 'I could hear them shouting. 'When they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front. She was in the road in the path of cars then shouted ""watch now, the next car that comes"". She carried on walking in the road. I could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on. I thought it was going to hit her.' Ian Dunham, the driver of the fire engine said: 'I saw a person in the road. I turned the sirens off, I didn't swerve, and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room. I knew they had had a drink so not to startle them I turned the siren off. 'I noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up I was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car's width from the pavement.' The inquest heard the driver black Hackney cab Brian Sharples could not have avoided a collision. Coroner Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing Ms Hoskins as 'caring' Joseph Parkinson the driver of the Skoda Octavia following behind him said: 'The taxi in front didn't so much swerve as rock. When the lights came on I took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road. I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't have time to swerve. If I could have done, I would have done.' The hearing was told Ms Hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people. Tests showed she had traces of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement. Mr Hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of Ms Hoskins' manslaughter but no action was taken against him. Recording an open conclusion, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'She was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent, bright and spent her life caring for others. In Miss Howarth's opinion, she believes Megan was deliberately standing in front of cars. We have heard from Mark that that didn't happen. 'I don't know how or why she was in the road. It could have been that she fell, although she would normally fall if wearing heels. It could have been that she collapsed. It could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road. 'Sadly for unknown reasons to me, through collapse or choice, Megan was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles. The difficulty I have is I don't know why she was on the floor. The only person who can tell me why she was on the floor is Megan and sadly she is not here to tell me that.'","Megan Hoskins had taken cannabis, cocaine and alcohol before she died .

"A computer expert has managed track down the delighted owner of a memory stick full of treasured photographs living half way across the world, two years after she believed they were lost forever. Jonathan Stainsby, 26, was handed two USB sticks by a friend after they lay unclaimed for two years after being discovered in a Marks and Spencer store. The memory sticks were full of photographs, and IT expert and photography enthusiast Jonathan quickly realised how precious the images could be and determined to find the owner. Amazing: Jonathan  managed use technology to track down the photos' owner  half way across the world . Technology: When Jonathan put this picture in, it matched to a woman called Narien - who would eventually turn out to be the owner of the photographs . So he set about selecting images and running them through Google image search, trying to get the perfect match. And his hard work paid off, when he managed to find the name Narien. But even with the unusual name, he was still struggling to find the mystery owner. 'None of the names was Narien, so I went onto Facebook and trawled through some of the photographs of people with that name to see if I recognised anyone from the pictures,' he explained. 'Then I went back to the USB stick and looked at some of the documents on it and found the surname Meyer. 'I typed that in Facebook and a lady called Narien Meyer, from South Africa, came up and I managed to positively identify her.' Narien, it transpired, was a teacher now living in Oman - almost 4,000 miles from Jonathan's home in Hartlepool. Extra: Jonathan then turned back to the USB sticks to find more information, and then found a surname . Then he hit another hurdle: he sent a message to Narien, to let her know he had found her photos. But she didn't respond, so he did a little more sleuthing work and found a friend who was willing to help. And finally, he was able get the pictures back to their rightful owner, who is said to be 'absolutely delighted'. Narien sent Jonathan a thank you message saying that she believes she lost the sticks possibly on a visit to Barnard Castle in 2013. It said: 'Thank you so much for getting my pics back to me! I lost my bag with the USBs in it in Barnard Castle two years ago - or so I thought. 'We probably stopped at other places as well but I'm not that familiar with the area. 'Amazing that after two years you got it back to me I'm now in Saudi Arabia, and most of the photos were taken in Kuwait and Oman, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where I've been teaching. 'Thanks to you I'll have my memories!' Jonathan is equally as pleased. 'I had a one in 7.126billion chance of success and with hard work I accomplished it - and made new friends some 3,6660 miles away,' he said.","Jonathan Stainsby was handed two memory sticks lost two years ago .

"Penalty: Top lawyer Romie Tager QC faces a fine of £1.2million for failing to pay inheritance tax on his father's estate . A leading barrister has been ordered to pay a £1.2million penalty after he failed to pay his father's inheritance tax bill for 10 years after his death. Romie Tager QC, one of the country's top experts in commercial and property law, repeatedly refused to reveal how much his father's estate was worth and did not respond to requests to pay inheritance tax. A judge criticised his 'wholly unacceptable' and 'disgraceful' behaviour towards the tax authorities, adding that he was not 'open and candid about his affairs'. The barrister resigned as head of his chambers for 'personal reasons' shortly before the tax tribunal judgment was made earlier this month. Mr Tager, 67, has practised as a barrister for 45 years, and became a QC in 1995. Until his recent resignation, he was head of Selborne Chambers, based near the Middle Temple in central London. He recently defeated Gordon Ramsay in a High Court dispute over one of the celebrity chef's pubs, and has represented high-profile figures including David Mellor. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs took him to a tribunal last year after it emerged that he had run up enormous bills for unpaid income and inheritance tax. Mr Tager's father Osias died in March 2005 without making a will, the tribunal heard, but an assessment of the size of his estate was not given to HMRC until four years later. Tax officials disputed Mr Tager's estimate of his father's wealth, which was largely contained in shares, and sent Mr Tager a string of letters demanding further information. Despite being hit with non-compliance penalties of more than £30,000, Mr Tager did not give HMRC the information they needed and was taken to the Upper Tribunal in May last year. At that hearing he blamed 'a lack of organisation' for his failure to respond properly, and although Judge Colin Bishopp said the barrister 'commanded little sympathy' he agreed to give him five weeks to comply with HMRC's demands, which he described as a 'last chance' to get his affairs in order. At a second tribunal hearing held in London in October, the judge was told that Mr Tager had still not sent the necessary information to HMRC. Judge Bishopp said that the information he had provided was 'wholly inadequate', adding: 'I have not doubt that Mr Tager must have been aware that it was inadequate.' In his evidence, Mr Tager said that he had earned 'very substantial fees' during his career, added that though he had often filed tax returns late he was keen to fulfil his liabilities. He also said it was difficult to work out the size of his father's estate, as Osias Tager was 'secretive' about money and had much of his wealth tied up in a variety of shareholdings. Work: Mr Tager has recently stepped down as head of Selborne Chambers, pictured, in central London . But the judge said in his ruling that it was 'difficult if not impossible' to understand why Mr Tager did not entrust his tax affairs to an accountant, given that he was 'unwillng or insufficiently skilled' to take care of them himself. He added: 'I regret to say that I am not satisfied that Mr Tager is as keen to be open and candid about his affairs as he would have me believe.' Judge Bishopp also cast doubt on whether the lawyer 'truly was attempting to be co-operative', continuing: 'I am unconvinced that Mr Tager has been as candid as he should be about his late father's affairs'. The judge resolved to impose a penalty on Mr Tager under the terms of the Finance Act 2008, which allows tribunals to impose financial penalties taking into account unpaid tax bills. Mr Tager claimed that the amount of inheritance tax he owed was no more than £75,000, but Judge Bishopp agreed with HMRC that the true figure was at least £1,171,020. The judge ruled that Mr Tager should pay a penalty totalling the entire amount of unpaid inheritance tax, along with a separate penalty for unpaid income tax, meaning that the final figure the lawyer owes is £1,246,020. Cases: Mr Tager recently defeated Gordon Ramsay, left, at the High Court, and he has also represented David Mellor, right, in a legal dispute . In a scathing judgment delivered earlier this month, he said that Mr Tager had done 'too little too late' to resolve the case, and had 'repeatedly and persistently fobbed HMRC off'. He added: 'His earlier conduct as I have described it was, not to mince words, disgraceful.' The judge concluded: 'His conduct... can only be regarded as contemptuous; and his reckless offer of undertakings to this tribunal, followed by his, as I perceive it, insouciant attitude to his non-compliance, are of a similar character.' Judge Bishopp also remarked that 'if all taxpayers behaved as Mr Tager has done the administration of tax would become impossible.' The barrister plans to appeal against the ruling, but in the meantime he must pay the £1.25million penalty within a few weeks. If HMRC succeeds in obtaining a full record of his late father's estate, Mr Tager could face a further hefty tax bill, as the penalty imposed by the tribunal does not cancel out tax liabilities. The total size of his father's estate is not known, but if the inheritance tax assessment of £1.17million is correct then it is likely to be worth at least £3.4million. Charity: David Cameron opened the Tager Centre, an autism treatment centre in Berkshire funded by Mr Tager's family, in June 2009 . Mr Tager admitted that he had not acted with 'alacrity and attention' in his personal tax affairs, but denied deliberately hiding information from the authorities. He told MailOnline: 'Throughout my 44 years at the bar I have conducted myself with utter professionalism, commitment and attention to detail. The decision of the tribunal, concerning as it does wholly uncharacteristic behaviour, is therefore a matter of deep personal regret to me. 'I did not act in my tax affairs with the same alacrity and attention as I have conducted myself professionally and I accept that regretfully, I did not comply with the relevant notices in a timely fashion or with the undertaking to the tribunal. 'While I accept that there were delays in providing information to HMRC, there was never any deliberate concealment or intentional withholding of information, and my evidence to HMRC and to the tribunal was honest and truthful. 'I have always been anxious to pay the correct amount of tax, erring on the side of caution in calculating potential tax due and consciously making overpayments if in doubt as to the amount payable.' In February Selborne Chambers announced that Mr Tager was to stand down as head of chambers 'for personal reasons'. It is not known whether or not this decision was related to his tax affairs. Mr Tager recently won a High Court case against Gordon Ramsay on behalf of film director Gary Love, after the celebrity chef claimed his signature had been forged on the lease for the York & Albany pub in north London, which is owned by Mr Love. He also represented ex-MP David Mellor in a dispute over a £1.3million deal to buy an antiques company, and is acting for billionaire tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz in a £2.2billion claim against a group of accountants who allegedly embroiled the businessman in a Serious Fraud Office investigation. A residential home for autistic people which was funded by and named after Mr Tager's family was opened by David Cameron in 2009 in the grounds of the Ravenswood community in Berkshire.","EXCLUSIVE: Romie Tager QC failed to tell authorities the size of father's estate and has not paid inheritance tax 10 years after his father died .

"Cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers . She was turned down for life-changing surgery on the NHS. But cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk – thanks to Daily Mail readers. The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery at the same Leeds hospital trust which gave aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham breast enlargements. And even when readers raised £55,000 to pay for Sophie’s surgery her family were told by NHS doctors she was ‘not disabled enough’ to qualify – despite not being able to walk. But the toddler has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the United States this autumn. It means that, by the time she is four, Sophie could be walking. Sophie was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy. She needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery, which involves cutting the nerves in her spine, to be able to walk freely. Sophie has strengthened her legs ahead of the operation using a specially-adapted £1,200 bicycle bought from readers’ donations. Doctors said this means she is an ‘ideal candidate’ for the surgery and is likely to be able to walk completely unaided afterwards. Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘Sophie wiped my face and she said “Mummy why are you crying?” I told her she was going to be able to walk and she said “Yes!”. ‘By the time she is four she could be walking. It’s very, very emotional, we just can’t believe it. ‘It is frustrating that Leeds turned us down but now we know that Sophie is going to have the best surgeon, so that is more reassuring. If anything goes wrong at least we know we did everything we could for her. ‘As it gets nearer I’m sure the nerves will kick in - it’s a big operation. But it’s what she needs and it’s the best thing for her. ‘Sophie understands now that she is going to walk. She knows Dr Park will “fix her legs” and she knows she is going on a big plane to get there.’ The three-year-old was denied NHS funding last year for the surgery, but she has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon Dr Tae Park in the U.S. Sophie’s mother Allison, 41, a nurse, said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved. She said: ‘If it wasn’t for the Daily Mail we wouldn’t be where we are now' Mrs Thomlinson said Sophie had progressed to standing up on her own since using the bike bought from readers’ funds, which meant doctors had told her they were ‘confident’ she would be able to walk after surgery. She added: ‘If it wasn’t for the Daily Mail we wouldn’t be where we are now, we just can’t thank everyone enough. ‘The messages we’ve had are so encouraging and we’re keeping them all for Sophie in a memory box for when she’s older.’ She and husband Craig, 45, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, are continuing to fundraise to get to their target of £75,000 which will cover their flights to the US and Sophie’s therapy and equipment she will need after surgery. The family are fundraising through the charity Tree of Hope and any excess will go towards helping other disabled children.","Cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson, from Dukinfield, could not walk .

"Two mothers who went on a night out have been left with matching scars after suffering horrific injuries when their heads were 'banged together' outside a city centre pub. Joanne Baker, 31, and Gayle Smart, 37, were both left with deep scars above their eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub. They believe someone smashed their heads together as they stood outside the Rose and Crown on Newgate Street. Friends Gayle Smart (pictured left) and Joanne Baker (right) were both left with horrific injuries and deep scars above their eyes when they became embroiled in a disturbance outside a Newcastle pub . But police say they are satisfied no crime has been committed. The women had gone out for drinks in the city centre on Friday night with Ms Baker's boyfriend John Burton, 26, when they ended up at the Rose and Crown. 'We had been in the pub then we went outside then the next thing I remember is our heads were banged together,' said Ms Baker. Ms Smart, a waitress, added: 'As far as I can remember I was just outside having a cigarette and our heads were just smashed together.' Gayle Smart (left) and Joanne Baker (right) believe someone smashed their heads together outside the pub . The incident took place outside the Rose and Crown pub in Newcastle (pictured) Neither realised how seriously injured they were until they looked at one another's faces. Ms Baker said: 'I just saw Gayle's face and I was more concerned about her. But she was looking at me and asking me if I was OK.' Mr Burton ran to a nearby Greggs shop to get tissues to stem the women's bleeding and police and paramedics arrived at the scene. Ms Smart, who lives in Bensham, Gateshead, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary by ambulance, while Ms Baker got a taxi back to her home in North Shields. Mother-of-two Ms Baker (pictured) said she had to tell her daughter her injury was fancy dress because the little girl was so shocked at her appearance . When she arrived home she discovered the true extent of her injuries and went to North Tyneside General Hospital. 'When I got home I was really shocked,' Ms Baker said. 'The cut was so deep I had to have internal stitches and eight external stitches.' The mother-of-two said: 'When my kids saw it they nearly passed out. I had to tell my daughter it was fancy dress because she was so shocked.' Mother-of-two Ms Smart said she now has to put up with awkward questions and curious looks from customers at the pub where she works. The pair say they believe someone deliberately banged their heads together but police say they can find no evidence of a crime being committed. Ms Baker said: 'I'm going to be scarred for life. I just can't believe all this has happened just from going to a bar. It just doesn't make sense. Ms Smart added: 'There was blood smeared across my forehead. When I saw it I was in shock. And now it's going to scar.' A Northumbria Police spokeswoman said: 'Police were informed of a disturbance in Newcastle city centre at around 8.35pm on Friday. 'Two women suffered facial injuries. Officers attended and inquiries were carried out and it was established no offences were committed. Suitable advice was given to both parties.' Both women say they have been put off nights out in Newcastle city centre and  won't be returning.","Joanne Baker, 31, and Gayle Smart, 37, went on a night out in Newcastle .

"An attack of the giggles can sometimes appear at the strangest moments. Whether it's during a speech or in a meeting, helpless laughter is one of our most insightful behaviours, according to neuroscientist Sophie Scott. In a recent Ted Talk in Vancouver, Professor Scott revealed that laughter often isn't to do with comedy value, but with our relationships with others. Laughter is often used as a tool for social bonding rather than in reaction to something that has comedy value, according to UCL Professor Sophie Scott.  Pictured are Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama during a basketball game . According to David Robson at BBC Future, Scott's study of people in Nambia revealed that laughter is a key cultural mechanism that helps social bonding. When Scott asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and describe the emotions, laughter was the most recognisable. 'People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people's jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,' she told the BBC. The University College London professor's current research aims to distinguish the difference between fake laughs used during conversation, and involuntary giggles. She has carried out brain scans on volunteers listening to expressions of disgust, a real belly laugh and a realistic fake one. Laughter activates the brain's mirror regions that mimic other's actions, and she says this is the reason behind why laughing can be so contagious . So far, her research has found that volunteers were almost always able to identify a false laugh. She has also discovered that less authentic tones are more nasal, and belly laughs never come through the nose. Researchers from Indiana State University found that with laughter can boost the immune system by up to 40 per cent. The study tested 33 healthy women. Half of the women watched a comedy video together while the others watched a dull video on tourism. When the films were over, scientists took samples of the women's immune cells, known as natural killer cells, and mixed them with cancer cells to see how effectively they attacked the disease. They found that the women who had found the comedy funny enough to laugh out loud had significantly healthier immune systems afterwards than those who had watched the tourism film. Meanwhile, MRI scans revealed how hearing real and fake laughter activates two different areas of our brains. Fake laughter triggers more brain activity – in the medial prefrontal cortex, associated with problem-solving – as we try to work out why the person is doing it. Genuine laughter simply activates auditory areas in the temporal lobe – where we process all sound. But both activate the brain's mirror regions that mimic other's actions, and she says this is the reason behind why laughing can be so contagious. 'You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you're with someone else,' she claims. To further her work, Scott has recently set up an experiment at London's Science Museum, where she will be asking visitors to judge the authenticity of different clips of people laughing. And she believes far more research needs to be done on this cultural tic. 'If you search on the Web of Science database for papers on the emotion of fear, you'll get back 6,477 published papers,' Professor Scott writes on Ted. 'Search for papers on laughter and you'll get a paltry 175. Why the disparity? Well, one reason might be that laughter, like other positive emotions, feels less important than negative emotions. 'Sometimes people think that laughter is a ridiculous, trite, pointless topic to research…I think it's a fascinating social behaviour, it is essential to study.' In a separate study last year, psychologist Dr Carolyn McGettigan from the Royal Holloway University of London measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on YouTube clips. Each participant was asked to pick clips they found funny. This ranged from comedy shows, such as Flight Of The Conchords, and even the Eurovision Song Contest. The results were then compared to how their brains responded to fake laughter. The findings revealed participants, none of which were told the study was about laughter perception, could unconsciously tell when the chuckles were insincere. Dr McGettigan said: 'It's fascinating to consider the way our brain is able to detect genuine happiness in other people. 'Our brains are very sensitive to the social and emotional significance of laughter.","Professor Sophie Scott says laughter often isn't to do with comedy value .

"For the first time this century, the skies over Britain will grow dark during the day next Friday with a thrilling eclipse of the Sun. With some parts of the country experiencing 97 per cent darkness, outdoor events will be held nationwide as people gather to gaze heavenwards. Here, GUY WALTERS presents a family guide on how to get the most out of an event that will not happen again for more than a decade. Get out your glasses: Special shades like this are a good bet for watching Britain's first great eclipse this century, with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not set to take place until 2026 . Who turned the lights out! Shortly after 8am next Friday, the skies above Britain will start to grow dim. At first, the change will be slight, but little more than an hour later about nine-tenths of the Sun will be blocked out. Not until nearly 11am will the Sun finally be restored to its full glory. The event taking place will, of course, be a solar eclipse, when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth and casts a deep shadow over the Earth’s surface. It will affect the entire country as the eclipse travels from the Isles of Scilly and all the way north to the Orkneys. Unlike in 1999, none of the UK will be covered by a total eclipse. Instead, we will witness only a partial eclipse. The total eclipse will be taking place over the North Atlantic — it will start from a spot 400 miles south of Greenland, skirt the south of Iceland, pass over the Faroe Islands and the Norwegian territory of Svalbard, and finish over the North Pole. But even though we will not be plunged into total darkness, the effect should still be spectacular —especially if the skies are cloudless. With the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not taking place over Britain until August 12, 2026, and the next total eclipse not happening in our skies until 2090, Friday marks an incredibly rare opportunity to witness a phenomenon that has been a source of wonder and fascination for centuries. A solar eclipse in the Faroe Islands, where hotel rooms have been booked far in advance for this latest event . So where can I catch it? It’s probably too late to travel to the Faroe Islands to see the total eclipse, as by all accounts hotel rooms and berths on ferries were fully booked months if not years ago. However, if you can travel within Britain, it’s best to head north — the farther north you go, the closer to the path of the total eclipse you get and the more the Sun will be obscured. On the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, for example, nearly 98 per cent of the Sun will be covered, while in Dover that figure falls to just over 82 per cent. That may not sound like a big difference, but it is. Skies in Kent will not grow as spectacularly dark as they will in the far north of Scotland. The timeline for the eclipse in Manchester. First sight will come at 8.20am and maximum eclipse at 9.32am . Keep a close eye on the weather forecast. Clouds are the greatest enemy of eclipses, so it’s best to make sure you head somewhere where the sky is clear. The long-range forecast for Friday does look promising — but that can change, of course. If you want to enjoy the eclipse with a group, consider heading to your local park. Astronomical societies are arranging events up and down the country, and you’ll be able to talk to experts and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Check local press for details. The BBC is using big screens in Belfast, Bradford, Bristol, Coventry, Glasgow, Leeds, Portsmouth, Swansea, Waltham Forest, Warwick and Woolwich. What's the best way to view it? You should never look directly at the Sun with the naked eye, even if it is largely obscured. Don’t be tempted, either, to wear just sunglasses or welder’s glasses, no matter how strong the UV protection. However, there are numerous ways to view the eclipse without going blind in the process: . Eclipse glasses: There are many available online, on sites such as Amazon and eBay, and they typically cost less than £10. Whether they are safe is another matter, and even if you are wearing them, do exercise caution, and perhaps still refrain from looking directly at the sun. It is best to consult a telescope or camera shop, which should have stocked up with suitable glasses. Camera: It is only possible to use a camera safely if you have a solar filter mounted or have securely attached a solar filter sheet to the front of the lens. Sheets are available for about £20 at online stores such as Amazon, and should also be available at camera shops. Left to right: Binoculars, a bucket of water and a colander can all be used to get a safe look at the eclipse . Colander: No, that’s not a misprint. If you hold an ordinary kitchen colander up to the Sun and cast the colander’s shadow onto a light surface, such as a white piece of card held about 20 in away, you will notice that the holes project an image of the Sun complete with a corresponding chunk taken out of it by the Moon. This is a fun and safe way to watch the eclipse without having to look directly at the Sun. Bucket of water: This is perhaps the simplest method — fill a bucket with water and look at the Sun’s reflection on the surface. To make it appear more dramatic, line the bucket with a black bin liner. Binoculars or telescope: Though you should never use binoculars or a telescope for looking at the Sun, you can still use them to watch an eclipse. After setting them up on a stand or tripod, point them towards the Sun — without looking through — until the light from the Sun is cast directly down their length and out through the eyepiece. Then, place a piece of white card or paper behind the eyepiece, and an image of the Sun will appear. To bring it into focus, use the ring on your binoculars or telescope, or adjust the distance of the card. Basic pinhole projector: Take two pieces of plain white paper or card and, with a drawing pin or similar, make a neat round hole in the middle of one sheet. When the eclipse is taking place, hold the paper with the hole in it towards the Sun and project the light onto the second sheet by holding it behind the first. You will see that an inverted image of the partially eclipsed Sun will appear. To make the image bigger, move the second sheet farther away. The further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence Stornoway in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland is the place to be on this list . The dawn chorus – twice over . If the skies are clear, the effect should be dramatic — akin to a sunset in mid-morning. Birds will stop singing and may even roost. Then, when the eclipse is over, they will start a second dawn chorus. Watch out for the sky wolves! In times past, many people regarded eclipses with a great deal of fear, seeing them as a manifestation of divine anger or believing that the Moon was in conflict with the Sun. In early cultures, the Sun was sometimes seen as being eaten by supernatural entities. The Vikings, for example, blamed eclipses on ‘sky wolves’ that would chase the Sun and Moon and occasionally catch up with and eat one of them. The Vietnamese blamed eclipses on a greedy giant frog, while the Kwakiutl tribe in Canada believed the Sun was being consumed by heaven itself. Many cultures would greet eclipses with rituals that involved a great deal of banging and shouting, to chase off the evil beings trying to steal the Sun. Some tribes still observe eclipse rituals, even today. The Navajo in North America do not watch the eclipse, but instead stay inside and fast for the duration of the event, while singing to each other. Eclipses were also seen as portents of doom by many. When an eclipse took place in France in AD 840, King Louis thought it an omen that he would soon die, as his father’s death had been preceded by two eclipses. As it happened, Louis was right. He died a month later. Will it affect our power supplies? IN 1999, during the total eclipse over Britain, almost none of the country’s electricity was generated by solar power. Today, the figure is 1.5 per cent, and some concerns have been expressed that the eclipse will disrupt electricity supplies. The National Grid says it generates only about 3,000MW of solar power during a sunny day in March. On Friday, only during the eclipse, this will be reduced by nearly half. ‘The loss of this solar generation will be largely offset by the reduction in demand for power from people watching the eclipse,’ says Jeremy Caplin, forecasting manager at the National Grid. So fear not, there will be no disruption. Despite the sun being blocked out, the loss of this solar generation will be largely offset by the reduction in demand for power from people watching the eclipse, according to the National Grid . It's a magical moment for science . modern man has learned much from studying eclipses. On August 18, 1868, the French astronomer Pierre Janssen observed that day’s total eclipse through a spectrometer, which measures light waves. Around the edge of the eclipsed Sun, he was able to study the huge pillars of gas that emanate from it — and in doing so he discovered a new element. It was named ‘helium’ after the Greek word for the Sun, Helios. The element would not be identified back on Earth until nearly three decades later. But the most crucial scientific finding made during an eclipse was the confirmation of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, which predicted that light from stars would bend as it passed the Sun. In 1919, British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington photographed the positions of the stars around the Sun during an eclipse and then photographed them at night. He found that the light from the stars had shifted, which supported Einstein’s .","The Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth in this landmark event .

Unlike 1999 it will not be a total eclipse over Britain - that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole .

"It was the childhood home of Henry VIII but has become just as famous for its more recent colourful residents, who turned Eltham Palace into an Art Deco haven. The wealthy Courtauld family held luxury cocktail parties for royals and politicians in the 1930s, with millionaires Virginia and Sir Stephen planning their travels using maps on the walls, decorating the rooms with lavish accessories and even transforming the house's air raid bunker in the basement. The palace is set to reopen to the public in April, following a £1.7million renovation, which is part of a larger conservation programme.

Five rooms in the Art Deco palace will be unveiled, including a luxury wartime bunker and 1930's dark room, and a billiards room . The Courtaulds were from a wealthy textile background, and amongst the first to embrace aviation as a means of travelling the world. Visitors will be able to experience the magnificent entrance hall, as well as the luxury air raid shelter that the couple installed in the basement, and see the splendid Medieval Great Hall. Children can also enjoy the launch with a fully interactive tour exploring the animals who resided at the palace – including Mah Jongg the family's pet lemur who had his own heated bedroom. Laura Houliston, English Heritage curator at Eltham Palace, said: 'Eltham Palace is one of the finest examples of art deco architecture and design surviving in Britain today. 'It was also a decadent, fun place to visit. 'This April we'll open up new rooms, the ropes will come down and we'll be inviting people to step back in time and experience one of the Courtauld's lavish parties as they try on vintage inspired designs, play in the billiards room and watch cinefilm of the family.' Historians agree that the Eltham Palace had many state-of-the-art modern conveniences for its time, including under-floor heating . From April 3, guests will be whisked back into the time of the swinging 1930s and will be able to also enjoy the brand new visitor's centre and greenhouse café next to the children's play area. The renovations are one of the first of the £52 million conservation projects to be undertaken by the English Heritage Trust, a charity which will oversee more than 400 sites, including Stonehenge and Hadrian's Wall. The charity has been given a £80 million fund by the government, but aims to be self-funding by 2023. There will also be a unique 1930's map room full of plans to exotic locations, which was formerly hidden under decades of wallpaper . Digital handsets will be provided along with visual guides to each room as well as cinefilm and original photography of the family . A new children's guide will also be available, telling the story of the Palace's exotic animals, such as Mah Jongg the lemur . During the renovation, the Palace will remain open to the public on Sundays as normal during winter. The new rooms open on April 3 . The renovations are one of the first by the English Heritage Trust, a charity which will oversee more than 400 sites, including Stonehenge .

"London was hit with flooding over the weekend after Friday's Solar Eclipse saw tides across the country swell. The Environment Agency issued 24 flood alerts across the UK with rescue teams called to a number of incidents on the coast. In Chiswick, West London, motorists ploughed through flooded streets after the tide climbed three metres in height as a result of the rare eclipse. Parts of Chiswick in West London flooded over the weekend after the Solar Eclipse which caused higher tides . The Thames Barrier closed over the weekend to protect London from further flooding. Above, a cyclist in Chiswick drudges through the water . The Thames Barrier closed on Saturday to protect London from the high tides linked to the solar eclipse and 'supermoon' which caused rising water levels. Flood alerts were issued across much of the country with the Met Office predicting that some areas would still be affected today. The rising tides came after Friday's Solar Eclipse, the first of its kind for 16 years. With the sun and moon aligning, higher tides were to be expected. But added to the fact the Earth was at its closest point to both, they were slightly larger than usual. Enthusiasts hailed the phenomenon as the 'supertide of the century', with hundreds flocking to coastal points across the country. Some encountered trouble at sea as a result of the weather, with one family plucked from Watergate Bay in Newquay by a lifeboat after becoming trapped in a cove. A grandmother and her two granddaughters had to be rescued when the waters became too high. RNLI volunteer Lifeboat Operations Manager Gareth Horner said: 'The group were a bit damp but unharmed after becoming trapped around three hours before high-water as often happens along this stretch of coast.' The combination of the eclipse and the Earth being at its closes point to the moon and sun caused water levels to rise. A child narrowly avoids a soaking in Chiswick, West London yesterday . The Environment Agency issued more than 20 flood alerts over the weekend withs ome parts expected to have trouble until Monday . An hour later the same team rescued a couple by the tide on Towan Island, while four teenagers were plucked from chest-high water elsewhere. One Dorset coastguard officer said in his 24 years working for the service he had never seen the tide come back in so quickly. The four foreign teenagers, who didn't speak much English, called the emergency services panicking because they were lost and becoming cut off by a rising tide near Old Harry Rocks. Anne-Marie Clerk from Poole lifeboat said: 'The group didn't know the area and had carried on walking along the shore near Old Harry because the tide was extremely low. 'They raised the alarm sometime after 5pm when they realised they couldn't get back. 'They were under the cliff and there was loose rock behind them so they couldn't climb out and the water was up to their chests.

"Sam Rimmer, 19, sexually assaulted an 84-year-old woman at knife point and was jailed for 12 years . A teenager who sexually assaulted an 84-year-old woman at knifepoint in a brutal attack which left her with 44 separate injuries has been jailed for 12 years. Sam Rimmer, 19, climbed in through the window of the frail victim's home before launching the 'vicious' sex attack. The drunken intruder was armed with a large bread knife when he broke into her house in Greater Manchester on November 8 last year. The terrified woman became aware of a 'shadow in her room' moments before he sexually assaulted and tried to rape her, Manchester Crown Court was told. She fought back and grabbed the knife from the thug, dropping the weapon by the side of the bed. Rimmer, from Irlam, Greater Manchester, responded by punching the arthritis sufferer on the shoulder and forcing his fist into her mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying attack. But as she prayed out loud he 'suddenly came to his senses', apologised and fled before confessing to a friend. Prosecutor Phil Dobson told the court how the woman's mobility was badly affected by the attack. Because she now struggles to move her right arm, the pensioner has become reliant on her family and struggles to pay for carers to help with cooking, dressing and bathing. Despite sleepless nights, she has shown a 'spirited determination and forgiving attitude' in the wake of her terrible ordeal, Mr Dobson said. In a witness impact statement, the elderly woman said she had forgiven Rimmer for the shocking attack. 'I feel comfortable in the home I have had for 55 years and I will not let anyone force me out of my own home,' she said. 'Unfortunately I don't think I will ever be able to forget this incident, due to the physical problems I have and the upset it has caused not only me, but my family. 'I really struggle to understand why he has done this to me, however I have no ill feelings towards him and forgive him for what he has done. 'I'm a strong Catholic and feel sorry for him and his family. I hope he will turn his life around.' Rimmer forced his hand into the frail woman's mouth to silence her screams as he continued his horrifying sex attack, Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard . Hunter Gray, defending, argued that with no previous convictions, Rimmer should not be classed as a 'dangerous' offender. But judge Hilary Manley disagreed, saying that Rimmer attacked the victim with 'extreme force and viciousness'. She added: 'She tried to resist and fight you. You were a young man of 19, making yourself as fit as possible for entry into the Army. She was an 84-year-old who had to use sticks when she walked. 'She is clearly resilient and brave but these offences have had a profound impact on her life... she's not spent a night at home alone since this incident. This was a vicious and humiliating attack on a vulnerable and defenceless elderly woman, it must have been a terrifying experience for her. 'Had she not managed to disarm you it could have ended even more badly.' 'You cannot present a reason why you committed this offence - the lengthy and unnecessary violence causes the gravest concern.' Rimmer admitted attempted rape and sexual assault and was jailed for 12 years. He must spend an extra five years on licence and will not be released until the authorities are satisfied he is no longer dangerous.","Sam Rimmer sexually assaulted and tried to rape an 84-year-old woman .

"A man is accused of raping and assaulting three teenage girls while holding them captive at his remote Oklahoma home for months at a time over a two year period. Gregory Zavala, 23, of Tuttle is facing three counts of kidnapping, two counts of child sexual abuse, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and one count of rape in the first degree. He is also facing a separate charge of possession of child pornography in connection with photos investigators found on his phone. Scroll down for video . Gregory Zavala, 23, of Tuttle, Oklahoma, is accused of raping and assaulting three teenage girls while holding them captive at his remote home for months at a time over a two year period . Two of his victims were 16 and 17 at the time they were reportedly kidnapped. The third victim's age hasn't been disclosed, but officials say she was a minor at the time. Court documents detail how Zavala allegedly enticed the three women at different times between 2011 and 2013 to the remote home that he shares with his parents. The 16-year-old victim told police she was locked in his bedroom and held against her will between March 2011 and May 2011, reports NewsOK.com. She told police she was allegedly forced to have sexual relations with Zavala 'on an almost daily basis.' Scared for her life and feeling isolated, she described his home as 'in the middle of nowhere,' according to an affidavit. She became pregnant and then was somehow able to escape. Another woman was 17 when she was held captive from January to August 2012. Zavala is accused of holding the girls captive at his remote Tuttle, Oklahoma, home for months at a time between 2011 and 2013 . During that time, she was punched, strangled, hit with a metal bar and cut with a box knife. She, too, was sexually assaulted and became pregnant as a result, but was eventually able to escape. The third teenage victim began dating Zavala in October 2012. She was homeless at the time and had no family support, and he offered her a place to live. But shortly after she moved in, Zavala had her car towed, leaving her with no transportation. In one particularly violent assault, Zavala allegedly bashed the woman in the head with a hammer multiple times in December 2012, causing a permanent skull deformity. When she tried to run from him, he struck her again in the head with the hammer and in the abdomen with a metal bar. Zavala faces three counts of kidnapping, two counts of child sexual abuse, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and one count of rape in the first degree . 'Zavala told (her) no one would miss her when she was dead, because no one was looking for her,' the affidavit states. The woman told investigators Zavala raped her nearly every day, court records show. Zavala allegedly used a belt on occasion to strangle her during the attacks, causing her to lose consciousness. All three victims alleged that Zavala threatened to kill them and their families if they ever left his house. Zavala has a preliminary hearing date set for June 9 and his parents are also under investigation. He is being held in the Grady County jail on a $2 million bail. A judge has ordered that if he were to post bail he is not have contact with anyone under the age of 18.","Gregory Zavala, 23, is accused of raping and assaulting three teenage girls .

"The man who became an internet sensation after he badly missed a $1million halfcourt shot has revealed he came up short because his strength is gone due to a rare disorder that caused five of his organs to fail. Scott Park took, and missed, the halfcourt shot on Friday during halftime of the ACC Tournament semifinal between Notre Dame and Duke. A Vine capturing his failed attempt quickly began spreading on the internet. It has been viewed more than 7.6 million times, although there is no way to know how many mean comments have been made. Scott Park, 56, took a halfcourt shot at halftime of the ACC semifinal game between Notre Dame and Duke . His attempt fell badly short of the mark and a Vine capturing the moment began spreading on the web . Park, 56, knew the ball wasn't going in when he shot it because serious medical problems have sapped his strength, but he still wanted to give it a try, according to the Sporting News. Those who laughed shouldn't  feel too badly, though. The Navy environmental engineer doesn't have a problem with all the attention the shot has gotten. He said: 'I'm happy to be alive. I'm happy to even have a chance to shoot for a million dollars. 'I had no illusions that ball was going in.' In 2007, Park had open heart surgery and was forced to go back to the hospital two days later because something was wrong. Doctors couldn't figure out why, but Park's kidney, liver, spleen, gallbladder and pancreas were shutting down. Things got so bad that one of Park's doctors began preparing his wife Ellen for his death. Park's wife Ellen was at the game. He has a blood disorder called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome . Patients with CAPS like Park have a 48 per cent mortality rate, primarily due to sudden cardiac arrest . After a last-ditch effort, all of Park's organs, except his kidney, began to respond and he was eventually diagnosed with a blood disorder called catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). The rare disorder has only been diagnosed about 400 times. The syndrome is 'a rapidly progressive life-threatening disease that causes multiple organ thromboses and dysfunction in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies', according to the Journal of Intensive Care Medicine. Patients with CAPS have a 48 per cent mortality rate, primarily due to sudden cardiac arrest. Park had two years of dialysis but was able to get a kidney transplant from someone who goes to his church. He survived becoming the first person in the world with CAPS to have successful transplant surgery of any kind. The medical miracle, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia, now must take 39 pills each day and get an injection of an experimental drug once every two weeks, but he's healthy. All of that explains why the joke really wasn't on Park at all. He said: 'The Lord has blessed me probably as much or more than a lot of people. 'I feel that every day. 'God has been a power in my life, and he keeps giving me miracles every day.'","Scott Park shot at halftime of ACC semifinal between Notre Dame and Duke .

"British tourists are today warned to beware migrants trying to stow away in their cars or caravans amid a ‘crisis’ at Calais. An investigation by MPs found illegal immigrants heading for Britain are making it across the entire EU without a single border check. Ahead of the Easter getaway, the situation has become so severe lorries are being told not to stop within 125 miles of the port for fear of people trying to clamber aboard. MPs say that, as a result of greater lorry security, cars and motor homes are a prime target. Scroll down for video . Warning: As a result of greater lorry security, cars and motor homes are a prime target for illegal immigrants in Calais who are trying to enter the UK . In a report published today, the Commons home affairs committee says migrants trying to reach the ‘El Dorado’ of Britain are being caught at a rate of 100 a day.At the same time, the number gathering in squalid camps around Calais has almost doubled to 2,500 in the space of a few months. The committee found evidence of migrants who arrived in the EU via Turkey or Italy making their way to Calais without ‘encountering any border controls’. Its report, titled ‘Migration failures lead to a crisis in Calais’, blamed the Schengen Agreement allowing EU citizens to travel from one member state to another without passport checks. The UK opts out of the agreement, which Margaret Thatcher refused to sign 30 years ago to sneers from fellow European leaders. But even the French authorities have now declared Schengen a ‘failure’. Borders allowing access to the EU are not being properly policed, allowing tens of thousands of people from the likes of Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Syria to flood in via Italy, Greece and Turkey. Retired bank manager Sue Taber, 59. came through the Channel Tunnel without realising there was a stowaway illegal immigrant in the back of her car . Fabrice Leggeri, the executive director of European border agency Frontex, has warned that Libya alone has up to a million potential migrants ready to leave for the EU. The number massed at Calais has almost doubled since September from 1,300 to 2,500. Sir Charles Montgomery, director-general of the Home Office’s Border Force, said staff detected 30,180 attempts to enter the UK in the ten months to the end of January. This compared to 18,000 in the entire preceding year. Yet when caught, the migrants were handed over to the French who simply let them go. The MPs say: ‘We find it bizarre that there are thousands of attempts to enter the UK illegally through Calais, at great cost and inconvenience to business and leisure travellers, transport companies, and hauliers, and yet the people who are caught are simply released back into the French countryside.’ The Government is helping to fund more security fences around Calais. When she found an illegal immigrant hiding in the back seat of her Fiat Panda after driving home from France, Sue Taber couldn’t believe her eyes. Miss Taber thinks the man sneaked into her car when she left it briefly unlocked at Calais in September last year. Discovering him upon arrival in Kent, Miss Taber told the man ‘in no uncertain terms’ to ‘get lost’. She said at the time: ‘I’ve got a Fiat Panda for goodness sake, with two dogs in the back. 'And I’ve managed to get though passport control and everything else with a stowaway on board.’ But the report says there are fears that as security around freight traffic increases, migrants ‘will adapt to hiding in a wider variety of vehicles, including private cars or caravans’. The home affairs committee warns: ‘Schengen was intended to allow free movement, but not the free movement of illegal migrants. It was based on the assumption that the external border would be secure.’ Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The crisis in Calais is a direct result of the soft EU external border in the Southern Mediterranean and the Greek-Turkish border.’ The MPs also cast doubt on the Home Office’s ability to carry out new exit checks on everybody leaving the country from April 8. Ferry operators have warned the measure could create travel chaos for passengers and long queues. The MPs said they expected ministers to agree a series of exemptions – such as not checking the passports of British tourists leaving by coach. A Home Office spokesman said it had committed £12million to help reinforce security at Calais, ‘including installing security fencing and improving the flow of traffic to reduce the risk of queuing vehicles being targeted by migrants’.","Immigrants make it across the entire EU without a single border check .

"Virgin Australia are under fire for forcing a woman and her baby off a flight after she refused to stop breastfeeding during take-off. The mother was horrified after she and her baby were left stranded at Gold Coast Airport after their plane turned around on the runway, delivering her to federal and local police who had been alerted by the airline. Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out to the runway on Gold Coast airport. Scroll down for video . Virginie Rutgers was forced off a flight with her son after she refused to stop breastfeeding during take-off . Virgin Australia are being questioned on social media for their decision to turn their plane around to take a woman and her baby back to the terminal, where she was questioned by police . Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out from Gold Coast airport . She used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy, but was told to remove it by Virgin Australia staff. ‘He (the flight attendant) started to raise his voice and become quite abusive,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News. A woman who alleges she witnessed the incident from a couple of seats away has come forward, describing the ‘shocking’ incident on the Virgin Australia Facebook page. Laureen Fairweather insists the mother and child were sitting in separate seats, with the infant using the appropriate regulation seatbelt while he was being fed. ‘The child was not restrained with the carrier at all! They both had their seat belts on. She was covering herself with the carrier while nursing.’ Ms Fairweather wrote. Virginie used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy whilst they were reportedly both buckled in different seats, but she was told to remove the blanket by Virgin Australia staff . The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff . ‘She showed (the staff) too but they insisted it had to go.’ Ms Fairweather was shaken by the staff’s conduct during the confrontation. ‘Having witnessed the whole event, I can honestly guarantee you that it was not a pretty scene.’ ‘(Ms Rutgers) did comply with the rule by restraining herself and the child.’ ‘Absolutely gobsmacked at how rude and offensive the staffs were - totally unprofessional (Sic),’ she wrote. The mother claims staff did not explain why covering her child’s head with a sling was a hazard. Ms Rutgers continued feeding her child and was subsequently forced off the plane. ‘I was in a state of shock honestly. He (her son) was screaming because I couldn’t feed him any more,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News. Ms Rutgers continued feeding her child and was subsequently forced off the plane. She was 'shocked' and her son was screaming when she was unable to finish his feed . Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast airport . The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff. Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast Airport. Virgin Australia has refused to compensate her for the cost of her hotel that evening or for her taxis. But the airlines denies allegations of discrimination against the mother and said her breastfeeding had nothing to do with decision to remove her from the flight, according to Seven News. 'Our crew acted in accordance with Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations and, most importantly, with your child's safety at the forefront of their actions,' Virgin said. People aware of Ms Rutger’s experience have taken to Virgin Australia’s Facebook page. ‘Utterly pathetic sevice virgin! I fly frequently and will make sure i NEVER fly with you again. I do not want to get kicked off a plan for breastfeeding my child,’ wrote one former customer. ‘Breast feeding is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child,' a supporter wrote on the Virgin Australia Facebook page . ‘(Breast feeding) is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child. Never ever will I fly virgin,’ another declared. Representatives from the airline have responded to accusations regarding the case. ‘We can assure you that Virgin Australia welcomes breastfeeding on board our aircraft, as outlined in our policy,’ they replied to a Facebook post regarding the incident. ‘The safety of our guests is always our number one priority and there are a number of CASA regulations that must be followed on board to safeguard this, including ones that apply specifically to infants.’ ‘For privacy reasons, we cannot comment publicly on specific cases.’ We can assure you that Virgin Australia welcomes breastfeeding on board our aircrafts, as outlined in our policy,’ Virgin Australia said . Ms Rutger has vowed to never fly with Virgin again. She and her baby took a Qantas flight the following day . However other people on Facebook have sided with Virgin Australia, pointing out their responsibility to adhere to strict safety protocols. ‘I think anyone with any sense would realize the issue here. Safety comes first. Breastfeeding is a right all mothers should have, but that right shouldn't take precedence over safety,’ argued one person. ‘I am sure that the staff had their reasons for asking her to remove the carrier, it may have been a projectile or strangulation risk in the event of a difficult take off,’ wrote another. ‘I wasn't there so I can't comment on how it was handled but I do think you have to trust the staff when it comes to safety requirements and requests.’ Virgin Australia have offered Ms Rutger flight credit to make up for the additional costs she accrued when she was kicked off her flight.

"One person is dead and another being treated for life-threatening injuries after a bluff at the end of a popular hiking trail at Point Reyes National Seashore collapsed. The two visitors were standing on the Arch Rock lookout point just before 6 p.m. on Saturday when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet, winding up covered with rocks and debris. Collapse: A bluff collapsed at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, killing one hiker and leaving a second with life-threatening injuries . The National Park Service had posted signs at the site two days earlier warning hikers that a fissure along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened the cliff and that walking along the edge was dangerous. The park did not close the trail and in spite of the warnings, one hiker who visited the park that day told the San Francisco Chronicle she had seen dozens of people walking in the area that day. 'It was clear no one should be on that rock with the huge fissure,' Karen Blasing said. 'We stayed back, but many others were unconcerned and dangerously taking chances.' KBCW reports that other park-goers scrambled to assist before officials from Marin County fire, sheriff, and Park Rangers arrived to rescue the pair. A Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office carried the pair to the trailhead, where a medical chopper was waiting. One of the hikers was pronounced dead at the scene. The other was airlifted to a hospital. They have not been identified. After the fall, the trail was closed entirely, with the National Park Service posted a message to their website.

"Shaker Aamer with two of his children. He has been incarcerated in Guantanamo Bay for 13 years without charge or trial . MPs will make a blistering attack today on the US for failing to hand over Guantanamo Bay inmate Shaker Aamer to Britain. Politicians from all main parties will raise the scandal of the 48-year-old continuing to languish in the prison camp. Mr Aamer, a father of four, has been incarcerated in the naval facility in Cuba for 13 years without charge or trial. His supporters in Parliament will use a backbench debate to renew pressure on the White House to keep the promise to free the terror suspect, who lived in South London with his wife and children. MPs will also question whether the US authorities secretly negotiated to send him to Saudi Arabia to face possible torture – despite repeatedly telling the Government he would be sent back to Britain. Meanwhile, Amnesty International will hand a 32,000-signature petition to Downing Street calling for him to be freed. Saudi-born Mr Aamer is the longest-serving UK resident in Guantanamo and has twice been cleared for release, by the Bush administration in 2007 and by Barack Obama in 2009. But redacted documents released under Freedom of Information requests show US officials continued to hold top-level meetings with Saudi ministers which indicate they were discussing sending him to the Arab kingdom instead. One file reveals that less than two months after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told then Foreign Secretary William Hague in August 2010 that she ‘welcomed... discussing Mr Aamer’s case’, the US sent an ‘action request’ to its embassy in Riyadh on the subject of ‘engaging Saudi Arabia on Shaker Aamer’. Another document reveals a meeting in Jeddah in August 2013 between high-ranking US officials and the Saudi interior minister in which Mr Aamer was described as a ‘Saudi citizen with significant ties to the UK’. The current impasse is embarrassing for David Cameron, who said Mr Obama had vowed to ‘prioritise’ the detainee’s release after White House talks in January. Saudi-born Mr Aamer is the longest-serving UK resident in Guantanamo and has twice been cleared for release, by the Bush administration in 2007 and by Barack Obama in 2009 . David Davis, the Tory ex-minister who will speak in today’s debate, said: ‘The intention is to put more pressure on America to keep the promise it made to Britain. The senior half of the US administration is saying there is no evidence against Shaker and that he must be released, yet the other half is putting obstacles in the way.’ Cori Crider, a director of legal charity Reprieve and Mr Aamer’s lawyer, said: ‘It is a scandal that he continues to languish in Guantanamo. ‘Bland reassurances that the Obama administration is prioritising his case are no longer enough. We need a concrete timetable for his return home, and we must see answers on why this didn’t happen years ago. 'For a start, we need to know what happened in secret meetings between the UK and US, and the US and Saudi Arabia – are these indications of an attempt to silence him by handing him over to the Saudi regime?’ A U.S. Military police officer provides water to chained detainees as they arrive at Camp X-Ray in 2002 . Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001 he was detained in Kabul while carrying out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity, his representatives claim. He was handed to the US military for $5,000 and tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison. US intelligence insisted he financed Al Qaeda and was a key aide of Osama Bin Laden, a claim he vehemently denied. He was sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002. Despite being cleared for release, US officials are determined he will be sent to Saudi Arabia, even though there are serious concerns he will face torture. Mr Aamer’s lawyers allege the intention is to silence their client, who claims to have witnessed abuse in the presence of a British security official.","Shaker Aamer has been in Guantanamo Bay for 13 years without charge .

"A whale that swam hundreds of miles up an African river after taking a wrong turn 17 million years ago is helping shed light on a key moment in human evolution. Palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the ancient ancestor to modern beaked whales in the middle of one of the harshest desert areas of Turkana, Kenya. It has allowed scientists to pinpoint when the landscape in east Africa began to change as the land around the Great Rift Valley began to rise up. This 17 million-year-old fossil shown in the photograph above is from a whale found far inland in Kenya and has shed light on when east Africa's tectonic uplift that drastically altered the climate in the area first began . This was a crucial moment in human evolution from primates as it created the dry open habitats that led our ape-like ancestors to walk upright for the first time. They say that for the whale to have travelled so far inland in a river the area must have been much wetter, far flatter and dominated by forests. It is probably one of the most peculiar aspects of human biology - that females of a certain age lose the ability to reproduce. But scientists have discovered that killer whales - a species separated from humans by almost 94 million years of evolution - also suffer from the menopause. The finding could provide clues as to why the menopause evolved in the first place. The evolution of a trait that reduces the reproductive capability of a species has long baffled biologists and there are a number of theories for why it emerged in humans. Now a team of researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of York may have unraveled the reason for the menopause - in killer whales at least. They have found that it frees up the older, more experienced females to lead their families in the search for food and so boost the ability of the entire group to survive. The findings may now also help to explain why the menopause emerged in human populations - it allowed older women to impart their knowledge and help care for the younger members. Professor Louis Jacobs, a vertebrate palaeontologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas who led the study, said: 'The whale was stranded up river at a time when east Africa was at sea level and was covered with forest and jungle. 'As that part of the continent rose up, that caused the climate to become drier and drier. So over millions of years, forest gave way to grasslands. 'Primates evolved to adapt to grasslands and dry country. And that's when - in human evolution - the primates started to walk upright.' The whale fossil was first discovered in Loperot, west Turkana, Kenya in 1964 by palaeontologist James Mead, a curator at the Smithsonian Instution at the time. It was initially mistakenly identified as a turtle fossil but later identified as a whale in 1975. He named it Turkana ziphiid - a type of beaked whale that is related to modern marine mammals like the Baird and Cuvier's beaked whales - and estimated it had been 22ft (6.7 metres) long. Ziphiids are among the deepest diving mammals on the planet, plunging to nearly 10,000 feet (3,050 metres) in the ocean to feed on squid. The whale fossil was discovered nearly 459 miles (740km) inland and 2,000 feet (620 metres) above sea level. For it to have ended up there, the landscape at the time  must have looked very different. Palaeontologists found the remains of fish, crocodiles, turtles and mammals including primates, suggesting the area was dominated by a river and surrounded by a forest habitat. The fossil of the whale's beak (above), was found in 1964, and is thought to belong to an extinct species that became stranded in an ancient river after taking a wrong turn while swimming down the coast of east Africa . The fossil was found in an area of desert at Loperot in west Turkana, in Kenya, on the site of an ancient river . However, the whale fossil disappeared in 1979 and was only rediscovered in 2011 at Harvard University after Professor Jacobs asked curators to search for it. Professor Jacobs and his colleagues, whose work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, have now re-examined the specimen and claim the whale has provided a definitive date for when the geological changes in East Africa began. Determining ancient land elevation is notoriously difficult, but the whale has provided new clues. The area of Turkana in Kenya where the fossil was found (above) is now a desert, but was a forest 17 million years ago when the whale is thought to have taken a wrong turn and swam hundreds of miles up a river . Professor Jacobs said for the whale to end up where it did, it must have swam far inland up the ancient Anza River with a low gradient ranging from 78 feet (24m) to 121 feet (37m) over 372 miles (600km) to 559 miles (900km). This suggests the landscape was very flat and close to sea level. Professor Jacobs and his colleagues believe the whale may have been migrating along the east African coast and mistakenly entered the mouth of the river. Once it began swimming up the river it could not change its course. James Mead shown above excavating the whale fossil in the 'Open Pit Turtle Mine' in Loperot, Kenya, in 1964 . The fossil was originally recorded as a large turtle in expedition log books but later it was found to be a whale. Scientists also discovered fossils of many other species including crocodiles and primates at the same site . There are some modern examples of whales making similar mistakes such as the sperm whale that swam up the Thames towards London, and other whales what have become stranded in the Sacramento River in California and the Amazon in Brazil. Professor Jacobs said: 'You don't usually find whales so far inland. Many of the known beaked whale fossils are dredged by fishermen from the bottom of the sea.' Estimates for exactly when human ancestors began walking on two feet instead of four are varied and controversial. Some claim that a six-million-year-old species called Sahelanthropus was the first to become bipedal while others point to the four-million-year-old Australopithecus anamensis. However, the latest study has now provided clues as to when the landscape in the part of Africa where these ancestors are thought to have taken their first bipedal steps began to change. Dr Henry Wichura, the lead author of the study an a palaeontologist at the University of Postdam in Germany, said: 'Surface uplift from near sea level coincides with paleoclimatic change from a humid environment to highly variable and much drier conditions, which altered biotic communities and drove evolution in east Africa, including that of primates.' The whale fossil  belongs to an ancestor of modern beaked whales like the Blainville's beaked whale pictured .","Fossil of beaked whale was discovered in desert of west Turkana in Kenya .

"A California woman was out walking her dog in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday when she was attacked by a man wielding a medieval-style weapon. Travis Lanning, 34, was arrested at the scene in Sacramento County and charged with assault with a deadly weapon and mayhem. The victim, an unnamed woman in her 50s, was taken to a hospital with non life-threatening injuries to her head. Scroll down for video . Medieval mayhem: Travis Lanning, 34, pictured left in a mugshot and right in a photo from his Facebook page holding a mace, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly beating a woman with the medieval weapon . Crime scene: The brazen attack took place along Garfield Avenue in the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning . Weapon of choice: Deputies on the scene recovered the spiky club allegedly used in the assault . A Sacramento sheriff's deputy was patrolling Garfield Avenue at 4.15am when he heard screams and came upon a suspect beating a woman with a mace - a spiked metal club used to bludgeon opponets in medieval combat. According to the sheriff's office, Travis Lanning approached his victim from behind with the words: 'I'm going to kill you.' He then allegedly proceeded to strike her over the head with the heavy mace, puncturing her skull. She is expected to make a full recovery. The victim initially told officials that Lanning also killed her dog, a dachshund mix, with the mace, but the pet was later found unharmed. Witness Lisa French told CBS Sacramento the woman was 'bleeding all over' after the vicious cudgel attack. French also described the moment sheriff’s deputies apprehended Lanning, who kept mum and refused to cooperate, forcing them to carry him into an awaiting squad car. Pet: The victim initially told officials Lanning had killed her dog, but the dachshund mix (pictured) was later found unharmed . Following his arrest, Lanning was photographed for his mugshot with blood on his forehead and nose. It is unclear if he sustained injuries in the melee, or whether the blood came from his victim’s wounds. Travis Lanning is being held on $80,000 bail. He is expected to undergo a mental health evaluation and be tested for drugs and alcohol. Neighbors claimed the 34-year-old suffers from bipolar disorder and has been known in the past to go off his medication, reported the news channel KCRA. Last month, Lanning lost his mother, Leslie Lanning, to pneumonia. Two weeks ago, he shared photos on his Facebook page showing him posing with a silver mace, which looked identical to the weapon recovered by police from the scene of the brazen early-morning attack. Troubled: Neighbors said the 34-year-old suspect suffers from bipolar disorder and has been known to go off his medication . Grieving son: Last month, Lanning lost his mother, Leslie (left) to pneumonia . His social media posts suggest that Lanning has a strong interest in fantasy and Eastern legends, and in February he released what he described as an ‘epic poem’ about the fictional ‘grandmaster monk’ Ten Po. He also self-published a book of poetry titled Tenebrous Yearning, which to his chagrin has not sold a single copy in three years.","Travis Lanning, 34, from Sacramento, charged with assault with a deadly weapon and mayhem .

"A prototype of the highly-anticipated Tesla Model X has apparently been seen cruising around California. A video by Youtuber ‘nbkagzw13’ claims to show the pure electric vehicle, slightly covered to hide design features, on the road near Palo Alto. It comes as Tesla confirmed to Dailymail.com the new model will include autosteering and self parking capabilities announced by Elon Musk last week. Scroll down for video . A prototype of the highly-anticipated Tesla Model X has apparently been seen cruising around California. A video by Youtuber ‘nbkagzw13’ claims to show the pure electric vehicle, slightly covered to hide design features, on the road near Palo Alto . The concealment hides its grille, headlights, rear window and taillights, but the car is otherwise undisguised. Tesla first unveiled the Model X in 2012 with the original prediction of having the luxury crossover ready for sale in 2013. But the launch date has been pushed back several times, and the Tesla website currently states that it should be ready in 2016. However, a number of reports suggest the sighting of this test vehicle could mean the Model X will hit dealerships as early as this year. And this isn’t the first time the Model X has been spotted on the roads by Tesla enthusiasts. The concealment hides its grille, headlights, rear window and taillights, but the car is otherwise undisguised. A number of reports suggest the sighting of this test vehicle could mean the Model X will hit dealerships as early as this year . Electric vehicles are a useful tool for fighting city summers, according to a new study. Switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug-in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island, it said. The term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth, stored during the day in roads and buildings, which is released at night. The researcher's simulation was based on the weather in the Chinese capital in the summer of 2012, when the city was three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the surrounding countryside. Switching vehicles to electric would have caused this to fall by 0.94 C (1.7 F), according to their model. 'Heatwaves kill, and in terms of climate change, even one degree can make a difference,' said Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University, who took part in the study. Earlier this year, a video emerged of the Model X doing handling, braking and acceleration in a private lot. The Model X is expected to weigh around 10 per cent more than the Model S, but will share 60 per cent of its parts. Tesla claims the performance model will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in about 4.4 seconds. Last week, the California-based company revealed two key software updates for the Tesla model S sedan and the Model X that he claims will end 'range anxiety'. The first is a 'range assurance' app that communicates with Tesla's Supercharger network, warning drivers if they are about to run out of power, and pointing them to the nearest Supercharger. The second is a trip planner, which will combine the Supercharger network with the network of Model S cars to improve long-distance journeys for drivers. Other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the Model S, which should be available in the next three months. The technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel, acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway. In the future, the company will also give driver's the ability to summon their car to any location.","A video shows electric car slightly covered to hide its design features .

"Polar bears are suffering potentially harmful changes to their brains due to the accumulation of pollution in the arctic, according to a new study. Scientists have found that key processes in the brains of polar bears are being disrupted by man-made chemicals such as stain repellents and water-proofing treatments. They claim this could result in changes to polar bear behaviour and hormone balance that may ultimately affect their ability to survive. As an apex predator, pollutants in the food of polar bears, like the one above, can accumulate in their tissues . The pollutants, known as perfluoroalkly compounds, accumulate in specific areas of polar bears' brains over years of eating contaminated food. The chemicals get into the oceans from run-off from landfill and gradually filter up through the food chain, buidling up in the largest predators. A team of scientists have recently reported that chemical pollutants accumulating in the Arctic may be reducing the density of the bones in the penises of male polar bears. The researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark found that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are associated with a less dense penile bone. They have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens, which include PCBs, in their bodies, have smaller than average penis bones and testes. Organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine, and are used as solvents and pesticides, as well as in the making of dyes and drugs. PCBs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s, but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer. The researchers warn that the presence of such chemicals, which tend to accumulate over time in the bodies of top predators from the prey they eat, may have disastrous consequences for polar bear mating. As polar bears are the apex predator in the Arctic, they build up relatively high concentrations of these chemicals. The researchers found that areas of polar bears' brains where levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were highest also had disrupted levels of enzyme activity. However, the exact effect the pollution is having on bear behaviour has still to be explored. Katherine Eggers Pedersen, a toxicologist at the University of Copenhagen who led the research, said: Although PFASs have been increasing in the Arctic, and in particular in East Greenland polar bears, over the past three decades, several of the most dominant PFASs have started to decline around 2007. 'However relatively high levels have recently been found in polar bear brains . 'Results from our study support the hypothesis that PFAS concentrations in polar bears from East Greenland have exceeded the threshold limits for neurochemical alterations. 'Given the importance of these systems in cognitive process and motor function, the present results indicate an urgent need for a better understanding of neurochemical effects of PFAS exposure to wildlife.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Environmental Research, examined the brains of nine polar bears that had been killed by hunters in East Greenland. They then measured the levels of PFASs in different regions of the brain and compared them to levels of enzyme activity there. Researchers found pollutants were associated with lower levels of neurotransmitters in polar bear brain tissue . The highest levels of PFAS were highest in the brain stem, which controls vital life functions, and the cerebellum, which is responsble for coordinating movement and balance. They found that in particular perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which is as a strain repellent treatment for fabrics, and perfluorinated carboxylic acid, which are used to make non-stick coatings, were associated with changes to key neurotransmitters in the bear's brains. These neurotransmitters are known to be important for behaviour, learning and memory. Professor Bjarne Styrishave, another scienitist at the University of Copenhagen who was also involved in the study, told Science Nordic: 'We don't know whether the disruption of enzymes and signal substances is enough to have an effect on the polar bears' senses and behaviour. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the chemical structure of which is shown above, was widely used as a stain repellent and protector for fabrics but has been found to accumulate within the bodies of top marine predators . 'The brain is plastic and may adapt itself and compensate for the damage to a certain extent. 'It's difficult to say whether we are a long way from the limit, or very close to it. 'It’s the fundamental processes vital to being a bear that can potentially be disturbed by the substances.' It is not the first time pollution has been found to be taking a toll on polar bears. Last year researchers warned that the accumulation of  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may be causing the penis bones of male polar bears to become weaker. Climate scientists have also warned that as the habitat used by the predators changes due to climate change, the animals will face increasing challenges to their survival. Scientists recently warned that a a quarter of Canadian polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps. Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food. Biologists from the University of Alberta believe that as summers get warmer in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - islands off the North American continent and Greenland – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year. Scientists have warned that a quarter of Canadian polar bears (pictured) could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps. Warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear’s habitat, affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food and mate . This means that by 2100, each polar bear population in the Archipelago may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea, which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate. Projected global warming would adversely affect one tenth of their habitat, which is being damaged by man-made pollution, according to the study. It found that sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering the physical characteristics of marine ecosystems . The study, published in Plos One, used sea ice projections from 2006 to 2100 to gain an insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears.

"Hillary Clinton, attempting to quiet concerns about the security of her private email system, said Tuesday she never discussed classified information over email. And if hackers tried to obtain copies of her  communications, they couldn't have, Clinton said, because she had 'numerous safeguards' in place to protect her home-brewed server. 'It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,' Clinton said at a press conference. Security experts remain doubtful, however, that Clinton's emails contained only unclassified information and warn that her email or server could have been hacked without her knowledge - possibly exposing sensitive communications between the former secretary of state and the president. Scroll down for video . If hackers tried to obtain copies of her sensitive, State Department communications, they couldn't have, Hillary Clinton told reporters Tuesday, because she had 'numerous safeguards' in place to protect her home-brewed server . 'To say it wasn’t compromised is to say, ""I don’t know it was compromised,"" ' Stewart Baker, an assistant secretary at the the Department of Homeland Security during George W. Bush's presidency told Politico. 'It would be pretty easy for a nation-state to compromise that account, and pretty easy to hide the fact that they had compromised that account,' he said. The White House acknowledged on Monday that Clinton and Obama did email each other from time to time. 'I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. The National Security Agency technician who was in charge of the team that built President Barack Obama’s specialized Blackberry, Dickie George, said it's unlikely the president ever said anything to Clinton over email that could be seen as damaging if exposed. 'He’s actually very security conscious … There’s no, absolutely no, chance that he put anything sensitive in those emails, ' George told Politico. Still, Bruce Brody, a former chief information security officer at the Department of Energy who is now oversee secuirty at Cubic Global Defense, cautioned that even the most innocent of conversations between Clinton and Obama could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands. 'There’s more intelligence in casual conversation than you might think, just because he’s the president of the damned United States,' Baker told the publication. A Q and A document sent to reporters by Clinton's staff after the former State Department official's Tuesday afternoon briefing with the press asserted that 'robust protections were put in place' by the secretary and updated as needed. Yet it did not say what those were, citing concerns that 'people with ill-intentions' would attempt to break into her security system, which Clinton says was set up her husband, Bill, a former president, and guards the private communications of both him and his aides. The nine-page document disclosed, however, that  third-party experts were consulted. It did not name names. Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union told Politico that unless Clinton 'was paying a team of people to keep her personal email secure, it’s likely it was less secure,' however. The State Department, he pointed out, has a full-time security team and the National Security Administration at its disposal. 'It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,' Clinton said at a press conference . South Carolina Republican Rep.Trey Gowdy, head of the task force that' s investigating the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack to determine what knowledge the State Department possessed - if any - that could have prevented the assault, said Tuesday afternoon that Clinton should be required to turn over the server for inspection. She also needs to answer lingering, 'serious questions 'about the security of the system she employed,' he said in a statement, and 'who had access to the server from the time Secretary Clinton left office until the time – almost two years later – the State Department asked for these public records back.' Gowdy also wants access to the server to determine if any of the more than 30,000 personal emails Clinton says she got rid of because they were not related to her work at the State Department can be retrieved. Clinton says gave the State Department copies of all her work-related emails, yet 'without access to Secretary Clinton's personal server, there is no way for the State Department to know it has acquired all documents that should be made public,' Gowdy said. The former Obama administration official said Tuesday the server will remain out of the government's grasp, however. 'No one wants their personal email made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,' she told reporters while explaining her decision to toss emails she didn't think were pertinent to national security. Should Clinton change her mind and give the government unfettered access to her private property Chester Wisniewski, senior security adviser at Canadian computer company Sophos, says its possible that anything she tried to destroy may still be on the server. 'If the emails were on a server in her house and she deleted them, there’s a chance the emails could still be on the server’s hard drive if you forensically examine it,' he told the New York Times. 'To make sure the emails are really destroyed, you would have to physically destroy the hard drive, which many companies and places like the Defense Department often do.' Reporters flooded the United Nation's headquarters on Tuesday to listen to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton answer questions about her use of a private email system while serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet. A Q and A document sent to reporters after the briefing asserted that 'robust protections were put in place' by Clinton and updated as needed . Another concern of government officials is that Clinton deliberated classified information via her personal email address, which is against the law. She says she didn't. 'Classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office,' the statement from her office distributed on Tuesday said. But a former senior State Department official who worked in the diplomatic core of the government before her told the New York Times that Clinton's claim is dubious. 'I would assume that more than 50 percent of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified,' he said. 'Was every single email of the secretary of state completely unclassified? Maybe, but it’s hard to imagine.' Even if Clinton did confer with her colleagues about classified topics over email, 'there’s zero chance that she’ll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information, because she decides what’s classified,' Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, told the Times. The secretary of state, he said, has the highest classification authority at the department and the power to dictate what is and isn't restricted.","'It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,' Clinton said at a press conference on Tuesday .

"An alleged fraudster who claimed to own half of Facebook has vanished from his home just weeks before his New York-based trial after ditching his ankle monitoring bracelet, his lawyer has said. Paul Ceglia, 41, of Wellsville, sued the social network's billionaire founder, Mark Zuckerberg, in 2010, claiming he had been promised a 50 per cent share in the business in exchange for start-up money. In 2012, he was charged with fraud after federal authorities said he had fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case against Zuckerberg, 30. He was due to go on trial on May 4. However, it has now emerged that Ceglia is missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet. 'I don’t know where he is,' his attorney, Robert Fogg, admitted. 'I haven’t got a clue.' Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Paul Ceglia (left), 41, who sued Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg (right), in 2010, has vanished from his home just weeks before his New York-based trial after ditching his ankle tracking bracelet, it has emerged . Speaking to Reuters, Fogg said Ceglia's tracking device had been found at his home, in New York's rural Allegany County, after the U.S. Marshals Service was dispatched to check on him on Sunday. He said he has not heard from Ceglia, adding that U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick has now  scheduled a court hearing for Tuesday that was 'most definitely spawned by the recent event'. Last April, Buffalo federal judge Richard Arcara officially closed the book on Ceglia's multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming half-ownership of Facebook, granting Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss it . The ruling affirmed a magistrate judge's recommendation from a year earlier, saying  the suit should be thrown out because the 2003 software development contract Ceglia had based it on was faked. Ceglia had claimed that he and Zuckerberg had signed a contract, 'The Face Book', that included a provision entitling him to half-ownership of Facebook in exchange for start-up money for the firm. At the time, Zuckerberg was a freshman at Harvard University. Although Facebook's lawyers agreed the pair had a contract, they said references to the social network were slipped in for the lawsuit. Missing: Ceglia (pictured), of Wellsville, was charged with fraud in 2012 after federal authorities said he had fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his 2010 lawsuit against 30-year-old Zuckerberg . Claims: Ceglia - who claimed he had been promised a 50 per cent share in Facebook (pictured) - was due to go on trial on May 4. However, he is now missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet . Zuckerberg had previously done some programming work for Ceglia's company, StreetFax.com. The lawyers argued that the the only valid contract between the pair related to that company. At the time of Ceglia's arrest, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the suspect - who also provided allegedly falsified emails - was seeking a 'quick payday based on a blatant forgery.' 'The contract is a cut-and-paste job, the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud,' attorneys for Mr Zuckerberg and his Palo Alto, California-based company added. 'Zuckerberg has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to Ceglia's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails.' Facebook CEO: Last April, Judge Richard Arcara officially closed the book on Ceglia's multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming half-ownership of Facebook, granting Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss it. Above, Zucerkberg is pictured speaking during a keynote session at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, last Monday . On Monday, Fogg said that Ceglia - who has pleaded not guilty - has 'always been concerned with justice'. 'He has always been concerned about if he'd get a fair trial,' the attorney added. Ceglia has twice  tried to get the charges  dropped. He is also appealing against the 2014 ruling. Ankle monitoring bracelets are typically fitted to individuals under house arrest or parole. At timed intervals, they send a radio frequency signal containing information, like location, to authorities. If an offender moves outside of a permitted range, the police will be notified. The devices are designed to be tamper-resistant - they are meant to alert authorities if  offenders remove them. November 22, 2003 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'I have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at Harvard that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours. If we don’t make a move soon, I think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them. 'I’ve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $1000 for the facebook (sic) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or Jeff to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them. Please give me a call so that we can talk more about this.' January 1, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'I think it is unnecessary at this point, with all of the extra work I have done for you, to be held to the original completion date. I should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control, namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the Streetfax project that you wanted to be placed as a priority, thereby delaying my start on our second project. 'Thus, I am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract.' January 5 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'It is well past January 1 and to my knowledge you don't have a single thing done for the site... You know perfectly well that you can't just take a person's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in Harvard. 'I've been stalled long enough on this thing and if I don't see something soon I'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in Dobbs Ferry and let them know what's going on.' February 2, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Paul, I have a rather serious issue to discuss with you, according to our contract I owe you over 30% more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80% of the company. 'First I want to say that I think that is completely unfair because I did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second I don’t even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty. 'Mostly though I just won’t even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage. I’d like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership.' February 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Sorry it’s taken me a few days to respond, (sic) Now that the sites (sic) live I feel I must take creative control and I just can not risk injuring my sites (sic) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk, nor do I wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni. The site is cool as it is and I don’t care about making any money on it right now, I just want to see if people will use it.' February 7, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Mark, all I can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and MONEY that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh I’ve changed my mind I don’t think it’s cool to make money and that that should be that.' April 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Paul, I have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it, so I am thinking of just taking the server down. My parents have a fund that I can tap into for my college expenses and I would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work. At this point I won’t even really be able to work on the facebook until Summer.' April 6, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Grow up, take a f***ing ethics class, choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours.' July 22, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia (A week before Facebook was incorporated) 'Paul, I am guessing that you don’t want to talk to me but I wanted to say happy birthday and that I hope to resolve our differences. I see that what I did was wrong and I am really sorry that I behaved as I did. Please give me your address and I will mail you back the $2000 for your trouble, more if it will repair our business relationship. 'Another summer is here and I still don’t have any time to build our site, I understand that I promised I would, but other things have come up and I am out in California working during break. I just don’t want the obligation of having to answer to you for not following through and I won’t be able to.

But this summer fans of the movie franchise will be whipped in to a further frenzy of excitement with the DVD release. Daily Mail Online has learned that producers are cutting an extra length version for its home movie launch packed with steamy unseen sex scenes. And for those fans who were left a little disappointed by the sex scenes shown on the big screen, the new takes are even kinkier. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Body heat: The two hour-five minute cinema version has roughly 20 minutes of on screen sex featuring leading stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson . More! Dornan and Johnson are seeking seven figure raises for Fifty Shades sequel . Dylan Neal, who plays Anastasia Steele's stepdad, confirmed extra scenes were shot and would be woven into the release, tentatively lined up for June . The two-hour five-minute cinema version has roughly 20 minutes of on-screen sex featuring leading stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who have both asked for seven-figure salary increases to do the sequel. However, director Sam Taylor Johnson shot at least 10 minutes more of raunchy lovemaking and S&M scenes, which will appear on a Director's Cut. The news, sure to have fans clambering to buy the DVD following the huge box office success, was revealed to Daily Mail Online by movie actor Dylan Neal. Dylan, who plays Anastasia Steele's step dad, confirmed extra scenes were shot and would be woven into the release, tentatively lined up for June. Speaking in LA, Dylan, 45, said: ""I would not be surprised if maybe there was some extras in the DVD release or the directors cut. 'When we were shooting it they were probably always aiming for an R (restricted) rating. 'But there was lots of stuff left in the editing room which would push it over into NC-17.' In the US Fifty Shades made an R rating meaning that under 17s can see the movie with a supervising adult. This NC-17 classification means that only those aged over 17 are allowed to view the content - and so would feature more explicit material. Dylan was blown away by the success of the movie - and says so were movie studio execs at Universal Pictures. 'It is just one of those phenomenons that happens every couple of years,' he said. 'You start off with this book series that succeeded and part of the reason it took off is because the book series was one of the first digital downloads. 'And you could read this book on the bus without anyone knowing, and it fed upon itself - and then everyone had to see what the buzz was about. 'Then of course the movie was a feeding frenzy and this type of hype only comes around once in a while. Hideous kinky: The Editor's Cut will feature ten more minutes of raunchy sex play . 'I think the studio is really relieved that it has done so  well. And no-one anticipated that it would do so well.' However, American actor Dylan, who starred in Arrow and featured in Dawson's Creek, was not upset to have missed out on the romps. 'I was okay with leaving it to Jamie and Dakota this time round,' he said. Fifty Shades Of Grey is a staggering financial success worldwide. It cost $40m to make, and has already earned more than $520m in revenue in less than a month. The DVD, home rental figures and future TV rights will swell that figure to a billion dollars. Punters saw seven total sex scenes, with three being in Christian Grey's Red Room. There was around 20 minutes of total sex in the movie with eight spankings and ten whippings of Anastasia.","Shady ladies have complained that the film Fifty Shades of Grey was lacking the heat that made the book a world-wide phenomenon .

"An obese father who was told to give up fast food or lose his kids by his fiancée because she feared he would eat himself to death has slimmed down to 16 stone. Michael Wareing, 40, from Glasgow, who wore a size XXXXXL, loved to eat kebabs with ‘all the trimmings’ at least once a day and spent £200 a month on takeaways. He gained 20 stone between 2005 and 2008, after having two children with his fiancée April Roy, 31, taking him to an unhealthy 30 stone. Michael Waring, 40 from Glasgow, weighed 30 stone, left, before getting a gastric sleeve fitted and losing an amazing 16 stone, pictured right . Mr Waring and Miss Roy now relish the time they can now spend together playing with the kids in the park . However, April said Michael’s weight gain meant he didn’t help out around the house or looking after Kieran-Lee, now 11, and Liam, nine, and became a ‘huge strain’ on their relationship, so she gave him an ultimatum. Mother-of-four April moved into a flat near the family home, but Michael continued to comfort eat – it was then he had gastric sleeve surgery and finally managed to ditch the pounds and win back his family. April said: ‘I was scared it was putting his life at risk and he’d miss our boys grow up. I told him I was moving me and the boys out. I didn’t want them to see him this way. ‘He had to pick the kebabs or his kids – keep gaining weight and lose us or diet and put his family first.’ In a bid to win back his family, Michael swapped fatty foods for salads, pasta and fish dishes and kept a food diary. Michael continued to see his sons every weekend, and April rang his mother Janet Wareing regularly to find out his progress. Thw family can all now enjoy days out together. Miss Roy says that the gastric sleeve surgery was a lifesaver: 'I couldn't be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.' Mr Wareing couldn't go out and play with his kids as he would be exhausted after five minutes . April said: ‘I didn’t want to call Michael too much in case he thought I was nagging him. ‘Janet told me he was eating healthy and going for walks but he was miserable. When I saw him, he said he was practically starving himself to lose weight for us. ‘But it wasn’t working and he confessed being alone upset him and he comfort ate.’ April said: ‘Janet had seen a TV show about weight loss surgery and thought it could help Michael.’ Michael - who has since had another son and a daughter with April - agreed to go to a Phoenix Health weight loss clinic where a consultant talked him through his options. In August 2010, two weeks after Michael’s consultation, he was fitted with a gastric sleeve. The couple started dating in 2003 when they were introduced through Mr Wareing’s brother. April revealed that when they had their son Kieren-Lee, Michael was a hands-on dad – but it all changed after he put on weight. Michael and his sons Liam & Kieren-Lee standing in his trousers he wore when he was fat . Michael pictured with his partner April and new born Kaevy-Anne in hospital . She said: ‘Michael was a great dad. He loved bath-times and putting the boys to bed. ‘He got up in the night when they woke up crying and rocked them back to sleep. ‘When Kieren-Lee was bigger, Michael played toy soldiers with him. He loved taking him to the swings or for walks on the beach.’ But in 2005, Mr Wareing became a different person. April said: ‘He was more reserved and didn’t want to talk about his feelings. I imagined he was missing his other three kids who lived with their mums. ‘So he comfort ate crisps and chocolate. His favourite takeaway was kebabs with all the trimmings.’ A year later, the couple had their second son Liam, now nine. Michael gained so much weight he struggled to help around the couple’s house and look after their children. Michael said: ‘I got upset that I couldn’t go out with them and I was how I was. It was unfair on the kids.’ Michael with his children pictured outside a takeaway - which was his weakness before losing weight . Mid-way through his weight loss, Mr Wareing was already showing signs of a dramatic change . April said: ‘He wasn’t 11 stone anymore. He couldn’t come for walks to the park with us. After five minutes, he’d be exhausted and say his knees hurt. ‘All he could do with our sons was watch TV. I told him I was worried about his weight but it didn’t work.’ By 2008, Mr Wareing had gained 20 stone and wore XXXXXL jeans. April said: ‘It put a huge strain on our relationship but he didn’t talk about his weight. I had to get him to change his ways.’ In summer 2008 Miss Roy gave him an ultimatum. She said: ‘He had to pick the kebabs or his kids. “He was upset but we’d talked about his weight before so I knew he understood I was doing it for all of us. I said I loved him but I’d had enough.’ Abandoned by his family, it was the push Michael needed. The gastric sleeve procedure meant he could only eat small portions or liquids like soup. April said: ‘He said his lunch looked like baby food, but it worked.’ Soon Michael was swapping his old clothes for new, smaller-sized tops and trousers. As the pounds disappeared Mr Wareing found that he could go and and play with his kids like he used to . Michael on the swing, playing with his family in the park . She said: ‘He had the energy to run around the park and play football with them. We got on better and four months later, got back together.’ In December 2010, April fell pregnant again and was able to wear Michael’s old clothes as maternity wear when she was six months pregnant. In August 2011, Michael – who by now had lost 16 stone – had a gastric bypass to help him lose more weight. Kieren-Lee and Liam could now stand up in their father’s jeans, one in each leg. April said: ‘They were so big they called them Daddy’s Tents.’ In September 2011, the couple’s daughter, Kaevyanne, was born and in October Michael proposed. Michael now works as a kitchen porter in a takeaway. April said: ‘Michael can still eat kebabs but they need to be much smaller and the meat has to be dry, not greasy or fatty.’ In December 2014, Miss Roy gave birth to the couple’s third son Arran and are now planning their wedding. Mr Wareing is now more involved in his bringing up the children. He said: ‘I have a lot more energy now so I can go out and play with the kids. I take the dog out. I walk everywhere. ‘I’m a lot happier and feel more confident. April and my mum gave me a boost, and losing weight changed my life. Now I look back and think, why did I let myself go?’ Miss Roy cannot believe the life-changing results of the operation. Miss Roy said: ‘I’m so proud of Michael and couldn’t be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.’","Michael Wareing weighed  30 stone and struggled to leave the house .

"A naked man who claimed he was 'from a family of sasquatch' has been jailed for ten years after attacking an armed hunter in the woods. Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting for deer near his home in Manning, Oregon, when he saw Linus Norgren wearing what appeared to be 'tan clothing'. But when he got closer, Mr McDonald, who was carrying a high-powered rifle, realized that 22-year-old Norgren was in fact naked. Jailed: Linus Norgren, 22, was sentenced to 10 years in prison Tuesday for attacking a hunter while naked in woods in Manning, Oregon, in October 2013 . Mentally disturbed: Linus Norgren (pictured) attacked Jeff McDonald in the woods near Manning, Oregon, claiming he was from a family of sasquatch . Attack: Norgren had punched McDonald in the head and face and tried to choke him with the victim's own shirt . He told Oregon Live how he asked him for his name and received a normal response before Norgren said that he was 'a sasquatch from a family of sasquatches'. After offering to help take him home, Norgren struck Mr McDonald on the head with a rock, causing him to black out. When he woke up, Oregon Live reports, Norgren was on top of him and squeezing his hands tightly around his neck while Mr McDonald had suffered two dislocated shoulders. As the struggle unfolded he asked his attacker why he was trying to kill him to which Norgren replied: 'Sasquatch kills the hunter'. Mr McDonald said he managed to bite one of Mr Norgren's knuckles before the attacker appeared to 'pass out' on top of him. After a further struggle he managed to free himself and reach his gun, according to reports. Pointing his rifle at Norgren, he called 911. According to KPTV, McDonald told authorities they needed to get there quick, 'because I only have one option here and you know what it is'. Deputies eventually found them in thick forest after a 90 minute search. McDonald had held Norgren at gunpoint the whole time. Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting for deer near his home in Manning (pictured), Oregon, when he saw Linus Norgren wearing what appeared to be 'tan clothing' In court this week, Norgren said he was suffering 'catastrophic mental disturbances' at the time. Jurors were told that he had experiences symptoms of his 'untreated bipolar disorder', Oregon Live reports, while Norgren also told the court that he was acting in self-defense. 'I was injured already, I was naked and I was terrified,' Norgren said in court Tuesday, KPTV reported. 'Not to make excuses for myself, but Mr. McDonald's presence was absolutely terrifying. 'I truly believed I needed to defend myself to get out of that situation and go home. 'I didn't want to hurt him, I didn't want to hurt Mr. McDonald. 'I didn't want to kill him. I didn't want anything to happen to either of us.' 'I couldn't help it.' Guilty: Norgren was found guilty of attempted murder and second-degree assault last week. On Tuesday, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison with credit for time already served . But the self defence argument was rejected by jurors and Norgren was convicted of attempted murder and three counts of second-degree assault. He was cleared of further charges of first degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon. Oregon Live reports that his defense lawyer said he was unable to use an 'insanity defense' without Norgren's consent but suggested the evidence of mental illness should be a 'mitigating factor'. Norgren was jailed for ten years at Washington County Circuit Court this week, a year and a half after the incident in October 2013.","Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting close to his home in Manning, Oregon .

"A dog breeder and her husband have been found guilty of animal cruelty after 14 Red Setters were discovered  dehydrated and caged in the 'worst conditions ever seen'. Margaret and Gary Mazan from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had their dogs seized by RSPCA inspectors after the animals were discovered in filthy cages with matted fur. The couple were said to have caused unnecessary suffering to the dogs as they had failed to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails. A dog breeder and her husband have been found guilty of animal cruelty after 14 Red Setters were discovered dehydrated and caged . Margaret and Gary Mazan from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had their dogs seized by RSPCA inspectors after the animals were discovered in filthy cages . Three of the fully grown dogs were found crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed. Emma Ellis, an RSPCA inspector for Bradford who  helped to seize the animals, said it was the worst conditions she has seen dogs in her 12 years as an inspector. She said: 'These were the worst conditions I've ever seen dogs kept in. To see the dogs living in a small shed, with three fully grown setters living in a puppy cage is horrific. They could not sit down or turn around and there fur was matted, covered in urine and faeces. 'When the shed was opened, the smell literally hit you and it was a smell like I had never experienced before. I still recall the smell every time I see the photos. 'To keep animals in these conditions is unacceptable for anyone, let a alone a dog breeder.' Dingle Clark, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said Mrs Mazan, 53, had shown and bred setters for more than ten years. The animals had been kept at the Bradford home since the family moved from Leeds in February 2013. RSPCA officials served a warning notice a month after the couple moved in due to the conditions the dogs were being kept in. A dog warden was refused access to the home in April 2013, prompting calls to the RSPCA. Mrs Mazan chose not to give evidence in court yesterday, but her husband Gary, 51, who is a long-distance lorry driver, claimed it was his wife who had sole responsibility for the dogs. Both defendants were found guilty of seven breaches of the Animal Welfare Act and were granted bail ahead of a sentencing hearing next month. All the dogs are currently in the care of the RSPCA.

"The heavily tattooed ex-convict who allegedly killed one and injured five during a shooting spree in the Phoenix area had bail set for $2million on Thursday. Ryan Giroux, 41, silently bowed his head as a judge read out the lengthy list of charges including several counts of aggravated assault and burglary, along with one count of premeditated murder. Authorities say a motive for the initial shooting, which took place in a Mesa motel, is still unclear, though three later shootings were believed to be the result of Giroux's attempts to flee the scene. Scroll down for video . Motive unclear: Authorities are unclear about why Ryan Giroux, 41, opened fire in a motel room, killing one and injuring three, before shooting three others while fleeing . Records show that Giroux has a long rap sheet and history of substance abuse, while tattoos visible in prior booking photos identify him with membership of a white supremacist group. Having served three state prison sentences since 1994 on various charges including robbery and assault charges, an undated photo from the Arizona Department of Corrections shows him with the words 'skin' and 'head' tattooed in place of his eyebrows. The string of shootings began when Giroux opened fire into a motel room, where witnesses say Giroux had been arguing while accompanied by another, unidentified man. A witness described hearing the man grab Giroux's shirt and tell him 'they needed to leave the area' after he fired on three people in the room, according to a document filed in the case. David James Williams, 29, was killed while his mother, Lydia Marie Nelson, 51, and Jessica Lee Burgess, 19, were struck and injured. Giroux fled the motel, allegedly shooting Isaac Martinez, a 20-year-old culinary student at East Valley Institute of Technology, before stealing Martinez's car. Bail: Bond was set at $2million when Giroux appeared in front of a judge Thursday, as a lengthy list of charges, including aggravated assault, burglary and murder, were read . Lockdown: A SWAT team member searches for a gunman from the top of an armored truck Wednesday during the manhunt that led to the arrest of Giroux . Through the years: Giroux's mugshot has undergone several transformations over the years, including the addition of a neck tattoo that reads 'Hunter' White supremacist: Giroux appears with 'skinhead' tattooed in place of his eyebrows along with numbers on his temple . After arriving at an apartment nearby, Giroux reportedly entered and shot Donavon Worker, 24, before moving to another building and shooting Marcus Butler, 25. After leading police on a manhunt for several hours, officers finally spotted him standing on a balcony at a vacant apartment and incapacitating him with a stun gun, before arresting him and escorting him to a truck parked outside the complex. In his earlier arrest photo, Giroux also has the number 88 tattooed on his left temple, which a spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate group monitoring organization, described as shorthand for 'Heil Hitler.' 'Each of those 8s stand for the eighth letter of the alphabet, which is ""H,"" which is ""HH,""' Mark Potok told 12 News. On the other temple is the number 14, a reference to the 14-word phrase 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White Children,' coined by David Lane, according to the SPLC website. Giroux was known to be a member of Hammerskin Nation, a violent skinhead group, and an affiliate of the Aryan Brotherhood, according to Potok. Arrest photo: Photos showed Giroux being led to a truck in a white jumper with a hood after an hours-long manhunt to subdue him . Manhunt: SWAT officers walk near Adams Elementary School while searching for Girous on Wednesday, before his arrest at a vacant apartment complex . On alert: A heavily armed officer stands guard outside Adams Elementary School while the manhunt for Giroux continued . Mourning: Tanya Ehrig, 27, cries for victims of a shooting as she holds her child Trinity on Wednesday in Mesa, Arizona . 'We have learned by talking with a retired Mesa Police detective who we have known for quite a few years that Giroux was known to him way back in the 90s and early 2000s as a member of Hammerskin Nation,' Potok said. In recent photos, tattoos on Giroux's eyebrows, temple and chin appear removed or faded. While on probation after his release from prison in 2013, officials noted Giroux's stated desire to distance himself from his past. 'The defendant stated he wants to change his life around and begin to have his facial tattoos removed as well as the tattoos on his hands,' probation authorities wrote in a report in May of last year. Giroux has served more than eight years in correctional facilities throughout Arizona prisons, which includes one aggravated assault conviction dating from a fight with Mesa police officers in 2007 as they arrested him for shoplifting a bag of potato chips. Officers involved said Giroux went for a .45-caliber pistol tucked into his waistband, though the man denied it and claimed he was beaten. Giroux spent two months for a probation violation after his 2013 release, with officials saying he failed a drug test and used or possessed methamphetamine and marijuana. The report went on to state Giroux confessed to having violent tendencies when intoxicated or under the influence. According to a test the Maricopa County Adult Probation Department uses to screen offenders, there was a 'high risk' Giroux would re-offend. Giroux has a GED and a certification in fighting wildfires. He also was using cocaine, heroin, LSD and methamphetamines off and on for the past 20 years, according to court records. Giroux is jailed on suspicion of murder and other crimes. His bond is set at $2 million bond. He was arrested after officers spotted him on an apartment balcony and hit him with a stun gun. Numerous officers led the handcuffed man to a truck parked outside the apartment complex. Giroux has served three stints in state prisons since 1994. An undated mug shot from the Arizona Department of Corrections shows him with several face and neck tattoos, including the word ""skinhead"" where his eyebrows normally would be. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said Giroux is not listed in their database. Spokesman Mark Potok said some of his tattoos, including an ""88"" tattoo on his left temple, are associated with white supremacy. A newly released mug shot shows a bloodied and scraped up Giroux without many of his facial tattoos visible. Authorities say Giroux had expressed a desire last year to get his facial tattoos removed.","Ryan Giroux, 41, is held on a lengthy list of charges including several counts of aggravated assault and burglary, as well as one count of murder .

"The National Collegiate Athletics Association is worried about holding the Final Four – one of the nation's biggest college sporting events – in Indianapolis, after Indiana's governor signed a 'religious freedom' bill into law that gay rights activists say is a license to discriminate. Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA, said Thursday that the governing body for college sports is 'especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.' The Final Four, an annual culmination of the national men's college basketball tournament, is slated to be held next week at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, a city where the NCAA itself is based. The new statute, the first of its kind passed this year, invalidates state and local laws that 'substantially burden' the ability of people – including businesses and associations – to follow their religious beliefs . Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, supported the bill as it moved through the state legislature and was passed by wide margins in both chambers. He signed it in a private ceremony Thursday morning. Pence is considering whether to enter the 2016 presidential race, but is considered an outsider with long odds at success. STUMBLE? Future FInal Four appearances in Indianapolis could be in jeopardy because of a new religious-freedom law that Indiana gay rights activists saw is a license to discriminate . CALM DOWN! Indiana Gov. Mike Pence addressed the new statute in a news conference at the Statehouse in Indianapolis on Thursday . NO MEANS NO? Indiana's staet government won't be able to force bakeries run by evangelical Christians to provide wedding cakes for same-sex couples under the new law . There's no indication the NCAA has any plans to relocate the Final Four this year – ticketing and promotions have been underway for more than six months – but the event is scheduled to return to Indianapolis in 2021 and the NCAA is hinting that it might bolt the Hoosier State. 'We will work diligently to assure student-athletes competing in, and visitors attending, next week's Men's Final Four in Indianapolis are not impacted negatively by this bill,' Emmert said. 'Moving forward, we intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.' An online push for the NCAA to react to the bill began earlier this week, carrying the hashtag #Final4Fairness. Former professional basketball player Jason Collins, the first openly gay athlete to play in the NBA, tweeted: '@GovPenceIN, is it going to be legal for someone to discriminate against me & others when we come to the #FinalFour?' A pressure group called the LGBT Sports Coalition asked Thursday for the NCAA, the Big Ten, the NFL, USA Diving and USA Gymnastics to pull their events from Indianapolis over the next 16 months. The Big Ten holds its football championship game in at Lucas Oil Field and has a contract to remain there until 2021. The conference also is scheduled to hold its men's basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis in 2020 and 2022. The Big Ten women's basketball tournament is set to be held in Indianapolis for six years beginning in 2017. The NFL also holds its draft combine at Lucas Oil Stadium every year. Indiana's largest city is also hoping to land the 2019 Super Bowl. Pence said in a statement Thursday that the new law, patterned after a federal law signed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, ensures 'religious liberty is fully protected.' 'The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion, but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,' he said. Reaction to the decision was swift and divided. Indiana Right to Life President and CEO Mike Fichter praised the new law, saying it would give abortion opponents legal recourse if they are pressured to support the procedure. The organization circulated an online petition to thank Pence for signing the bill. FINAL FORGET-IT: Look for gay-rights protests next week when the Final Four comes to Indiana's largest sports arena, Lucas Oil Stadium . MIXED REACTIONS: A window sign on a downtown Indianapolis florist shows its owner's objection to the Religious Freedom bill passed by the Indiana legislature . Freedom Indiana, the gay rights group that led a successful 2014 fight against efforts to add a gay marriage ban to the state constitution, called it 'a sad day for Indiana,' saying Pence and lawmakers ignored concerns of thousands of Indiana residents. 'We made it clear that this law will only be used to harm other Hoosiers, and that's not the Indiana way. The lawmakers didn't listen. The governor didn't listen,' the group said in a statement. ON DECK: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he'll sing a similar law if his state's legislature passes it . At least two groups – the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Gen Con – have said they would reconsider plans to hold their conventions in Indianapolis because of the legislation. Gen Con is a videogaming convention that drew 56,000 people – most of them young – last year, making it the city's largest convention in both economic impact and attendance numbers. The CEO of the California technology company Salesforce told the Indianapolis Business Journal his company would reduce its investment in the state, specifically because of the new law. Supporters say discrimination concerns are overblown and that the Indiana measure merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide services like catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. They note that similar laws are already on the books in 19 states. Last year, Mississippi enacted its own religious freedom law just weeks after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, vetoed a similar effort there amid criticism from large corporations concerned about its impact on doing buiness in the state. 'This bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it,' Pence said Thursday. 'For more than 20 years, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act has never undermined our nation's anti-discrimination laws, and it will not in Indiana.' Chad Griffin, national president of the Human Rights Campaign, held his own press conference with one anchored by Hutchinson, the Arkansas governor . COUNFOUNDING EXPECTATIONS: Republican Jan Brewer, then Arizona's governor, vetoed a similar bill in 2014 before leaving office . The nation's political climate is vastly different from what President Clinton saw in 1993, however: The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this year on whether gay marriage bans violate the U.S. Constitution. The Indianapolis chamber of commerce opposed the bill on the grounds that it could make it more difficult to attract top companies and employees. Similar bills have been advancing this year in the Arkansas and Georgia legislatures. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Thursday that if his state's lawmakers send the bill to his desk, he'll sign it into law. 'I think it's a bill that puts a high priority on religious freedom and recognizes that as a part of the balance,' Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference after Pence signed his state's bill. Elsewhere at the state Capitol in Little Rock, Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin told journalists that the legislative push 'is a concerted effort by a hateful political faction to say that Arkansas does not welcome all its citizens, sending a clear message that this state is not open for business – and all this is happening on Gov. Hutchinson's watch. Griffin's organization is America's wealthiest and most powerful gay rights group. The latest changes to the Arkansas bill, tweaked on Wednesday night, give liberal lobbyists some ground by agreeing that complying with federal law counts as a 'compelling government intetest.' But Griffin said Thursday that his group wasn't satisfied. 'You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig,' he said. Indiana GOvernor Mike Pence . Pence delivered a brief statement during a news conference on Thursday, after signing the controversial bill into law: . 'Today I signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, because I support the freedom of religion for every Hoosier of every faith. 'The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action. 'One need look no further than the recent litigation concerning the Affordable Care Act. A private business and our own University of Notre Dame had to file lawsuits challenging provisions that required them to offer insurance coverage in violation of their religious views. 'Fortunately, in the 1990s Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—limiting government action that would infringe upon religion to only those that did not substantially burden free exercise of religion absent a compelling state interest and in the least restrictive means. 'Last year the Supreme Court of the United States upheld religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but that act does not apply to individual states or local government action. At present, nineteen states—including our neighbors in Illinois and Kentucky—have adopted Religious Freedom Restoration statutes.

'This bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it. In fact, it does not even apply to disputes between private parties unless government action is involved. For more than twenty years, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act has never undermined our nation's anti-discrimination laws, and it will not in Indiana. 'Indiana is rightly celebrated for the hospitality, generosity, tolerance, and values of our people, and that will never change. Faith and religion are important values to millions of Hoosiers and with the passage of this legislation, we ensure that Indiana will continue to be a place where we respect freedom of religion and make certain that government action will always be subject to the highest level of scrutiny that respects the religious beliefs of every Hoosier of every faith.'","Look for gay rights protests at Lucas Oil Stadium as the men's college basketball tournament comes to Indianapolis, where the NCAA is based .

"Albert Maysles, the revolutionary documentary filmmaker who helped pioneer nonfiction movies by turning a keenly observant eye on both the famous and the ordinary in films like Gimme Shelter and Grey Gardens, has died. He was 88. In a statement, Maysles' family said the director passed away after a brief battle with cancer at his New York home Thursday night. Scroll down for video . Albert Maysles poses for a portrait during the 2013 Sundance Film Festival (file photo) Maysles is best known for directing the classic documentary Grey Gardens . Maysles was best known for a handful of documentary classics he made with his brother, David, in the 1960s and 1970s. The Maysles Brothers - as many referred to them - chose subjects as ordinary as the struggles of Bible salesmen and as glamorous as Marlon Brando, Orson Welles and the Beatles, whom the pair followed in 1964 during their first trip to the United States. One of their films, Gimme Shelter, about The Rolling Stones' Altamont Speedway concert on Dec. 6, 1969, captured on film the killing of a fan and the darkening of the hippie dream. The Altamont concert was the Stones' disastrous effort to stage a festival like the Woodstock gathering a few months earlier. Maysles was active right up to this death. His documentary of the fashion icon Iris Apfel, Iris, is to be released in April. Earlier this week, the Tribeca Film Festival announced that In Transit, a documentary he co-directed about the longest train route in the U.S., will premiere at this year's festival. 'We lost a true titan today, one who pioneered an art form and fostered a whole generation of artists,' said Eamonn Bowles, president of Magnolia Pictures, which is releasing Iris. 'His impact is immeasurable and we won't soon see his likes again.' Born in Boston to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, Maysles served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946, studied at Syracuse and Boston University and taught psychology for three years before turning to film. His first foray into motion pictures was a 16-mm documentary he made in 1955 while visiting mental hospitals in the Soviet Union. Maysles started out as an assistant to Robert Drew, a pioneer of cinema verite, and his peers included such acclaimed documentary makers as D.A Pennebaker and Frederick Wiseman. He and Pennebaker were among those who worked with Drew on the groundbreaking 1960 documentary Primary, about rival Democratic presidential candidates John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey. Maysles also served as a camera operator for Pennebaker's 1968 concert film Monterey Pop. 'My friendship with Al was forged during four months of filming together, just the two of us, in Russia in 1959,' said Pennebaker, referring to their film Opening in Moscow, about that year's world fair. 'When he got a camera against his eye, he was one of the world's great watchers, and I knew we would always be filmmaking companions.' Filmmakers David, left, and Albert Maysles work on the streets of New York for Salesman . The Maysles and others worked without scripts, sets or lighting. The resulting works had no narration, no filmed interviews and gave audiences a fly-on-the-wall feeling. 'Our films aren't the conventional kind, locked down and scripted before shooting begins, David Maysles once said of their films. 'We shoot life as it's lived.' A technical revolution had made such films possible — the arrival of lightweight, portable sound and film equipment — and gave them the opportunity to observe their subjects with as little effect on events as possible. ]The natural disposition of the camera,' Maysles said, 'is to seek out reality.' In 1966, using the new equipment, they filmed Truman Capote shortly after he finished In Cold Blood. Capote explained that his book was his idea of the nonfiction novel  - 'a synthesis of journalism with fictional technique.' 'We wanted to experiment in film the way Capote had experimented in literature,' Maysles said in Hand-Held and From the Heart, the filmmaker's autobiographical documentary. That led them to make the feature-length Salesman in 1968, following Bible salesmen from house to house as they try to convince people to buy what one of them calls 'still the best-seller in the world.' The technique of unfettered observation - 'direct cinema,' the brothers called it - allowed the Maysles Brothers to record such historical moments as the slaying of a fan at the Altamont concert, and the grim reaction of Mick Jagger, the Stones' singer, as he watched a replay of the footage. President Barack Obama awards the 2013 National Medal of Arts to filmmaker Albert Maysles . In Grey Gardens, released in 1975 and later adapted into a Broadway musical, the Maysles Brothers captured on film the lives of a mother and her daughter, relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, living in a falling-apart East Hampton mansion. Some critics attacked the cinema verite techniques as falsely objective, given that the film ultimately viewed by audiences was usually a result of what the filmmakers chose to focus on and the cutting and selecting of the editing process. 'Any work of art is a combination of objective and subjective,' Maysles once told The New York Times in response to those criticisms. 'But I try to minimize my effect. I don't interview people, for instance. If you ask a question, that determines the answer. Making a film isn't finding the answer to a question; it's trying to capture life as it is.' After his brother died in 1987, Albert Maysles continued to work with various collaborators and mentored younger filmmakers. In 2006, he founded the non-profit Maysles Documentary Center in Harlem. 'While we mourn the loss of Albert, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as inspiration to people around the world to be willing to push themselves creatively and take the time to observe and reflect on life as it unfolds,' said Erika Dilday, executive director of the center. Maysles also continued a longtime working relationship with artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude, whose process for creating monumental environmental art the Maysles Brothers documented in several films beginning in the 1970s. They were Oscar nominated for their 1973 short Christo's Valley Curtain. In 2007, Maysles and Antonio Ferrera made The Gates about Christo and Jeanne-Claude's Central Park project. Last July, President Barack Obama awarded Maysles the National Medal of Arts, honoring his six decades of filmmaking. Said Obama: 'By capturing raw emotions and representations, his work reflects the unfiltered truths of our shared humanity.'","Albert Maysles, the revolutionary documentary filmmaker, has passed away at the age of 88 .

"The University of Maryland is investigating a fraternity member who allegedly sent a racist email that also talked about raping women. A member of Kappa Sigma's chapter at the College Park school was suspended from the fraternity after the organization learned about the incident and he later resigned. The student sent the email, which insulted and used racial slurs for black, Indian and Asian women, to six people in January last year. Officials at the University of Maryland (pictured) are investigating a racist email allegedly sent by a member of Kappa Sigma last year . The frat member said that students of the races should not come to their parties for 'Rush week,' when new brothers are recruited. The author also denounces getting consent for sexual activity when speaking about women in the email. University president Wallace Loh released a statement saying, 'The vulgar language in the email expresses views that are reprehensible to our campus community'. The institution's Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct is conducting an investigation into the student, who has met with school officials. Loh said that the university only learned about the email on Tuesday and that Kappa Sigma has asked for diversity and respect training from the university for its members. The fraternity has suspended the student, who also later resigned, following racist statements against black, Indian and Asian women. University president Wallace Loh said 'The vulgar language in the email expresses views that are reprehensible to our campus community' The investigation comes shortly after the University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter was closed down after a video emerged of frat members singing racist chants on a bus. Two members from Texas, Parker Rice and Levi Pettit, were expelled from the university for leading the songs, which talked about lynching black people. Officials at University of Texas at Austin are looking into the possibility that members of the fraternity's chapter at their school also used the chant, according to the Los Angeles Times. There is also an investigations into Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Louisiana Tech and a chapter of the fraternity at University of Washington that has been accused of calling black students 'apes' and not allowing them into parties. School officials' acknowledgement of the email came a day after officials at another University System of Maryland campus confirmed they had expelled two students for code-of-conduct violations. The discipline followed an investigation into sexual assault allegations at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

"Some Easter Egg hunts will be indoors this year as bad weather is forecast for over the holiday weekend. Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane will be the wettest capital cities this Easter weekend. But it didn't back up the old wives' tale that it always rains at Easter either, as the Meteorology Department said most other regions will remain dry for the most part. The department said it's normal for eastern New South Wales and south-east Queensland to get more rain in Autumn with heavy showers forecast for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Scroll down for video . Is there anybody out there? Thick fog descends on Sydney Harbour Bridge on Wednesday morning . I think the car's flooded: Huge amounts of rain fell in south-east Queensland, with this man left stranded in Nundah, Brisbane . Sydneysiders got their working day off to a strange start on Wednesday as thick fog descended on the city. At one stage in the early morning it had totally obscured the Sydney Harbour Bridge. But it cleared as the day progressed. However, it was the threat of rain, not fog that was the big issue . 'It's due to an up-level trough that's moving across the area. Rainfall will be widespread in these regions,' a spokesman for the Meteorology Department said. 'As well as these areas the rainfall will possibly spread into the far east of Victoria.' The fog surrounding Sydney Harbour Bridge is just for starters as rain is forecast for the city over the Easter weekend . Severe storms were already causing big problems though. Huge amounts of rain fell in south-east Queensland, with many locals waking up to flooded yards and roads. ABC News reports that six children had a lucky escape and just had cuts and bruises after a tree collapsed at Logan's Park Ridge State High School about 8:30am. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFRS) had also been called to several swift water rescues, including two at the Brisbane suburb of Zillmere. Stones Corner in Brisbane was another area that was badly hit by torrential rain on Wednesday . Foggy outlook: Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane will be the wettest capital cities this Easter weekend . The Sunshine Coast was still being battered and the Meteorology Department warned the storms were likely to produce prolonged heavy rain and flash flooding. Over the Easter weekend rain is also forecast for central parts of Western Australia to the north of Perth, although Perth itself will be mostly fine. Across the Northern Territory it will be relatively stable with isolated showers and storms, but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year. Apart from the far eastern part of Victoria, Melbourne will be mostly dry over the holiday period. In the Brisbane suburb of Virginia more cars were left swamped in rain water after the storm hit . Bad weather maybe forecast in Sydney, but Melbourne will be mostly dry over the holiday period . 'Melbourne will be possibly cloudy with a few showers, but over all it see the same rainfall as the eastern part of the country,' the spokesman said. Canberra will have its worst weather on Friday and Saturday, while Brisbane could be in for showers on each of the four days due to brisk southeasterly winds. Hobart and Adelaide all have less than a 30% chance of getting any showers on any across the weekend. An up-level trough moving across New South Wales and Queensland will see widespread rain in these areas .","Rain is on the way for south-east Queensland and eastern New South Wales on Friday, Saturday and Sunday .

"A mother and her daughter who both have a rare condition which makes their skin wrinkle prematurely have undergone matching £50,000 facelifts. Tracey Gibson, 45,  and her daughter Zara Hartshorn, 18, both suffer Lipodystrophy, a rare condition which makes fat dissolve beneath tissue. While Zara had a face-lift at the age of 16 to stave off bullies, her mother has long suffered lingering stares and cruel nicknames. Having been rejected by the NHS for a free operation, the mother of seven thought she would be forever trapped in a sinking face. But, two years since her daughter received free surgery from American doctors, the 45-year-old has unveiled her new £50,000 face after being flown overseas to receive the same VIP treatment. Scroll down for video . Zara Hartshorn, 18,  and her mother Tracey Gibson, 45, (above) have undergone matching £50,000 facelifts abroad after suffering a lifetime of taunts over their wrinkled skin . Before: Zara, left, aged 16 and Mrs Gibson, right, aged 45. Both women have suffered at the taunts of bullies who made fun of the rare condition which sees their skin wrinkle prematurely . After: The mother daughter duo were treated to free surgery by doctors in America after being turned down by the NHS . Speaking of the treatment- a face and neck lift plus Botox injections - Mrs Gibson, who was constantly teased as a child, says she has never felt better. 'My face is worth £50,000 and it feels absolutely amazing when I get up in the morning,' she said. 'I’ve been called a ""granny"" and a ""monkey"" all my life and when I look at old pictures now I think I looked like the dragon off Shrek. 'But now I’ve got a new lease of life and I can hold my head high when I walk down the street. I think I look pretty good now and totally different.' Mrs Gibson, who lives off disability allowance, has been plagued with low self-esteem her entire life because of the condition. While lipodystrophy can occur as a side effect of various illnesses, a small number of people in the world are born with the condition. The results can vary between sufferers. In Mrs Gibson's case her face, neck and arms were the worst affected making her look double her age at times. Now the pair say they enjoy better self-esteem and higher levels of confidence despite being turned down by the NHS . The pair (left, after the procedure and right, in 2011) are among a handful of people afflicted with Lipodystrophy in the UK . Zara (pictured aged seven) was born with the condition and teased at school. When she was 16 she was contacted by surgeons in America who offered to perform a facelift free of charge . Three of Mrs Gibson's seven children were born with the condition though Zara (left) was the worst afflicted. They are pictured above with her daughter Jolene who also has Lipodystrophy,  in 2012 . Mrs Gibson, who has been married three times, said that for the fist time in years she is being chatted up by men. She is pictured three years ago aged 42 with her husband Lawrence and daughters Jolene and Zara . Lipodystrophy affects its sufferers differently, with fat loss occurring in different parts of the body. Mrs Gibson, for example, has more pronounced wrinkles in her arms, neck and face. Above, she poses with Zara (right) before her procedure, and daughter Chloe, who does not have the condition . 'I’ve been ridiculed my entire life and endured all sorts of cruel names since school,' she said. 'I’ve had to put up with so much. I was never able to get a job and it does make you resentful sometimes.' Of Tracey’s seven children, three have inherited the rare condition. Jolene, 25 and Tommy, 26, are also sufferers though Zara's symptoms were most prominent. The 18-year-old underwent surgery in 2012 after being contacted by a plastic surgeon in the U.S. who performed the operation for free. Lipodystrophy also known as the ‘Fat Redistribution Syndrome’, refers to a number of disturbances in the way the body uses and distributes fat. One of the most common symptoms is fat loss in the face, causing sufferers to appear gaunt and wrinkled far earlier than their peers. While it is a common side effect of illnesses such as diabetes, a small number of people are born with the condition. The dissolving of fat beneath tissue can occur in different body parts in every patient. Some will look haggered in the face and thin in the arms while others will see rushes of fat to the hips and legs. The pair stayed in touch and, after watching her daughter's skin improve, the doctor offered Mrs Gibson, who had already been rejected by the NHS, the same treatment. 'I got turned down in this country because they said it was just cosmetic and as you can imagine I was absolutely fuming,' she said. 'I think it’s disgusting that I was born with this condition and the NHS won’t do anything about it. 'I don’t know how they could refuse me - my face looked terrible.' And while she was delighted with the facelift and subsequent Botox injections, the 45-year-old stopped short of transforming her whole face. 'They asked me if I wanted Angelina Jolie lips but I think that would be taking it a bit too far. 'It was never about looking younger, it was just about having a normal face that I could be happy with and stand to look at in the mirror. 'I love putting my make-up on now and making the most of my new face. I never bothered with anything like that before but now I have a bag full of cosmetics.' 'I feel like I’m having the last laugh now at everyone who called me names and it’s a massive boost. 'I’ve always had my head down trying to blend into the background, but that part of my life is done with now and I can finally be the person I’ve always wanted to be.'","Tracey Gibson and her daughter Zara Hartshorn both suffer Lipodystrophy .

"Despite years of experience as a handler, Jason McDonald just wasn't quick enough to escape the powerful jaws of this eight foot gator. This dramatic video shows the moment the gator wrestler was taught a painful lesson during a stunt for visitors. It shows him struggling to free himself after a risky trick - involving him putting his hand in the creature's mouth - backfired and the gator clamped his teeth down and refused to let go. Scroll down for video . Ouch! Experienced gator wrestler Jason McDonald had never been bitten before, until a risky trick backfired . The 34-year-old's hand was trapped inside the alligator's mouth for more than 10 minutes. He was eventually released when friends and co-workers prised open the 150lb beast's mouth with a piece of metal. Mr McDonald, who has been volunteering at Colorado Gator Farm in Mosca, Colorado, for 10 years, had never been bitten before. He said: 'I've had many close calls before and I would still have my unbitten streak if I hadn't attempted that dangerous trick. Bait: The experienced handler was taught a painful lesson during a stunt for visitors at Colorado Gator Farm . 'I was in disbelief when it bit me and I was a little mad and disappointed in myself that I had allowed it to happen. 'But I've seen plenty of other people getting bit so I didn't panic at all.' He added employees tried to help him by wedging the creature's mouth open with stick - but it only led to the gator clamping down harder. 'I knew I had to control the head and keep the gator from rolling or shaking its head and causing me further injury,' he said. 'The bite started to hurt a little more as we tried to put sticks in its mouth to wedge it open - every time something touched the inside of its mouth it would clamp down harder. 'Once we were able to pry its mouth open and my hand was free it felt numb - I had one puncture wound that was about half an inch deep and was filled up with blood.' Mr McDonald's girlfriend was filming as he prepared to perform the risky stunt at the farm in Mosca, Colorado . Keep calm: Mr McDonald kept a cool head as his hand was trapped in the alligator's jaws for ten minutes . Finally free: The 34-year-old was eventually released after co-workers pried open the gator's mouth with metal . Injuries: Mr McDonald had to have a cotton bud, dipped in bleach water, inserted into his wounded hand, left, and right, the injuries to his right hand after the ordeal . But he added that despite the ordeal, he will continue handling and treating alligators. 'At no point was I ever in shock. The worst part was when we used a cotton bud with bleach water to clean out the wound and prevent infection. 'I have no ill will towards the gator at all. I honestly have no idea why it closed its mouth and I plan on continuing to catch gators and teach my wrestling class - I just won't be doing that trick anymore.' Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals, is a crematory manager - but in his spare time performs tricks for visitors to the farm. He became involved with Colorado Gators when he signed up for a wrestling class. Colorado Gators started out as a fish farm, but in 1987, its owners decided to buy 100 baby gators, as a means of disposing of guts and carcasses.

"The U.S. Army has begun the process of destroying the nation's last supplies of chemical weapons which are contained in almost 800,000 artillery shells. The terrifying arsenal is contained at the Pueblo Chemical Depot in southern Colorado. The first batch of the mustard agent was destroyed after scientists used explosives to open up a sealed container and flooded it with a second chemical to neutralise the liquid. Scroll down for video . Technicians will take four years to eliminate almost 800,000 artillery shells containing mustard agent . The chemical agent, commonly known as mustard gas, is actually a liquid which smells like the condiment . It is estimated that there are 2,600 tonnes of the chemical agent contained within 780,000 shells at the facility. Bruce Huenefeld, who is managing the destruction process said: 'Everybody's really excited, but we're being cautious, making sure all the procedures are followed exactly.' Mustard agent can maim or kill by damaging skin, the eyes and airways. It's being destroyed under a 1997 international treaty banning all chemical weapons. It will take four years to destroy the Pueblo stockpile. Another 523 tons of mustard and deadly nerve agents are stored at Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky. Blue Grass isn't expected to start destroying its weapons until 2016 or 2017, finishing in 2023. The destruction process is safe, officials said. Most of Pueblo's stockpile will be dismantled and neutralised in a highly automated $4.5 billion plant built at the depot. The Pueblo Chemical Depot  in southern Colorado has a method of destroying damaged chemical shells . The United States said it never used mustard agent in any conflict and agreed to destroy their stockpile . About 1,400 damaged shells and a dozen metal bottles of mustard agent are considered unsuitable for that plant. They'll be opened with explosives and neutralised in the sealed chamber, which sits inside an airtight structure near the larger automated plant. The metal bottles contain mustard that was extracted from the shells for testing. A single bottle was the first container to be opened and neutralised Wednesday. Crews were waiting for the neutralisation to finish before draining the chamber, rinsing it and then removing the remains of the bottle. Once all the bottles are destroyed, crews will start work on the damaged shells, depot spokesman Thomas Schultz said. The automated plant isn't expected to begin work until December or January. Design and construction have taken years, and final testing and training are underway. Mustard agent is a thick liquid, not a gas as commonly believed. It has no color and almost no odor, but it got its name because impurities made early versions smell like mustard. The U.S. acquired 30,600 tons of mustard and nerve agents, but it never used them in war. Nearly 90 per cent of its original stockpile has already been destroyed, mostly by incineration. The depots in Colorado and Kentucky are using chemical neutralisation because residents and officials expressed concerns about the vapor from incineration.","The United States agreed to destroy its mustard chemical agent in 1997 .

"The latest numbers from the US Labor Department show that 295,000 jobs were added in February, marking the 12th straight monthly gain above 200,000, while the unemployment rate dropped to a more than six-year low. But the decline in the jobless rate from 5.7 to 5.5 per cent occurred mainly because some people out of work stopped looking for jobs and were no longer counted as unemployed, according to federal officials. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 240,000 increase in payrolls after a previously reported 257,000 rise in January. They had forecast the jobless rate falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.6 per cent. Scroll down for video . Job gains: US employers added 295,000 jobs in February, marking 12th straight monthly gain above 200,000 . Progress: The unemployment rate dropped to a more than six-year low of 5.5 per cent . However, the stronger-than-expected job gains weren't enough to boost wages by much. The average hourly wage rose just 3 cents in February to $24.78 an hour. Still, over the past 12 months, 3.3 million more Americans have gotten jobs. More jobs and lower gas prices have led many consumers to step up spending. That's boosting the economy, offsetting sluggish economies overseas and giving employers the confidence to hire. The closely followed employment report was released a little more than a week before the US central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting. The strengthening job market could give the Federal Reserve room to move toward raising interest rates from record lows. Most analysts expect the Fed to pave the way for higher rates by adjusting the statement it issues after its March policy meeting, to be followed by the first hike in June or September. After the jobs report was released Friday morning, investors sold ultra-safe US Treasurys, a sign that many anticipate a Fed rate hike. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.18 per cent from 2.11 percent before the report was issued. The US job market and economy are easily outpacing those of other major nations. Though Europe and Japan are showing signs of growing more than last year, their economies remain feeble. The euro currency union's unemployment rate has started to fall, but at 11.2 percent it remains nearly twice the US level. The US economy expanded at a breakneck annual pace of 4.8 per cent in last year's spring and summer, only to slow to a tepid 2.2 per cent rate in the final three months of 2014. Many economists estimate that growth is picking up slightly in the current quarter to an annual rate of 2.5 per cent to nearly 3 per cent. Back to work: Over the past 12 months, 3.3 million more Americans have gotten jobs . Still, economists remain bullish about hiring despite the slowdown in growth. The fourth quarter's slowdown occurred largely because companies reduced their stockpiles of goods, which translated into lower factory output. But companies focus more on consumer demand in making hiring decisions, and demand was strong in the October-December quarter. Americans stepped up their spending by the most in four years. And though consumers are saving much of the cash they have from cheaper gas, spending in January still rose at a decent pace after adjusting for lower prices. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, expects the economy to grow 3 per cent this year, which would be first time it's reached that level in a decade. That's fast enough to support hiring of about 250,000 a month, he said.","Employers added 295,000 jobs in February, marking 12th straight monthly gain above 200,000 .

"The small southern Utah town of Hurricane might become a little quieter after a statue of a copper bull lost its most prominent private feature this weekend. The sculpture holds a high perch above the sign for Barista's restaurant, and owner Stephen Ward said he woke up Friday and decided the bull would look better without the oversized genitalia that caused uproar among the neighbors. Hurricane residents disturbed by the noticeable, cone-shaped feature had asked the city council to revoke Barista's business license. Hurricane, Utah, restaurant Barista's cased an uproar after displaying a bull on its sign with over-sized genitalia (left). On Friday owner Stephen Ward decided to remove (right) the genitalia that caused such a disturbance in the town . Ward told the St. George Spectrum on Saturday that he made it clear to city officials before he altered the statue that he wasn't bowing to community pressure. 'I told them I am not removing the penis for you or because of your complaints. I don't like you. I'm doing it for me,' Ward told. 'I just decided it would look better without the weenie. And oh my God! It's beautiful.' Even before the battle over the bull, tensions had been running high between Ward and the local community just north of the Arizona border. Customers have said the food is too expensive, alleged that Ward is hostile and has poor business practices. He says his offerings are the best in the region and hasn't hesitated to push back. The dispute got physical on March 14, when an altercation erupted between a Barista's employee and a patron. The patron was cited for a number of misdemeanors, including assault, according to the Hurricane City Police Department. Though Ward received an onslaught of criticism for the bull, he insists that he is not removing the genitalia for the community, but because he 'just decided it would look better' Ward, however, said the incident wasn't handled appropriately and is upset that the patron wasn't arrested. The copper bull's over-sized genitalia reinvigorated the fight. After a steady stream of complaints, city officials were evaluating whether there were grounds to force the removal or modification of the bull. City Manager Clark Fawcett said the sign was approved by the planning department and Ward went through the proper channels, but: 'the dimensions of certain parts of the animal don't seem to be built the same way as in the plan that came to us.' More than 500 people  signed the petition asking the council strip restaurant of its business licence. According to the petition: 'As a member of the Hurricane City council has already said, Barista's has given Hurricane, UT a ""black eye"". 'It's owner is a terrible representation of what our community stands for. He takes advantage of every person that walks into his restaurant. 'They intentionally take excessive advantage of those that are visiting our community from other parts of the world. Ward (pictured) has had more than one clash with residents of Hurricane, but he said this recent conflict hasn't hurt business . 'They have a horrible reputation that shines a bad light on the rest of Hurricane, UT. We as a community will not stand aside and allow this false representation be made!' Local resident Denise Mackelprang told The St George News: 'It looks terrible. I could see the bull, but not the details of the sex. It’s R-rated to me, especially with young school kids seeing it and talking about it.' Fellow resident Lindsay Knapp complained: 'The giant bull is awesome. The giant, weird testicles and penis are not even anatomically correct … that is my issue.' Ward acknowledged Saturday that he did feel like something was a bit off after he installed the bull. 'It didn't even look (right), it was in the shape of a cone — but I don't know what a weenie on a bull is supposed to look like,' Ward said. He said he didn't put it up to make anyone angry on purpose, but the conflict hasn't hurt his business. 'I put it up because it's an amazing piece, and I bought it as-is,' he said, 'but I am having fun with all the attention and it's brought in more customers.'","Restaurateur Stephen Ward removed over-sized genitalia after locals complained and tried to revoke his business license .

"Ukip leader Nigel Farage broke down in tears as he described how his children had been bullied because of his job. In a revealing interview on BBC One, the politician admitted his family had paid the price for his position as the head of the United Kingdom Independence Party. Once described as 'the most hated man in Britain', an emotional Farage appeared to break down in tears he said how his children were being judged 'unfairly'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage broke down in tears as he described how his children had been bullied . 'We have this very unusual surname, there aren't many of us, and that is difficult, it is difficult,' said the MEP who has two children under the age of 15 and another two in their 20s, . 'It is difficult when you are younger because you are going to get teased mercilessly wherever you go, but it actually difficult when you are grown up too, because people are judging you unfairly by your father, and that's tough, that is tough.' But he said his family's struggle would not make him give up the chance to establish Ukip as a party with real political sway. 'I've got to go with it and to hell with the consequences,' he added. It appears his ambition is paying off as Ukip are predicted to win six seats in the general election. Farage himself had unsuccessfully contested British parliamentary elections for UKIP five times, both before and after his election as an MEP. In August 2014 he was selected as the UKIP candidate for South Thanet in this year's general election. He was recently questioned on his 'most hated' title during an appeareance on Loose Women. In a revealing interview on BBC One, the politician admitted his family had paid the price for his position as the head of the United Kingdom Independence Party . Mr Farage said his family's struggle would not make him give up the chance to establish Ukip as a party with real political sway. His wife Kirsten is pictured left . Actress Linda Robson, one of the show’s panellists, asked Mr Farage why he had been voted ‘the most hated man in Britain’. He said: 'You look at these political figures, they are all like cardboard cut-outs. They are all playing safe, they are all scared of the media. I’m not, I’m a bit like Marmite. People either like me or don’t like me.’ He added that all politicians are fundamentally ‘selfish’ and neglect their families. He said: ‘The other three big leaders are very good at coming on programmes like this and saying what wonderful family men they are, how they do the school run and when the babies were little they changed all the nappies and did the night feeds. Maybe that’s true. All I can say is, it’s pretty much impossible to do that.’ Often pictured down the pub pint in hand, Farage also admitted he also had a secret nocturnal habit- shore fishing. The party leader said he would often travel down to the coast from London and have three or four hours of fishing through to the early hours after a busy day.","Nigel Farage broke down in tears as he described children being bullied .

"Mexicans take it literally when they amp themselves up for a night out in their country's capital. A drinking game popular in Mexico City takes shock-factor to the extreme as friends affirm their macho status by competing over who can handle the most electricity, and they connect themselves to a live current. Known as 'toques' - Spanish for 'touches' - the game has seen a recent surge in popularity through the city, and has seen players' nights-out cut short by urgent visits to the emergency room. 'The drunker people get, the more voltage they can generally handle,' says Javier Rodriguez, who has worked the lively Condesa neighbourhood of Mexico City for the past 35 years. Scroll down for video . Electricuting: Javier Rodriguez has been offering drinkers the chance to play 'toques' for 35 years . Painful: It requires a player to withstand as many volts of electricity coursing through their body as possible . Cheap thrills: People pay  £1.50 for a round, and Javier can expect to make more than £300 in a weekend . 'I've seen party-goers pass out after passing 100 volts, although it usually has something to do with what they've been drinking.' 'It's fun,' said Leonardo Flores, who eagerly took up the challenge when Javier passed by clicking the metal handles to make the sound known throughout the capital as a toques vendor. 'It gives you a jolt and you feel good afterwards,' he told the MailOnline, who watched as he withstood 85 volts of electricity passing up his left arm and then down his right. 'People also say it makes hangovers less painful, but that hasn't ever been my experience.' Javier walks a circuit of the bars and restaurants in the trendy party district from 3pm until the early hours of the morning, clicking together the metal handles that players hold onto to complete the electric circuit, which can reach up to 120 volts. UK mains supply runs at around 240 volts. 'It's a long-standing tradition here in Mexico,' he said. 'I've been hired to offer the game at private events: weddings, funerals, Sweet 16 birthday parties, town fairs, political dinners, pretty much everything. 'It's become part of our country's drinking culture. Wherever Mexicans are drinking in large numbers, you can be certain someone is going around offering the electrocution game.' 'Fun': Despite pictures suggesting the contrary, some people claim they enjoy the sensation . Device: The two handles send volts of electricity through the player's body, starting off at just 20 volts . Secret cure: It is also claimed a game of toques can make your hangover less  severe in the morning . Each round costs £1.50, and Javier can expect to make more than £300 on a lively weekend in Condesa, one of Mexico City's most popular nightlife districts. Good business, given that that Mexican minimum wage stands at under £150 a month, and that his only expenses are eight AA batteries every three or so weeks. He claims Mexicans are always his best clients, and that not only are international visitors less likely to participate, but that they are generally underperformers. 'Mexicans know what to expect, but it's rare to see foreigners do well,' he boasted, 'Foreigners are generally very cowardly, and get very scared when it comes to this game.' The MailOnline tried its hand at toques, and can report difficulty in typing up the experience the following day. The game starts slowly, and the current noticeably takes the shortest route through the body: along the inside of the forearms, up through the armpit and across the upper back if the game is played the traditional way – holding a metal handle in either hand. A tingling sensation is apparent at around twenty volts, which increases in intensity and reach, as the dial is turned up towards the 120-volt maximum. Upwards of 60 volts the wrists begin to bend inward under the force of the current, and past 80 volts the hands become completely paralysed – unable to let go of the circuit even if the player would want to. It's little wonder Javier says players rarely surpass 85 volts. The MailOnline's reporter reached 80 and the pain was excruciating. Guinea pig: MailOnline's Alasdair Baverstock decided to test his pain threshold against the electricity . Challenge: According to Javier, foreigners are not very good at toques . 'Excrutiating': Alasdair can confirm, having reached 80 volts, the game is exceedingly painful . Low cost: The 'shock box' only requires eight AA batteries, which last about three weeks . Although the shocks may be painful, it would take more than 10 times the highest amount to even get close to killing a human being. Electric shocks above 2,700 volts can be fatal to human beings - with shocks above 11,000 volts considered 'usually fatal'. For burns to occur, there would need to be somewhere between 500 and 1,000 volts of electricity - although defibrillators can use up to 1,000 volts to get a heart beating once more. Conversely, electric shocks can also stop the heart from beating properly, prevent breathing and cause painful muscle spasms. The voltage causes current to flow that blocks the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles. More than 2.5million people in the UK suffer a mains voltage electric shock per year, according to statistics from Electrical Safety First. In 1890, murderer William Kemmler was the first man to be executed in the United States by electric chair. A voltage of approximately 1,000 volts was applied for two minutes in order to kill him. The game stops only when the player asks - or screams - for it to end, signalling the man with the battery pack to cut the power. The ordeal is generally followed by restorative tequila shots, which bar staff continue to serve up to clients no matter how drunk they are. 'The average score is from 70 to 85 volts,' says Javier, who recommends that his more zealous clients undergo regular two-minute 40-volt sessions in the belief that the electricity helps an individual's blood pressure and stress levels - although whether the current helps to increase or decrease he does not mention. 'I woke up the morning after I played toques, and I felt like my tongue was burned,' said Oscar Gonzalez, a Venezuelan marketing consultant who moved to Mexico City last year. 'It's a crazy game and I can't really see the benefit. It's one of those inexplicable things about Mexican culture.' The game is played competitively solo, although multiple people can play together by forming a human chain; touching hands, noses, lips, ears, buttocks or any other piece of bare skin which will allow electricity to flow. 'The hands are relatively easy to withstand,' says Javier. 'I've seen people get up to 50 volts by touching tongues.' When played in a group, the drinking element of toques becomes more prevalent, as the person who breaks the chain first is often punished by having to drink shots of tequila. Team sport?: People can play alone, or in groups like this one - sending electricity through each other . Not just for the drinkers: 'You'd be surprised how many people simply enjoy the sensation and will have a go at the end of their lunch hour, without having touched a drop of alcohol that day,' Javier told MailOnline . 'If you get to the upper limits of the voltage you actually start to feel tingling in your brain,' said Ignacio Alonso, a Mexico City native who reached 90 volts before screaming for mercy, a trial sandwiched by shots of the rudimentary and potent mescal, a spirit similar to tequila. Eight AA batteries power the 'shock box', which Javier carries around with him to offer the game to party-goers and ordinary office workers alike. 'I start work at 3pm,' he says. 'You'd be surprised how many people simply enjoy the sensation and will have a go at the end of their lunch hour, without having touched a drop of alcohol that day.' Travelling is difficult for Javier, since he is not allowed to take his equipment on aeroplanes inside his hand luggage, and has been questioned in the past by airport bomb squads over the contents of his checked suitcase. 'Officers in international airports rarely understand that it's just a game,' he chuckles. The maximum of 120 volts is not enough to damage human tissue, although players with heart pacemakers should not take on the challenge.","'Toques' - touch in Spanish -  sees people electrocute themselves for fun .

"Attractive: Motorists will be given cut price parking on rainy days in summer . Parking charges at a popular British seaside resort could soon be weather dependent after a council pledged to halve them when it rains. Councillors in Brighton and Hove say they want to end 'rip-off' charges and are suggesting motorists pay 'significantly less' for street parking on rainy summer days. The scheme, which would be the first of its kind in the UK, is modeled on flexible parking charges schemes in San Francisco and Madrid. It forms part of the Conservative Party manifesto for the May 7 council elections promising, 'A common sense council for Brighton and Hove'. It says: 'We will examine flexible parking charges and the innovative use of technology e.g. introduce significantly cheaper charges in winter, on rainy summer days etc. 'It is bizarre that summer parking rates begin on 1 March.Under the Conservatives summer parking charges will only apply in summer.' But critics have hailed it as an early April Fools' Day joke, given the fickle British summertime weather. Conservative transport spokesman Graham Cox, told The Telegraph the economy relied on the weather and they had to look at ways of attracting people when it was bad. 'If it's a lovely, hot, summer day in June, July or August, the queues in Brighton will stretch up the A23 and every space in town is taken. If it's wet, it's a very different situation,' he said. Every cloud: Conservative councillors in Brighton and Hove are promising to halve the cost of parking on rainy days in summer in a bid to boost tourist numbers . In 2013, business leaders blamed parking charges and poor weather for the plummeting number of visitors to the region during a particularly wet summer. Figures from the Brighton Business Improvement District (BID) showed footfall in the city had dropped by 14 per cent year-on-year. Costly sunshine: Visitors would be charged twice as much to park on sunny days under new proposals by councillors in Brighton . The parking proposal would be based on weather forecasts so if heavy downpours were predicted for a particular weekend, the parking tariffs would be reduced. Motoring organisations said it would confuse drivers and said both tariffs and clear instructions would need putting on street parking signs.","'Significantly cheaper' charges promised during rainy summer days .

"Twitter users are accusing Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart's successor, of antisemitism for comments made about Jews in tweets dating back to 2009. The South African comedian, who is little-known in the United States, rocketed to national fame on Monday after he was named the new host of The Daily Show. But the excitement and curiosity was tinged by a slew of people calling on the 31-year-old - who is a quarter Jewish - to apologize for 'offensive' comments. In May last year, Noah, a contributor to The Daily Show, tweeted: 'Behind every successful Rap Billionaire is a double as rich Jewish man. #BeatsByDreidel.' Accusations: Trevor Noah, the South African and quarter-Jewish comedian taking over The Daily Show, has been accused of antisemitism . This is one of the five tweets dating back to 2009 that bloggers are dragging up and complaining about . A year earlier, he said: 'Note to self - Langostines are not Jewish prawns.' And during a soccer match in January 2012, he joked: 'Messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him, but Messi doesn't go down easy, just like jewish chicks. #ElClasico.' The tweets are now being posted online by enraged bloggers, slamming Noah as 'racist'. One Twitter user said: 'Jon Stewart, born Leibowitz, won't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets.' A blogger posted Noah's tweets in an article, with the comment: 'Trevor Noah, the racist, hack taking over for Jon Stewart is also quite the anti-Semite too. Obama and progressive liberals really will love this guy. Among some of the skits that Trevor Noah came up with was the Black Hitler.' Noah joined The Daily Show as a correspondent just three months ago. He won over viewers with his 'outsider' account of the U.S. 'I never thought I’d be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa. It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days, back home,' he joked during one episode. His dry, cutting humor has been singled out by producers as the winning formula to win over viewers lamenting the end of Stewart's 16-year stint. According to The New York Times, a slew of better-known potential replacements chose to move on to competing networks. However, the reaction to his appointment was overwhelmingly positive. The son of a half-Jewish Xhosa mother and Swiss father, Noah speaks an impressive six languages and is expected to bring a more international perspective to The Daily Show. Viewers have lamented the end of Jon Stewart's 16-year stint on the show . Successor: The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has been named successor to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year . Appearance: In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show (pictured). In 2013, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman . Tough act to follow: Noah was not surprisingly reverent of extremely popular departing host Jon Stewart as he tweeted Monday about the news he's the next host . 'He brings such a unique worldview and a deep understanding of human nature, which makes his comedy so insightful,' Comedy Central president Michele Ganeless told the Times. 'He's truly a student of the world.' Noah also brings a wealth of hosting experience helping him, in Ganeless' words, check 'off every box' on her network's list of requirements. Also important: he has kindred spirit Stewart's blessing. 'All I needed in my life was Jon's blessing. That's what I have, so I'm looking forward to being part of The Best Damn News Show in the World,' he told the AP. Speaking to the Times from Dubai, where's he's completing a comedy tour, Noah said: 'You don't believe it for the first few hours. You need a stiff drink, and then unfortunately you're in a place where you can't really get alcohol.' Born to a black mother and white father in South Africa, 31-year-old Noah was not allowed to live with either parent and even passed off by family as albino because, under apartheid laws, different races could not mix . Trevor Noah, 31, grew up in Soweto, South Africa, the son of a Xhosa mother and Swiss father. 'My mother had to be very clandestine about who my father was,' Noah told the Times. 'He couldn't be on my birth certificate.' For much of his childhood, his African family passed him off as an albino. Under apartheid laws, different races could not mix and he was not allowed to live with either of his parents. He reportedly once cracked to an audience, 'I was born a crime.' Noah began doing stand-up in South Africa in his twenties and has since leveraged his ability to speak six languages into an international career. He's hosted his own late-night show in South Africa, radio shows and awards shows. Noah is also the only South African comedian to ever perform on The Late Show and Tonight Show. But don't be too quick to connect him to the Dark Continent. He told Letterman in 2013: . 'They make it sound like a guy in leopard skin's going to come running on the stage.' Nonetheless, Noah's past is firmly rooted in South Africa's turbulent racial history. 'I didn't live a normal life,' he told the Times. 'I grew up in a country that wasn't normal.' More specifically, Noah says that after he began to do stand-up in his 20s, he quickly became aware that 'speaking freely about anything, as a person of color, was considered treason.' News of his new role spread quickly in South Africa. 'Over the years, Mr. Noah has proved that laughter is the best medicine and has helped our country and its people to find healing through laughing at themselves,' said Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa. 'South Africa is a microcosm of the world and there is no doubt that a global audience will find resonance in his humor,' he added in an email.","Trevor Noah, 31, has been appointed as Jon Stewart's successor .

"With 40 per cent of British choosing not to go on holiday abroad in the past year, it makes sense that the latest host of a TV show being jetted off to exotic locations doesn't want to be there either. Research conducted for Channel 4's new magazine-style show Travel Man claims 40 per cent of Brits have either chosen to take their breaks within the UK or didn't want to go overseas this year. The same survey found 30 per cent of respondents, chosen to reflect a cross section of society, haven't left Britain for the past five years while one in 10 Brits have never been overseas . Travel Man host Richard Ayoade and his guest for the show's first episode, 48 Hours in Barcelona . A significant 40 per cent of Britons didn't go overseas for their holiday in the past year, says a survey . The stress of it all is a big reason for this say 31 per cent of the survey subjects, a sentiment Ayoade can relate to on his mission to make the most of his destinations without the hassle. In the four-part series Ayoade travels with a celebrity guest to Iceland, Istanbul, Marrakech and Barcelona, where his journey begins with similarly non-plussed traveller Kathy Burke. His other celebrity travel companions for subsequent episodes are comedian Adam Hills, actress Jessica Hynes and actor Stephen Mangan . Much like his other show Gadget Man's attitude to life in general, Travel Man aims to get the most he can out of a holiday in the least time. In Barcelona, Ayoade is particularly unimpressed by  the museum at the home of Lionel Messi's Barcelona FC, the Nou Camp, owing to his total disinterest in football. The Channel 4 survey for Travel Man found that 31 per cent of people find the stress of holidays a deterrent . Despite walking being a perfectly effective way to get around the city, Ayoade opts for a Trixi pedicab tour to take in sights such as the Christopher Columbus Monument, Santa Maria Church, and the Nou Camp as efficiently as they can. To get to Barcelonetta beach, Richard goes for a cable car instead of going by car with Kathy. In Istanbul with Adam Hills, they go to the historic Hagia Sophia just before closing time to avoid the crowds and uses the Triposo app to ensure all the necessary information he needs is at his fingertips. Burke and Ayoade visit the Nou Camp, home to Barcelona FC, during the first episode of the new show . And to see as much of Marrakech as possible in a short period of time with Stephen Magain, Richard takes a hot-air balloon ride, use a compass-like trekking guide to find their way around the busy Souks and a currency converter app to aid with haggling. There is no short cut, however, when the pair appear to liven up during a Cava tasting - by actually tasting the famed Catalan sparkling wine. The show's survey found 80 per cent of Brits prefer to test out local food and drink when they go abroad, and 60 per cent attempt to pick up some of the language of the place they're in. Reluctant traveller Ayoade looks for short-cuts on holiday such as the cable car to Barcelonetta beach . Perhaps a surprise to many is that only 32 per cent of Brits will chose a break at the beach over a city break while 38 per cent of respondents have been back to a previous holiday destination. Australia is apparently the dream holiday destination for UK residents, however 23 per cent of us always choose somewhere within Europe to take leave time. Age and geography are other significant factor for travel, with 16 to 34-year-olds going on holiday the most (more than twice in the last year). Travel Man: 48 Hours in Barcelona is on Monday night at 8.30pm on Channel 4. .","Survey conducted by Channel 4 for the new programme Travel Man .

"Proud pose: Tory poster boy Afzal Amin, in ceremonial Army uniform, whose political career is in ruins . Afzal Amin was to be the Tories’ poster boy at the General Election. But his political career was in ruins last night as he suffered the shame of being suspended from the party over his self-serving plot to win votes by stirring up racial hatred. It is a spectacular fall from grace for a politician from a humble background who seemed set for high office with the Conservatives but is now a victim of his over-reaching political ambition. Amin was the first ethnic minority candidate to be chosen for this year’s poll, and has been pictured alongside Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The 40-year-old has appeared on the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme four times and was praised when he spoke out against the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby by Islamists, insisting that Muslims were an ‘integral part’ of Britain. Despite his ambitions, Amin – who is married with two teenage children – has not been afraid to criticise Conservative Party bosses. Last year he admitted that many ethnic minority voters in his target seat of Dudley North, held by a Labour majority of just 649, think that the Tories ‘remain a racist party’. And he told a newspaper that British society and political leaders as well as community leaders must share the blame for the ‘jihad generation’ that is travelling to Syria to join murderous Islamic State. His high-profile position with the Conservatives and sought-after views contrast markedly with his humble beginnings. Amin was brought up in the deprived Black Country town of Smethwick, where the Tories had once infamously used openly racist slogans on election leaflets. He left school with practically no qualifications and took a series of menial jobs, including being a waiter, before going to university in London as a mature student. His fortunes changed in 2001 when he was selected to attend training at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He rose to the rank of captain and saw active service in Iraq and did three tours in Afghanistan. Role model: A campaign poster encouraging youngsters to canvass for him . Influential: With Justin Welby at a seminar about sex crimes in war last year . High profile: Meeting George Osborne at train manufacturer Bombardier in Derby . Spokesman: Interviewed on BBC News about the murder of Lee Rigby and the effect on the Muslim community . Later moving into an educational role, he says he was a personal tutor to Princes William and Harry, as well as serving as chairman of the Armed Forces Muslim Association. After leaving the Army he set up a consultancy called The Curzon Education Ltd, which won a £120,000 grant to give lectures to schoolchildren about the role of Commonwealth soldiers in the First World War. It sparked controversy as the grant was given by the Department for Communities, where his ‘political acquaintance’ Baroness Warsi was a Minister. Mr Amin worked at the Army’s Counterinsurgency And Stabilisation Centre and has given lectures at the UK Defence Academy. He describes himself on Twitter as ‘International Conflict and Stabilisation Adviser Government Strategist Fragile States.’ On the photosharing website Flickr he posted a picture of himself meeting Sir Nicholas Soames – Winston Churchill’s MP grandson – and wrote: ‘In late 2003 I was working on anti-hijacking operations in Southern Basra. We were visited by Sir Nicholas Soames MP whom I briefed about our work tackling gangs with Iraqi police.’ Harry, Wills... and a vicious assault . Afzal Amin: Yeah he [a reference to a man involved in the 2011 riots] punched a guy in the face. Who hasn’t done that? The difference between you and me is one thing: I haven’t been caught. LAUGHS . …Even in Windsor, I was Education Officer for Prince Harry and Prince William, I headbutted a guy, his face exploded. But when the police turned up they see me in a suit – cashmere suit with a briefcase and they see this guy hoodie up, cap on. Male [a friend of Amin]: What was he doing? AA: Wheeling all over the place... They can’t work out why would the guy in the suit crack that guy? Amin, pictured left, in Basra with fellow officers and MP Sir Nicholas Soames, boasted of being the Princes William and Harry's Education Officer . ‘I’m not a Paki, am I?’ AA: I’ll have tandoori prawn for the main. Can you make it as mild as possible? Waiter: It’s marinated in the spice already. AA: Yeah can you rinse it off? Tommy Robinson: You don’t like spicy food? AA: No, I’m not a Paki am I? Newsnight boasts . Naim Akhtar [AA’s friend, talking about a Conservative gathering of ‘your white, working class people.’]: Out of all the people that were there Afzal says to me, ‘Let’s wait here, he’ll come to us.’ David Cameron walked up to us and said, ‘Afzal, how are you? How is your campaign?’ We had a good five or 10-minute chat, the way we’re chatting now. Out of all the people in the room... AA: They know who I am. Naim: They know him. The only candidate in the whole of the UK who’s been on Newsnight four times. AA: They’ve already asked me what sort of committees do you want to serve on, they’re that sure I’m going to win.","Star Asian Tory candidate planned fake English Defence League demo .

"The Budget has failed to provide a Tory bounce – but if the economy stays on track until the Election, David Cameron could still win. Labour is four points ahead of the Conservatives, but would be out of sight by now if the party had a better leader than Ed Miliband. Astonishingly, if the Election was a presidential style head to head, more than one in eight Labour voters would choose Mr Cameron. The Budget has failed to provide a Tory bounce – but if the economy stays on track until the Election, David Cameron (pictured) could still win . A total of 13 per cent of Labour supporters opted for Cameron, but only 2 per cent of Tories choose Miliband. The Survation poll carried out for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 34 points, the Tories on 30, Ukip on 17 and the Lib Dems on ten. A total of 1,008 people took part in the online survey on Friday and Saturday. Asked to choose between the Tories and Labour, Labour clearly wins. But when voters are asked to choose between Cameron and Miliband, Cameron wins by 42 per cent to 33. There have recently been claims by some Tory MPs that the Budget was ‘too dull’, and Australian-born Election guru Lynton Crosby has been criticised by Ministers including Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith for ‘lack of vision’. But the poll suggests that his strategy, which relies on a late pro-Tory swing by voters worried that Labour will wreck the recovery, could yet work. Labour is four points ahead of the Conservatives, but would be out of sight by now if the party had a better leader than Ed Miliband, the poll shows . A total of 16 per cent of non-Tory voters say they could still change their mind and vote Conservative if the economy stays on track. Following the Chancellor’s decision to help pay for celebrations to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt, where Henry V defeated the French, voters were asked which of the four main leaders would have done best in the battle. Excluding the ‘don’t knows’, Ukip leader Nigel Farage won – scoring 44 – followed by Cameron on 32, Miliband on 16 and Clegg coming in last on only eight.","If economy stays on track until the Election, David Cameron could still win .

"The Iraqi man who was shot dead in Dallas while photographing his first ever snowfall had arrived just three weeks prior after saving up for a year, his devastated family has revealed. Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, was fatally shot as he played in the snow with his wife and brother-in-law at their apartment complex last Wednesday. Police have not yet arrested any suspects. Al-Jumaili had married his wife Zahraa Altaie just a month before she left Iraq for Texas and Al-Jumaili had saved for more than a year to be able to afford to join her, CBS News reported. Fearful of terrorist activity in their country, he worked hard providing Internet connections to Iraqi homes so he could head to America, according to his father-in-law Mohammed Altaae. Torn apart: Ahmed Al-Jumaili (right) was shot dead just 20 days after arriving in the U.S., where he was reunited with his wife Zahara (right). He had saved up for more than a year to be able to join her . Devastated: His father-in-law Mohammed Altaae wept as he described how the young couple had just wanted to start building their life together after more than a year apart and have children together . His wife had moved to the Dallas area to be near family members and her husband joined her just 20 days before he was murdered. He had a car and was looking for a job, his father-in-law said. 'For a young man and a young woman, oh God, so many dreams together,' Altaae told CBS. 'They wanted to have children and educate them well. It was the dreams of young people. 'We're looking for safe place... What he got was a bullet in his heart.' Authorities have released surveillance footage showing four men in their 20s walking from the complex on Wednesday but so far no arrests have been made. Police do not yet know if Al-Jumaili was targeted or was the victim of random gunfire. Widowed: His distraught wife Zahara is pictured outside the Dallas apartment they shared with her family . Refuge: Just weeks earlier, the couple had been reunited as Al-Jumaili joined his wife in the United States . Dallas police Major Jeff Cotner said two of the four wanted men were armed and, without exchanging any words with the group, fired bullets across the complex. Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Dallas and Fort Worth area, explained in an account on Facebook that Al-Jumaili had taken cover behind a pickup truck when the men opened fire - but a bullet pierced the truck and struck him. Al-Jumaili was shot in the chest and rushed to hospital, where he passed away the following day. 'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.' In security footage that captured the men, one appears to be carrying a firearm by his side. They are seen running separately through the snow. Cotner told CBS that while it does not appear the shooting was a hate crime, it is a possibility they are investigating, among others. Look familiar? Police in Dallas have released this security footage of potential suspects in the shooting . Possible involved: Witnesses previously reported seeing four male suspects aged in their 20s enter the gates of the Walnut Bend Apartments complex. Men fitting the description were captured on nearby cameras . Truck: Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when shots rang out, but a bullet pierced straight through the truck (photographed) and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest . A LaunchGood fundraising page explains Al-Jumaili and Zahara married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State. The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees. The fundraiser has raised more than $29,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment. Salem said the Council on American-Islamic Relations has raised an additional $7,000 reward for information to help in the investigation into the killing.

"A Russian motorist was shocked to discover his £5,000 car had been frozen solid in a block of ice after leaving it parked on the side of the street during a heavy snow storm. Vlad Pokrovski, 32, left his Lada Priora parked in a small ditch beside a block of flats in the city of Saratov, south-west Russia. The small ditch filled with water overnight and by the time Pokroviski had returned to the car in the morning, the water had frozen solid above the level of the wheels. Vlad Pokrovski parked his £5,000 Lada, pictured, in a drainage ditch overnight outside a block of flats . When Pokrovski returned to his car the following morning he discovered it was frozen in a block of ice . The water flooded into the car, almost covering the seats, pictured, before it froze into a solid lump . Pokrovski asked several of his friends and neighbours to help him try to free the car, but after an hour of trying to chip away at the solid block of ice, they were forced to give up after temperatures plummeted to minus 30 Celsius. Pokrovski said: ""We tried pouring hot water over it but that just froze and made it worse. 'We then tried hacking the ice away with spades and knives, but it is so hard some of them broke.' He then called a local car garage to see if they could help, and was told it would be a waste of time. Garage owner Andrey Teliatev, 45, said: 'I'm not even sure its worth trying to get free. 'The engine will be dead from being flooded and I don't think it can be repaired. 'In fact, repairing it would cost about the same as getting a new one.' Pokrovski added: 'I can't believe this. 'If I hadn't parked in that ditch this would never have happened, but who would have thought it? 'I guess the snow must have melted and then when the temperatures fell froze.' Pokrovski's mechanic warned that after such an ordeal it would be cheaper to buy a new car . Pokrovski said he tried pouring boiling water over the ice but it froze instantly making the situation worse .","Vlad Pokrovski parked his car overnight in a drainage ditch in Russia .

"The expenses cheat congressman who decorated his office in the style of Downton Abbey has compared himself to Abraham Lincoln as he finally quit office. Aaron Schock predicted in his farewell address on Thursday that like another Republican representative from Illinois who once held his seat, he would ultimately persevere. Schock said he would leave Capitol Hill with 'sadness and humility', but he knows that 'God has a plan for' everyone. He offered no apology to other members of Congress, his constituents or taxpayers for a litany of lavish claims. Schock's downfall came after a Washington Post reporter discovered that he had redecorated his office in the style of acclaimed British television show Downton Abbey to the tune of $40,000, paid for by the taxpayer. Details of more lavish spending, including taking a private jet to Chicago for an NFL match - then billing it as 'software' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . SHAMED: Congressman Aaron Schock was revealed to be a lavish spender and offered a valedictory speech today which contained no apology but compared him to Lincoln . 'GOOD LUCK TONIGHT': Schock tweeted this Instagram selfie with singer Ariana Grande, 21, before the American  Music Awards in November . IPHONE AT THE READY FOR HIS HOLINESS: Schock posted online a photo of him greeting Pope Francis in January on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp . Another trip saw him take a group of 20, including several interns to New York for a Katy Perry concert at a cost of $10,000. It was one of a series of celebrity events he attended and which were posted on his Instagram, featuring Arianna Grande and even Pope Francis. It was billed by Schock as a 'very legitimate trip' as it coincided with a visit to the city by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He then posted a picture of himself with the Indian leader. The final blow was when Politico discovered that Schock had wrongly reported and been reimbursed for mileage on his personal vehicle - bought at taxpayers' expense. But he acknowledged nothing of that in his speech, instead using it to say he was going through 'defeats' like Lincoln - the president nicknamed 'Honest Abe' throughout his political career for his utter personal integrity. 'I also know that every person faces adversity in life. Abraham Lincoln held this seat in Congress in one term. But few faced as many defeats in his personal, business and public life as he did,' Schock said. FIRE YOURSELF: Schock bragged on Instagram in November after he met with real estate tycoon and possible presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Trump Tower office . 'THE PRESIDENTIAL': Schock's congressional office budget covered more than $5,000 for this custom podium, styled after the one President Obama uses when he's on the road . 'His continual perseverance in the face of these trials, never giving up, is something all of us Americans should be inspired by, especially when going through a valley in life.' A rising star in the Republican Party, and one of the youngest members of Congress from either political party, the flashy congressman, first attempted to weather the storm - hiring top-level communications strategists to help him beat back the charges - before announcing he would quit hours after his mileage claims came to light. In exiting Congress swiftly Schock avoided an ethics investigation from his peers. He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. Technically a Member of Congress until the end of the month, Schock said goodbye to his constituents and colleagues today as representatives prepared to head home for a two and a half week long recess built around the Easter holiday. The nearest he came to an apology was to speak of 'humility'. 'I was never more excited than the day I walked into this chamber six years ago. I leave here with sadness and humility,' Schock said on the House floor. 'For those whom I've let down, I will work tirelessly to make it up to you.' He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. Lincoln was first nicknamed Honest Abe when he was a store clerk in Springfield, Illinois, and the epithet stuck with him throughout his life. He used it as the 1859 presidential campaign slogan. RED IS THE COLOR:The lavish design appointments earned Schock snickers . REP. HARDBODY: Schock made a splash in May 2011 with this Men's Health magazine cover . Schock was correct that they had represented the same seat but Lincoln's sole term was not because he had to resign or because the voters kicked him out - he in fact was standing by his pledge that he would serve only one term. A Whig at the time he served in the federal legislature, Lincoln went on to become the 16th President of the United States, a position he held while the country was immersed in its first, and only, civil war. His Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in Confederate, southern states fighting against the Union. Sounding more optimistic than humiliated, Schock said today that he believes 'through life's struggles, we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves.' 'And I know that this is not the end of a story, but rather the beginning of a new chapter,' he added. 'Thank you for the honor to serve,' he said in at the conclusion of his remarks, nothing that he looks forward to keeping in touch with both his friends in Congress and in his district. He then left the House chamber - and an empty coffee cup, violating the legislature's rules - to applause. According to the Hill, three of his Republican colleagues - Jason Smith of Missouri, Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Mark Sanford of South Carolina - were waiting in the wings for him as he gave his speech. Sanford memorably rose from the ashes to take back his old congressional seat after leaving his state's governor's office in disgrace several years before. Following his first stint in Congress Sanford was elected and reelected as governor of South Carolina before he was caught cheating on his wife with an Argentinian mistress whom he later proposed to but never married. Still beloved in South Carolina by some of his former constituents Sanford reclaimed his House seat via a special election in 2013 and achieved reelection last fall. He ironically shares the same birthday with Schock. After Shock announced his resignation, his father said: 'Two years from now he’ll be successful, if he’s not in jail.'","Aaron Schock quit  after his expenses claims came to light - and avoided an ethics probe .

"Happy: Abbi Jillians has been given a pink hand through the pioneering 3D printer technology . The first thing four-year-old Abbi Jillians wanted to do when scientists gave her a new hand was brush her Barbie doll’s hair. The youngster – who was born with a just a thumb on her left hand – has been given the pink hand through the pioneering 3D printer technology. She has now been using her new hand to pick up objects around her house, ride her bike, and even pinch her dad on the bottom. Full-time mum Julie Jillians, of Tavistock, Devon, started a campaign to find local access to a 3D printer three months ago and said the new hand had revolutionised her daughter’s life. The 47-year-old said: ‘When we got home, the first thing she did was pick up her dolly so she could brush her hair with two hands. ‘That is one thing she always wanted to do. She had always loved her dolls and wanted to dress them - but I ended up always having to do it for her. ‘It is amazing and wonderful to see her do it herself. She is just like any other girl - Barbie is her favourite. ‘This is just so special for Abbi. The smile on my daughter’s face is from ear to ear with a bow round the back. ‘I am now finding things all over the house. There are apples upstairs. She’s even managed to pinch her daddy’s bum. ‘It’s fantastic. The determination on her face is the sweetest thing, and the fact she’s willing to receive the hand and willing to work at learning to use it.’ The hand works by opening and closing when Abbi bends her wrist up or down. It has a Velcro which straps around her palm and the gauntlet sits on her arm. Abbi had an operation at 18 months old, taking parts of her toes to give her a bigger palm, and replacing the toes with hip bone. But her mother said she and husband Jim, 34, would not consider any more operations after seeing the success of her hand. She said: ‘It is fantastic and we just can’t stop her using it. She wants to wear it all the time and cannot believe what she has now got. New lease: Julie Jillians says the pink hand has changed Abbi's life and the four-year-old has been testing out the new kit by picking things up and putting them down all over the house . Abbi's hand costs around £50 in materials to print a hand, so new limbs can be created as she grows . ‘She is still building up her strength and getting used to it - and she cannot hold anything too heavy. ‘But she is going around picking everything up, from cups to fruit, and playing with all the toys she was never able to before. ’She loves dress-up as well and is finding that a lot easier now she has two hands. Abbi's hand is among designs available on a global database of 3D printer prosthetics and comes in 30 colours. It was printed in around 20 pieces which were put together with elastic bands before a professional helped to fit it. The hand is attached to Abbi’s arm with Velcro straps. She can control it by twisting her wrist to tighten the bands. The 3D printer was provided by IT firm Midwich, and the Enabling The Future website printed it out and helped fit it. A Midwich spokesman said NHS prosthetics were usually for aesthetic purposes only and did not move or grip. He added that it costs around £50 in materials to print a hand, so new limbs can be created as a child grows. ‘She was never able to ride a bike before as her hands would slip off the handlebars. But she is now riding it around the house. ‘The technology is fantastic. The more she gets to use it, the stronger her wrist and arm will become. There is no way I would consider another operation for her now - this is just way too functional. ‘Because her muscles aren’t as developed in that arm, we keep having to take it off her so she doesn’t overdo it. But in time the muscles will get stronger and she’ll be able to use it more and more. ‘It’s not going to be a permanent fixture on her arm but it’s there as and when she needs two hands.’ Abbi, who is in reception class at school, said of her new hand: ‘I love wearing it so much. I want to wear it forever and ever.’ Mrs Jillians launched the appeal for organisations with a 3D printer to help Abbi, and the FabLab at Plymouth College of Art, with the help of IT firm Midwitch, came forward. The family has since raised nearly £4,000 to get a nearby school kitted out with a 3D printer to help other children in a similar position to Abbi.","Abbi Jillians, 4, was born with just a thumb on her left hand .

"The Arizona aid worker who was killed while being held captive by ISIS in Syria was honored with a moving memorial service in her hometown on Saturday. Kayla Mueller, 26, was captured in August of 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, and held for 18 months. It is believed she was killed by Jordanian airstrikes targeting ISIS in Raqqa last month. About 500 people, including Arizona Senator John McCain, attended a ceremony in an auditorium at Yavapai College in Prescott that was held to honor the memory of 'the ultimate Good Samaritan'. Scroll down for video . Kayla Mueller, 26, was honored with a memorial at Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona, on Saturday . Her father, Carl Mueller (right), addressed  the service with some assistance from Kayla's brother Eric (left) Arizona Senator John McCain spoke to about 500 people at the ceremony . Speakers at the ceremony reminisced about Kayla's quick wit and an overflowing heart. Kayla's father, Carl Mueller, read a moving letter at the service, recounting his daughter's discovery that her life's purpose was to ease the suffering of others. Mr Mueller paused to regain his composure as he read the letter his daughter wrote while working an earlier job at an orphanage in India. As her father struggled to get through a particular passage, Kayla's brother Eric rubbed his shoulders. He quoted his daughter as saying: 'This is my life's work. But my family is my life.' Kayla's family members thanked the soldiers who risked their lives in a rescue attempt for her. They also tried to bring some levity to the ceremony and Kayla's father, dressed in a  dark suit and tie, made sure to lift up the legs of his pants to show off the rainbow socks he found in her room. Her parents have started a nonprofit organization called 'Kayla's Hands' designed to further her humanitarian efforts locally and internationally. Kayla was captured by ISIS in August of 2013 in Aleppo, Syria and held for 18 months before being killed . Kayla helped raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and worked the overnight shift at a women's shelter in Prescott . Sen. McCain's voice cracked with emotion as he delivered a short tribute to Mueller. He said 'I didn't have the privilege - the blessing - of knowing Kayla. I wish I had. 'I'd be a better man for knowing her. I'm sure of that. 'But her example of compassion and courage, her generosity, her unbowed humanity, have by her terrible sacrifice and her dignity in extremity reached so many people who did not know her as all of you knew her. 'We can try to give justice to her murderers' other victims and their families. 'But even if we succeed, and our retribution is swift and complete, we could not equal the rebuke that Kayla's life gave to the culture of death that robbed her of it. 'I never knew Kayla. That's my loss. But I won't forget her. That's my privilege and my responsibility.' Mr Mueller read a letter at the service revealing the discovery that Kayla's purpose was to ease suffering . Emotions ran high during the ceremony yesterday and Mr Mueller had to be comforted by his son (right) ISIS released images of a badly-damaged building in which they claimed Kayla had been killed by an airstrike . A slideshow at the ceremony flashed images of happy moments in Kayla's life. Childhood photos showed her on a camping trip, standing next to a snowman and laughing as a dog sat straight up in a chair at the table during a meal. Other images showed Kayla as an adult, affectionately nudging her face on a horse's neck in one photo and, in another frame, bending down to smell flowers. In her hometown, Kayla helped raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and volunteered for the overnight shift at a women's shelter. She protested genocide in Darfur, Sudan, while in college at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. She also traveled to the Palestinian territories, Israel, India and France. Sen. McCain said: 'We can try to give justice to her murderers' other victims and their families' The Arizona Diamondbacks wore a patch with 'KAYLA' on it during spring training games earlier this month . Sen. McCain's voice cracked with emotion as he delivered a short tribute to Mueller during the ceremony . Kayla and her Syrian boyfriend were both taken hostage. He was released, but he returned to Syria to try to free her. She became interested in Syria after her boyfriend told about the struggles of refugees there. Her death was confirmed Feb. 10 by her family and US officials. The Arizona Diamondbacks wore a black patch with 'KAYLA' on it during spring training games earlier this month. Team President Derrick Hall said the way the young humanitarian 'gave back to the world around her embodied many of the core values' of the Diamondbacks organization. He said Kayla 'will always have a place in the history of Arizona' and that the Diamondbacks are 'deeply saddened by her loss.' Kayla is the fourth American to die while being held by ISIS. Three others - two journalists and an aid worker - were beheaded. In each case, their captors demanded huge ransoms, which the United States has refused to pay, saying doing so would only encourage more kidnappings. President Barack Obama has defended that policy, although he has said it was extremely difficult to explain it to victims' families.

"Officials in Norway are warning anyone planning to visit the islands of Svalbard to witness this week's solar eclipse that polar bears are on the prowl in the Arctic region. The islands are said to be the ideal location to witness Friday's phenomenon due to its location in the eclipse's path and the low pollution in the area. However, the islands are also home to about 3,000 polar bears - the earth's largest land carnivore, and the area's tourist website cautions they attack without warning. Warning: The islands of Svalbard are said to be the best place on earth to watch Friday's eclipse - but they are also home to about 3,000 polar bears, which are known to attack without warning . British teenager Horatio Chapple, a pupil at Eton College, was killed by a polar bear on Svalbard during a schools trek in 2011. Christin Kristoffersen, mayor of Svalbard's main settlement Longyearbyen, said she expected 1,500 visitors for the eclipse, on top of its 2,500 residents, meaning the numbers on the archipelago had reached a maximum safe limit. 'Safety comes first, even before the eclipse,' she said. 'We need to take care of people. It's terribly cold in March and wehave the challenge with polar bears.' Meanwhile, in Germany experts said the eclipse will be a good test of the country's electricity grid, which relies increasingly on renewable energy. The partial eclipse affecting Germany is expected to cause a sudden drop and then a surge in solar-generated power, which contributed almost 6 percent to Germany's energy mix last year. In Britain, some parts of the country will experience as much as 97 per cent darkness, and outdoor events will be held nationwide as people gather to gaze heavenwards at 8.45am. During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse. Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole. The next similar eclipse will not take place over Britain until August 2026.","People visiting Svalbard told to watch out for polar bears during eclipse .

"A high school junior has told of her anger after being suspended from school over dying her hair a 'normal color'. Savannah Keesee from Farmington, Missouri, used a Garnier brand dye kit to permanently color her auburn hair to a 'deep ultra-intense red' while she was snowed in at home with her mother. However, when the teenager returned to classes at West St. Francis County R-4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue and told her new coiffure violated the school's grooming code. Her mane was apparently branded 'distracting', 'bright' and 'orange' by members of staff. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Savannah Keesee from Farmington, Missouri, used a Garnier-brand dye kit to permanently color her auburn hair to a 'deep ultra intense red' while she was snowed in at home with her mother . While the school rules state that non-natural hair colors are not permitted, Savannah argues that her shoulder-length hair isn't purple, green or blue and only a little brighter than her natural shade. Her 40-year-old mother - who had a helping hand in the transformation - concurs. 'I dyed it auburn, which is what was on the box. And auburn to me is natural, just like strawberry blonde or blonde, or black or brown,' she told KTVI News. 'She just wanted it a little bit different. We had a bunch of snow days, and did some girl stuff and dyed her hair.' The mother and daughetr didn't expect any objection to the dye. However, when the teenager returned to classes at West St. Francis County R-4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue and told her new 'orange' coiffure violated the school's dress and grooming code. In writing: Indeed, the rules state that non-natural hair colors are not permitted . Speaking out: However Savannah argues that her shoulder-length hair isn't purple, green or blue and only a little brighter than her natural shade Her 40-year-old mother (pictured) agrees . But Savannah said that the principal told her to call her mother on Tuesday to be picked up. She then tried to return to lessons the following day but was instructed to stay at home because her hair remained unchanged. West St. Francois County superintendent Stacy Stevens said she couldn't comment specifically on Savannah's situation, but he says the hair color policy has been in place for decades. 'We try to work with the students to be fair. We don't want them out of school, we don't typically have issues with this policy. I think our students and parents are accepting of it. It's been in place a long time, and I think it's a policy that works.' Savannah refuses to dye her hair back to its original color as a matter of principal. She plans to appeal the principal and superintendent’s decision and take it before the school board. Her mother, meanwhile, wishes the school would worry about bigger issues. 'Instead of maybe picking up on the bullying, and kids who are actually causing trouble, its hair color,' she concluded. Superintendent Stacy Steven has since told DailyMail.com that the hair dye issue has been resolved but she was 'unable to go into specifics'.","Savannah Keesee from Farmington, Missouri, used a Garnier-brand dye kit to permanently color her auburn hair while she was snowedin at home .

"Killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was concerned he was losing his eyesight, possibly because of a detached retina - with his vision already restricted to 30 per cent, it was claimed today. The condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients - and is often marked by flashes in the eye. Earlier today, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Lubitz was living ‘on the edge’ because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot’s licence. Scroll down for video . Madness: Lubitz was 'on the edge' over his deteriorating eyesight, fearing it would cost him his pilot's licence . Health issues: Lubitz , 27, pictured masked his true condition from his employers and was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was . A detached retina causes blurred vision and without treatment it can lead to blindness. German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that it was unclear whether Lubitz’s vision problems had physical or psychological causes. Meanwhile, another report in France from Le Figaro claimed Lubitz’s vision was at just 30 per cent at the time of the crash, which saw the 27-year-old fly his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside. The Mail  told how investigators believe his eyesight problems - coupled with a breakdown in his relationship with his long-term girlfriend - triggered the ‘madness’ that ended in mass murder. Lubitz masked his true condition – described by police as ‘severe burnout syndrome’ – from his employers and was aided by German confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was. But police still don’t know whether his vision problems, which are understood to have begun several years ago, were caused by his psychological condition or whether, as one officer said, he was in fact ‘slowly going blind’. It is understood he once planned to marry pretty blonde teacher Kathrin Goldbach, 26, but she called time on his increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour which made her fearful for her own safety during his rages. One friend said: ‘He tried to order her what to wear, what men she could speak to, even the length of her skirts. He was a control freak of the highest order.’ Another friend added: ‘She said he was very kind and attentive, but that he had problems with mood swings. And I think we sensed that she became more fearful over time.’ The break, according to friends, came just weeks ago. She still lived with him but it is understood she was on the lookout for a bachelor-girl flat. Frantic that he would lose her, Lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two Audi cars. He took delivery of one vehicle just five days before Tuesday’s horror. Break: Kathrin Goldbach still lived with Lubitz in his Dusseldorf flat (pictured) but was looking for a new place . His obsessive need to be in charge extended even to fast food. Habib Hassani, who runs a pizza restaurant near Lubitz’s Dusseldorf home, said: ‘He was extremely particular about pizza toppings. 'He wasn’t interested in what was on the menu. It was often paprika, ham, onion and broccoli. He had to have it his way. He was compulsive about it.’ Yesterday, it was revealed by police that Lubitz suffered from a ‘severe psychosomatic sickness’ that required the care of several neurologists and psychologists. Police said they took away a plethora of medicines from his apartment in Dusseldorf and from his parental home in the small Rhineland town of Montabaur. Police have moved to seize the confidential medical records of the mass killer hitherto protected by labyrinthine privacy laws in Germany. They particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his A320 Airbus into a French mountainside, killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew. Desperate: Frantic that he would lose her, Lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two Audi cars . On Friday, it was revealed that his illness was so chronic that he had multiple sick notes from doctors, including one issued to him for the day of the disaster, discarded and ripped up in his home. The disintegration of his eyesight, according to investigators, fuelled his chronic anxiety that his flying career – the career he lived for since he was a teenager – was coming to an end. As the jigsaw puzzle of his complex and disturbed personality was reconstructed by investigators, the agony of his murder-suicide mission struck at the heart of his home town of Montabaur, for ever changed because of the actions of a Jekyll and Hyde figure whose warped personality made him lead two lives. On the surface, he projected stability, confidence and calm: the cool pilot who turned up at his grandparents’ home wearing his crisp Germanwings uniform. He was a fanatical runner, and he liked discos, cars, cooking and music. Recovery: Rescue helicopters continued to search the French Alps today for further signs of wreckage . But his insecurity demanded constant attention – which led him to betray Kathrin with a five-month fling with a Germanwings stewardess conducted in cheap hotels where they stayed while working. ‘He was always seeking assurances about the way he looked and the way he was viewed by others,’ said the former lover, identified only as Maria, 26. She painted a portrait of a ‘tormented and erratic’ man who would wake up from nightmares screaming: ‘We’re going down, we’re going down!’ She added: ‘He once told me he would do something to change the whole system, that the world would know his name and remember him.’ He lived up to the macabre promise when he smashed his aircraft into a mountainside on Tuesday when the emotional volcano within him finally erupted. His mind disorders, despite treatment, could no longer be restrained. A spokesman for Lufthansa, the parent company of the budget airline, said the carrier was unaware of a psychosomatic or any other illness affecting Lubitz. Last morning with my love, my Prince... heartbreaking tribute to British victim . Anguish: Anneli Tiirik with boyfriend Paul Bramley in a previous photograph . The grief-stricken girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane tragedy has revealed a poignant last photo of the young couple together. Anneli Tiirik took to Facebook to post the image of her final morning with Paul Bramley, 28. Alongside, she wrote: ‘Last morning with my love, my best friend, my protector, my prince.’ The photo emerged as Mr Bramley’s father made an emotional appeal for the 150 dead not to be forgotten and demanded airlines be more ‘transparent’. Yesterday, a distraught Philip Bramley visited the monument erected near where the Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed. His son was one of three Britons who lost their lives. Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on Tuesday, Mr Bramley said: ‘What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don’t want it to be forgotten, ever.’ He added: ‘I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children’s lives in their hands. I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.’ Many people took to Facebook to offer Ms Tiirik condolences in response to the photo she posted, with one friend saying ‘he was the best guy you could ever meet’. Ms Tiirik, who is from Estonia, replied: ‘Thank you! He was. It is a big loss for everyone. How it can [sic] be that the most lively and positive person there ever was can be taken from us in this way... I just don’t understand.’ Mr Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with Ms Tiirik. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days’ holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family.","Andreas Lubitz feared deteriorating vision would cost him pilot's licence .

"The 'quiet beer' that turned into an impromptu tip to Thailand has described it as 'a truly crazy experience', with a series of photos revealing the exploits of two Middlesbrough men who have become an internet sensation. Phillip Boyle and friend Jamie Blyth made headlines all over the world when it was revealed that a drink in their local pub turned into an all-nighter and a flight out to the Far East. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Boyle has revealed how the madness continued throughout the duration of the two-day trip - not all of it positive though. Phillip Boyle (right) booked a trip to Thailand with friend Jamie Blyth (left) after a night in Middlesbrough . 'Going out there was the roughest part in all honesty, as we were both suffering from hangovers, but once we got to Thailand, we threw ourselves into it,' said the 33-year-old company director. 'It was a crazy decision to make, booking flights out there after a session on the beers, but I don't regret it at all, it was a brilliant trip and a truly crazy experience. 'We knew some lads out there, and there's a big community from the UK, so it was great to catch up with people. 'We were out all the time, going for meals and having drinks in bars and pubs, we didn't get the chance to travel around much.' Mr Boyle, who paid £550 for a return flight and £60 for a two-night stay in Pattaya, revealed that he decided to upgrade his luggage after only heading out with a Tesco bag 'full of boxers and T-shirts'. The pair of friends from Middlesbrough met up with David Lamb (right) in the Robin Hood pub in Bangkok . Mr Boyle (left) had his trainers stolen; Mr Blyth (right) grabs some much needed rest before the flight home . 'When I got there I bought a bag and some trainers from Levis,' he added. However, on checking out of one hotel after their first night's stay, Mr Boyle fell on some hard luck. 'We were checking out, and there was a bit of confusion. One guy started to get involved in the conversation, we had no idea who he was. Phillip Boyle, 33, (far left) and friend Jamie Blyth, 33, (second left) pictured with friends they met in Thailand . The pair flew from Manchester Airport to Pattaya, Thailand with a stopover in Abu Dhabi . 'The next minute I looked down and my trainers had gone - he must have had his eye on them and that's why he came over.' Determined not to let the theft ruin his holiday, Mr Boyle continued the party - matching up shorts with a pair of black shoes. 'We got to Bangkok, and decided we had to get a motorbike as the taxi wasn't going anywhere and it was really busy,' he added. 'But there was no way I was getting on one barefoot, so I reached into my bag and pulled out my brogues and off we went.' Blyth and Boyle chill out with an old friend over some beers in Bangkok, while right, a bleary-eyed Blyth makes his way into a taxi . The friends relax in the airport lounge on the way back from Thailand after their epic two-day trip . The pair had arranged through Facebook to meet an old friend, David Lamb, who was in Thailand at the time. The friends used to play football in the UK with Mr Lamb, who works in Australia and was visiting Thailand following a wedding. 'It was great to catch up with people we knew, and it was just a brilliant trip,' added Mr Boyle. 'It was definitely worth doing for the sheer craic of it.' It's been somewhat of a comedown for Mr Boyle since he returned to the UK on Monday, and he has found himself behind with his work. 'Going away has meant I've let some people down in work terms, and that's never easy,' he added. 'I'm finding myself a bit behind now, but I wouldn't swap our experience for anything.' His friend, however, might have some more pressing explaining to do, as Mr Boyle explained. 'Jamie's got a girlfriend, and it was a real battle just to get hold of his passport to head out to Thailand. 'But it's only two days we were out there, not two weeks, so I'm hoping he should be OK.'","Phillip Boyle, Jamie Blyth booked trip to Thailand after night of drinking .

"A San Francisco sheriff's deputy who was accused of forcing inmates to perform sex acts on him in 2006 is now alleged to have organized 'gladiator style' fights between prisoners. Deputy Scott Neu was accused of orchestrating two fights at County Jail No. 4 between inmates Ricardo Palikiko Garcia and Stanley Harris as deputies placed bets on the outcome, Jeff Adachi, the city's public defender, said on Thursday. Three other deputies Evan Staehely, Eugene Jones and Clifford Chiba have also been accused of forcing the inmates to fight. The alleged matches took place in March when Garcia and Harris were promised hamburgers if they won, or were threatened with Mace, handcuffed beatings and transfers to dangerous housing quarters if they refused to fight, according to a report. Scroll down for video . San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi (above during a press conference on March 26, 2015) has alleged that Deputy Scott Neu is ringleader behind organized fights between inmates that took place in March . Neu was the subject of two sexual assault lawsuits in 2006 and 2008, which were settled out of court. All four deputies have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation. 'These revelations are sickening,' said Adachi. 'Deputy Neu forced these young men to participate in gladiator-style fights for his own sadistic entertainment.' Ricardo Palikiko Garcia, 23, pictured, said Neu forced him to fight and promised him hamburgers if he won and beatings if he refused . Garcia, 23, told investigators that he does not know why Neu does it but believes he gets a kick out of it, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 'It looks like it brings him joy by doing this, while we’re suffering by what he’s doing,' he said. Garcia, who weighs 150-lb, said he was forced twice to fight Harris, who weights 350-lb. Both men were injured in the bouts but were threatened with beatings if they sought medical treatment. In a recorded conversation with Adachi, Harris said that Neu, as part of 'training', made him do 200 push-ups within an hour, and also threatened to anally rape him. He also said Neu had a tattoo reading '850 Mob' in reference to the address of the county jail at 850 Bryant Street. Another inmate, Jonathan Christopher, said that Neu carried dice and playing cards he would use to make inmates gamble against him for benefits such as food and clean laundry. Adachi said he went public with details from the report prepared by private investigator Barry Simon to forestall a planned jailhouse fight meant to take place next week. He hired Simon after a public defender heard about the fights from Garcia's father on March 12. Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi (above speaking during the press conference on Thursday) has moved both Garcia and Harris from the jail and said he does not accept the alleged barbaric behavior in the county jail system . The San Francisco Deputy Sheriff's Association called the allegations 'exaggerated' and that the fighting was 'little more than horseplay'. '(Adachi) has done a cursory sham investigation by interviewing a few inmates over a scant two days rather than having the decency to request a serious impartial investigation,' said Harry Stern, an attorney for the deputy's union. 'It is unfortunate that Mr. Adachi didn’t initiate a formal complaint that would have been investigated thoroughly by the appropriate agencies. 'The investigators would have had the opportunity to interview witnesses, including the accused deputies, and look for physical evidence.' San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said he does not accept any kind of culture within the county jail system that reports such barbaric and unlawful activities, according to ABC. Mirkarimi has moved the affected inmates to another facility, and Adachi has called for an investigation by state or federal officials. Another inmate said they had to bet Neu for benefits such as food and clean laundry. Adachi made the information public once he got word that there was another planned fight meant to take place next week (above County Jail No. 4)","San Francisco sheriff's deputy Scott Neu is accused of forcing inmates Ricardo Palikiko Garci and Stanley Harris to fight at County Jail No. 4 .

"Esa's Rosetta spacecraft is getting ready for an adventurous pass through the geysers of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Scientists hope to discover more information about the comet’s interior from the jets. And with the comet becoming more active as it approaches the sun, these next few months are providing the best opportunity yet to study the comet - but it is not without risk. Esa is preparing to send its Rosetta spacecraft within nine miles of comet 67P. The probe will be tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface (shown in image). These could reveal what the comet's interior is composed of. And as the comet gets more active, Philae on the surface could wake up . ‘The comet is getting super exciting,’ said Esa’s Rosetta project scientist Dr Matt Taylor in The Times. ‘Hundreds of kilos per second of material is flinging off it. We want to a do a fly-by through one of these active regions.’ The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing to orbit and study the comet. From data collected by the two proves, Esa said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. The probe will be brought within nine miles (15km) of the comet, with its path taking it right through 67P’s geysers. These jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. It is getting closer and closer over the next few months, with its point of closest approach taking place in August. As it becomes more active, Rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data. In so doing, though, the probe can become disorientated. It relies on seeing stars to know where it is, but the jets can obscure its view. This means that, occasionally, the spacecraft has to take evasive actions when it passes through a jet, to get itself into empty space and re-orientate itself relative to the stars. But studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface, and it could also reveal the connection between the comet’s atmosphere - its coma - and the surface. As the comet gets closer to the sun, scientists will also be hoping to hear from the Philae lander on the surface. The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. Now, as the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae’s batteries and bring it back to life. The Rosetta probe (illustrated), which carried the Philae lander, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014 . Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko completes an orbit around the sun every 6.45 years (shown in graphic). The comet rotates once every 12.4 hours. It is about 2.7 miles (4.3km) long and 2.5 mniles (4.1km) wide, and will make its closest approach to the sun on 13 August 2015 . After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, Rosetta successfully released the Philae lander (illustrated) from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 3.3ft (one metre) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it bounced twice before coming to rest . Earlier in March scientists sent commands to the lander in the hope it would respond, but with no luck. On 14 April they will make another attempt to get in contact - and, if it stirs from its slumber, Philae will have a fantastic opportunity to study the comet as it reaches peak activity. Speaking about the most recent attempt to find the probe, Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told MailOnline: ‘We were trying to see if the lander would wake up and, at the same time, we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation. ‘We don’t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander.’ Now, as the comet approaches the sun, it is hoped that solar rays will recharge Philae’s batteries and bring it back to life. Shown is one of the first images returned by Philae on the surface, showing what appears to be the probe on its side wedged in darkness against a cliff . The main issue at the moment is that, for the lander simply to wake up, it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45°C (-49°F). But to start communicating with Rosetta again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power. It may have already reached the former level, which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we won’t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter. The next few months are certain to be an exciting time, though - not just for Philae, but for the orbiting Rosetta spacecraft as well.","Esa will send its Rosetta spacecraft within nine miles of comet 67P .

"Claim: Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones revealed he limits his children’s pocket money to £25 a month . His work ethic has seen him build a business portfolio worth millions of pounds. And it seems Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones implements the same principles at home. Yesterday the business tycoon, 48, revealed he limits his children’s pocket money to £25 a month - and expects them to earn it through household chores. He said he has also told them he won’t be funding their first homes, but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions. Giving an interview, in which he also criticised the national curriculum for not teaching children business skills, Jones said: ‘My pocket money is based on incentive. It’s like, “You’ve got to clean your room, to get this,” and if they don’t do it, they don’t get the money. It’s a bone of contention.’ Another prickly topic of conversation, no doubt, will be that Jones, who is worth an estimated £475 million, has told his children he will not be buying their first homes. Instead, he said will reward them by making small contributions on top of whatever they earn themselves, but offer nothing if they don’t make money. He said: ‘I want my kids to be polite and respectful, stand on their own two feet. In the future if they want to go and do charitable work, then I’ll fund that charitable work. I’ve said that rather than me buying them a house, I’ll give them a contribution on top of what they deliver. So if they earn £20,000 a year, I’ll give them a tiny contribution on top. If they decide not to work, they don’t get anything. I want them to do it for themselves.’ Jones and his partner Tara have three daughters: Natalia, 12, Isabella, 10, and Talula, nine. His two eldest children, Annabelle, 22, and William, 18, from his marriage to ex-wife Caroline – are now both older than he was when he set up his first company, a tennis coaching academy, aged 17. Jones’ extensive business portfolio includes technology website Expansys, gifts company Red Letter Days, and the re-launched camera chain, Jessops. And he has also established an entrepreneurs’ foundation for schools, after growing frustrated at the lack of business training in the national curriculum. Speaking to Radio Times about the foundation, Jones said schools are ‘obsessed’ with times tables but fail to teach children about entrepreneurialism. Jones said he has also told his children he won’t be funding their first homes, but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions . He said: ‘I’ve been campaigning as much as I can. I’ve been an advocate for ten years now, across two governments – first with Gordon Brown, then with David Cameron – on enterprise, and really encouraging, pushing, cajoling, to do everything we can to embed enterprise in our national curriculum, and I continue to be disappointed that we just pay lip service to the issue. We talk about going back to basics, and we talk about times tables. We’re far too obsessed with times tables.’ Jones added that while ‘it is important for us to be able to add up, obviously, we take it as read that our kids should be able to do that’, it should also be ‘taken as read’ that children are taught about entrepreneurism as well. Dragons’ Den, which sees entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to the panel of Dragons, returns to BBC2 on Sunday at 9pm.","The business tycoon, 48, reveals he limits his children’s pocket money .

"Recovery: Ashya King, pictured last October, is clear of cancer after his parents Brett and Naghmeh took him for pioneering treatment in the Czech Republic after fleeing a Southampton hospital last year . The parents of five-year-old brain cancer sufferer Ashya King revealed today  their son is clear of the disease. Brett and Naghmeh King were put in prison after taking their son out of an NHS hospital and going across Europe to seek pioneering proton therapy in the Czech Republic. Now, some five months after he completed the pioneering treatment, they said Ashya was making good progress, starting to speak again and able to play with his brothers and sisters in the park. His parents told a newspaper he had been given the all-clear by the private clinic that treated him. Mr King, 51, told The Sun: 'We are absolutely delighted. It has justified everything we have gone through, because things are working out for Aysha. 'If we had left him with the NHS we don't think he would have survived. We have saved his life. 'We could not sleep before we got this news. Now we are so full of hope for the future. We are jumping up and down with joy this is a miracle we thought we would never see.' His wife, 46, added: 'We could not sleep before we got this news — now we are so full of hope for the future. We are jumping up and down with joy. It is a miracle we thought we would never see.' A report issued by the private clinic's oncology department last week declared Ashya cancer-free. However, the family has yet to return to the UK and are living in their holiday home in Spain. He described the advanced proton beam therapy treatment Ashya had as 'sniper fire' which specifically targeted the cancer. The couple sparked a manhunt last year when they took their son abroad to seek pioneering proton therapy. Mr King said the treatment was 'much less harmful' than the conventional therapy which doctors at Southampton General Hospital intended to give to Ashya. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. Scroll down for video . Fresh start: Five months after the pioneering proton therapy, Ashya, pictured in September in the Czech Republic, is making good progress, starting to speak again and able to play with his brothers and sisters . Support: Mr and Mrs King were arrested last year after taking their son out of an NHS hospital to take him for the pioneering treatment in the Czech Republic, pictured on the intensive ward  in Prague in September . But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Disappearance: The couple sparked a worldwide manhunt when they took Ashya from Southampton General Hospital last August (pictured  CCTV footage) Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. At the time, Mr King the family said they were so scarred by their nightmare experience that they would not be returning to the UK for the foreseeable future, fearing Ashya would be 'taken away' from them. Their son was largely left alone in a Spanish hospital during their three-day detention, howling in despair and confusion at being apart from his family. Held in grimy adjoining cells at a Spanish police station, Mr King recalled to the Mail: 'She [Naghmeh] was crying: 'Ashya, where is my Ashya?' On and on and on . 'She was saying: 'Are you happy now? We should have stayed in England — this would never have happened.' Suddenly it was my fault.' Mrs King said: 'I wasn't crying for myself in prison, I was crying for Ashya. I didn't want him to be alone in a foreign country not understanding the language. I was just praying the nurses would feel sorry for him, be with him, so he wasn't completely alone.' Ashya had 30 irradiation sessions to fight his rare brain tumour at the Prague clinic which has said proton therapy is more effective than radiotherapy because it limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs. Good news: The Kings have stood by their decision and said that the treatment had been so successful that their son, pictured in October, had now been given the all-clear . Belief: Mrs King said that she believes that if she and her husband had left Ashya, pictured in September, at the NHS hospital, he would not have survived . Ashya was unable to speak or move following surgery in Britain and had still not uttered a word in the Prague clinic after the treatment. Mrs King told The Sun: 'At the clinic we were trying to get him to speak — then this nurse came in with a needle and he suddenly shouted 'No!'. 'We thought it was a miracle. It really blew our minds. He was just saying 'No' to everything. It was funny.' He soon progressed to other words — and now chatters away, according to the newspaper. The therapy is not available for him on the NHS, although the health service has since agreed to fund Ashya's treatment. The outcry over the family's ordeal led to criticism that police and prosecutors had been too cruel in issuing the European arrest warrant, which was eventually withdrawn. Public anger also prompted a nationwide fundraising effort in a bid to help the family. Dr Nick Plowman, senior clinical oncologist at Great Ormond Street children's hospital, told BBC Radio 4's World At One: 'It's very gratifying to hear that he is in remission, and if time goes on and he holds that remission, hopefully that equates with cure. 'I do not agree that he could not have been in a similar situation had he had orthodox X-ray radiotherapy, which is going on to a very high standard in all the departments in this country. 'That's not to say there are no advantages of protons, but I think we could have achieved the remission he is in now with standard radiotherapy.'","Brain cancer sufferer Ashya King given all clear after his proton therapy .

The parents of a teenage Army recruit who died from a gunshot wound at Deepcut Barracks have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death. Private Cheryl James, 18, was one of four young soldiers who died in unexplained shootings at the Surrey base between 1995 and 2002. After fighting for justice for 20 years, her parents won the right to hold a new inquest after Surrey Police were forced to hand over tens of thousands of pages of previously concealed evidence. They believe the new documents could provide the truth behind how their daughter died after years of speculation, including fears she was murdered or driven to commit suicide after being sexually assaulted. It is understood the evidence could quash Ministry of Defence claims that Pte James took her own life and could lead to a criminal trial. But now the police force – which has repeatedly come under fire for their botched investigation into the deaths – is trying to push back the case by years, the family claimed. The force argued in a hearing earlier this month that Pte James’s inquest should be heard alongside inquests into the deaths of the other three soldiers – a process which could take another three years. Des, 66, and Doreen James, 63, Cheryl’s parents, from Carreghofa on the Shropshire-Montgomeryshire border, said: ‘Three weeks ago we thought we were on the way to justice. ‘Then the police come back to court with a ludicrous suggestion which would create huge delays, not only for us but for all of the families. ‘You’ve got four kids who die on the same site and the police link them all together, even though two of them died almost seven years apart. ‘Surrey Police never intended there to be a thorough investigation and they are trying to halt the case again.’ Pte James, 18, was found dead in a copse of trees at the base after she had been on sentry duty in November 1995. Surrey Police handed the matter to the Army, which treated it as suicide. Private Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex, was also found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in June 1995. And in September 2001, 17-year-old Pte Geoff Gray, from Seaham, Co Durham, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head. Private James Collinson lost his life in suspicious circumstances at Deepcut in March 2002. (Clockwise from top left) Private James Collinson, Private James,  Private Geoff Gray and Private Sean Benton all died at Deepcut Barracks . The soldiers’ families have refused to accept that all four committed suicide, accusing the Army of covering up bullying and abuse. Retired company direction, Mr James, said he believed the new evidence, which he has seen, could lead to a criminal investigation, adding: ‘I am fighting to find out everything I possibly can about my daughter’s death. ‘I’ve never said she was murdered, nor that she was sexually assaulted. The problem has been that someone has never allowed me to see the evidence. ‘I refuse to speculate on what happened to her because frankly it is too awful to think about.’ He added: ‘My suspicion regarding what happened to my daughter was made clear when I wrote to the MoD shortly after her death asking if finger prints had been taken off the rifle. ‘They took five months to reply and then said there had been no point taking fingerprints because it was a pooled weapon. ‘There is quite simply no evidence that connects Cheryl’s death with the rifle found near her body. Finger prints were not taken, rounds remaining in the rifle were inexplicably destroyed and bullet fragmentation was allegedly not collected at the post mortem.’ Concerns about the deaths led police to investigate in 2002, but the force refused the families access to their files of evidence. After Liberty threatened legal action, Surrey Police caved in and handed over 44 volumes of statements, notes and photographs in 2012. The material contained ‘significant forensic evidence that was never properly examined and suggestions important witnesses lied’ at the first inquest, said Liberty. But the force has still not handed over 25 per cent of the files on the death of Pte James. Mr James added: ‘If we can make a case with 75 per cent of the files, one must wonder what else is to come and why exactly it has taken Surrey Police almost ten years to hand it over. ‘Surrey Police have let us down over and over again. They let us down in 1995 when they ignored our daughter’s death by leaving it to the army. ‘They let us down a second time when they conducted a sloppy investigation in 2002, which left huge questions… not least of which was they didn’t allow the dignity of those poor kids to have individual investigations.’ Pte James, 18, was found dead in a copse of trees at the base (pictured) after she had been on sentry duty in November 1995 . Speaking yesterday, Emma Norton, Legal Officer for Liberty, said: ‘Des and Doreen have suffered all these years and the case should be dealt with separately as that is what these young people and their families deserve. ‘Surrey Police have repeatedly refused to give access to the materials held by them to the families all these years. ‘That it should be Surrey Police that is again standing in the way of – or significantly delaying – justice is disgraceful.’ They said it was ‘only in their interest’, not in the interest of the families, and said their ‘sudden request for an adjournment’ was shocking. The High Court ruled there was an ‘insufficiency of inquiry’ at the original 1995 inquest into Pte James’ death which lasted just an hour. Two judges quashed the controversial open verdict last year - a dramatic breakthrough in the family’s 19-year fight for justice. Miss Norton added: ‘In July 2014 Des and Doreen finally got what they had been fighting for for 20 years when the High Court agreed to order a fresh inquest following the disclosure of thousands of pages of new material.’ A hearing was held earlier this month to set a date for the inquest later this year, but lawyers acting on behalf of the police called for it be stayed until all of the other cases were prepared. The family are now waiting to hear back from the coroner into whether the case will be suspended until such a time. ‘This is a process that could take many, many months and probably years as they haven’t even completed disclosure and there are many thousands of pages to go through concerning all 4 deaths’, Liberty said. ‘Des and Doreen’s case is ready to go now. Surrey Police are being obstructive by trying to delay this and they have not been there for the family. It is not in the family interest. ‘These deserve separate individual careful inquests. ‘It may well be that evidence comes to light. The concern has always been that they (Surrey Police) were predisposed to find suicide and until we dig into the heart of this case the family will never know what happened to their daughter.’ The soldiers’ families have refused to accept that all four committed suicide at the barracks (pictured), accusing the Army of covering up bullying and abuse . ‘I can’t explain how angry I am, I find it so upsetting’, Mr James said. ‘It is such an hypocrisy, Surry Police pretending that they have the families interests at heart when they have abjectly refused to allow us disclosure for so many years.’ An inside source claimed Surrey Police were ‘lumping’ the cases together to ‘soften the blow’ to the force by taking ‘one bad hit at once’, rather than four separate hits. The source added: ‘There is a fear that it is going to be easier to mask the individual failings if the cases are all lumped together.’ It has since emerged that even the families of Sean Benton and James Collinson do not want all the inquests to be treated as one case. Mr James added: ‘I can’t understand for the life of me how Surrey police think by dictating the pace of this they are doing the families a favour. ‘The suggestion that we will benefit from this is ridiculous. ‘Surrey Police are holding all of this up, we are ready to go, and the MoD is ready to go.’ A Surrey Police spokesman said: ‘Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which Pte Cheryl James died. ‘At the pre inquest review His Honour Justice Barker was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of Pte Cheryl James, Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte James Collinson, together or individually. ‘This was raised as a matter for consideration and Surrey Police will fully support the coronial process.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Private Cheryl James died from a gunshot wound at Deepcut Barracks .

"Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are facing an uphill battle in the Orlando popularity stakes this weekend. Disney World is a real life Magic Kingdom for millions yet not even the grandest of shows or white knuckle rides will match the atmosphere in the creaking, cavernous Citrus Bowl on Sunday afternoon. A sell-out crowd of 62,000 will make their way downtown to witness Orlando City, led out by Brazilian legend Kaka, in their inaugural MLS match against another fellow newcomer in the shape of NYCFC. David Villa is expected to make his MLS debut against Orlando City FC on Sunday for New York City . Brazilian star Kaka will also play in the match on Sunday, for the new MLS franchise Orlando City . The match will take place at Florida's Citrus Bowl, which was a venue at the 1994 USA World Cup . It’s an opening day fixture to get the marketing men salivating. Yet while the newfangled New York franchise have literally started from scratch, this match, shown live on Sky Sports in the UK, marks the culmination of four years of hard work and realised dreams. Adrian Heath, the former England Under 21 and Everton midfielder, has been in charge all of that time , thanks in no small part to a chance meeting in a Newcastle-under-Lyme pub with a bloke called Phil Rawlins. Rawlins, a director at Stoke City who founded a highly successful IT sales and marketing consulting company in Texas, has lived in the US for 17 years and was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes. Heath was keen too. Former Everton midfielder Adrian Heath has guided Orlando City to MLS after four years of hard work . Heath's appointment came after a chance meeting with Phil Rawlins (right), who was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes . Out of work after not having a caretaker stint at Coventry City turn into a permanent role , the 54 year-old had already witnessed what effect the beautiful game was having in the US during a pre-season tour which took him to the fanatical footballing hotbed of Portland. The possibilities fascinated him. Initially the pair, introduced to each other by agent Gary Mellor, went to Texas where Rawlins founded the Austin Aztecs. At this point, leaving the USL Pro, the third tier of the American soccer scene, and joining MLS was more than a pipedream. So Rawlins upped sticks and relocated everyone to Florida. And Orlando City were born. Orlando City tweeted this about how Lampard won't be at the game and wrote: 'Sorry, Frank - we're sold out' A first championship was secured in their inaugural season and, impressively, a fan base in a state which has enjoyed its fair share of disappointments following the folding of MLS side Miami Fusion in 2002 (Fusion were based in Fort Lauderdale, a good 200 miles away), the Orlando natives got straight behind the Lions. Another regular season title and a second championship followed. That has ensured that Heath has achieved a rare feat – taking a team up through the levels in a country where promotion and relegation are dirty words. Unlike New York City, there is a strong feeling of continuity allied with a natural connection to the city. Eight players remain the squad from their final USL Pro season. NYCFC manager Jason Kreis will lead his team out for their first ever MLS match on Sunday . NYCFC will begin in front of a 62,000 sell-out crowd against Orlando City at Citrus Bowl in Florida . Yet not everything came easily. Behind the scenes, Rawlins was working tirelessly. He desperately wanted to take the club on to the highest level. That, however, needs more than sweat and toil on the pitch. With top level franchise costs rocketing from $7.5 to $100 million, big bucks are needed to take a seat at the top table. They were snubbed by MLS in 2012. Enter Brazilian millionaire Flavio Augusto da Silva in February 2013. Having made his money in setting up English language schools back home, his arrival has been key. He provides the conduit between South America and the US, a partnership which satisfies many people on myriad levels. Naturally, his wealth and business expertise have ensured Orlando City’s dream has become a striking reality. His links into the South American market, where so much talent bubbles under the surface, have been crucial – Columbia, El Salvador and Brazil are all represented in Heath’s squad. Honduran striker Bryan Rochez,19, is the youngest designated player in the League. Seb Hines (top right) has arrived on loan from Middlesbrough and will play for Orlando in their opening game . Sean St Ledger, formerly of Preston and Leicester, is also set to make his MLS bow on Sunday . Former Birmingham City midfielder Lewis Neal ,the loan arrivals of Seb Hines from Middlesbrough and Republic of Ireland international and free agent Sean St Ledger give their English boss a reminder of home and some experience to boot. Most importantly though, Orlando is the No 1 holiday destination for Brazil’s middle classes. So where better to start an Anglo-American-Brazilian franchise? An impressive 20,000 were at a championship match against Charlotte. MLS couldn't deny them again. Their place as the 21st franchise was confirmed nine months after Da Silva's arrival. The prospect of even more tourist dollars flowing into the city has got the club firmly on-side with the local authorities and businesses. New York City have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase . Flavio Augusto da Silva (left) has been key to the progress of Orlando City since his arrival in February 2013 . Unlike in Miami when it comes to David Beckham, they are right behind his plans, so much so that, after agreeing a public and private partnership plan, a brand spanking new 19,500 stadium could be ready for the start of next season. Walt Disney World Resort are one of the founding sponsors. Oh, and he is friends with Kaka. When Da Silva came calling, the 32 year-old former world footballer of the year didn’t have to think twice. The $7.2 million salary - making him the best paid player in the League - certainly helped. His fanfare arrival piqued interest like never before. Kaka is the man Heath is building his team and vision around. Injuries over the years may have taken their toll yet he still managed 56 games last term for AC Milan and Sao Paulo. The kind of touch and awareness which saw him join Real Madrid for an eye watering £57 million in 2009 will be there for all to see. Da Silva and Rawlins’ business plan has been ticking all the boxes so it will be fascinating to see how Heath adapts to MLS and the injection of quality he will encounter week in, week out. Only two expansion teams have reached the end of season playoffs in their debut campaign, so history is not on Orlando’s side. The chairman has already stated that his men have to make sure they’re the third. The pressure is on without a ball being kicked. Yet with such brilliant support in the stands, the city and the boardroom, you get the feeling Heath’s men are onto a winner, whatever happens. Kaka - Orlando City SC . The Brazilian won the Ballon d’Or back in 2007, so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new MLS franchise Orlando City. He may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass. Frank Lampard – New York City FC . One of two high-profile signings made by New York City on their introduction to the league. Lampard won more than 100 caps for England and 11 major trophies with Chelsea in 13 years. He is due in New York in the summer once he has finished playing with Manchester City. Steven Gerrard – LA Galaxy . The Liverpool midfielder will become the second former England captain to join LA Galaxy following the successful period of David Beckham. Like Lampard, Gerrard will not join Galaxy until the summer once the Premier League has finished. He will link up with former Reds team-mate Robbie Keane. David Villa - New York City FC . Villa became New York City’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping Atletico Madrid win La Liga last season. He has spent time on loan at Melbourne City in the Australian A League and he will be expected to score the bulk of New York’s goals in their debut season. Bradley Wright-Phillips - New York Red Bulls . Overshadowed by brother Shaun in England but since moving to MLS he has been the star man for the Red Bulls. He won the Golden Boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games. With the departure of Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill he could struggle to score as many this term.","New York City and Orlando City face each other in their first MLS match .

"Nine British medical students have travelled secretly to Syria to help treat jihadi fighters in hospitals controlled by Islamic State, it emerged yesterday. The group of five men and four women, all in their late teens and early 20s, fled medical school in Sudan and travelled to Istanbul before crossing the Turkish border. One woman, a surgeon’s daughter, sent a smiling selfie to her sister before entering Syria. Their desperate parents believe they have been ‘brainwashed’ by Islamic fanatics and have now travelled to the region in a bid to convince their children to return home. Scroll down for video . Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Pictured from left to right: Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir and Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah . The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families and fled to Syria from a medical base in Sudan. Left to right: Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir and Ismail Hamadoun . The medical students are believed to now be in the ISIS-held area of Tel Abyad, according to a Turkish politician. From left to right: Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman . The students are from the Sudanese community, but were born and raised in England. ‘They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,’ Turkish opposition politician Mehmet Ali Ediboglu said after meeting the families. ‘We all assume that they are in Tel Abyad now, which is under IS control. The conflict out there is fierce, so medical help must be needed.’ He insisted that the students wanted to volunteer in hospitals, adding: ‘Let’s not forget about the fact that they are doctors; they were there to help, not to fight.’ It is believed the students had been enrolled in medical school in Khartoum. Last year, a British medical student who attended the same Khartoum medical school was arrested on suspicion of plotting with Islamic State. Tarik Hassane, 21, known to friends as ‘The Surgeon’, allegedly posted on Twitter ‘I smell war’ hours before his arrest. He was Tasered by police who stormed a relative’s flat where he was sleeping after flying into the country. Three of the students had graduated and the others were still studying, it is thought. They were joined by two medics from the US and Canada, also of Sudanese origin. Volunteer: One of the runaway girls, Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, 19, of King’s Lynn in Norfolk, sent a selfie to her sister just before crossing the border . About a dozen classmates are believed to have flown from the Sudanese capital to Istanbul on March 12, then taken a bus to the border the next day. They are thought to have kept the plans secret from their families. They were named as Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, Nada Sami Kader, Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tasneem Suleyman Huseyin, Ismail Hamdoun, Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah, Mohammed Osama Badri Mohammed, Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah and Sami Ahmed Kadir. Their parents are now living near the wire fences of the Turkish-Syrian border desperately trying to get their children back. One of the runaway girls, Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir, 19, of King’s Lynn in Norfolk, sent a selfie to her sister just before crossing the border. Her father Mamoun Abdelgadir is a surgeon at King’s Lynn’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital. She sent the picture over social networking site WhatsApp, saying: ‘Don’t worry about us, we’ve reached Turkey and are on our way to volunteer helping wounded Syrian people.’ She sent it just before crossing the border and, within hours, her father boarded a plane to Turkey where he has been ever since. ‘We have decided not to return home unless we go with them,’ Mr Abdelgadir told Spanish news agency Efe. ‘We sent our children to study [in Sudan] so that they would be surrounded by their culture. But their decision to go to Syria has been a shock for all of us.’ There was no answer at the smart family home in a village outside King’s Lynn last night, but a neighbour said that the family were ‘doing what they had to do’. Schoolgirls Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and  Amira Abase, 15, (pictured at Gatwick airport) fled to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria where they are believed to have become ISIS jihadi brides . Ahmed Babikir, students’ dean at Khartoum’s private University of Medical Sciences, told AFP that five students were missing after travelling to Turkey. He said that they were ‘top students’ who had been studying medicine and pharmacology, with one expected to qualify as ‘the youngest surgeon’ in Sudan. Hamdoun’s Facebook page shows pictures of hunting trips in Sudan in which his friends pose with guns and heads of dead rabbits. The Home Office said the students would not automatically face prosecution under anti-terror laws if they tried to return to the UK, as long as they could prove that they had not been fighting. Mr Ediboglu said he thought the students were volunteers through a charity called IHH, which he called a ‘voluntary medical group’.","Nine medical students were born in UK and studied medicine in Sudan .

"Samantha Cameron and her two older children, Nancy, 11, and Elwen, 9, were in the gallery just beside me for PMQs – and they chose a belter. 'There's going to be quite a lot of shouting,' I heard Mrs Cameron warn the youngsters as the House assembled below us. There sure was. This was the last PMQs of the Parliament. For either Dave or Ed, this was possibly the last hurrah at the despatch box. As the Prime Minister took his seat he looked up and spotted his children. An enormous beam lit his face and he winked at them. But as he read his usual opening spiel about having 'further such meetings today' he shot the Speaker a rueful little smile, plainly acknowledging that the precious formula of words – used by premiers for decades – might never again fall from his lips. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband was left flustered after Mr Cameron was happy to rule out a VAT increase during the PMQs . After that momentary wobble, Mr Cameron proceeded to do to Ed Miliband what your average food processor will do to a bunch of browning bananas. Magimix time! Mr Miliband had seemed sure he had the zinger par excellence with which to undo his great rival. The Labour leader stood at the Table, feet planted wide, a superior twitch on his lips as he leaned into the microphone. After a drollery about Mr Cameron's 'retirement plans' (that TV interview which has so excited the PM's more crosspatch critics), Ed Mil' challenged the PM to give a straight answer to a straight question. 'Will he now rule out a rise in VAT?' asked Mr Miliband. Mr Cameron: 'Yes.' Oops! That wasn't meant to happen. Mr Miliband had been expecting the PM to give a waffling non-answer. All his poise had been predicated on that. The eyebrow had been raised in a doubting manner as he put the query. His tone had been sarcastic. He knew – just knew – that Cameron would not be able to give a straight answer. Instead, the low swine had coughed up a horribly direct, undeniable, comprehensible 'yes'. What a filthy trick. Not fair, ref! The Miliband team had spent hours finessing follow-up attack lines. They had envisaged accusing the Tories of failing to be clear about their VAT plans. Now the so-and-so Cameron had gone and ruled out any such rise. Darn Tories. You can't rely on them to do ANYTHING. From my perch I could not see Mr Miliband's eyes but a colleague who was watching him reports that they revolved like a couple of fruit-machine dials whose lever had just been given a mighty yank. His cheeks were sucked in, as were the curtains in Dorothy's bedroom as the tornado strikes in The Wizard of Oz. The whole House was taken by similar surprise. There was an initial silence, as perhaps happens immediately after a bomb blast before car alarms start to ring. Had one of Labour's main themes for the general election just been obliterated? It did look horribly like that. Labour MPs sat stony-faced as Tory MPs roared with laughter when Mr Cameron ruled out a VAT increase . Er ,er, er, er: the Miliband mainframe went into catastrophic systems freeze. He sounded as though he had just swallowed a Rubik's Cube whole. 'Let me say to him, let me say to him, let me say to him,' he jibbered, gulping for air. Then, with desperation: 'Nobody's gonna believe him! Nobody's gonna believe him!' This drew laughter from the Government benches, aghast silence from Labour. Lucy Powell, Labour election supremo, was sitting beside Mr Miliband. She was doing one of those tombstone grins they do in the Tom & Jerry cartoons before all the teeth drop out. Mr Cameron capitalised on the ambush (which, one hears, may have been arranged with George Osborne). He pounced on Labour confusion and asked Mr Miliband if he would reciprocate by ruling out a Labour tax rise on national insurance. Naughty. After all, PMS is meant to be about questions TO the prime minister, not from him. Speaker Bercow let it pass and Mr Miliband flailed. He offered no such promise on national insurance, allowing Mr Cameron to clinch the moment by accusing Labour of a 'jobs tax bombshell'. Only later in the afternoon did a somewhat panicked Labour high command deny that it will hike national insurance tax. By then the moment had largely passed. Mr Cameron appeared to be enjoying his time at the Despatch Box, with wife Samantha and children Nancy and Elwen looking on from the public gallery . The Government benches were in loud, rampant tumult. Sir Bob Russell (Lib Dem, Colchester) hoiked up his trouser legs to betray two horrendously yellow socks (he had a yellow waistcoat, too). Keith Simpson (Con, Broadlands) waved a large, florid mouchoir. Beside me, young Nancy and Elwen grinned enormously and Nancy clenched her fist, punching the air with a 'Yes!'. She is like this aged 11? Crumbs. By 30 she'll probably be running a multinational. Or the country. Behind the Cameron family party sat another notable visitor: Geoffrey Boycott, cricket commentator and Yorkshireman. Boycs kept his counsel but if he had been offering commentary box analysis of the session one fears he might have talked of Miliband's stoomps bein' uprooted. This was a comprehensive clattering of a disorientated, dazed Miliband. It was a high-velocity whizzing which left the Labour leader a sorry, smoothiefied splodge on the floor. Game on.","Samantha Cameron and her two older children watched on during PMQs .

"You may think you’re making a healthy decision when opting for a bowl of cereal over a bacon sandwich but a new survey has uncovered the staggering amount of sugar in some of the most popular Australian brands. Just Right, which is marketed as ‘low in salt. High in fibre. Goodness of wholegrain’ contains a shocking seven teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams. It’s ‘healthy’ counterparts in the cereal aisle such as Nutri Grain contain eight teaspoons of sugar, while Sultana Bran and Be Natural Apple and Raisin Cereal both boast five and a half. Scroll down for video . Kellogg's Sultana Bran contains five and a half teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams and Just Right has a shocking seven teaspoons . Dieter's staple Special K, which is sold as '99% fat free', has 3.5 teaspoons of sugar but it has 490 mg of sodium, making it 'high' in salt. In fact, the average sugar content of all 20 cereals analysed by the Obesity Policy Coalition was 19.8g per 100g – that’s almost 20 per cent sugar, about five teaspoons of the dangerous ingredient. Children’s cereals are, less surprisingly, also packed full of sugar. Chocolate covered Coco Pops which are advertised as ‘nutritious grains of puffed rice with cocoa’ contain a sickening nine teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams, as well as 465 mg of sodium. While Fruit Loops boasts nine and a half teaspoons of sugar, despite being labelled promisingly as ‘no artificial flavours, no artificial colours’. In the children's aisle, Nutri Grain contains eight teaspoons of sugar and colourful Fruit Loops has nine and a half . Frosties, which don't have any health claims, contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams – highlighting that they should probably only be eaten as a treat. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks, but also those found naturally in honey, syrups and fruit juices. That equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink. However, the UN agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits. Yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this just in our first meal of the day – cereal. Be Natural Apple and Raisin Cereal, which advertises itself as 'No artificial flavours, colours or preservatives', has five and a half teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams. Frosties, which don't have any health claims, contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams . The Obesity Policy Coalition (OPC) says its findings suggest Australian cereal manufacturers are potentially misleading consumers by promoting healthy sounding statements on their packaging despite sugar making up more than 35 per cent of the ingredients of some popular brands. Executive Manager of the OPC Jane Martin said: ‘Many breakfast cereals contain high levels of sugar, but manufacturers use all sorts of creative phrases on their labels to give consumers the impression they’re a nutritious choice for breakfast. It’s as though they are prepared to tell consumers only half the story. ‘Many parents would be horrified to learn that for every three mouthfuls of Nutri-Grain, one is just sugar, while a small bowl contains twice as much sodium as a small packet of chips.’ Special K only has 3.5 teaspoons of sugar but it has 490 mg of sodium, making it 'high' in salt. Chocolate covered Coco Pops which are advertised as ‘nutritious grains of puffed rice with cocoa’ contain a sickening nine teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams, as well as 465 mg of sodium . Foods containing over 15 grams of sugar per 100 grams are considered 'high' in sugar . Cheerios are '69% wholegrain. No artificial colours or flavours' but contain five teaspoons of sugar. All Bran has three teaspoons of sugar . ‘The Health Star Rating System was introduced more than a year ago to help consumers compare the overall nutritional quality of products at a glance. The system helps consumers better understand a product’s overall health rating so they can make informed choices, but our research has revealed very few cereals, as yet, carry the star label,’ Ms Martin said. ‘Clearer labelling through such a system is a vital step in helping consumers make healthier choices in an environment where approximately 63 per cent of Australian adults and 25 per cent of Australian children are overweight or obese.’ Foods containing over 15 grams of sugar per 100 grams are considered ‘high’ in sugar and or salt, a product with over 400mg of sodium per 100 grams is considered ‘high’ in salt.","Average sugar content of 20 cereals analysed was about five teaspoons .

"Rachel Hollis, a married mother of three, was vacationing in Mexico this weekend when she decided to do something for all the moms out there: pose in her bikini on the beach, proudly flaunting her post-pregnancy body. Hollis, 32, a Los Angeles celebrity party planner and the founder of the lifestyle website The Chic Site, on Saturday shared the snapshot on the Facebook page for her business, accompanied by a strong message of empowerment. ‘I have stretch marks and I wear a bikini. I have a belly that's permanently flabby from carrying three giant babies and I wear a bikini. My belly button is saggy... (which is something I didn't even know was possible before!!) and I wear a bikini,’ she wrote in her brief manifesto.

Proud mom: Hollis has three sons, ages 2, 6 and 8, with her husband of 11 years, David (far left) On the run: Hollis said a week before her now-famous beach photo was taken, she had completed her first marathon (left), and she felt that she was at the peak of her form . ‘I wear a bikini because I'm proud of this body and every mark on it. Those marks prove that I was blessed enough to carry my babies and that flabby tummy means I worked hard to lose what weight I could. ‘I wear a bikini because the only man who's opinion matters knows what I went through to look this way. That same man says he's never seen anything sexier than my body, marks and all. ‘They aren't scars ladies, they're stripes and you've earned them. Flaunt that body with pride!' The reaction to Hollis’ inspiring post was almost instant: by Tuesday evening it has drawn more than 341,000 'likes' and more than 10,000 comments, many of them from fellow mothers thanking Hollis for taking a stand against body-shaming and speaking out on their behalf. In an interview with Yahoo Parenting, Hollis explained that she was vacationing with her husband of 11 years, David, in Cancun when she asked him to take a picture of her in a two-piece orange and blue monogrammed swimsuit. When she took a look at the resulting image, Hollis said she noticed the stretch marks on her stomach and released that she has never seen such a candid snapshot on social media. 'So I thought, ""I'll just post this for the moms,""' she recalled. No more shame: The 32-year-old married mother of three said she decided to share her bikini photo to give confidence to other moms . Battle of the bulge: The Oklahoma native said she has been struggling with weight her entire life . Family matters: When Hollis became pregnant with her first child, she packed on 45lbs, which she was unable to lose by her second pregnancy . Before long, comments and 'likes' began pouring in, leaving Hollis feeling overwhelmed with support. 'You have no idea of how empowering your words are to someone as myself. I gave birth to my last baby (my third son) 6 months ago. I have many stretch marks... and my confidence has plummeted. Reading this has made me realize how im seeing everything in the wrong way,' wrote Amanda Gongloff, thanking Hollis for helping her regain her lost self-confidence. Amanda Uscanga wrote in a similar vain: 'Thank you for sharing this! Finally another woman who's stomach that looks like mine.' 'Us 50 somethings are proud of our children ( and grandchildren) but ashamed of our bodies. God blessed us to bear children. The media cursed us with untrue body image. We are all beautiful because if Gods grace. My body will be in a bikini. Just bought it yesterday!’ Pam field-Mackle posted. Some of Hollis' followers went a step further, sharing on her page their own bikini snapshots, with stretch marks and all. For his eyes only: The 32-year-old party planner wrote in her Facebook manifesto that the only man whose opinion she cares about is her husband, David, and he thinks she looks sexy . Positive feedback: Hollis' photo has drawn thousands of comments from other moms, some of whom even shared 'imperfect' bikini photos of their own . Third time's the charm: after she gave birth to her third son (pictured), Hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise . Nancy Engelhard uploaded a photo of herself in a black two-piece number on the beach, along with a caption that boldly stated: 'This is me! After 2 kids, 1 miscarriage, 7 bladder surgeries, ovarian cancer and a hysterectomy! Love my bikini! A few male commenters also weighed in, among them disabled veteran Mike Vanderveen who revealed that he still wears shorts, even though he had lost his legs in a land mine explosion. 'At least I don't have to worry about snakebites, cold feet, stubbing my toes, twisting my ankles, and buying shoes is a breeze,' he joked, before concluding in all caps: 'IF YOU DON’T LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, LOOK THE OTHER WAY!!!' Hollis responded to the veteran’s message by saying that at age 22, she had a bout with a condition called Bell's Palsy, which left her face paralyzed for two months. Not everyone, however, got on board with her positive body image message, with some users lambasting her for drawing attention to such a relatively minor problem as stretch marks. The mother of three, however, insisted that her critics missed the point of her message. Party girl: Hollis, pictured all dressed up alongside her spouse, launched her party-planning business in LA back in 2004 . Playing dress-up: The Hollis clan on Halloween, channeling an Old West town, with Rachel dressed as a flowering cactus and her youngest son dressed as a tumbleweed . Hollis, the daughter of an Oklahoma Pentecostal minister and a church pianist, said she has been fighting the battle of the bulge her entire life, even before she had her three sons, ages 2, 6 and 8. While she was pregnant with her first child, the 5-foot-2 Hollis packed on 45lbs, and she had not lost that weight by the time she became pregnant with her second son. After giving birth to her youngest, Hollis was finally able to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight through healthy eating and exercise. Hollis revealed to Today Show that the now-famous beach photo was taken a week after she had completed her first marathon and was proud of her new and improved physique. 'It’s never ever going to be like a Victoria’s Secret model, but I think I look good and my husband wants to make out with me, so I’m doing something right,' Hollis concluded.","Rachel Hollis, 32, a party planner from LA, took Internet by storm with her belly-bearing beach photo .

"The man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies earlier this week has pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty. Nathan Thompson allegedly loaded 11 bull terriers cross puppies into his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri on Wednesday, according to the Daily Telegraph. As a result of his plea, Thompson cannot own, acquire, buy or possess any animal, or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade. Scroll down for video . Nathan Thompson, 25, allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured) Thompson (pictured) leaves East Maitland Court after pleading guilty to animal abuse . Magistrate Caleb Franklin granted Thompson bail to be sentenced on April 28. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated. The  25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies. Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived. David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the incident. 'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said. 'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive. Nathan Thompson, the man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies,  pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed. 'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr O'Shannessy said. Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable, however Mr O'Shannessy says he has 'grave concerns' for her. 'She appeared to have some injuries and had blood shot eyes when we rescued her,' he said. 'But who knows what Lucky's witnessed.'

"The world’s largest boring machine was lifted out of an underground tunnel in Seattle, where it has been stuck for more than a year after it broke down mid-job. The gigantic drill, known as Bertha, stopped working in December 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of its two-mile journey to replace the aging Alaska Way, which was damaged in 2001 by an earthquake. A crew from Dutch construction company Mammoet used a huge red crane on Monday to hoist the front end of the machine – which is fivestories tall and weighs 2,000 tonnes – out of the ground so it could be repaired. Scroll down for video . The front end of gigantic digger Bertha is being lifted out of the ground by a huge red crane in a painstaking process . The machine, pictured in the ground, stopped working after digging just 1,000ft of its two mile trip to replace an aging waterfront highway . Workmen spent hours on Monday carefully lifting the equipment, which weighs 2,000 ton, to the ground so it can be fixed . A release by the Washington State Department of Transportation said removing the removing the equipment, buried 120 feet underground, would take workmen at least 16 hours but there was no set schedule, adding: ‘Crews will take as long as necessary to prepare for and safely complete the lift.’ The operation was the fourth and final lift in the department’s repair programme, with crews already removing three pieces of Bertha’s exterior from the pit, the department added. The machine's breakdown and other construction issues have left the $80million project two years behind schedule and sparked concern about cost overruns and other unforeseen obstacles. The original highway overhaul was expected to cost $2 billion and be completed by 2015. The new timeline for replacing the busy Alaskan Way Viaduct, damaged in a 2001 earthquake, is 2017. A white crane arrives on the scene in Seattle to help lift part of Bertha, which had been buried 120 feet underground . Workers prepare a gravel pad as Bertha is pulled out of the ground. Mammoet, the company who set up the huge red crane to remove Bertha, has completed similar lifts across the world including hoisting a Russian nuclear submarine from out of the Arctic Ocean . Matt Preedy, deputy Highway 99 tunnel administrator for the Washington State Department of Transportation, praised the work of Mammoet, Seattle Tunnel Partners (STP) and tunnel-machine maker Hitachi in a report to The Seattle Times, saying they had devised a good lifting plan and did an 'excellent job'. The mammoth task saw the digger gradually heaved to ground level at a rate of four to five inches a minute,  with the help of seven miles of cable. He added that Bertha now needs to be disassembled, inspected and repaired before construction companies commit to a time frame where the machine will start work again - with some contractors saying work could start again in August, . Mammoet has performed other lifts around the world, including recovering a Russian nuclear submarine from the bottom of the Barents Sea, in the Arctic Ocean. There had been concern that Bertha, buried 120 feet might not be able to move itself to the pit opening because it had experienced various mechanical issues, including increased temperatures, before it stalled. The huge section of the digger was pulled up four to five inches a minute, using seven miles of cable, according to The Seattle TImes . Workmen scale the top of the red crane, to ensure the ropes are fixed properly as they lift the machinery out of the ground, while Seattle Tunnel Partners project director Chris Dixon walks along the site to check the rescue operation is going to plan . This photo was shared on Twitter by @BerthaDigsSR99, with the caption: 'I'm up and on the move! Being carried towards the white repair platform.' Twitter account @BerthaDigsSR99 also shared this picture with its 15,000 followers of the part left in the tunnel. The caption, posted at 5.44am GMT, read: 'A look at the section of me that will remain in the pit. Catch you in the morning.' But, using its own power, it was able bore through nearly 20 feet of concrete last month to break through a wall leading to the rescue pit's opening, ready for it to be extracted this week. Thousands of people have followed Bertha’s journey back to the ground on a dedicated Twitter page, called @BerthaDigsSR99. Along with mechanical issues, the project has been set back by other concerns. In February, four men at the site were injured when a rebar wall collapsed, causing them to fall 25 feet. Two Seattle firefighters walked about a half mile into the State Route 99 tunnel and carried out one of the injured men while the others walked out. A fifth worker escaped injury, while his four colleagues were taken to Harborview Medical Center,  One of the men suffered a fractured arm.

"Humans, sea lions and seals alike are sharing in the bounty of the Columbia River. Flying over the Desdemona Sands during a telemetry survey, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife caught a photo of what looked like fish washed up at low tide. But it was actually more than 6,400 regionally based harbor seals. It's not unusual, WDFW biologist Steve Jeffriessaid, to see 4,000 to 5,000 of them hauled out on Desdemona, between the Astoria Bridge and Hammond in the Columbia River, a fraction of the 15,000 regional population from Netarts north to Grays River, Washington. 'They've been moving seasonally into the Columbia River in response to smelt runs forever,' he said. Scroll down for video . Increasing? California sea lions and harbor seals rest on the docks of the East End Mooring Basin in Astoria, Oregon on Tuesday. During a Feb. 11 aerial survey, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted more than 1,200 California sea lions at the East End Mooring Basin, along with nearly 600 Steller and California sea lions on the South Jetty . All-time high: The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife agency counted 2,340 California sea lions at the East End Mooring Basin . During a Feb. 11 aerial survey, WDFW also counted more than 1,200 California sea lions at the East End Mooring Basin, along with nearly 600 Steller and California sea lions on the South Jetty. On Friday, spokeswoman Jessica Sall of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said, her agency counted 2,340 California sea lions at the East End Mooring Basin. Increasing numbers of pinnipeds, driven by starvation in California to the healthy smelt and salmon runs in the Columbia River, have put a strain on the Port of Astoria's infrastructure and created enmity between fishers, conservationists and fishery agencies. In 2010, Pacific smelt, known as eulachon, were marked threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. The past two years have marked the first time since the designation that they've been allowed for commercial and recreational harvest. Fisheries managers estimated 200 million smelt returning to the Columbia in 2014 and a similarly strong run this year. And sea lions reserved their spot at the dinner table. Their seats are largely at the Port's East End Mooring Basin, which has two docks for boats, and two unofficially for sea lions, that also cover the rock breakwaters surrounding the marina. Fisheries agencies counted 1,256 California sea lions there Feb. 11; 1,649 Feb. 20; 1,211 March 2; and 2,340 on Friday, which Sall said was an all-time high. 'I think that will be telling once the smelt run is done, how many sea lions leave,' Sall said. 'They're already tapering off.' Beating them back: Orange ribbon is shown placed along a dock of the East End Mooring Basin in Astoria, Oregon. The Port of Astoria has successfully used the ribbon to deter sea lions from jumping onto the dock . But even when the smelt are gone, an estimated 312,600 adult spring chinook salmon are expected to provide a continuing food source. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report in October showed a decrease in chinook salmon survival from 90 percent in 2010 to 55 percent in 2014. It compared the decrease in survival with a more than 670 percent increase in sea lion populations counted by ODFW in Astoria between March 15 and May 15 over the same years. Amid the issues of sea lion predation, the Port has maintained it only wants to keep sea lions from damaging its docks, estimating more than $100,000 in damage to utilities and the docks themselves from sea lions. It has removed docks, disconnected utilities from the two that the sea lions inhabit and strung brightly colored surveying tape, which has effectively dissuaded the animals from jumping onto the two docks with boats still tied to them. 'There's a public health issue,' said Permit and Project Manager Robert Evert about fecal coliform in the water and the mounds of feces with the ringworm fungus that Port staff clean up off docks. The Port has looked into galvanized steel railings — for years now — to keep sea lions from jumping up on docks. There is 5,000 feet to cover on the Port's three docks at the basin, Operations Manager Matt McGrath said at a March 17 Port Commission meeting. The railings have worked in San Diego, but would cost $50,000. Evert added the Port will be meeting with Smith-Root Fisheries Technology next week, which creates a low-voltage matting for docks that is uncomfortable for sea lions. Starving: Increasing numbers of pinnipeds, driven by starvation in California to the healthy smelt and salmon runs in the Columbia River, have put a strain on the Port of Astoria's infrastructure and created enmity between fishers, conservationists and fishery agencies. For several years, the Sea Lion Defense Brigade has kept a regular presence at the basin, monitoring ODFW's trapping and branding and reporting on its Facebook page. Members snap photos of visitors who drop by to see sea lions and regularly attend Port meetings to testify on behalf of pinnipeds. 'I want to talk about sharing on the second biggest river in North America,' Ninette Jones, brigade member, told the Port Commission March 17, after being told she couldn't comment a second time on sea lions. Brigade members see sea lions as a scapegoat for larger issues, such as pollution, climate change, overfishing and thousands of miles of blocked fish passages. They've claimed that Sea Shepherd Conservation Society once offered to pay for a sea lion haul-out, although the Port has previously denied being offered funding. Regardless of whether they're hauling out on Port docks or their own haul-out, Evert said, letting them on docks is akin to domesticating a wild animal. The Port started shutting down the causeway to the East End Mooring Basin when ODFW is trapping and branding sea lions to track them, a practice authorized in 2012 by NOAA and not as deadly as the euthanizations at Bonneville Dam, but nonetheless controversial. Tensions over the practice came to a near boiling point Feb. 18, according to ODFW. Sall said a visitor to the basin had been approached by a branding protester. The visitor then approached and harassed the ODFW employee, she said, before threatening to grab a shotgun and shoot her. Sall said ODFW reported the incident to the Oregon State Police, which couldn't be reached for comment by press time.

"A bogus doctor who had 'more psychiatric qualifications than Sigmund Freud' and used her husband and parents as fake references has been unmasked as a serial liar. Sarah Sims claimed she had a long list of qualifications from the University of London and said she had been given a 'ladyship' by Warwick University. The three-times married 'doctor' also claimed she had been an officer in the Ministry of Defence as she applied to be head of childcare services at a children's home in Folkestone, Kent. But she was finally exposed as a fraud after the employers discovered her qualifications were completely made up. Sarah Sims claimed she had been given a doctorate by the University of London (pictured), but it just was one of a long list of lies she told . Sims, 41, claimed on her CV that she received a first class bachelor's degree, master's degree and philosophy doctorate from the University of London. She said her last job had been lead welfare officer at the MoD, and included glowing testimonial from her line manager Sergeant Major Darren Pugh. Three-times married Sims, who lives in a £1million home near Canterbury, also claimed to be a member of the 'British Association of Counselling and Psychology (BCAP).' She added that she had been awarded the title of 'Ladyship' from Warwick University for community 'good works'. The highly-qualified 'doctor' seemed the perfect fit for the role as operations director at Ferndearle Child Care Services - until it was revealed that nearly her entire CV was a lie. A jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard that Sims did not receive any of the psychology degrees she claimed to own, and her university had no record of her ever being a student there. Warwick University said it never gives out the title of 'ladyship' and the British Association of Counselling and Psychology does not exist. Sims' glowing reference from her 'line manager' Sergeant Major Darren Pugh turned out be be her 48-year-old husband - Darren Pugh - who was himself cleared of fraud. The three-times married 'doctor' also claimed she had been an officer in the Ministry of Defence as she applied to be head of child care services at a nursing home, Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) heard . The court also heard that two other references listed on Sims' CV as 'therapeutic supervisors' were actually her parents. Piers Reed, prosecuting, told how Sims applied for the Folkestone post in February 2011, saying she was considering leaving the Army. Mr Reed said: 'She said she was a doctor of psychology and was interested in working for Fearndale. She contacted the manager and part-owner of the home and arranged to visit.' 'Mr Pugh had been in the Army, but not at that time. In her job application, she stated she had been a student at London University and had obtained a BA in Psychology, an MA and Phd in Behavioural Psychology. 'Under the heading, she said she was a member of BCAP and, under the Awards heading, stated that, in May 1997, she had been awarded a ladyship from Warwick University for services to the community.' But Mr Reed said that said Sims appeared to have 'more psychiatric qualifications than Sigmund Freud', but there were no records of her attending university. Mr Reed added: 'BCAP doesn't exist. The British Psychological Society and the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy do exist, but neither have ever heard of her. 'And the University of Warwick, while conferring awards, never confer titles such as 'Ladyship'. 'In her CV, she also claimed to have worked as a lead consultant director for a company called EIS. There are no records of her ever working for EIS.' Mr Reed told the court that Sims obtained a mortgage on her property after telling Halifax she was earning between £80,000 and £150,000. In fact, at the time, she was jobless. Sims was found guilty of four counts of fraud and will be sentenced next month.","Sarah Sims claimed she had a doctorate from the University of London .

Pyne has been attempting to overhaul the education system, introducing laws that would allow universities to set their own fees and financially penalise graduates who do not repay their student debts, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Despite the second time failing to convince the Senate, Pyne has vowed he will never give up on his higher education campaign. Speaking to Nine news, Pyne said: 'I never give up, no, I will not give up. It's too important to allow the Labor Party who are political opportunists and the Greens who are the same, to wreck this reform.' During the show, Mr Pyne admitted if the higher education reform failed to be passed it could cause a double dissolution. He has pledged to reintroduce higher education reforms after they were defeated in the Senate on Tuesday.

"Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for  £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge, it has been revealed. The ex-Labour backbencher, who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a Tory MP in a Commons bar, repeatedly used his Parliamentary card to settle big bills. Many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses, but his card was not blocked by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) for more than two years. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster. Disgraced MP Eric Joyce used his taxpayer-funded credit to pay for £450-a-night hotels during his £13,000 expenses binge . Mail Online's  Tom McTague revealed earlier this week that Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around £1,000 a month from his salary. But that will not clear the outstanding sum of around £10,000 before Parliament is dissolved. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff. However, he is disputing at least £6,000 of the debt. If he refuses to repay voluntarily the watchdog's only option will be to pursue him in the civil courts. The details emerged after Ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of Mr Joyce's hotel claims as 'not paid' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full. The Falkirk MP accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card, suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff . The watchdog confirmed he put £743 on a card to fund a three night-stay at a 'non-London' hotel, believed to be in Glasgow, in September last year. The bill was automatically paid by Ipsa. But as he is only entitled to claim up to £120 a night for hotels outside the capital, an excess of £383 was added to his debt. The published expenses records merely state that £383 was 'not paid'. He was was 'not paid' £272.33 for a non-London hotel claim in August, and £208 for another in September. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05. He used the same group again the following month, but this time breached the ceiling by just £61.45. The issues seem to go back to at least 2012. In December of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a Tory MP during a brawl in a Commons bar - he charged £896.92 to the card for a two-night stay at a London hotel. It is understood that the claim was declared invalid because key parts of the receipt had been blacked out - although again Ipsa had already footed the cost and subsequently reported it as 'not paid'. Altogether there are dozens of hotel claims listed as either 'not paid' or 'part paid' since 2012, totalling some £4,000. Mr Joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office, and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time. The £896.92 bill was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the Park Plaza near Westminster, he said. 'That was all of my staff in London,' he said. 'That was essentially an error. It should have come off my (personal) card. 'They would have all been eligible (for expenses) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card.' Mr Joyce said Ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013, but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last December. He even claimed that one £896.92 bill for two nights was for a 'whole bunch of people' to stay at the four-star Park Plaza near Westminster (pictured) 'The whole figure was only exposed in December,' he said. 'Some of these figures are legitimate debts to Ipsa but they would not discuss the rest of it.' Mr Joyce said there was a 'particular issue' with a member of staff who moved to Brighton from Scotland. He said the watchdog had signed off an arrangement where the employee worked from home but occasionally stayed at hotels in London. However, after 16 months, Ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back, according to Mr Joyce. The MP said he had asked the watchdog's compliance officer to look again at the situation. An Ipsa spokesman said: 'MPs have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs and we publish details of all of their claims - both paid and not. 'We have consistently told the MP that he has a budget to keep to and that he is liable for any excess. We have stressed this time and again throughout the Parliament, as we do to every MP. 'We've been talking to the MP since autumn 2013 to put his financial affairs on an even keel. As you would expect, when this didn't work we escalated these conversations within Ipsa and this approach resulted in a personal assurance from the MP that he would repay the amounts due. Mr Joyce stayed at a prestigious Intercontinental Hotel in London in May 2013, when he appears to have broken the £150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by £203.05 . 'When those assurances were not followed through, we turned off his payment card in January 2015 and in February 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary. We will continue to recover this money until it is repaid in full. 'This is a very unusual case. We've tried to encourage the MP to manage this situation. Clearly, this hasn't worked and we are committed to getting this money back. That is why have moved to more direct measures of recovery, including taking money straight from his pay packet.' In 2008, before Ipsa took over the system, Mr Joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly £5,000 in 'non-parliamentary' travel expenses to Tokyo, Kinshasa and Nairobi on a Commons card, and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay. The latest situation could fuel calls for Ipsa to publish fuller, receipt-level information about MPs' spending. The watchdog has already lost two rounds of an Freedom of Information battle to avoid publishing copies of every receipt filed, a process that could potentially cost millions of pounds. The Court of Appeal is due to hear the case later this month - but no judgement is expected until after the election. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined £1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.

"The family of an alleged Facebook fraudster who faces up to 40 years in prison have gone missing days after he went on the run, police say. Paul Ceglia, 41, of Wellsville, New York, sued the social media founder, Mark Zuckerberg, in 2010, claiming he had been promised a 50 per cent share in the business in exchange for start-up money. But federal prosecutors said he fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case and he was due to go on trial on May 4. However, this week it was reported that, while under house arrest, he ditched his ankle monitoring bracelet and assumed fugitive status ahead of the hearing. Paul Ceglia, 41, of Wellsville, New York, (seen above with his wife Iasia in 2006) reportedly ditched his ankle monitoring bracelet over the weekend and assumed fugitive status ahead of his May trial . Now authorities say family members are concerned over the whereabouts of his wife, 36-year-old Iasia M. Ceglia, 36, and their two young sons, Leeman, ten, and Joseffinn, 11 (children seen here) Now authorities are concerned over the whereabouts of his wife, 36-year-old Iasia M. Ceglia, and their two young sons, Leeman, 10, and Joseffinn, 11. The family and their dog apparently have not been seen at home since March 10. Two childhood friends of Mrs Ceglia told WGRZ News that they believe it's possible her husband coerced her to flee with him. Neither had been able to contact her by telephone, which they said was 'unusual'. Police are currently appealing for anyone for information on the Ceglia family's location to come forward. Ceglia faces  trial on a charge he fraudulently claimed ownership in Facebook. His civil lawsuit against founder Zuckerberg was thrown out after he was accused of doctoring a software development contract he signed with Zuckerberg in 2003. Authorities say he made it appear Zuckerberg promised him half ownership in return for $1,000 in start-up money. Search: U.S. Marshalls released this Wanted poster in the search for the  fugitive who escaped house arrest . Ceglia was criminally charged in 2012 and went on to plead not guilty to fraud charges. He was due to go on trial in May. However, it emerged this week that Ceglia had one missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet. Lawsuit: Ceglia sued Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg (pictured), in 2010 . 'I don’t know where he is,' his attorney, Robert Fogg, admitted. 'I haven’t got a clue.' Speaking to Reuters, Fogg said Ceglia's tracking device had been found at his home, in New York's rural Allegany County, after the U.S. Marshals Service was dispatched to check on him on Sunday. He said he has not heard from Ceglia, adding that U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick has now scheduled a court hearing for Tuesday that was 'most definitely spawned by the recent event'. Last April, Buffalo federal judge Richard Arcara officially closed the book on Mr Ceglia's multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming half-ownership of Facebook, granting Mr Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss it . The ruling affirmed a magistrate judge's recommendation from a year earlier, saying the suit should be thrown out because the 2003 software development contract Ceglia had based it on was faked. Ceglia had claimed that he and Zuckerberg had signed a contract, 'The Face Book', that included a provision entitling him to half-ownership of Facebook in exchange for start-up money for the firm. At the time, Zuckerberg was a freshman at Harvard University. Although Facebook's lawyers agreed the pair had a contract, they said references to the social network were slipped in for the lawsuit. Claims: Ceglia - who claimed he had been promised a 50 per cent share in Facebook (pictured) - was due to go on trial on May 4. However, he is now missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet . Zuckerberg had previously done some programming work for Ceglia's company, StreetFax.com. The lawyers argued that  the only valid contract between the pair related to that company. At the time of Ceglia's arrest, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the suspect - who also provided allegedly falsified emails - was seeking a 'quick payday based on a blatant forgery.' 'The contract is a cut-and-paste job, the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud,' attorneys for Mr Zuckerberg and his Palo Alto, California-based company added. 'Zuckerberg has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to Ceglia's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails.' On Monday, Fogg said that Ceglia - who has pleaded not guilty - has 'always been concerned with justice'. 'He has always been concerned about if he'd get a fair trial,' the attorney added. Ceglia has twice tried to get the charges dropped. He is also appealing against the 2014 ruling. November 22, 2003 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'I have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at Harvard that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours. If we don’t make a move soon, I think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them. 'I’ve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $1000 for the facebook (sic) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or Jeff to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them. Please give me a call so that we can talk more about this.' January 1, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'I think it is unnecessary at this point, with all of the extra work I have done for you, to be held to the original completion date. I should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control, namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the Streetfax project that you wanted to be placed as a priority, thereby delaying my start on our second project. 'Thus, I am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract.' January 5 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'It is well past January 1 and to my knowledge you don't have a single thing done for the site... You know perfectly well that you can't just take a person's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in Harvard. 'I've been stalled long enough on this thing and if I don't see something soon I'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in Dobbs Ferry and let them know what's going on.' February 2, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Paul, I have a rather serious issue to discuss with you, according to our contract I owe you over 30% more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80% of the company. 'First I want to say that I think that is completely unfair because I did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second I don’t even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty. 'Mostly though I just won’t even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage. I’d like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership.' February 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Sorry it’s taken me a few days to respond, (sic) Now that the sites (sic) live I feel I must take creative control and I just can not risk injuring my sites (sic) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk, nor do I wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni. The site is cool as it is and I don’t care about making any money on it right now, I just want to see if people will use it.' February 7, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Mark, all I can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and MONEY that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh I’ve changed my mind I don’t think it’s cool to make money and that that should be that.' April 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia . 'Paul, I have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it, so I am thinking of just taking the server down. My parents have a fund that I can tap into for my college expenses and I would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work. At this point I won’t even really be able to work on the facebook until Summer.' April 6, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg . 'Grow up, take a f***ing ethics class, choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours.' July 22, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia (A week before Facebook was incorporated) 'Paul, I am guessing that you don’t want to talk to me but I wanted to say happy birthday and that I hope to resolve our differences. I see that what I did was wrong and I am really sorry that I behaved as I did. Please give me your address and I will mail you back the $2000 for your trouble, more if it will repair our business relationship. 'Another summer is here and I still don’t have any time to build our site, I understand that I promised I would, but other things have come up and I am out in California working during break. I just don’t want the obligation of having to answer to you for not following through and I won’t be able to.

"Matthew Gonzalez allegedly told police he communicated with his neighbor's dog prior to shooting his ex-girlfriend . Authorities say an Albuquerque man accused of shooting his ex-girlfriend on Tuesday told police his neighbor's dog told him to do it. KRQE-TV in Albuquerque reports that 48-year-old Matthew Gonzales told investigators that the dog gave him the advice after Gonzales saw his ex-girlfriend's status update on social media. Gonzales says he was angry about his ex-girlfriend announcing that she was single. According to court documents, Gonzales says the dog told him, 'you need to take care of this.' Police say Gonzales shot his ex-girlfriend during a struggle on Tuesday. According to court documents when police arrived they saw a woman lying on the ground with an apparent gunshot wound to her head. She was conscious when she arrived at the hospital and told the staff that her boyfriend arrived at her home that morning and was arguing with her. She then told police that because her family was at her home at the time she got into a car to discuss things with her ex-boyfriend so as not to upset them. She says that he drove her short distance and the next thing she remembered was that she was lying on the ground on the street. Court documents state that police discovered Matthew Gonzales at Legacy Church where he supposedly admitted to his pastor that he shot his ex-girlfriend. When police confronted Gonzales, he waived his Miranda Rights and said that his neighbour has a dog that communicates with him. He told police that he initially planned on ending his own life in front of his girlfriend so that she would 'know how he felt' about her single status on Facebook. Court documents; Court documents describe that struggle between Matthew Gonzales and his ex-girlfriend on Tuesday and reveals he believes his neighbor's dog told him to kill himself in front of his girlfriend . Planned suicide: Court documents reveal that Gonzales planned on killing himself but that he was later convinced by his boss to confess his sins to a pastor instead . Police say Matthew told them that he drove to his sister's house to borrow a gun and he took the gun to his ex-girlfriend’s house where he arrived unannounced. She and her 10-year-old daughter exited the house as he demanded and he insisted that his ex-girlfriend get into his car and that her daughter go to the neighbor's house. 'Don’t make me drag you into the car,' he reportedly said. He allegedly pulled a gun from his pocket and his ex-girlfriend fearfully obliged. Matthew told police that as he drove his girlfriend she was 'freaking out' and shaking. The court document states that when the ex-girlfriend saw Gonzales staring into oncoming traffic she opened the door and tried to get out of the car. Gonzales, with a gun in his right pocket, allegedly tried to grab her and he also discharged his gun one time. She fell to the ground. He then allegedly drove to the Mesa to commit suicide but after calling his boss he was advised to talk to his pastor. Gonzales faces a number of charges, including kidnapping and aggravated battery. He is being held on a $150,000 bond. It was not known if he had an attorney.","Matthew Gonzales told police he was angry about his ex-girlfriend announcing that she was single on social media .

"'Concerned': Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the highly respected Ernst & Young Item Club . Ed Miliband does not have the right ‘mind-set’ to run the country and has an unrealistic view of how business works, a leading economist says today. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the highly respected Ernst & Young Item Club, says he is ‘concerned’ about the prospect of a Labour government after the general election in May. The former Treasury mandarin says ‘even Neil Kinnock’ would have been a safer pair of hands than Mr Miliband because ‘he knew the way the world worked’. The unflattering comparison with the former Labour leader – who lost the 1992 election to John Major – will delight Tories hoping for a similar result in May. Mr Spencer says George Osborne’s plans to cut state spending to the lowest level since the 1930s will not lead to ‘Armageddon’ despite protest from the left. ‘The world has moved on from the 1930s,’ says Mr Spencer, dismissing claims from Labour and the unions that the Tories’ plans would cripple public services. He says whoever is Chancellor after the election will need to return Britain to the black and start paying down the national debt after two decades of borrowing. The comments, in an interview with the Daily Mail, will come as a boost for Mr Osborne ahead of the budget next week. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband has pledged to ‘bring back socialism’ and is planning to raise taxes on business, high earners and owners of expensive homes. Plans: Mr Miliband (right) has pledged to  to raise taxes on business, high earners and owners of expensive homes while Chancellor George Osborne (left) plans to cut state spending to the lowest level since the 1930s . The boss of chemist chain Boots has warned a Labour government would be a catastrophe and Mr Spencer says he is now also worried about the prospects of a Labour government. ‘This is the first election where I have not been able to wholeheartedly support Labour’s policies,’ he says. ‘Labour used to be quite concerned about the way the economy actually works. 'Labour’s heart has always been in the right place, no question, but they do have a little bit of a problem in understanding the way the world works.’","Peter Spencer says he's 'concerned' about prospect of Labour government .

"Three Watertown police officers have recalled their chaotic gun battle with the Boston bombers four days after the explosions that killed three people and injured 264. Testifying at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Monday, the officers also recounted the terrifying moment he raced towards them in his getaway car - but fatally struck his older brother, Tamerlan, as he fled. The brothers fired a gun at three police officers and hurled bombs at them, including one that was similar to the devices used in the April 15, 2013 attack, the officers testified. Watertown Police patrolman John Reynolds recalled chasing the brothers in two cars hours after they allegedly shot and killed a police officer in nearby Cambridge, and having a large bomb thrown at him and a colleague as they tried to arrest the Tsarnaevs. On trial: In this courtroom sketch, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, center, is depicted between defense attorneys while the boat in which he was captured in sits on a trailer for observation during his federal death penalty trial . Getting a close look: The jury visited the bullet-ridden boat where he was found in April 2013 . 'My ears were ringing, I could hear all the car alarms going off for many blocks around us, there was a huge cloud of smoke,' he testified in court in Boston. 'I could feel all the debris landing on me.' The gun battle continued for eight minutes, he said, . 'It felt like there were hundreds of rounds,' he said. 'It was non-stop.' The jury saw a photo taken during the gun battle, showing two people that Watertown Police Sergeant John MacClellan identified as the Tsarnaev brothers, crouching in front of a black Mercedes during the gunfight, which played out on a street tightly packed with houses. James Foley, who lived on the block, testified that he was sleeping in the living room of his home with his three-week-old son when he was awakened by gunshots. 'I looked outside and I could see guns firing,' Foley said. 'I didn't look for long. I saw that it was pretty serious and I wanted to get my kid back upstairs to the back of his house and into his crib.' Reynolds, MacClellan and a third officer, Sergeant Jeff Pugliese, attempted to tackle Tamerlan, who was a trained martial artist. As they struggled to handcuff him, Dzhokhar sped towards them in the black Mercedes that the brothers had carjacked. Reynolds said he heard the engine revving. Found: Investigators work near a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts the day after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding inside in April 2013. On Monday, the jury in his death penalty trial visited the boat . Evidence: A still video image shows the covered boat being transported for viewing by the jurors on Monday . 'Get off! Get off! He's coming back toward us!' he recalled himself shouting. He fired and hit the windshield as Dzhokhar drove towards them but he didn't stop. An officer tried to pull Tamerlan out of the way but couldn't, ABC reported. 'Tamerlan was run over by the Mercedes,' Reynolds said. Sergeant John MacLellan added: 'It was very violent. The car was jumping back and forth with the body stuck up under the wheels.' Tamerlan was not immediately killed by his injuries and Reynolds testified it was still a struggle for him and a second officer to handcuff him after Dzhokhar drove off. He died later that day. Dzhokhar briefly escaped, ditching the car and hiding in a drydocked boat in a backyard. Reynolds also testified about the moment he came across the two men days after the bombings and after they had killed an MIT campus security officer. He was on patrol at 12.38am when he saw a vehicle that matched the description of the car involved in that shooting. 'He was driving slow, very suspicious,' Reynolds told the court. 'We locked eyes.' The car stopped and Tamerlan got out before pulling out a weapon on Reynolds, he testified. The police officer ducked and reversed - and then came the eight-minute gun battle. Ahead of the testimony, the jurors visited the boat where Tsarnaev was found. Tsarnaev, flanked by three attorneys and U.S. marshals, watched impassively from a table 50 feet away. The group then went two at a time onto a lift so they could look inside the vessel, which was on a trailer, to see the notes he scrawled on the walls before he was taken into custody on April 19, 2013. The red and white boat, the Slipaway II, was dry-docked in a yard in Watertown when he climbed inside. It is now covered with more than 100 bullet holes each marked with white evidence tape. In his notes written in pencil, Tsarnaev denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. The note is speckled with at least 10 bullet holes and stained with long streaks of blood. Hideout: Tsarnaev, then 19, can be seen emerging from the boat after he was found on April 19, 2013 . Final words: Inside the boat, he wrote a series of notes, which the jury saw Monday. This note, punctured with bullets, explains how he is jealous of his brother Tamerlan because he had died and gone to paradise . The notes also denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Last week, the jury heard how all the bullets that made holes in the side of the boat were shot from outside the vessel as he hid inside . 'We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all,' Tsarnaev scrawled, citing what it said was aggression in Muslim lands. 'We are promised victory and we will surely get it. Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in islam... but due to said [blank] it is allowed.' 'The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that. As a [unintelligible] I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all. Well at least that's how muhhammad (pbuh) wanted it to be [for]ever. The ummah is beginning to rise. [Unintelligible] has awoken the mujahideen. Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven, now how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it. Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said [unintelligible] it is allowed. All credit goes [unintelligible]. Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.' 'I'm jealous of my brother who ha[s] [re]ceived the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me. I do not mourn because his soul is very much alive. God has a plan for each person. Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions. I ask Allah to make me a shahied to allow me to return to him and be among all the righteous people in the highest levels of heaven. He who Allah guides no one can misguide. A[llah Ak]bar!' A word was missing from the message due to a bullet hole. In a separate, blood-covered note, he wrote that he was jealous of his older brother because he was dead and in paradise. 'God has a plan for each person,' he wrote. 'Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions.' Last week, Todd Brown, a Boston police bomb technician, testified that he saw the writing inside the boat when he was sent to check it to make sure there were no explosives or booby traps on board. During cross-examination of Brown, Tsarnaev's lawyers established that all the bullet holes were from shots coming into the boat when police fired. The officer said no bombs, guns or weapons of any kind were found inside the boat. One of the boat's two front windows is shot out almost completely, with just one shattered piece of glass remaining. Tsarnaev is on trial for planning and carrying out the April 15, 2013 bombings and faces the death penalty if convicted. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded near the Boston marathon finish line. The blasts killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard, who was at the marathon with his family. Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 27, was shot dead three days later as the Tsarnaev brothers fled authorities. After the bombings, the brothers carjacked a man and hurled explosives at police during a shootout that ended when Dzhokhar roared off in a car, running over and killing his brother before disappearing into the dry-docked boat in the Boston suburb of Watertown. Plot: 23-year-old Tamerlan, pictured left, was killed during a shootout with police officers days after the bombings, while Dzhokhar, right, was found injured inside the boat and taken into custody . Police found him the next evening, after a day-long lockdown of the Boston area when hundreds of thousands of people hid in their homes. Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements of his trial that he participated in the bombings and the later crimes, but said his slain older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind who recruited the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar to help him. But prosecutors say Tsarnaev was a full and willing participant. Now 21, he faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. The same jury that decides guilt will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty. The trial began its third week on Monday. It had been expected to last three to four months but is moving faster than anticipated, largely because the defense has not cross-examined many witnesses.","Three police officers testified about the harrowing gun battle in Watertown, Massachusetts during Tsarnaev's trial on Monday .
