"It's one of India's most colourful festivals and when Princess Beatrice was invited to get involved during a London cocktail party thrown to celebrate it, she just couldn't resist getting stuck in. Luckily for Beatrice, that meant bindi accessories inspired by the sub-continent rather than the paint-throwing that characterises the real thing. The 26-year-old was back on the fashion circuit for the second time in less than seven days, having stepped out for the gala launch of the Alexander McQueen Savage Beauty retrospective last week. Bright spark: Princess Beatrice got into the spirit of the event with a set of bright green bindis . Looking good: Beatrice looked lovely in an emerald-green dress with a striking sequinned bodice . On that occasion, Beatrice, who is recently returned from the US where she went back to school to study a brief course in finance, opted for a daring thigh-high gown. This time, the Princess, who was attending a party thrown by London-based Indian designer Saloni Lodha, opted for a striking emerald-green dress and a forehead decorated with bindis. Ms Lodha, who grew up in Mumbai but has also lived in Seoul and Hong Kong, launched her eponymous label in 2008 and counts Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama among her fans. Now stocked at Net-a-Porter and Matches among others, she is famous for her love of colourful print and flatteringly feminine designs. But Ms Lodha wasn't the only print fan at the party, with fellow designer, Greek-born Mary Katrantzou, also in attendance. All smiles: Beatrice posed with Ms Lodha who was wearing one of her own eye-catching designs . Fashion fan: Beatrice has become a familiar face on the London fashion party circuit of late .

Prosecutors said Bahena-Arrellano had read text messages on his estranged wife's cell phone and believed she was cheating on him, according to ABC 7 Chicago. Elk Grove Village Deputy Police Chief Chuck Walsh called the attack an isolated 'domestic violence-type incident'. Walsh said no one else was injured during the stabbing and that the hospital was not placed on lockdown, the Chicago Tribune reported. According to police, Bahena-Arrellano was deported after he was charged with domestic violence battery twice.

"England's first wild beavers for 800 years were last night released back onto a river in Devon, after passing vital health tests. The animals were captured for a series of tests last month, after Natural England gave unprecedented permission for them to be allowed to live free near Ottery St Mary, east Devon. Four adults and a juvenile were certified as free of disease, and will rejoin four young kits which had remained on the River Otter. Scroll down for video . Born free: England's first wild beavers (pictured paddling away after being released) for 800 years were last night released back onto the River Otter in Devon, after passing vital health tests . Devon Wildlife Trust officials, who will monitor the animals in a five-year pilot project, last night said they were delighted the beavers were back on the river. Ministers had initially wanted the remarkable animals to be rounded up and put in a zoo or even culled after they were first spotted in late 2013. But government agency Natural England has decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild in the first project of its kind. Devon Wildlife Trust’s Peter Burgess said last night: ‘Today’s re-release means that these beavers are back where they belong, in the wild on the River Otter. ‘We’re delighted and relieved that they’ve coped very well with a short period in captivity and been given a clean bill of health. Close to freedom: The Devon Wildlife Trust said: ‘We’re delighted that [the otters] have coped very well with a short period in captivity and been given a clean bill of health (moment prior to release, pictured) Government agency Natural England ruled that as long as the beavers were disease-free, they could remain on the Rover Otter (newly freed otter shown in its natural habitat) Beavers build dams to flood areas and provide ponds. These in turn act as protection against predators - their 'lodges' are often in the middle of these deep ponds - and to provide easy access to food during winter. Dams typically range in size from a few feet to more than 300ft wide, although one was once recorded as spanning 2,800ft. Beavers work at night, carrying mud and stones with their paws and timber between their teeth. ‘They’ve tested free of serious infectious diseases and we’re now looking forward to starting the next phase of our work: studying the long term effects of these wild beavers on the local landscape, on local communities and local wildlife.’ Beavers, which are native to England, were plentiful in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary some 18 months ago. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. It later became clear that there were in fact nine beavers, of three different generations, living on the River Otter. Idyllic: Beavers, which are native to England, were plentiful in our countryside (River Otter pictured)  until they were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages . DNA tests also confirmed the family were Eurasian beavers - the species originally native to the UK - rather than North American beavers (here one of the English family is pictured while in captivity during tests) Tests, carried out by beaver experts from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland over the last few days, revealed the animals were free of bovine TB and a parasitic tapeworm that can cause serious harm in humans . At home: Officials had originally said that the wild family (one member, pictured) posed a risk to other wildlife, and might spread parasites and disease, and should be caged or killed . The beavers' impact on the surrounding landscape (dam in River Otter, pictured), fish stocks and landowners including farmers, will also be monitored over the coming years . Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers, reducing numbers of trees on the banks, improving light levels, and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams. Some people think they may slow down flood waters, as well as boosting wildlife diversity. Farmers and anglers have that they can damage the landscape and fish migration routes. This proved they had been quietly prospering and – crucially – breeding, and had been there for at least five years. News of the discovery was incredibly popular locally - so people were furious when Defra, the Government’s environment department, decided they would round up the beavers. Officials said that they posed a risk to other wildlife, and might spread parasites and disease, and should be caged or killed. But a fierce campaign to allow the animals to remain free, backed by the Daily Mail, resulted in a dramatic turnaround. Natural England, the government agency in charge of wildlife, ruled that as long as the beavers were disease-free, they could remain on the Rover Otter. They vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until, mysteriously, one was spotted near Ottery St Mary in eastern Devon last winter. A few months later a second beaver was seen and then grainy pictures emerged in the spring of a juvenile. A screen grab of video footage of the beavers is shown . Each of the beavers (pictured during short stint in captivity) has been tagged with colour-coded ear labels, which will help officials track the individuals as they are filmed by hidden cameras . Beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity. They are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild. The animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft, weigh up to 70lbs, and feed on a diet of reeds, leaves and bark. Beavers were hunted almost to extinction in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties. Tests, carried out by beaver experts from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland over the last few days, revealed the animals were free of bovine TB and a parasitic tapeworm that can cause serious harm in humans. DNA tests also confirmed they were Eurasian beavers - the species originally native to the UK - rather than North American beavers. Having been cleared for the project, each of the beavers has been tagged with colour-coded ear labels, which will help officials track the individuals as they are filmed by hidden cameras. Their impact on the surrounding landscape, fish stocks and landowners including farmers, will also be monitored. At its conclusion in 2020, the project will present Natural England with its evidence and decide the future of the beavers. The four adults and a juvenile were certified as free of disease, and will rejoin four young kits which had remained on the River Otter (map shown) The reason for the beavers’ (pictured) presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are captive breeding programmes in the UK, including one in Dartmoor, but none of the animals are unaccounted for . Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: ‘The return of these beavers is fantastically exciting, and a great success for all those who fought for them to remain in the wild. ‘Let us hope it is just the start. We should bring beavers back to other parts of the UK where they used to live and look at boosting or returning other species too - from the pine marten to the lynx. ‘We need to radically change our relationship with nature. Bringing back our native species will help existing wildlife, repair our ecosystems and bring more life and joy to our landscape.’ The reason for the beavers’ original presence in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes in the UK, including one on the other side of Dartmoor, but none of the animals is unaccounted for. Other explanations touted by locals include their escape from a private collection, or a deliberate release by wildlife enthusiasts.","Captured for a tests last month, after government agency gave permission for them to be allowed to live free near Ottery St Mary, Devon .

"Young teenagers are happier and healthier now than teenagers were a decade ago, a new study said yesterday. It found that the ‘Facebook generation’ of youngsters are less likely than their predecessors to drink alcohol, smoke tobacco or cannabis, or get bullied. A growing proportion of 11 to 15-year-olds, the study said, engage in behaviour that would make their parents proud. They eat fruit and vegetables, take exercise, clean their teeth, and talk to their mothers and fathers. Adolescents are more likely to eat fruit and vegetables, take exercise, talk  to their mothers and fathers . However the study, assembled by academics at St Andrews University, complained that despite the increasing levels of health and well-being, adolescents now are just as likely to be fat as the generation of the 2000s. Obesity rates, it said, did not decline between 2002 and 2010. The findings, based on a series of papers put together with the help of the World Health Organisation, are the latest to underline the increasing trend for teenagers to avoid risky behaviour in favour of a healthier lifestyle. In England and Wales teen pregnancies have fallen to levels last seen in the 1960s and official surveys have shown a major drop in drinking among young people. More than a quarter of under-24s are teetotal and fewer than a fifth ever go binge drinking, according to 2013 estimates. in 2013 tobacco smoking among young women aged 18 to 24 dropped by 10 per cent, and among young men by almost as much. State surveys also showed a major drop in 2013 in numbers of people in the same age group who took any illegal drug, down from 19.3 per cent to 16.3 per cent. Some researchers have pointed to a ‘Facebook effect’ which has led teenagers who would once have spent their spare time on the streets instead to devote it to playing with gadgets in their bedrooms. Widespread public disapproval of smoking, drunkenness, drug abuse and teen mothers is also likely to have influenced teen behaviour. Professor Candace Currie of St Andrews, who assembled evidence drawn up from surveys and official statistics carried out in Europe and North America, said: ‘There is much to celebrate about the health and well-being of many young people today.’ The study, assembled by academics at St Andrews University (pictured), said that despite the increasing levels of health and well-being, adolescents now are just as likely to be fat as the previous generation . She added however that ‘others continue to experience real and worrying problems.’ Some countries, including Scotland, showed evidence that fewer youngsters took daily exercise in 2010 than in 2002. The report said that while the overall optimistic picture seems surprising, considering that many countries faced a severe economic crisis in the last decade, policies and actions to improve public health were implemented in many countries in the same period. Many of those policies were, however, deeply controversial. Some researchers have pointed to a ‘Facebook effect’ which has led teenagers who would once have spent their spare time on the streets instead to devote it to playing with gadgets . Critics of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, launched in England by Tony Blair, have said that it had nothing to do with the fall in teenage pregnancy, which did not become evident until after David Cameron’s Coalition scrapped the programme of contraceptive distribution in 2010. Yesterday’s report added that ‘the general feeling that young people are better off today could also be attributed to changes in fashions, behavioural norms and societal values.’ Professor Currie said: ‘Adolescence is a crucial stage in life when you lay the foundation for adulthood, whether that is healthy or otherwise.’","11-15 year olds less vulnerable to drugs, alcohol and smoking cigarettes .

"Authorities say a Pennsylvania man on Sunday denied striking a woman with his car despite her the upper half of her severed body having been found on his passenger side floor. Jose Antonio Santiago, 33, is charged with causing an accident involving death or injury in the hit-and-run near Allentown after cops identified him by matching the car parts lost at the scene to those missing from his badly damaged car. State police say 62-year-old Anna Lewis was hit so hard that her body was cut in half and that the upper half of her severed torso was found in Santiago's Saab. Scroll down for video . Sliced in half: Anna Lewis (left, with her niece) was hit so hard in a hit-and-run Sunday that she was sliced in half at the waist with her top half ending up in the driver's car and the bottom being left behind . Her sister Rosalie Carlo, 51, of Brooklyn, New York, suffered a broken wrist and other injuries in the crash, reports LeHighValley.com, after the sisters were hit while walking on the shoulder of a road in Hanover Township. Carlo and Lewis had just left a restaurant where they had dinner, when 'I saw a bright light and I felt a push,' Carlo recalled from her hospital bed Monday. 'I felt enormous pressure, like a Mack truck hit me.' The next thing she remembers, she was being roused by a passerby who told her help was on the way. Meanwhile, her sister's lower torso was among the debris left behind by the hit-and-run driver, her head and torso had presumably crashed through the driver's windshield. 'I hope he rots in hell,' she would later tell Lehighvalley.com. 'It's not right. My sister was a good woman.' Police found Santiago's heavily damaged car about 90 minutes after the crash and Santiago two hours later when he approached a state trooper at his damaged car and identified himself. Police say Santiago admitted driving a friend home from a bar that night after having a few drinks but denied hitting anyone. 'I hope he rots in hell': Lewis's sister Rosalie Carlo (center) was with her when a car sliced her in half and drove off with half her body in the car . Suspect approached them: Police searched the scene and found pieces of a car left behind, including a side mirror and front grill. They soon found a badly damaged car with the missing parts . 'Was there a crash on Airport Rd? I had looked on WFMZ news and seen there was a hit and run accident, I didn't hit anyone. I would've stopped. I'm not a bad person,' he told them, apparently without prompting. He also told them, 'I was just bringing my friend home and it all happened so fast, but I didn't hit anyone. If I did, I would've stopped.' Left at the scene were a car's mirror, the front grill, the right headlight, a portion of a window and other parts, according to records. Police discovered Santiago's car was missing those parts. His right pant leg was also covered in red 'body matter.' Police indicated that Santiago smelled of alcohol but did not specify whether he'd been given a field sobriety test. Police did say they suspected both alcohol and speed were factors, reports WFMZ. He's been charged with a felony count of accidents involving death or personal injury, reports LeHighValley.com. He was locked up in Lehigh County jail in lieu of $275,000 bail. It remained unclear whether he'd face DUI charges. Also unclear was whether Santiago had anyone else in the car at the time he allegedly hit Lewis. Jose Antonio Santiago, 33, approached the police as they inspected his badly damaged 2003 Saab and told them he'd heard about a hit and run on the news. Police say he was covered in blood and smelled of alcohol .

He was seen in hysterics at Harry Wright's portrayal of the indomitable Lady Bracknell and Harry Elgood's sophisticated depiction of lead character John Worthing. This comes days after the revelation that Prince Harry is planning to leave the Army to continue his mother's legacy with a number of charitable projects during his second 'gap year'. Speaking  about his choice to bring his active military career to an end, he said it was a 'really tough' decision and he was looking forward to starting a new chapter in his life.

Earlier today he joined Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge for the memorial service of triple Olympic gold equestrian Richard Meade. In a statement on his website, Prince Harry said: '[Richard] had huge successes in his career as a competitor but his greatest success was not in his achievements on a horse, but in the way he conducted himself – with generosity to others, genuine interest and a real sense of integrity, always standing up for what was morally right. 'He cared deeply about the sport and gave so much to both the eventing and wider horse world. Thank you for all the wonderfully supportive letters and messages and many apologies for only answering a small number of them so far.' His two-year relationship with Cressida came to an end last April, with a number of sources saying she was hoping to concentrate on her career. She graduated from the Laban school of dance and made her theatrical debut  in 2014 at Hay Festival in the play There's a Monster in the Lake. The budding actress has now bagged a bit part in Tulip Fever, the forthcoming Judi Dench movie produced by Harvey Weinstein, who declared her 'a fantastic actress'.

"More than 1,000 people have been questioned by police investigating claims of historic sex abuse, it was revealed yesterday. The huge number, including suspects, victims and witnesses, lays bare the scale of the task facing detectives. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted the wave of allegations is consuming a huge amount of resources. But he pledged to get to the heart of the claims, no matter who was involved. Scroll down for video . Homes belonging to Leon Brittan, left, and the former head of the armed forces Lord Bramall, right, have been searched by police investigating child sex allegations, it has emerged . His comments came after it was revealed Met officers raided the homes of Tory grandee Leon Brittan and a former head of the Armed Forces last week. In a series of low-key searches, plain-clothes detectives examined Lord Brittan's home in Pimlico, central London, and his North Yorkshire country retreat. The rural property, near the picturesque town of Leyburn, is in the Richmond constituency which he once represented as an MP. The searches came just six weeks after the former home secretary died aged 75, triggering claims he attended VIP sex ring parties. Officers also attended the home of 91-year-old Lord Bramall, chief of defence staff until 1985. The Second World War hero won the Military Cross for bravery and rose to be Britain's top-ranking Army officer. The team of police, including at least one in body armour, were seen at his £750,000 stone detached property in Crondall, Hampshire, near the Army town of Aldershot. One onlooker said: 'They were here for most of the day. There were lots of cars in the driveway. I've no idea why they needed so many – he's an elderly man.' The searches took place on the same day as officers searched the Leicestershire home of ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor, 68, prompting him to publicly deny any wrongdoing. Proctor, whose Parliamentary career ended in a rent boy 'spanking' scandal, said he was trapped in a 'Kafka-esque fantasy'. Former disgraced Tory MP Harvey Proctor, pictured, also had his home raided earlier this week by officers from Operation Midland . Detectives spent two days searching Mr Proctor's grace-and-favour home at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, pictured, after a police team arrived on the estate on Wednesday . Lord Bramall was head of the army from 1979-1982 before becoming Chief of the Defence staff - head of the whole armed forces - a position he held for three years. He first joined the army in 1943 and took part in the D-Day landings the next year. The young soldier was given the Military Cross at the end of the Second World War. Lord Bramall's glittering military career saw him promoted to lieutenant and sent to Japan in 1946, before serving in the Middle East during the 1950s as he climbed the ranks. He was given an OBE for his services to the Armed Forces in 1965, shortly before he was deployed to Borneo as commanding officer of the Royal Green Jackets regiment, where his actions were mentioned in despatches. He would later serve in Hong Kong before returning to Britain. In his role as Chief of the Defence Staff, Lord Bramall played an integral role in planning the Falklands invasion. After retiring he was made a Knight of the Garter and, as a life peer, spoke out against invading Iraq in 2003. Speaking on LBC Radio, Sir Bernard said his staff were 'determinedly working their way through' all the evidence, adding: 'We've now interviewed at least 1,000 people.' Asked whether the huge amount of resources required could be justified, he said victims deserve answers. 'What we cannot do is ignore people who were ignored 30 years ago,' he said. Sir Bernard added that police 'have to prioritise' but nevertheless have 'put tens of officers into these inquiries'. He said: 'We have got both witnesses and suspects that are scattered to the four winds. They are not grouped geographically like they were 30 years ago. 'But we will get to the bottom of it, I am sure we will, so far as it is possible.' The overarching Met inquiry into claims of historic sex abuse was triggered in 2012 when MP Tom Watson called for police to look again at allegations of a 'powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10'. At least six spin-off inquiries have been launched, with the most high-profile one investigating claims a VIP sex ring operated out of the exclusive Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico. Lord Brittan had always denied any wrongdoing and after his death Tory colleagues lined up to defend his legacy. Ex-minister John Gummer, now Lord Deben, branded the claims 'wicked'. Lord Bramall was unavailable for comment. Lord Brittan - pictured as British Trade and Industry Secretary - with Margaret Thatcher in 1986.

"Sarah Carr (pictured) said that she received a phone call  from a man who claimed to be from the IRS . A con artist who told woman she was being convicted of tax fraud seemingly had an attack of guilt after finding out she was pregnant. Sarah Carr, who owns three event venue businesses in Denver, Colorado, told 9News that she received a voicemail on her cell phone from a man who claimed to be from the IRS. Ms Carr said she she rang the number back and broke down in tears at the news at 8am on Tuesday morning. The man told her there was a lien on one of her properties and Ms Carr said he was believable as he knew so many personal and private details about her business and finances. 'I just start crying,' Carr told KUSA. 'I said, 'I'm nine months pregnant...I don't know what I'm going to do.' 'And then he says, 'Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're pregnant?' and I said, 'Yes!' And he goes, 'I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry, this is a scam. You're okay, we're scamming you. 'We were just trying to get money out of you. Please stop crying,'' Carr said. She said the man then hung up and ended the call. Ms Carr, who already has a young son, said her immediate relief at not owing money than turned to a mixture of anger and fear as the man had been so convincing due to his knowledge of her situation. 'I was like super happy that I wasn't' going to jail. But then I was just really freaked out,' Ms Carr said. Fake IRS agents have now targeted more than 366,000 people with harassing phone calls demanding payments and threatening jail as part of a huge nationwide tax scam that has cost taxpayers $15.5 million. More than 3,000 people have fallen for the ruse since 2013, Timothy Camus, a Treasury deputy inspector general for tax administration, said Thursday. Scroll down for video . Ms Carr with her young son, left, and right, with her husband.  She said she broke down in tears at the news at 8am on Tuesday morning, but the con-man then said 'I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry, this is a scam. You're okay, we're scamming you . The scam has claimed victims in almost every state, Camus said. One unidentified victim lost more than $500,000. 'The criminals do not discriminate. They are calling people everywhere, of all income levels and backgrounds,' Camus told the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing. 'The number of complaints we have received about this scam make it the largest, most pervasive impersonation scam in the history of our agency.' With tax season in full swing, the IRS is warning taxpayers about a huge nationwide scam in which fake IRS agents call people on the phone, demand payments and threaten them with jail if they don't pay. Some tips from the IRS to void the scam: . The IRS will never call about taxes owed without first mailing you a notice. The IRS will never demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount the agency says you owe. The IRS will never require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card. The IRS will never ask for credit card or debit card numbers over the phone.The IRS will never threaten to have you arrested for not paying. If you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and asking for money, here's what the IRS says you should do: . If you think you might owe back taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. If you know you don't owe taxes, report the incident to the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, at 1-800-366-4484, or online at www.tigta.gov . The scam is so widespread that investigators believe there is more than one group of perpetrators, including some overseas. Camus said even he received a call from one of the scammers at his home on a Saturday. He said he had a stern message for the caller: 'Your day will come.' So far, Camus said, two people in Florida have been arrested. They were accused of being part of a scam that involved people in call centers in India contacting U.S. taxpayers and pretending to be IRS agents. 'These criminal acts are perpetrated by thieves hiding behind telephone lines and computers, preying on honest taxpayers and robbing the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars every year,' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 'Taxpayers must be more aware of the risks and better protected from attack and these criminals must be found and brought to justice.' The inspector general's office started warning taxpayers about the scam a year ago, but it has since ballooned. Tax scams often increase during filing season. As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, Camus said. The callers might even know the last four digits of the taxpayer's Social Security number, Camus said. They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account. Ms Carr said her immediate relief at not owing money than turned to a mixture of anger and fear as the man had been so convincing due to his knowledge of her situation . Ms Carr owns three event venue businesses in Denver, Colorado (one of them is pictured) Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more. Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, Camus said. And they never demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer. 'Our message is simple,' Camus said. 'If someone calls unexpectedly claiming to be from the IRS with aggressive threats if you do not pay immediately, it is a scam artist calling. The IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by telephone. If you do owe money to the IRS, chances are you have already received some form of a notice or correspondence from the IRS in your mailbox.' The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in 2013. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.","Sarah Carr owns three venue and event businesses in Denver, Colorado .

"An Australian blogger  hit back at trolls when she became the target of online abuse and vilification after she said she wasn’t crazy about a popular kitchen appliance. Lana Hirschowitz posted a ‘light-hearted’ article on her blog,Sharpest Pencil, which explained her experience using a Thermomix, a $2,000 ‘do-it-all’ kitchen appliance which has a legion of dedicated ‘cult’ followers. Scroll down for video . Blogger Lana Hirschowitz felt the wrath of an online ‘cult’ after she dared to speak out against the all-in-one kitchen appliance . The article went viral and became the topic of contentious debate which resulted in a storm of criticism for Ms Hiroschowitz, which interestingly she predicted in the opening of her article. ‘I’m almost scared to write this post. I feel like I am talking out against the cult. 'I worry that I’ll be ostracized like a leper from a community that prays before the Thermomix, but I’m taking the chance,’ she added. Ms Hirschowitz's article didn't offer any particularly harsh criticisms of the Thermomix, in fact, she even acknowledged that the appliance was ‘great at what it does.’ Her gripe was that, unlike the swarm of devoted fans, she didn’t find the appliance ‘life changing.’ Ms Hirschowitz said she was left 'teary' after being called a 'scammer' and a 'poor little rich girl' The Thermomix community have a large group of vocal online followers who didn’t take her comments lightly. Ms Hirschowitz became the target of an online attack which brought her integrity into question. She was labelled a ‘scammer’ and a ‘poor little rich girl’, some posters even saying she was using the blog post to obtain a free Nutribullet. The Thermomix is known to have dedicated band of followers who have been labelled as a 'cult' In a Youtube video she posted on Monday with Kerri Sackville she said she was brought to tears after reading the comments and condemned those who personally attack others online for merely expressing an opinion. ‘I just want to write my opinion and not be vilified for it.’ ‘It’s just an appliance.’ she added. Ms Hirschowitz took to Twitter to defend herself and those who have been attacked online for simply expressing their opinion . The critics soon became the criticised as commenters on social media started to turn on the ‘Thermomix hate brigade’ Some bloggers apologised and even back peadled claiming they ‘got a little over excited’ and’ should stay away from the news in the future.’ The Thermomix has a dedicated legion of food blog followers who started posting hate instead of recipes . In a show of defiance Ms Hirschowitz posted a picture to Twitter on Monday of her  happily cooking a laksa without the assistance of the Thermomix, instead she used a run of the mill pot. #thermogate ended with Ms Hirschowitz posting a photo of her happily cooking without the Thermomix . This wasn’t the first instance the Thermomix came under public scrutiny with social media backlash after a new model was released in Australia without 'appropriate warning.' Customers said they felt duped after buying the substandard model only days or weeks before the upgrade was released. Australian comedy duo Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney also lampooned the Thermomix as part of their parody cooking series 'The Katering Show'. In the video, which has almost 1.5 million views on Youtube, the pair describe the $2,000 appliance as 'something you buy because you've always wanted to join a cult, but don’t have the energy for group sex’ or it's 'the kind of a appliance that your rich mother-in-law gives you as a wedding gift, because she doesn't think you can cook'. The Thermomix was first launched in Australia back in 2001 with some 80,000 units being sold in 2014 alone. The German-designed appliance claims to do the job of twelve appliances, boasting the ability to weigh, chop, blend, knead, steam, juice, grate, whisk, simmer and crush.","Lana Hirschowitz wrote an article about a kitchen appliance the Thermomix .

"This United Airlines regional jet was forced to make an emergency landing without a nose gear at an airport in Chicago, Illinois, Saturday afternoon after experiencing a mechanical problem, officials said. The GoJet plane, operated by the major US airline, was traveling from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Chicago when the pilot informed passengers there was an issue with the aircraft's front landing gear. A few minutes later, the pilot announced that the plane would be performing an emergency landing at O'Hare International Airport. Incredibly, flight 3645 touched down safely with no nose gear at 3.24pm. It was the second United Airlines plane to suffer a serious malfunction Saturday after another plane had to turn back to Denver International Airport when one of its tire blew on takeoff earlier in the day.

"Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez appeared upset with a man he is accused of murdering two days before the killing, an associate of the victim said on Tuesday. This came as a Nike expert revealed Hernandez was wearing the same kind of shoes the night of the killing as the footprints found near the victim's body. Kwami Nicholas testified in Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts, that Hernandez stared at the man he is accused of killing, semiprofessional football player Odin Lloyd, and another man at a Boston nightclub on the night of June 14, 2013. Scroll down for video . A witness said that Aaron Hernandez (pictured Tuesday) appeared upset with the man he is accused of murdering two days before the killing . Kwami Nicholas testified that Hernandez stared at the man he is accused of killing, semiprofessional football player Odin Lloyd, and another man at a Boston nightclub on the night of June 14, 2013. Nicholas said Hernandez stared at Lloyd and another man for two or three minutes and later walked quickly out of the nightclub with his head down as Lloyd ran behind him, trying to catch up. He said Hernandez appeared to brush Lloyd away with an arm gesture, telling him to talk to someone else. 'He seemed like he was angry about something,' Nicholas said, adding he saw Hernandez 'storming out of the club' and 'walking aggressively'. 'He looked like he was upset,' Nicholas added. Defense lawyer Michael Fee went after Nicholas's testimony, bringing up inconsistencies in what he told police in an August 2013 interview and what he said on the witness stand Tuesday. Fee played video clips from the interview in which his testimony varied, such as about where Hernandez was and what Hernandez was doing. When Fee asked him if he could remember telling police what he said in the video, Nicholas repeatedly said he could not. Nicholas said that Hernandez appeared to brush Lloyd away with an arm gesture as he was leaving the club . Defense lawyer Michael Fee went after Nicholas's testimony, bringing up inconsistencies in what he told police in an August 2013 interview and what he said on the witness stand Tuesday . 'Do you have a poor memory, sir?' Fee asked. 'I don't have a poor memory,' Nicholas replied. Fee also questioned Nicholas' opinion of Hernandez's mood. Nicholas acknowledged he had never met Hernandez before and had never seen him leave a club. 'You're not familiar with Aaron's expressions and what he does with his face?' Fee asked. 'I'm familiar with human expressions,' Nicholas replied. 'You have no familiarity with Aaron's face or his expressions, do you?' Fee asked again. 'No, I don't,' Nicholas acknowledged. Prosecutors contend Hernandez killed Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister, after becoming upset at him for associating with people he disliked at the Rumor nightclub that night. Aaron Hernandez sits with his attorney Charles Rankin during his murder trial at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts . Prosecutors contend Hernandez killed Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister, after becoming upset at him for associating with people he disliked at the Rumor nightclub that night . Hernandez, 25, had a $41million contract with the Patriots when he was cut from the team hours after being arrested for Lloyd's killing in June 2013. He is on trial on murder and firearms charges and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted. The former tight end and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home in the early hours of June 17, 2013, and drove him to an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, where his body was found later that day, according to prosecutors. Lloyd, 27, had been shot five times with a .45 caliber handgun, and investigators found several shell casings at the scene and one that had been removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez. Also on Tuesday, the jury heard that Hernandez wore a model of Nike shoe in surveillance video recorded at his home that prosecutors say he was wearing at the time of the murder. Witness Herbert Hedges, of Nike, testifies during the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez . Hodges said that Hernandez was wearing the same Nike Air Jordan 11 Lows in surveillance footage from before and after the murder. Prosecutors said a footprint at the scene matches the shoe . Herbert Hedges, a consultant for Nike Inc, identified the footwear worn by Hernandez in still images as Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Low shoes, saying: 'It's a very unique shoe.' Hedges, who worked for the footwear company for more than 30 years, was shown surveillance video of Hernandez at a gas station less than 90 minutes before the killing and at his home less than 10 minutes after. In both, he said, Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan 11 Lows. Prosecutors have said a footprint at the scene was made by that kind of shoe. But Hernandez lawyer James Sultan pointed out that more than 3million shoes with that sole have been made. Hedges said fewer were made in a size 13, the size Hernandez wears, which would have a slightly different sole than the others. Prosecutors also showed videos of headlights heading toward the empty lot at an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home where Lloyd's body was found and then leaving less than four minutes later. But the four videos, from a gas station and two businesses, were from so far away and of such poor quality that the kind of car or the number of occupants could not be seen.","Witness said Aaron Hernandez stared at the man he's accused of killing, Odin Lloyd, at a Boston nightclub before quickly leaving club .

"I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell, writes Simon Heffer . Four years before he died in 1998, Enoch Powell did me the honour of asking me to write his biography. I spoke to almost everyone alive who knew him. When he died, I had unique access to a vast collection of private papers, including numerous intimate letters. If there is anyone alive other than Enoch’s widow and daughters who knows more about him than I do, I’d like to meet him. I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell. His probity in personal and financial matters was rock solid. When on Saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the Church of England, my first instinct was to laugh: but that soon changed into utter outrage when I realised he was serious. The Church has publicly accused Enoch of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay, without the slightest evidence. They might as well accuse him of having been a war criminal or an armed robber, for there would be as much truth in either allegation. The appalling slurs are just like those made against 91-year-old Lord Bramall, a D-Day veteran and former chief of defence staff, whose homes in London and North Yorkshire were gratuitously raided by police recently on the back of an unspecified allegation of a sexual nature dating back to the 1970s. It is not just that the bishops who have made these accusations are behaving in a remarkably un-Christian fashion by putting this smear into the public domain. But that they do not appear even to have engaged what passes for their brains, or consciences, before behaving in this grotesque and offensive fashion. Scroll down for video . Their brains should have told them that a man of Enoch’s controversial reputation would never for a moment have got away with the type of behaviour they are alleging he indulged in during the 1980s. The Establishment turned against Enoch in 1968 after the so-called Rivers of Blood speech; it would never have protected him for a second had it detected the slightest whiff of scandal. Their consciences should have told them that to make such an outrageous allegation about an enormously distinguished public figure who cannot defend himself, and which would cause the deepest distress to his family and friends, was the height of mischief and irresponsibility. It is disgraceful and destabilising for clergy to behave in this way, and the Church needs to investigate those responsible for this smear and take action accordingly. These post-Savile accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including notorious cases in Rochdale and the Orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids. Enoch Powell, pictured making a speech in 1977, has been named in a Church of England review into historic sex abuse . When the London School of Economics investigated 84 alleged cases, it found no convincing corroborative evidence of any abuse – yet families had been torn apart on the say-so of those who insisted action be taken. For decades, Enoch Powell has long been a bug-bear of the liberal Establishment. He has been demonised not least because to attack his memory is a quick and effective way for them to score points by setting out their own political correctness. What better way for some mischievous Leftist priest to damage Enoch further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse? In 1998, just after Enoch died, the BBC broadcast a programme in which they railed at Enoch for his hypocrisy. They said this scourge of mass immigration had visited the West Indies in 1953 to recruit black labour for the NHS. I was told of the story before the programme was broadcast and informed its researcher that Enoch had never been to the West Indies in his life. I was told, effectively, that I was lying, and it was broadcast. The allegations are a monstrous lie. That the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt, writes Simon Heffer . A black clergywoman, then resident in London, talked at length of Enoch having recruited her as a nurse. The story was rubbish. Detailed investigation by the BBC complaints department found that the woman had been recruited after a visit to her island by Jack Profumo, not Enoch Powell at all, and the Corporation was forced to make a grovelling on-air apology in peak time. I have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and Establishment figures would stop manipulating Enoch’s memory for their own advantage. But I never thought I would hear of bishops of the Church of England doing it. The allegations are a monstrous lie. That the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt. There must be an investigation and, for all the distress this outrage has caused, there must be a reckoning.","Late Tory MP was one of the most prominent politicians of the 20th century .

"The Greek foreign minister has claimed that his country deserves EU help because it has not committed crimes on the scale of the Holocaust – while Germany has confirmed that it will not pay Greece war reparations. Angela Merkel met far-Left Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Berlin yesterday – his first visit to Germany since he came to power in January. Mr Tsipras is understood to have told the German Chancellor that Greece would face insolvency within weeks without the release of more funds. Angela Merkel (right) meeting with far-Left Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras (left) in Berlin was overshadowed by comments from the Greek foreign minister, whoc claimed that his country deserves EU help because it has not committed crimes on the scale of the Holocaust . Mr Tsipras is understood to have told the German Chancellor that Greece would face insolvency within weeks without the release of more funds . The Greek government is claiming Germany must now repay a loan which was ‘forced’ on Athens in 1942. Pictured: Merkel and Tsipras listen to their countries' national anthems upon his arrival for talks . However the meeting was overshadowed by comments from Nikos Kotzias, the Greek foreign minister, who said in an interview that his country deserved to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany. He suggested that Germany should help set up a commission to come up with a plan to compensate Greece for the suffering caused by the Nazis during the Second World War. The Greek government is claiming that Germany must now repay a loan which was ‘forced’ on Athens in 1942, as well as pay for Nazi atrocities. And speaking to a German newspaper yesterday, Mr Kotzias pointed out that Germany had not been made to make arduous repayments after the war.

Kotzias risked further inflaming tensions by referring to the Holocaust to back demands to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany . German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras as he arrives at the chancellery in Berlin. He told Suddeutsche Zeitung: ‘The Allies were very generous with Germany; they did not smother Germany. ‘There was an interest to build Germany up again. Don’t we have the same rights?’ He went on to ask if the ‘crimes that our people committed’ were greater than ‘Dachau or Auschwitz’ – referring to two of the most notorious Nazi concentration camps where more than a million people were murdered. At the press conference yesterday, Mr Tsipras also renewed the demand for war reparations, saying: ‘We must work on the issue of forced loans and Second World War reparations.’ However Mrs Merkel said she viewed the demands as an attempt to distract from the need for economic reforms, adding: ‘The issue of war reparations is closed from a political and legal point of view. The topic has no relationship with the crisis and its emergencies.’ Tsipras is expected to present a list of reforms, hoping to unlock bailout funds to prevent Greece from running out of cash next month, Greek government sources said . The Greek government has insisted that Germany must repay a loan forced on occupied Athens in 1942 and make reparations for Nazi atrocities . European leaders are currently refusing to give Greece any more money unless the Left-wing government commits to reforms. If they fail to come to an arrangement then Greece will be forced to leave the euro – plunging the continent into financial crisis. Yesterday Mrs Merkel was careful to point out that Germany was only one of the eurozone nations that would be responsible for deciding whether Greece’s reforms are sufficient, and said that no decisions had been made in her talks with Mr Tsipras. But she remained positive, saying the meeting had been held in ‘a spirit of trust’. The Greek prime minister also characterised the talks as ‘positive’, saying he found Mrs Merkel ‘listens and wants to be constructive’. He said the Chancellor had invited him to come to Berlin over the phone, telling him: ‘It is better to talk with one another than about one another.’ Mr Tsipras went on to say: ‘I did not come here for financial help. I came for an exchange of our thoughts.’ Yesterday the Eurasia risk consultancy group said the likelihood of Greece having to leave the euro had risen from 20 to 30 per cent. The group’s eurozone analyst Mujtaba Rahman said: ‘The prospects of a deal are diminishing, as Germany, the eurogroup and Greece continue to posture. While Berlin still wants to keep Greece in the eurozone, it will not be flexible regarding the conditions attached to more financial aid.’ Greek foreign minister Nikos Kotzias risked further inflaming tensions by referring to the Holocaust to back demands to be treated as leniently as post-war Germany . Tsipras' visit comes after Merkel and other European leaders last week told him to come up soon with budget cuts and tax increases that would enable him to get urgently needed bailout money .","Greek government has insisted that Germany must repay a loan forced on occupied Athens in 1942 and make reparations for Nazi atrocities .

"Astronomers believe mysterious signals - previously dismissed as stellar bursts - are coming from an Earth-like planet. The Gliese 581d planet has conditions that could support life, and is likely to be a rocky world, twice the size of Earth. Signals from the planet were initially discovered in 2010, but last year dismissed as noise from distant stars. Scroll down for video . Astronomers believe mysterious 'alien signals' - previously dismissed as stellar bursts - are in fact coming from an Earth-like planet. The Gliese 581d planet was initially discovered in 2010 (artist's impression pictured) Now, a further study claims that the 2014 research was based on 'inadequate analyses of the data' and that Gliese 581d does exist. The planet was initially discovered in 2010. It was the first Earth-like planet found in the 'Goldilocks'-zone around another star. But soon after the discovery, a group of scientists said the signals thought to be from a planet were in fact simply magnetic bursts from stars. The latest study claims that the stellar bursts research was based on 'inadequate analyses of the data'. They said the method is suitable for large planets, but the technique is unable to find small planets like GJ 581d. Last year, Pennsylvania State University researchers said Gliese 581d - and its companion Gliese 581g - were simply a trick of the light caused by magnetic bursts from a local star 22 light-years away. The new British research, however, argues the method used by the Pennsylvania team was only suitable for large planets, and that it could miss small ones like GJ 581d. The study, by Queen Mary University, London and the University of Hertfordshire, claims to use a more accurate model on the existing data. 'The existence (or not) of GJ 581d is significant because it was the first Earth-like planet discovered in the 'Goldilocks'-zone around another star and it is a benchmark case for the Doppler technique,' said lead author, Dr Guillem Anglada-Escudé. 'There are always discussions among scientists about the ways we interpret data but I'm confident that GJ 581d has been in orbit around Gliese 581 all along. 'In any case, the strength of their statement was way too strong. 'If their way to treat the data had been right, then some planet search projects at several ground-based observatories would need to be significantly revised as they are all aiming to detect even smaller planets. The Gliese 581d planet is likely to be a rocky world, twice the size of Earth. Pictured is an artist's impression of the planetary orbits of the Gliese 581 system compared to those of our own solar system . According to one of Nasa's top planet hunters, we will find a planet with oceans like Earth in the next 15 years. Dr John Mather is an astrophysicist at the Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and the senior project scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The giant telescope will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe, figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed. But perhaps most excitingly, it will study Earth-like worlds beyond our solar system. 'We hope to find a planet that's Earth-like and measure its atmosphere to work out if it has enough water on it to make an ocean,' he said in an interview with . 'I think that will be in around ten to 15 years from now. 'In that time we might be able to say: 'I can see that star over there. [Its planet] has a climate that's like Earth and it might have life on it.' 'One needs to be more careful with these kind of claims' GJ 581d is believed to be the first planet outside our solar system in the Goldilocks zone around its star – an area not too hot and not too cold for life. To find Gliese 581d, University of California, Santa Cruz astronomers originally looked for subtle changes in light caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet tugging back and forth on the star. The strength of the tugging, they believed, showed them a planet was about three times as massive as Earth. At the time, the discovery of Earth-like planets around Gliese 581 caught the public imagination. Documentary-maker RDF and social-networking site Bebo used a radio telescope in Ukraine to send a powerful focused beam of information - 500 messages from the public in the form of radio waves - to Gliese 581. And the Australian science minister at the time organised 20,000 users of Twitter to send messages towards the distant solar system in the wake of the discoveries. Other exoplanets have previously been doubted, most notably Alpha Centauri Bb, the closest Earth-sized world to us, which some scientists claim could just be noise in the data. Gliese 581 (the bright star shown in the centre), which is 22 light-years away, has three other confirmed planets, none of which lie within its habitable zone .","Gliese 581d is in star's habitable zone and may be suitable for humans .

"When you want to buy something - a lunch, a shirt or a plane ticket - you can usually find the price of the item on a menu, tag or online listing. It's not as easy when it comes to health care. The truth is that undergoing a simple tonsillectomy can cost as little as $4,000 to as much as $14,000, depending on the city, according to new data compiled by Gawker. Using data from HealthSparq, the website charted eight common procedures and compared how much they cost in Washington, DC; New York City; Miami; Houston; Los Angeles and San Francisco. Random: New data shows the difference in price for common health care procedures in six cities across the U.S. Above, the cost of undergoing a tonsillectomy varies as much as $10,000 . Common procedure: The cost of undergoing an appendectomy hovers around $14,000 in most cities, but is a steal in Washington DC at $9,000 . The results will certainly have Houston residents driving to Los Angeles if they want to undergo a carpal tunnel procedure. A carpal tunnel release procedure at a surgical center in Houston costs upwards of $20,000 - while the price of the same procedure in the other cities hover between $5,000 and $8,000. Herniated disc decompression surgery costs $15,000 in Washington and more than three and a half times more in Houston and Los Angeles - more than $48,000. A simply tonsillectomy will run $3,500 in Washington - but costs $14,000 in San Francisco. The reason health care costs are not widely advertised stems from the fact that they vary based on who ends up paying - and insurers don't like revealing the negotiated final amount. However, there has been a recent push towards price transparency. Some states have  started making databses of health care costs based on insurance claims and other insurance data. You can also research the costs of health care further on websites like HealthcareBlueBook.com. Ouch: Decompressing a herniated disc at a surgical center in Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York costs around the same as four years of college . Astronomical: Houston has an exceptionally high cost for a carpal tunnel release at a surgical center compared to the rest of the cities .

"Britain is locked in a post-Snowden ‘arms race’ with terrorists who are using technology to spy on the security services and put ‘our people and agents at risk’, the head of MI6 warned last night. In his first public speech, Alex Younger made a series of pointed references to how UK intelligence agencies operate within some of the strictest laws in the world while our enemies were ‘unconstrained’. His comments will be seen as a rejection of the barrage of criticism aimed at MI6, MI5 and GCHQ by US ‘whistleblower’ Edward Snowden and his supporters in the UK. Snowden’s cheerleaders claim he exposed mass unauthorised surveillance by the security services. MI6 chief Alex Younger said Britain was locked in a post-Snowden ‘arms race’ with terrorists who are using technology to spy on the security services and put ‘our people and agents at risk’ But Mr Younger said: ‘What really distinguishes us from our opponents is that we live by the values of this country and are regulated by its laws, even as we work in secret.’ He warned that terror groups such as Islamic State and Al Qaeda were increasingly using the internet to target the intelligence agencies. Spy chiefs say the leaks revealed by Snowden – who stole 1.7million classified documents – had revealed sensitive intelligence gathering techniques. Sources have also warned the Snowden files may have put individual agents in danger by revealing their identities or location. Mr Younger said: ‘The internet and big data can combine to our advantage, allowing us to know more about the people we meet and the places we meet them. Using data appropriately and proportionately offers us a priceless opportunity to be even more deliberate and targeted in what we do, and so to be better at protecting our agents and this country. That is good news. Edward Snowden – who stole 1.7million classified documents – revealed sensitive intelligence gathering techniques . ‘The bad news is that the same technology in opposition hands, an opposition often unconstrained by consideration of ethics and law, allows them to see what we are doing and put our people and agents at risk. ‘So we find ourselves in a technology arms race. Contrary to myth, human intelligence operations are not an alternative to technical operations; the two are interdependent and are set to become more so.’ The spy chief did not mention Snowden by name. But, in a speech earlier this year, his predecessor Sir John Sawers said: ‘Snowden threw a massive rock in the pool. The ripples from that have still not died down.’ Earlier this month, Home Secretary Theresa May added that the leaks by Snowden had ‘damaged’ intelligence agencies across the world and drained Britain’s spies of vital resources. Mr Younger was speaking at the unveiling of an English Heritage blue plaque at the home of the first MI6 chief, Sir Mansfield Cumming. Known as ‘C’ due to his habit of initialling his papers, Sir Mansfield lived and worked at 2 Whitehall Court in Westminster at various times between 1911 and 1922. Mr Younger said: Naturally, he would be as taken aback as any of his contemporaries at the way in which Britain’s role in the world has altered. It fell to him to protect Britain’s interests as an imperial power during a great war. My task is a bit more subtle, but no less taxing.’","MI6 boss Alex Younger warns about threat posed by new technology .

"According to musical myth, the strings of violins were once made from cat guts. Yet despite this, it seems that  playing your pet a piece of classical violin music may be the best way to make them relax, according to new research. Scientists have found that playing Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings can calm cats and may even help them recover quicker after a visit to the vets. Scroll down for video . The cats were played clips of music through headphones while undergoing surgery, shown above, a heart monitor attached to their tongue measured their pulse and scientists recorded the diameter of their pupils . In a bizarre set of experiments, researchers fitted headphones to cats ears so they could listen to music while undergoing surgery at a veterinary clinic in Portugal. The scientists played two-minute bursts of classical, pop and rock music to the animals and measured their reaction while under anaesthesia. Most people will have heard music that sounds a bit like cats fighting - but it turns out that is not far from the kind music our feline pets actually enjoy. Scientists have created what they say is the first species-specific music for domestic cats by replicating some of the sounds the animals produce themselves. They say the music could provide new ways for cat owners to enrich the environments that their pets live in while also helping to calm agitated animals. The cat music has been created by psychologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and musicians at the University of Maryland. The music uses rhythms that mimics the pulsating of a cat's purr along with melodies that were similar to their high pitched meows. In tests against classical human music by composers Johann Sebastian Bach and Gabriel Faure, the cats showed stronger reactions to the feline tunes. Just like in humans, however, the younger the cat was, the more excited it got about the music - with middle aged cats seeming the least interested. They found that the classical music - Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings - made the cats more relaxed while Natalie Imbruglia's Torn was slightly less effective. Listening to AC/DC's Thunderstruck appeared to increase the stress levels of the animals. While listening to music is known to reduce pain and stress in human patients, the study is thought to be the first to show it can also have the same impact in cats. Dr Miguel Carreira, a veterinary surgeon at the University of Lisbon, Portugal who led the study, said: 'After reading about the influence of music on physiological parameters in humans, I decided to design a study protocol to investigate whether music could have any physiological effects on my surgical patients. 'In the surgical theatres at the faculty where I teach and at the private veterinary medical centre where I spend my time operating, environmental music is always present. 'During consultations I have noticed, for example, that most cats like classical music, particularly George Handel compositions, and become more calm, confident and tolerant throughout the clinical evaluation.' The researchers played the music to 12 cats while they were undergoing neutering surgery through headphones. They attached a heartbeat monitor to the animals' tongue, measured their respiratory rate and pupil diametre. The cats were exposed to two minutes of silence followed by random clips of music. The rock music of AC/DC, pictured above, seemed to increase the stress experienced by cats during surgery . When listening to classical music, the cats had a lower respiratory rate and smaller pupil diametre, suggesting they were more relaxed. Previous studies have suggested that cats prefer classical music because it contains tempos and frequencies that match purring for example. Dr Carreira and his colleagues suggest that playing classical music during surgery could help make surgery safer and improve an animal's recovery. Writing in the Journal of Feline Medicine, said: 'Use of certain music genres in the surgical theatre may contribute to a decrease in the anaesthetic dose required, reducing undesirable side effects of anaesthetic agents and thus promoting patient safety.' The researchers now hope to look at how music might impact other animals including dogs. The strings of a violin were originally thought to have been made from cat's gut, but playing classical violin music (above), such as Adagio for Strings, may also be the best way to calm your pet say the scientists .","Scientists at the University of Lisbon, Portugal, fitted headphones to cats .

"Taking over: Carole Middleton is to fill in while William and Kate find new household staff . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge can finally breathe a sigh of relief after finding new housekeepers to run their Norfolk estate – Kate’s mum and dad. Last month I revealed that William and Kate had lost the services of Amy and Colin Wood, their valuable husband-and-wife team. Now I understand that Carole and Michael Middleton are personally filling the void while they help Kate look for some new hired help to maintain elegant Anmer Hall. Though Carole has stopped short of scrubbing floors, she is said to be organising every detail of running the household from her own quarters in an annexe of the 100-room Georgian manor. Kate’s father Michael is thought to be overseeing the gardening, and has been involved in making arrangements to clear a mole infestation which has ruined a pretty lawn overlooking the Sandringham estate. It is believed that Carole, 60, and her 65-year-old husband have now committed themselves to staying in Norfolk until Kate’s second child arrives next month. Mr and Mrs Wood started working for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September last year when restoration work was being completed on the Georgian mansion. The property was given to the Royal couple by the Queen after they got married. The Woods lived at the site with their five-year-old son, with Mrs Wood looking after the ten-bedroom property and her husband in charge of landscaping and the garden. The couple had previously been trusted employees at the Sandringham estate and it is thought they will return to work there after five months with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their son, Prince George. Sources say that Kate, who has endured another difficult pregnancy, has been ‘tetchy’ and can only be truly placated by her mother – one of the many reasons why William is happily encouraging the arrangement. Mrs Middleton has previously been said to be a frequent visitor to Anmer Hall. But news of the Middletons’ involvement in running the Cambridge family home comes at a time when reports suggest that Prince Charles is growing anxious about how little he sees his grandchild. A family friend tells me: ‘When George arrived, Kate and William moved into Kate’s parents’ house. This time the Middletons are moving in to Anmer with William and Kate. There is plenty of space and Kate really wants her mother around. At the moment Carole is getting everything in place because the baby is due around April 25.’ The couple have been left in the lurch since Amy and Colin Wood, their valuable husband-and-wife team, quit last month . The Middletons were the first to meet Prince George after his birth in 2013 – ahead of Charles and his wife Camilla – and it seems they are set to be favourites when it comes to getting access to George’s brother or sister too. Another source added: ‘William is very happy to sit back and let Carole take up the reins. She is ensuring that Anmer runs like clockwork. The nursery and staff will be an oasis of calm and evenings will be sacrosanct for relaxation, sleep and recovery.’ The Middletons spent Christmas at Anmer Hall - with the Duke and Duchess flouting royal tradition by being absent from the normal get together at the Queen's lunch at Sandringham. There have also been rumours that the Middletons are considering buying a house in Norfolk to be close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their young family. This could be a great help for the Duchess because William will be starting his new job as a helicopter pilot with East Anglian Air Ambulance in the summer. The family home in Bucklebury is a frequent bolthole for Kate, who also retreated there for a week in October last year as she again struggled with the extreme morning sickness that marked her first pregnancy. Kate's mother is thought to be running every inch of the household from her quarters at Anmer Hall (above) Despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton was seen taking Prince George off her daughter's hands as he dealt with her morning sickness. She is said to prefer being there than Kensington Palace because she can retreat from the public eye. Officials were forced to announce the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy in September, which was earlier than planned,  because her acute morning sickness meant she was forced to cancel a number of public engagements. The Duchess was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with Prince George. But doctors have been better prepared this time and it has been suggested she may even have been treated with a drip at home. Might we be seeing a bit more of Hollywood actress Uma Thurman in London?

"The complexity of the human brain - with its 86 billion neurons - has puzzled scientists ever since the Greek philosopher Plato attempted to understand how it worked. Now researchers are claiming that our brains may in fact be far simpler than had previously been believed - and it took research on sea slugs to reveal it. Neuroscientists based at Manchester University and the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago, have studied the brains of sea slugs as they move. Researchers studied the brains of the sea slug Aplysia (pictured above), which have around 18,000 neurons . Their brains, while far smaller than our own, share some of the complex structures of higher organisms while their neurons are large and easy to observe. The researchers found that rather than creating a mass of confusing signals that appear in scans of the human brain, they were able to see neurons acting as groups. The act of remembering may be one of the major reasons why we forget, researchers have said. The groundbreaking research was able to identify identify neural fingerprints of specific memories, distinguishing brain activity patterns produced when viewing a picture of a necklace, say, from a picture of Marilyn Monroe. The study proved that intentional recall is beyond a simple reawakening of a memory; and actually leads us to forget other competing experiences that interfere with retrieval. The study from the University of Birmingham and the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge is the first to isolate the 'adaptive forgetting' mechanism in the human brain. The brain imaging study found that remembering dynamically alters which aspects of our past remain accessible. They found that these groups were actually laid out like tiles to form a circuit. The scientists say that similar patterns exist in the brains of other organisms, including humans, but are scaled up by millions of times. Dr Mark Humphries, a Medical Research Council fellow at Manchester University who was involved in the research, said: 'What happens in the brain during movement is currently only well understood for small, dedicated neural circuits. 'This research introduces new methods for pulling apart neural circuits to expose their inner building blocks. 'Our methods could be used to help understand how brain networks change in disease states and how drugs act to restore normal brain function.' Sea slugs have just 18,000 neurons in their entire nervous systems yet have been found to be remarkably similar to other organisms. Previous research has shown that they can form memories and signal muscle movements in the same way as higher organisms. Until recently scientists have had to study brain activity by looking at the action of individual neurons using electrodes. Even sophisticated brain scanning technology like functional magnetic resonance fails to provide a clear picture of how the brain is organised beyond its physical structures. The scientists studied neurons in the ganglion area of the brains of sea slugs, shown in the image above . The human brain (shown in the model above) is known to have specific structures that perform different roles but how neurons are organised within those has remained a mystery as studying them as they work is difficult . In the new research, which is published in the journal Neuron, the team of scientists were able to map how the large neurons in the brains of the sea slug Aplysia as they moved. Led by Angela Burno from the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, the researchers were able to do this by using a voltage sensitive dye and detecting the tiny spikes in current that occurred in the slugs' brains as the nerves that drive their muscles fired. They found there were four classes of neural ensembles that behaved in different ways - oscillatory, bursters, pausers and those where there was no strong activity. Until now scientists have had to study electrical signals of individual neurons or the whole brain (like above) These tended to be organised into modules or tiles that had related activity and pass signals between them in a loop. The researchers say the sea slugs could provide a useful analogy for when studying human brains. Professor William Frost, a cell biologist at the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in Chicago, said: 'This is a really exciting time. 'This collaboration has created an approach that cuts the time taken to map neural networks from years to a few hours.'","Scientists at Manchester University studied brains of the Apylsia sea slug .

"In a move that is no doubt set to excite Harry Potter fans across the country, Daniel Radcliffe has taken his Melbourne home off the market. The exclusive property at 98B St Georges Road in Toorak, was listed as for sale in February and was expected to fetch around $2.5 million. However despite it receiving plenty of interest,  the star appears to have changed his mind, fuelling rumours of a temporary return to Australian shores, according to the Herald Sun. Scroll down for video . Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe has taken his penthouse apartment in Toorak, Melbourne off the market . The three-bedroom apartment on Georges Street was bought by his parents for $1.8 million in 2006 . The 25-year-old Englishman had the property bought for him 10 years ago in 2006 for the filming of Rod Harvy's December Boys, in which the then-16-year-old actor played an Australian orphan. It was purchased for $1.8 million by Radcliffe's parents Alan Radcliffe, a casting agent, and BBC casting director Marcia Gresham. Radcliffe shot to fame at 11 years old when he was cast as the eponymous Harry Potter in the Warner Brothers film franchise, and is reported to have property in New York and London, as well as Melbourne. The three-bedroom property was transferred to the Kill Your Darlings actor in 2007 when he turned 18, and was made use of by family and friends when Radcliffe was occupied with projects overseas, reported Domain. Marshall White's Marcus Chiminello previously told Daily Mail Australia that despite loving the privacy the apartment offered, Radcliffe has found himself visiting Australia less frequently than in previous years and had decided to put the much-loved apartment up for sale. 'He's based himself full-time in New York and has sadly decided to move on,' said Mr Chiminello, . The property was bought in 2006 by Radcliffe's parents, who transferred ownership to him when he turned 18 . The apartment is one of only two in the apartment complex in the exclusive Toorak residence . Radcliffe shot to fame at 11 years old when he was cast as the eponymous Harry Potter in the Warner Brothers film franchise . He added that Radcliffe was a big fan of the large living area which entailed almost half of the apartment and  made the residence an ideal place for entertaining friends and family. The north facing St Georges Road apartment is spectacular in it's own right, winning the Victorian Apartment Project of the Year and nestled on one of Toorak's most exclusive streets. The suburb has the highest average property values in Melbourne, and is home to other well-known Australians including media personality Eddie McGuire, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and footballer Nathan Buckley. Estate agent Marcus Chiminello said that Radcliffe had made himself a permanent home in New York .

"Precocious amateur CiCi Bellis says she's ready to take on the best of the pros - Serena Williams. Bellis, a 15-year-old American who made a big splash at last year's U.S. Open, advanced Friday to a potential third-round match against Williams by beating Zarina Diyas 6-2, 6-1. Williams' second-round match Friday night against Monica Niculescu was postponed until Saturday because of rain. But Bellis was already relishing the chance to take on the 19-time Grand Slam champion. Catherine ""CiCi' Bellis of the United States, pictured at the US OPen this summer, advannced at the Miami Open on Friday and may have a chance to go against Serena Williams . 'It's going to be really fun,' Bellis said. 'I have nothing to lose, so I'm just going to play my game and see what happens.' Sloane Stephens won an all-American match on the stadium court, converting five of six break-point chances to beat No. 17 Madison Keys 6-4, 6-2. It was the first meeting between the two Fed Cup teammates, and Keys teared up near the end of her loss. 'I just kind of let the emotions get to me,' the 20-year-old Keys said. 'It's like you're having a really terrible day, but my terrible day is in front of hundreds of people and then broadcast on TV. That's not always fun.' New opponent?: CiCi Bellis Bellis is already relishing the chance to take on the 19-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams (pictured) after her recent win against Zarina Diyas . No. 2-seeded Rafael Nadal, showing no ill effects from an ankle injury suffered in practice Monday, defeated fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro 6-4, 6-2. 'I am well,' Nadal said. 'The day after, I had pain, but after two days I improved 50 percent. It's not limiting my movements.' Others advancing in the women's draw included No. 3 Simona Halep, the titlist last week at Indian Wells. She won 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 against wild card Nicole Vaidisova, a two-time Grand Slam semifinalist mounting a comeback from two shoulder operations. Two-time champion Andy Murray beat American Donald Young 6-4, 6-2. Other men's winners included No. 7 Stan Wawrinka, No. 8 Tomas Berdych and No. 25 Bernard Tomic.

Four-time champion Novak Djokovic lost in doubles and plays his opening singles match Saturday night. 'Hopefully I can have another great week in Miami,' Djokovic said. Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan shakes hands with Catherine ""CiCi' Bellis of the United States at the US Open last year and on Friday at the Miami Open Bellis beat Diyas 6-2, 6-1 . 'Some of my best tennis I have played here in these courts.' Two-time champion Victoria Azarenka reached the third round by beating No. 20 Jelena Jankovic 6-1, 6-1. Azarenka faced 13 break points and saved them all. 'I stayed composed,' Azarenka said. 'I was very sure what I had to do, and I was really executing that.' Bellis became the youngest player to win a match at the U.S. Open since 1996 when she upset 12th-seeded Dominika Cibulkova last August. Suddenly a celebrity, Bellis then lost to Diyas in the second round. She avenged that defeat Friday with much less fanfare. 'This one I think I played a lot smarter,' Bellis said. Oppents: Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan returns a shot against Catherine ""CiCi' Bellis of the United Statesduring their women's singles second round match on Day Four of the 2014 US Open last year . 'At the U.S. Open I was really like caught up in all the kind of hype that was going on. But this one I was just really focused and played my game. I think I did what I needed to do to win really well.' The Californian has yet to turn pro, and the Miami Open is her biggest tournament since the U.S. Open. She made the draw as a wild card and played Friday on remote Court 9, but she'll be on the stadium court Sunday if she faces Williams, who has won Key Biscayne a record seven times. Intimidating? Bellis says no. 'We are all in the same tournament, so we are all kind of at this level,' she said. 'You can't really think about who you're playing. It's just a ball that's coming back on the other side of the court. You just have to go out and not think about that stuff and just play your game.

"A high school journalism teacher has shot dead her former police officer ex-husband after an argument during a messy split, police have said. Cara Ryan, 45, killed John Joseph Rush, also 45, at her home in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida around 11pm on Saturday. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office initially said the shooting occurred during a domestic dispute and they did not bring any charges, but on Friday, they said that Ryan had been arrested. The sheriff said he would share more details about the incident at a press conference on Friday afternoon. Gunned down: Cara Ryan, left, shot dead her ex-husband John Joseph Rush, right, on Saturday after an argument at their home. She has now been charged with his murder following an investigation . Authorities previously said they had been arguing before the shooting, Fox 13 reported. The couple, who have a grown daughter together, had divorced in 2003 but then they later moved back in with each other, Fox reported. But Rush's family told the channel that the relationship had soured again in recent months and he had moved out of the home in February. It was not clear why he returned at the weekend. Rush, known to friends as 'JJ', had retired from the  St Petersburg Police, where he had worked in the forensic unit, with an injury following an on-duty car crash in 2005. Afterwards he went to work for the county medical examiner's officer, family members said. Sergeant Joe Pratt, who had worked with Rush, said he was stunned that his friend, who had survived working a dangerous job, was ultimately killed at home, WTSP reported. 'Something like this, you just never anticipate, so it's really a shock when something like this happens to someone you know and care about and has been a part of your life the past 25 years,' he said. Split: Ryan, a high school teacher, and Rush, a former cop, had divorced in 2003 but had rekindled and had moved back in together. But their relationship soured again and he moved out last month . Scene: The shooting unfolded following an argument at Ryan's home, pictured, on Saturday night . Shock: Police can be seen responding to the scene in Indian Rocks Beach on Saturday night . Ryan, who owns the home where he was shot, is a media production teacher at Clearwater High School. According to her LinkedIn page, she has been with the school district for two decades. Her Facebook profile features a picture of her and her ex-husband sitting close together and looking into each other's eyes. Another image shows them walking on a beach with their daughter. On a gofundme page set up in her father's memory, their daughter Meghan paid tribute to his service. The page has raised more than $5,000 of a $10,000 goal. 'The unexpected death of John has been an emotional roller coaster for our family,' she wrote. 'We are all proud of John’s service and we always greatly appreciate the day to day sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make just like John has.'

"A trainee teacher who suffered agonising cystitis for 17 years has managed to get her condition under control - by cutting out pizza and alcohol. Sarah Carr said for years she felt like she needed to go to the toilet 50 times a day - but urinating was like 'passing razor blades.' The now-23-year-old  was bullied at school by children in primary school who told her she should 'wear a nappy' as she ran for the loo. Teachers thought she was making up her symptoms to get out of class and doctors didn't know what was wrong with her. At seven years old (left), Sarah Carr, now 23, began suffering pain and a frequent urge to urinate. As she got older (right) she began needing the loo 50 times a day, but said urinating was like 'passing razor blades' In 2013 she was finally diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, a chronic form of the condition which does not respond to antibiotics and can be hard to treat . But finally, it emerged she had the serious condition interstitial cystitis, which causes recurring pain, urgency, a need to pass water frequently and a burning sensation when passing urine. After reading leaflets about her condition she found a surprising cure: cutting out some of her favourite foods – including pizza and sweets. Interstitial cystitis is triggered by inflammation of the bladder wall, which can follow childbirth, surgery or repeated bouts of bladder infections, though sometimes there is no known cause. While most cases of cystitis clear up on their own or with antibiotics, interstitial cystitis does not respond to the drugs and can turn into a painful long-term condition that is hard to treat. Miss Carr, of Hull,  chose to speak about her intimate problems to let other women suffering from the same illness know they were not alone. Her problems started when she was in primary school, when she could barely sit through a lesson without feeling a desperate urge to urinate. She said: 'I had the burning sensation like you're about to burst constantly. 'It was nearly every day. Interstitial cystitis causes recurring flare ups of discomfort in the bladder and pelvic area. Like regular cystitis, IC sufferers experience an urgency and frequent need to urinate. But the condition doesn't respond to treatment with antibiotics, because it is not caused by a bacterial infection. Around 400,000 people in the UK suffer the condition. More than 90 per cent of these cases are in women. The condition is commonly diagnosed around the age of 40. What causes IC? Researchers are not clear on the causes of the condition. There is a school of thought that believes the illness is inherited. It is also thought to be linked to other conditions including irritiable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. Another theory is that one of the protective layers of the bladder wall may 'leak' in people with IC, allowing chemicals in the urine to irritate the bladder. People with IC often have small areas of scarring, stiffness or bleeding on the wall of their bladder. Lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms . It is possible to reduce the symptoms by making some lifestyle changes. How is IC treated? There is no single treatment, with each sufferer finding different therapies helpful. Treatments include: . Source: NHS Choices . 'I got the urgent need to go to the loo, several times every lesson. 'Teachers would say no, thinking I was messing around. 'I'd do whatever I could to distract myself – cross my legs, drum my fingers on the desk, chew my pencil and bite my nails. 'But the urge to go would just get too much and I would run for the door. Other children would say, ""you should wear a nappy"".' When she was seven, Miss Carr's mother Tracey Carr, now 50, took her to an urologist who failed to find anything wrong with her. 'I thought it might be in my head,' Miss Carr said. 'As I got older, I tried cutting down on the amount I was drinking, but it didn't help. 'I was still dashing for the toilet 50 times a day. Even after I'd been, I'd feel a burning desire to go again fewer than five minutes later. 'It was excruciating though and felt like weeing razor blades. 'It was exhausting.' As she got older, she said she would spend nights out clubbing with her friends queuing for the toilets instead of on the dancefloor. Long car journeys also filled her with dread. In 2013 she was finally diagnosed with the chronic bladder condition interstitial cystitis, for which there is no known cure. While it's more common in women over 40, it can affect younger women, too. Miss Carr said the diagnosis brought little relief because she had hoped doctors would be able to help her. 'It causes recurring and intense pain in the pelvic area, as well as an increased need to urinate,' she said. 'I knew I couldn't live with it forever.' While there is no cure for the disease, making lifestyle changes is thought to help ease its symptoms. The Interstitial Cystitis Association advises people with the condition to stop consuming caffeine, chocolate, carbonated beverages, citrus drinks, and foods with high levels of vitamin C. Spicy foods and artificial sweeteners can also aggravate the bladder, although the charity warns that specific combinations of foods and drinks will act as a different trigger for each person. Miss Carr decided to try cutting out some of the recommended foods to see if her condition improved. She said: 'I cut out everything that could trigger a flare up including alcohol, spicy food, plus anything high in sugar or fat, like pizza. 'These were all my favourite foods, but I was amazed to notice my condition improved. 'I still needed to use the toilet more often than most people but I wasn't sprinting off to the loo as much. 'It became less painful to urinate.' She is still learning to live with the condition, and still has to plan long journeys and nights out. She said: 'When I have a flare up, I do have to dash to the ladies 50 times a day. Miss Carr found cutting out pizza, spicy foods and alcohol allowed her to manage her symptoms. She said: 'These were all my favourite foods, but I was amazed to notice my condition improved' 'I have to plan long journeys to make sure there are plenty of toilet breaks and when I go out with friends, I'm always the sober one. 'I'm at college training to be a teacher, but realistically I don't know if I'll be able to do it as a job. 'Dashing to the loo every five minutes would be a nightmare.' Other sufferers have had catheters fitted, or even had their bladder removed when no other treatment options have been successful. But for now, Miss Carr believes cutting out trigger foods will allow her to live a near-normal life. 'I'm not ready to go that far just yet,' she said. 'For now, I've accepted this is me.'

"Madonna has admitted she felt 'too humiliated' to tell police she had been raped at knifepoint at the age of 19. The singer spoke about the attack during an interview with Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show on Wednesday. When asked by the shock jock if she had ever reported the traumatic incident, Madonna said she hadn't, explaining: ‘You've already been violated. It's just not worth it. It's too much humiliation.’ Scroll down for audio . Difficult discussion: Madonna talked about being raped at 19 during an interview with Howard Stern on Wednesday, for his SiriusXM radio show . The now-56-year-old revealed in October 2013 that she was raped shortly after she moved to New York City from Michigan. Madonna said on Wednesday that she ‘was in shock’, and ‘didn't know a soul’ after relocating, adding that she ‘trusted everybody’. ‘I was saying “hi” to people on the streets like a dork,’ she recalled. Traumatic: The pop star, seen here in 1978 at the age of 20, said she 'trusted everybody' before the attack . Speaking about the moments that led to the attack, the pop star revealed: ‘I was going to a dance class and the door was locked and I needed money for the pay phone. [A man] gave it to me. He was a very friendly guy. I trusted everybody.’ Madonna said the man told her she could make the call from his house, and once she was there he raped her. She first revealed that she was sexually assaulted during a Harper’s Bazaar interview in 2013, and said she was attacked on a rooftop at knifepoint. 'I have confidence in my skills': Madonna revealed that she was never jealous of Warren Beatty's stunning exes. She is pictured with the actor in 1990 . The one that got away: The now-56-year-old said she 'wished' she'd had a romance with Evita (pictured) co-star Antonio Banderas . Despite the difficult discussion about the harrowing incident, Madonna still managed to have a light-hearted chat about her relationships during another portion of the interview with Howard. The Living For Love hit-maker admitted that Warren Beatty, who she dated for 15 months, was an incredible lover, adding: ‘I’m not going to lie.’ Madonna said she wasn’t jealous of his beautiful exes, who included Brigitte Bardot, Elle Macpherson and Julie Christie. ‘I have confidence in my skills,’ she explained. She was however ‘insecure sometimes’ during her eight-year marriage to Guy Ritchie, when her director husband would be heading to work with a stunning actress. 'I think I threw a tantrum once': Madonna admitted she felt insecure when husband Guy Ritchie would go to work with a beautiful actress. The former couple are seen in 2008, a few months before their divorce . ‘I think I threw a tantrum once,’ Madonna said, also telling Howard that she ‘wished’ she’d had a romance with Evita co-star Antonio Banderas. The pop icon later confirmed rumours that she secretly dated Tupac Shakur. Madonna was criticised for trivialising important issues in December after comparing the leak of 13 unfinished demos from her album Rebel Heart to 'rape' and 'terrorism'. 'This is artistic rape!!' she said in an Instagram post which was then removed. 'These are early leaked demo's half of which wont even make it on my album the other half have changed and evolved. Her go-to look:The Living For Love hit-maker wore her go-to leather, fishnets and fingerless gloves for the interview . 'This is a form of terrorism. Wtf!!!! Why do people want to destroy artistic process??? Why steal? Why not give me the opportunity to finish and give you my very best?' Madonna stood by her statement in an interview with The Guardian shortly afterwards. She said: 'Obviously there is a person, or a group of people behind this that were essentially terrorising me. I don't want to sound alarming, but certainly that's how I felt. 'It's one thing if someone comes into your house and steals a painting off your wall: that's also a violation, but, your work, as an artist, that's devastating. 'I'm an artistic person, I'm very expressive. I'm sorry if words alarm people, but that's what it felt like. It was not a consensual agreement. I did not say, ""Hey, here's my music, and it's finished."" It was theft.'

"This is the heartbreaking moment a dog desperately chased after the owner who abandoned it at a gas station on the side of a Louisiana road. A witness snapped the photograph after she saw a man drop off the dog on Highway 11 in Slidell. She said the owner yelled at his pet to 'Go! Go over there!' Lorie Hollis said the dog, a black German shepherd mix, was confused and jumped up, putting his paws on the tailgate of the man's pickup truck. This is the heartbreaking moment a German shepherd desperately chased after the owner who abandoned it at a gas station on the side of a road in Slidell, Louisiana . The dog then gave chase after the truck sped off, trying desperately to keep up. Hollis told the Louisiana Humane Society that she got into her car and tried to follow the dog and truck, watching the shepherd cross two lanes of traffic as it attempted to reach its owner. But after driving for a couple of miles, Hollis lost sight of them both. 'My heart is broken,' she told WDSU. 'I am in shock that someone would treat a dog like this.' A spokesman for the Humane Society said it is all too common for dogs to be abandoned and 'left to fend for themselves' on the sides of highways or back country roads. 'People can be cruel and heartless,' Jeff Dorson told WDSU. 'If people feel they can no longer care for a pet, all they have to do is surrender him or her to a nearby rescue group or shelter.' Dorson said when animals are abandoned in a 'random location' they have 'almost zero' chance of survival. 'This is truly a cowardly act and a punishable offense,' he added. The Humane Society of Louisiana said they will accept custody of the German shepherd and find it a home when it is  returned. They are also offering a $250 reward for any information that could lead to the owner's arrest or his abandoned dog's safe return.

"A father of a 12-year-old girl who he married off in an Islamic ceremony told his daughter that it Australian laws forbidding her from marrying were 'stupid'. The father, who cannot be named legally, is on trial at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court charged with procuring a child for unlawful sexual activity and with being an accessory before the fact of sexual intercourse with a child. The girl told a Sydney court her father said Australian law was 'stupid' and girls her age should be allowed to get married and have sexual intercourse. Scroll down for video . A 27-year-old man (pictured) has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars for marrying and sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl. Now her father is on trial for agreeing to the arrangement because he discovered that his daughter was' menstruating and interested in boys' a court heard . The girl's interview with a child protection worker was played as part of her father's trial. She said days after her wedding, her father began to panic that her husband might be jailed. 'He was upset because we might be in trouble,' the girl said. '(My father) knows no marriage under under the age of 16.' 'Because he says to me the law here is stupid, girls your age should be allowed to get married and have intercourse.' 'He said we didn't do anything wrong, we were just following religion.' Her father said her husband, now 27, 'shouldn't be put away', and that they were 'just following religion'. The girl, now 14, said in her father's religion, marriage was allowed once the girl got her period and having sex before marriage was punishable by stoning or death in Islamic countries. '(Premarital sex) is actually one of the worst things you can do,' she said. The court also heard the girl and her husband had sex 'once or twice' a day after they were married. They also spent five nights staying at her father's house. The girl also detailed the motivation for the marriage being organised, which was her reaching puberty. In the video interview shown to the court, she said she understood puberty to be 'blood...when I got my period'. She also said her father told her not to take birth control pills, and that her father reminded her not to let her husband wear a condom. 'Don't use pills or condoms - don't let him use anything,' she said. 'He always said that - I think the first time was just after we got married.' The court also heard her 'husband' approached her father about the marriage after he had been refused by leaders at her usual mosque. 'They said no because of my age and because I was Aussie,' she said. 'After he went to sheiks, after a while he came back and asked my Dad.' Her comments come after her mother said she had pleaded with the father to stop the wedding. The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney she strongly opposed the marriage. She said her former husband - with whom she had split before the incident - called her on what she believed to be the night of her daughter's wedding. 'He said (my daughter) is going to get married; they wanted to bring the man to meet me,' the mother told the court. 'I said no. I did not want anything to do with (my daughter) getting married.' The woman said she then spoke to her daughter and told her not to get married and the girl said she wouldn't. 'He wanted her to be married or he wouldn't have married her,' she said. 'I didn't agree with it, I had nothing to do with it.' The woman's former partner, a 63-year-old man, allegedly married his teen daughter off to a 26-year-old man so she did not commit the sin of extramarital sex. The father allegedly gave his daughter's mobile phone number to the 26-year-old man who wanted to marry her and then hosted an Islamic ceremony at his home in the Hunter region. The court heard the mother received a second call from her former partner that night, during which he used his 'angry voice'. The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney, she strongly disagreed with the marriage to a 26-year-old man (pictured) 'He said she was going to get married no matter what, that next time I saw her she would be married,' the woman said. 'I just didn't agree with them getting married. 'I know it was him on the other end of the phone; I know his voice because I had to put up with it for 20 years.' The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct. 'I don't have any trouble remembering the conversations,' she said. 'They did not have my consent. I was not at the wedding. I did not allow it. '(He)'s a liar; he is not going to admit to anything. 'What he said is what he said - I didn't add anything or forget anything.' She said she found out they couple had been married under Sharia law when the Department of Community Services got involved after the girl's husband tried to enrol her in a Sydney High school. The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct . The mother also told the court she briefly converted to Islam during their relationship, the religion of her husband, because she 'was interested in learning about God, and that was the only one he would let me learn about'. She also lashed out after the father's barrister after it was suggested her memory issues caused by her learning difficulty may have led to her remembering a conversation that never took place. 'Who's going to forget that,' the mother said. 'I'm not happy about my daughter being married in the first place so don't have a go at me.' When Judge Deborah Sweeney attempted to calm her and said the barrister was just doing his job asking questions, the woman asked if the barrister was a Muslim. 'Because if he's Muslim then you got to do what man says, because the woman is always a liar.' Crown prosecutor ­Siobhan Herbert earlier told the court the father hosted the couple at his home, where they allegedly had sex on a specially set up mattress. The father's trial comes after the husband, now 27, was jailed for seven and a half years earlier this month for persistent sexual abuse against the young girl. 'By her getting married he was stopping the sin of extramarital sex,' Ms Herbert said. 'His actions brought about or caused the unlawful sexual activity.' On the wedding day, he allegedly instructed the girl that neither she nor her partner were allowed to use contraception. On the first weekend after the wedding, the court heard the father hosted the couple at his home where he allegedly arranged a marital bed. The 27-year-old Lebanese student and the 12-year-old Australian girl spent their wedding night as a motel in the Hunter region of NSW where they had sex several times . The following morning, he asked his daughter if she needed to shower before prayers, in line with Islamic practice after sexual intercourse, the court was told . The father allegedly consented to the wedding, in January 2014, after discovering his daughter had begun menstruating and becoming interested in boys. The man she married, now 27, was jailed for seven and a half years earlier this month for persistent sexual abuse against the young girl. Judge Deborah Sweeney said on Friday the 27-year-old Lebanese man, who cannot be named, had persisted in pursuing his Australian victim despite her initial reluctance. The  girl was pregnant when her 26-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. However, she miscarried in February after complaining of abdominal pain . The pair held their 'wedding', which was allegedly arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW, in January last year. It is alleged the man gave the child $500 as a wedding gift. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, court papers stated. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013  after he approached her father and asked to meet her. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states. His trial will continue next week.

Primary school pupil Lili said: 'We enjoyed everything about our journey. Everything was new and exciting. Hearing new accents and languages was cool. 'Not going to school for a year was a new experience for Nel and I, but learning something new every day was easy when you got to.'

Every new country was a lesson in itself. Their numeracy skills were improved as they worked out exchange rates and new currency and their communication skills and confidence grew daily. 'Experiencing the world and all the variety it has to offer - the sounds and sights and smells - that education broadens the mind. It does more than reading about the world in a book ever could. 'I'm always so aware that your time with your children at home is finite and I want them to have amazing experiences and memories of their time growing up. I know Lili and Nel will remember our trip forever. 'Although they missed a year of physically being in school we tutored the children on the road.

"When it comes to highlighting their assets, Hollywood's hottest stars are proudly flaunting their plump rumps, ensuring that bosoms will continue to take a backseat to sculpted derrieres in 2015. Jennifer Lopez may have been the first celebrity to turn her booty into a trademark, but the past 12 months have seen a bevy of big-bottomed celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, Iggy Azalea and Nicki Minaj carving out star statuses for their now-infamous backsides. From 'belfies' posted on Instagram to booty-shaking music videos, female stars are continuously paying homage to their butts. And the American public are taking notice. Scroll down for video . Rear of the year? Kim Kardashian (L) almost 'broke the internet' when she uploaded this revealing 'belfie' to her Instagram account, while Beyonce (R) is renowned for boasting an impressively-pert behind . Musical notes: Both Nicki Minaj (L) and Jennifer Lopez (R) have written songs in honor of larger ladies and their bodacious booties and many people actually credit 45-year-old J-Lo with starting the trend for big backsides . Last year there was a 98per cent increase in butt implants and a 44per cent increase in butt lifts, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons – and those figures are showing no signs of decreasing any time soon. 'Media, television, and celebrities like J.Lo and Kim Kardashian are driving the increase, Dr Scott Glasberg, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, explained. Who has the best butt in Hollywood? Who has the best butt in Hollywood? Now share your opinion . He added: 'The butt is in.' Not surprisingly, 2014 was also dubbed the ‘year of the booty’ by multiple media outlets thanks to popstar Nicki Minaj's Anaconda video and Jennifer Lopez’s Big Booty remix featuring Australian pop sensation Iggy Azalea. Big butts were even celebrated in fashion bible Vogue. Last September, the magazine's website announced that we were in the 'Era of the Big Booty', crediting 45-year-old Jennifer's breakout backside for moving body trends away from the waif-thin looks of the past. Where celebrities once strived to maintain stick-thin figures, now they are embracing their curves, and regularly boast about the size of their behinds on social media. And then there are the 'belfie' models, whose bums are actually more famous than their faces. Jen Selter, a 21-year-old from Long Island, New York, is one such belfie star - and has managed to build a whole social media empire around her booty. She rose to fame in 2012 after she started posting fitness photos of herself highlighting her gravity-defying derriere. Last year, Kim Kardashian, 34, made waves when she shared her own sexy belfie that showed off her pert behind in a skimpy white one-piece. But Kim isn't the only person in the Kardashian clan who boasts a bodacious backside. Her 30-year-old sister Khloe and her on-again-off-again best friend Blac Chyna are all card-carrying members of the big booty club. Even the Kardashian sisters' nemesis, hip hop star Amber Rose, is known for twerking on camera and she frequently shares revealing photos of herself modeling the skimpiest thongs imaginable - all in order to showcase her impressive rear end. Then there are the butts that pack something of a surprising punch. Rihanna, Jessica Biel, Lady Gaga, Sofia Vergara and Shakira all have booties that seem to defy gravity - and they all love to show them off. And great bums also come in much smaller packages. Glee star Lea Michele loves showing off her trim and toned backside on Instagram - particularly when she is on vacation - while Jessica Alba has a similarly pert bottom that she frequently emphasizes with a series of perfectly-tailored red carpet gowns. Adult film star Farrah Abraham also has a butt that sparks conversation; the mother-of-one, who rose to fame while starring in MTV series Teen Mom, regularly flaunts her physique on the red carpet, ensuring to highlight her backside as much as possible. And who can forget when Pippa Middleton's behind stole the show at her sister Kate's 2011 wedding to Prince William? The then-27-year-old and her pert bottom were the talk of the town after she was snapped at the ceremony wearing a figure-hugging white bridesmaids dress while walking down the aisle behind her sister, the Duchess of Cambridge. Here, we list Hollywood's hottest - and most talked-about - butts - but it is up to you to decide whose rear end will reign above all. Flaunting it with fashion: Rihanna (R) and her fellow chart-topper Iggy Azalea (L) can regularly be seen showcasing their curvaceous behinds while wearing glamorous form-fitting ensembles on the red carpet . The best things... While Glee star Lea Michele (L) and actress Jessica Alba (R) might not have the most sizable booties in the business, both ladies have been praised for embracing - and enhancing - their natural assets . Center stage: Singers Lady Gaga (L) and Shakira (R) can often be seen wearing revealing outfits which help to flaunt their derrieres, particularly when they are performing on-stage . Royalty meets celebrity: Pippa Middleton's behind stole the show at her sister Kate's 2011 wedding to Prince William (L), while Jessica Biel (R) took the chance to showcase her pert behind at last year's Oscars . Behind the back: The only thing that reality star Khloe Kardashian (R) and her social media nemesis model Amber Rose (L) seem to have in common is their love of flaunting their curvy silhouettes . Star power: Belfie queen Jen Selter's entire career may have been built around her pert behind, but actress Sofia Vergara boasts assets that are just as impressive . Work it: Hip hop artist Blac Chyna (L) and adult film star Farrah Abraham (R) are both renowned for showcasing their behinds in a number of questionable red carpet ensembles .","2014 saw the rise of the 'belfie', as well as a 98% increase in butt implants and a 44% increase in butt lifts .

"The £1million home of Peaches Geldof has remained untouched for nearly a year following her tragic death. However, a pile of children's toys, a sofa, plastic furniture and a pram could be seen stacked outside the Kent property today - suggesting work is finally underway to sort the family's belongings. Decorators could also be seen entering the property armed with paint brushes as neighbours claimed they believe it will now be cleaned out and sold on. It comes ahead of the one-year anniversary of the mother-of-two's death, who was discovered in an upstairs bedroom in the property after overdosing on heroin. Scroll down for video . A pile of children's toys, a sofa, plastic furniture, a pram and cardboard boxes could be seen stacked outside the  £1million home of Peaches Geldof in Kent  today - suggesting work is  underway to sort her belongings . The £1million country home has remained untouched for nearly a year following her tragic death in April last year. However, the items could be seen dumped in the driveway today as workers attempted to sort the home . One man could be seen on the phone in the window of the property as the homewear stood on the driveway . Furniture, children's toys and boxes of belongings were piled outside the front door of the £1million home . Photographs of the home over the last 12 months have suggested it has lain untouched, with a pram discarded in the front driveway and children's toys littering the garden. But today's developments suggest her family may now be clearing out the property and sorting through her and her family's belongings, which will no doubt harbour sentimental value. A neighbour, who saw the workers arrive at the property this morning, said: 'Since she died, no one has been back. 'If you look at the place, it is very strange, it looks like time just stopped, everything is in exactly the same place from when she died. 'I was a bit shocked to see people going in there today, but it looks like they are doing some decorating inside. 'I would guess her partner will want to sell the house, it would be hard for anyone to go back after what happened there. 'The men inside were painting and cleaning, that's all I could see, but when I asked them about it and tried to find out if the property was going to be sold, they wouldn't tell me. 'But from where I was standing that's what it looked like.' The home does not appear to be up for sale as of yet. The movement at the property is believed to be the first since  the 25-year-old journalist and television presenter's death in April last year. A decorator could be seen arriving at the property this morning and walking into the house armed with painting equipment. A neighbour said workers arrived at the Kent home this morning and cleaned inside . Until today, a pram and bin bags were the only items outside the country house where Peaches Geldof once lived. However, belongings from inside the country home were brought out and put on the driveway today . The £1million property, in Wrotham, Kent, had appeared almost exactly as it was following the journalist and presenter's death in April last year. Until today, there was no sign of movement and just a discarded pram . Until today, the house and garden have sat untouched for nearly a year. Pictured: A play area in the garden . Peaches Geldof (pictured) took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead on April 7 last year. At the time of the tragedy, Kent Police said the presenter's death was 'sudden' and 'unexplained' Her widower, Tom Cohen, is said to have never returned to their marital home and is believed to be staying with their children Astala, two, and Phaedra, one, at his parents' home in south east London. It was Mr Cohen who discovered his wife's body at the home they shared, after he returned from a weekend away on April 7. An inquest in July heard that Peaches - daughter of late TV presenter Paula Yates and musician Sir Bob Geldof - had started using heroin again in February, after taking the substitute drug methadone for two-and-a-half years. Coroner Roger Hatch said she took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead. At the time of the tragedy Kent Police said the death was 'sudden' and 'unexplained'. But her husband told the inquest he had seen Peaches flushing drugs she had hidden in the loft of their home down the toilet. He found her body when he returned from a weekend away with the couple's two-year-old son, Astala. Their one-year-old son Phaedra was in the house with his mother. Mr Hatch said the young mother had been trying to wean herself off drugs and had been clean months before her death but had relapsed.

Pixie Geldof has said she will not be appearing at this year's Coachella Festival in California so that she can be in the UK for quiet family day. A source close to the model and singer was quoted this week as saying she had the choice to perform but turned it down, preferring to be with her family. Sir Bob is apparently keen to mark the anniversary by gathering the family together to exchange fond memories of Peaches. He has previously revealed how he blames himself for his daughter's death, adding that he 'goes over and over and over' what he could have done to help her after she started using the drug again in the months leading up to her death. He described the journalist, model and television presenter as 'super bright' but 'frantic'.","Sofa, plastic furniture, toys and pram stacked outside Peaches' Kent home .

"A disabled pensioner said she was 'gutted' after marrying her Tunisian toy boy following a whirlwind romance - only for him to leave her when he arrived in the UK. Patricia, who lives in the Midlands, was feeling lonely when she signed up to an internet dating website and was quickly contacted by 26-year-old Mondher, from Tunisia. 'I was looking for love and looking for someone to share my life,' Patricia, 64, told the Channel 5 documentary Holiday Love Rats which airs tonight. Scroll down for video . Love at first sight: Patricia and Mondher on their wedding day in 2012 . 'It was exciting. I thought I had found someone I could spend the rest of my life with. 'When he first contacted me he was all lovey-dovey and he started telling me he loved me when we had been talking for three weeks and asking me to go there for a holiday.' Mondher told Patricia that they could be together despite the 33-year age gap at the time, and being from different countries. 'I thought age was just a number and he kept drilling that into my head,' said Patricia, who uses a disability scooter. 'As long as we love each other, that's all that matters. He made me feel good because he was younger than me.' Despite suffering from crippling osteoarthritis, six months later she jetted off on holiday and it was love at first sight. The couple toast their marriage in Tunisia with plastic cups . 'When I got to the airport in Tunisia, he was waiting for me and I fell in love straight away,' said Patricia, a pensioner. 'I had been there for five days when he said ""let's get married, let's just do it!"" 'I thought ""I love the guy, go for it"". 'He was telling me he was going to treat me like a princess, we could buy a car and he would take me out where I wanted to go.' Patricia married Mondher in 2012 and said she felt 'like a princess', despite having to pay for everything, including the sheep that was to be slaughtered for the celebratory meal. 'On the wedding day, when they were reading the vows, I felt so happy,' added Patricia. 'It is a woman's dream to go to another country and marry a much younger man. It was wonderful and I was really, really happy.' Holiday Love Rats also features Diane who married Mobe after they met on a drumming course in The Gambia . However, her dream of a perfect life quickly turned into a nightmare when she was forced to return to the UK without him. Eight months later, she secured Mondher a visitor's visa, but a happy reunion was not to be. 'He didn't have much communication with me at all,' said Patricia. 'It was like once he'd moved here, that was it. 'I felt like I was second best and having Mondher in the house was a nightmare. 'He would have an argument with me if I spoke to my daughter on the phone. Marriage wasn't good.' Having already spent thousands on holidays to Tunisia, flights and food, and with Mondher's visitor's visa running out, Patricia refused to pay a further £2,000 to secure a new visa. However, she was left devastated when her husband then announced he was leaving her to stay with friends in Portsmouth. 'I was absolutely gutted,' she added. 'I felt I had been used and made a fool of myself.' In a statement to the programme, Mondher said that his marriage to Patricia collapsed due to circumstances beyond his control, that he loved Patricia and did not come to England for the money. The show also follows the disastrous relationships of 59-year-old Diane, whose passion for African music took her to The Gambia where she met drum master Mobe. Won over by Mobe’s talent and charisma, Diane fell in love and married him. She paid for the visa to allow him to stay in the UK, as well as supporting him financially. Diane and Mobe enjoy the sunshine in The Gambia . However, three years into their marriage, Diane discovered Mobe was in contact with other women and found a note in his bag detailing how he could divorce her and legally remain in the UK. Also featured is 49-year-old Michelle, who met a handsome Egyptian deep sea diver in Dubai and fell in love. Michelle married Walid and the couple talked about having children but despite living together in the UK for just over four years, a month after getting his British Passport, Walid left. Now he’s back in touch and says his new Egyptian wife has died and he’s asked Michelle to look after the two-year-old daughter he had with his Egyptian wife. And it’s not just British women who are experiencing this pattern of behaviour. The programme also focuses on 53-year-old Jayne, an American from Indiana who spent two years and thousands of dollars on legal fees to secure Nigerian Lateef a Green Card. She threw him out just weeks after he’d gained permission to stay in the US for ten years because she discovered he was sending romantic emails to other women.

"Sydneysiders may be the biggest coffee snobs, but it's Melbourne that can claim to have the best cafe culture. Research into the nation's caffeine habits by Roy Morgan Research found there's nothing more Australians love than fresh coffee, with the average person's café visits increasing by three per cent between 2010 and 2014. Although Sydney was found to have the highest number of people buying fresh coffee and the lowest percentage of people purchasing instant coffee, the Harbour City proved not to be the national coffee capital. Sydney was foudn to have the highest number of people buying fresh coffee and the lowest percentage of people purchasing instant coffee . Instead, it's Melburnians which can proudly claim the title, with 63.3 per cent of people aged 14 and over visiting a café for coffee or tea in an average three month period. This was followed closely by Sydney at 61 per cent and Hobart at 62.7 per cent. Melbourne residents were also found to visit cafes more frequently with 11.5 per cent of people going 16 or more times in a three-month period. Research into the nation's caffeine habits by Roy Morgan Research found there's nothing more Australians love than fresh coffee . The Harbour City proved not to be the national coffee capital: Sydney's Cornersmith cafe in Marrickville won The Good Food Guides's best cafe award in the city in 2014 . 'With a higher café visitation rate than any other capital city, Melburnians take their coffee very seriously,' Roy Morgan Research's Group Account Director, Angela Smith, said. 'And perhaps because so many of them count on their barista for their caffeine fix, Melbourne residents don't need to buy as much fresh coffee for home/work consumption – which is where Sydneysiders lead the country.' Meanwhile, instant coffee's popularity is steadily decreasing across the country according to the research which also found an 8.7 per cent rise in the number of households with coffee makers. Melbourne residents visit cafes more frequently than in any other city: The Good Food Guides's 2014 best cafe award in Melbourne went to Top Paddock in Richmond (pictured) Perth residents are particularly fond of their home brews with the capital city recording the highest rate of coffee-maker ownership at 39 per cent. 'While a much higher proportion of Aussies still buy instant coffee than fresh, its popularity has been declining for several years,' Ms Smith said. 'However, all is not lost: instant-coffee brands Moccona and Robert Timms are actually bucking this downward trend, with higher purchase rates in 2014 than in 2010. Meanwhile, Lavazza maintains top spot among the fresh coffee brands.'","Sydney has the highest number of people buying fresh coffee and the lowest percentage of people purchasing instant coffee .

"Scientists at Europe's CERN . research centre have had to postpone the imminent relaunch of . their refitted 'Big Bang' machine, the Large Hadron Collider, . because of a short-circuit in the wiring of one of the vital . magnets. 'Current indications suggest a delay of between a few days . and several weeks,' a statement from the world's leading . particle physics research centre said on Tuesday. Engineers had been expected to start on Wednesday pumping . proton beams in opposite directions all the way round the two . 27-km (17-mile) underground tubes in the LHC, closed down for . the past two years for a refit. Scroll down for video . The LHC (large hadron collider) in its tunnel at CERN (European particle physics laboratory) near Geneva, Switzerland.   After a two-year shutdown and upgrade, it is about to ramp up for its second three-year run. When physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars, they are confronted with a mystery. If they only take visible matter into account, their equations simply don't add up; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces. There is something missing. From this they deduced that there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does, as a whole, interact by means of the gravitational force. Called 'dark matter', this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe. That would have been the prelude to the start of particle . collisions in late May at twice the power of those in the LHC's . first run from 2010-2013. The smashing-together of particles inside the LHC is . designed to mimic conditions just after the Big Bang at the dawn . of the universe. In a breakthrough in 2012, CERN scientists . announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle, a basic . building block of the universe, which appeared to be the boson . imagined and named half a century earlier by theoretical . physicist Peter Higgs. Hopes for the second run lie in breaking out of what it . known as the Standard Model of how the universe works at the . level of elementary particles, and into 'New Physics.' That includes searching for the dark matter that makes up . about 96 percent of the stuff of the universe but can only be . detected by its influence on visible matter around it. CERN scientists expressed disappointment at the last-minute . problem, in just one of the underground machine's eight sectors, . which have been rewired and checked thoroughly during the . closedown. But the research centre's director general, Rolf . Heuer, played down its significance. 'All the signs are good for a great run 2,' he said in a . statement. 'In the grand scheme of things, a few weeks delay in . humankind's quest to understand our universe is little more than . the blink of an eye.' Scientists and engineers at CERN, mindful of a serious . leakage in 2008 which caused a delay of two years in the . start-up for the first LHC run, have long insisted that there . can be no rushing into full operations. Frederick Bordry, director for accelerators, said it could . take time to resolve what he described as an intermittent . short-circuit because it was in a cold section of the machine, . meaning that part would probably have to be warmed up. It would then have to be recooled. 'So what would have taken . hours in a warm machine could end up taking us weeks,' he added. Previously a Higgs particle has been created in an LHC detector and has then disintegrated into four muons (the four red lines). According to Dr Christoffer Petersson's model the Higgs particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter . Scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, say if nature cooperates, the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe. Beams should start running through the giant machine later this month, with the first high energy crashes probably coming in May,  accelerator director Frederick Bordry said in a Thursday news conference in Geneva. A test beam ran through the collider last weekend, he said. Scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics, including a first ever glimpse of dark matter, one of the chief focuses of the experiment. 'I want to see the first light in the dark universe,' CERN General Director Rolf Heuer said. 'If I see that, then nature is kind to me.' Dark matter — and its cousin, dark energy — make up most of the universe, yet scientists haven't been able to see them yet, so researchers are looking for them in high-energy crashes, in orbit on a special experiment on the international space station, and in a deep underground mine. 'What we know about dark matter is that it exists and then very little after that,' MIT professor Michael Williams said at a science conference in February. CERN spent about $150 million to upgrade during its down time, opening the massive machine every 20 meters (66 feet), checking magnets, improving connections. 'It's nearly a new machine,' Heuer said. 'It has the power which can melt 500 kilos (1100 pounds) of copper. Each beam. Two beams together, one ton of copper.' Professor Tara Shears, who leads the University of Liverpool LHCb group, said: 'We have unfinished business with understanding the universe. 'We want to see what the new data shows us about antimatter, and why there's so little in the universe. We want to chase the hints we've seen in previous measurements, whose behaviour didn't quite match our expectations, in case these hints turn into discoveries. 'We've spent the shut-down readying and improving the LHCb detectors so that we can explore this new data with precision.' Dr Victoria Martin, from Edinburgh University, a member of the Atlas team, said: 'Using data from LHC Run One we discovered the Higgs boson particle. However only a limited number of Higgs particles were produced and it has not yet been possible to test every prediction made by Peter Higgs and others. 'The higher energy and more frequent proton collisions in Run Two will allow us to investigate the Higgs particle in much more detail. CERN, the world's largest particle physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. 'Higher energy may also allow the mysterious 'dark matter' observed in galaxies to be made and studied in the lab for the first time.' On December 9 the magnets on one section of the LHC ring were successfully powered to the level needed for a single particle beam to reach 6.5 TeV. The goal this year will be to run two beams of proton particles in opposite directions to produce 13 TeV collisions.","Large Hadron Collider is about to ramp up for its second three-year run .

On Friday, a jury of six men and six women rejected every claim after less than 72 hours of deliberation in San Francisco Superior Court. Scroll down for video . Lost: Ellen Pao (pictured after the verdict) sued her former employers for four counts of gender bias after she was fired. The Reddit CEO claimed her career crumbled at Kleiner after ending an affair with a partner . A jury of six men and six women rejected all of Pao's claims in San Francisco Superior Court on Friday . Over the course of three years, Pao told the court her career at the Silicon Valley firm crumbled after she ended a brief affair with partner Ajit Nazre, and was fired in 2012 when she complained. Pao, who is married to Wall Street financier Alphonse Fletcher Jr, said he 'falsely told her that his wife had left him' and 'engaged in offensive, obstructionist, and difficult behavior' until she 'succumbed' two or three times. After she ended the liaison, he started to 'retaliate', she claimed. At one point, she said, Nazre appeared at her colleague's hotel room on a business trip wearing nothing but a bathrobe, carrying a glass of wine, according to testimony. The court heard Ray Lane, a former partner, said the woman, Trae Vassallo, should have been 'flattered'. Kleiner countered that it investigated Nazre after Vassallo complained, after which he quickly left the firm. Pao's first claim, tabled in 2007, also accused senior partner Randy Komisar of giving her a Leonard Cohen book, Book Of Longing, filled with sexually explicit drawings and poems. Later, he asked her to dinner adding that 'his wife would be out of town'. The case played out as Silicon Valley saw a steady decline in the number of female venture capitalists. Recent figures collected by Babson College show six per cent of the venture capital is female, down from 10 per cent in 1999. With that backdrop, Pao's lawyers described Kleiner as a pressure cooker that was hostile toward women. One of Pao's mentors testified that subpar performance meant she was not promoted, rather than gender . The firm disputed those charges, presenting evidence that Kleiner went out of its way to hire women. During the case, the court heard one partner, Chi-Hua Chien, said women 'kill the buzz' as he argued only men should be invited to a dinner with Al Gore. John Doerr, once Pao's direct boss, told investigators she had 'a female chip on her shoulder'. And senior partner Ted Schlein rebuffed the feminist rallying call from Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg that women 'deserve a seat at the table'. He said: 'I really don’t think it was a very big deal to us who sits at a table or who does not.' Specifically, Pao alleged that: . The jury ruled against Pao on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount. Two hours later, they emerged in favor of Kleiner Perkins. The court requires a minimum of 9-3 votes to come to a conclusion. But initially, the verdict stated that four jurors supported Pao's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination. On the pivotal claim that Pao was fired for being female, ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor. They came to their conclusion after completing this question-and-answer document. According to Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Elder, Pao looked down and forced a smile as the judge revealed she had lost. Some witnesses, including Pao's onetime mentor John Doerr, testified that Pao's lack of advancement stemmed from subpar performance, not discrimination or retaliation. However, Pao's attorneys argued she played a pivotal role in the investment in RPX and Twitter. Pao testified for five days and faced questions from jurors such as whether it was 'professional to enter into an affair with a married partner?' 'Going back I would not have done it again, but I didn't think it was inappropriate at the time,' Pao said. Following the verdict on Friday, Pao released a statement via Twitter. In nine tweets, she wrote: 'Thank you, world. 'I have been inspired by the thousands of people who have reached out to me over the past three years with support. 'I’ve heard from people in Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Australia, Malaysia, France, Argentina, Norway, Tanzania, Finland, and beyond. 'Because of social media and live reports, the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe . 'While today’s outcome is a disappointment, I take consolation in knowing that people really listened . 'If we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities, things will not change . 'Hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone, including women and minorities . 'To support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, we need to show leadership today. 'And thank you to the team and board @reddit for standing by me.'","Ellen Pao sued Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers for four counts of gender discrimination .

"Around 40 per cent of a typical public toilet is contaminated by bacteria and viruses, with just one germ multiplying eight million times in eight hours. But a new hand dryer claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of this potentially deadly bacteria quickly and effectively. Called the Sterillo, it uses a technology known as 'UV plasma' to blitz all the dangerous airborne molecules inside a room. There she blows: A new hand dryer called Sterillo (pictured) claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of potentially deadly germs. It uses a form of UV light to blitz all the bacteria inside a room . The technology is already used in ambulances and care homes to kill infections, but in the form of a hand dryer can tackle unsanitary conditions in bathrooms. The device uses technology discovered in the 1920s, called dual wave UVC light. This is a form of UV light and is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks. The device makes use of two wavelengths to kill the viruses. A lamp in the hand dryer creates a type of oxygen molecule called oxygen radicals. Such molecules are found naturally and are nature’s way of cleaning. Plasma is blasted from the dryer and destroys the germs. This can eradicate airborne infections  such as Salmonella, E-Coli, MRSA and Hepatitis A. It can eradicate airborne infections that lurk in toilets such as Salmonella, E-Coli, MRSA and Hepatitis A, and inventor Steve Levy said the dryer could also benefit schools and offices. The unit costs just under £500 ($740). It contains a 'UVC plasma technology' unit that silently destroys bacteria in a room ‘every second of every day’. Mr Levy told MailOnline that the device uses technology discovered in the 1920s, called dual wave UVC light. This is a form of UV light which is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks, for example. ‘Plasma comes out and goes around the room destroying germs,’ Mr Levy said.

Inventor Steve Levy told MailOnline the dryer could benefit schools, offices, hospitals and care homes . Mr Levy explained that inside buildings there are fewer self-cleaning molecules than outdoors, which helps create the perfect environment for germs to breed. He said Sterillo's technology is harmless to humans and that the dryer produces lower levels of radicals than are found outside. ‘Bringing them inside can kill germs and bugs that are not around outside,’ he continued. There is an added bonus of the device eradicating unpleasant smells too, as well as any mould.

"Twelve years ago 24 photographers decided to carry out an ambitious project - to document a full New Year's Day every year for 24 years. To begin with each was allocated one hour of the day to record what was going on around them. But the project did not stop there. This was a project that was to last 24 years, with each photographer progressing one hour every year, so that at the end of 24 years, there will be 24 sets of images from New Year's Day - or 576 images. 00.00 by Yvonne De Rosa – Untitled: 'I was in Reykjavik and I was with friends in the square close to the main church.' To contrast with the chaos she took this picture of a couple in 'a calm embrace and in their own magic space' The original 24 photographers met while studying on a postgraduate photography course at Central St Martin's in London. Six prints from this year's project will be auctioned off in aid of Hope and Homes for Children, an international charity working to ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in the love of a family. Curator Bridget Coaker said: 'When I first heard about 24photography I thought what a great idea, I do hope they manage to keep the momentum going. Now in its 12th year this group of dedicated photographers are still going out in all weathers and all hours to capture something that shows something of the first day of each New Year. Their commitment to the project is inspiring.' Claire Spreadbury, founder of 24photography, said: 'The exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our twelfth year we've really developed an identity and feel that we're an established part of London's art calendar. New Year's Day is an exciting time of the year, and we hope that 24 captures some of that excitement, but also gives a little glimpse into the rest of the day after the celebrations and parties.' 01:00 by Algy Sharman – Superhero: 'This shot was taken in a cafe near a spooky industrial estate outside Stockholm.This guy and his buddy were out skateboarding.

"Dozens of MPs are claiming taxpayer-funded expenses to rent homes or stay in hotel rooms in London while letting out property they own nearby, it emerged last night. The 46 MPs have claimed more than £1.3million for rent or hotel rooms at the same time as receiving rent from properties that were often purchased and refurbished from taxpayers’ money. An investigation by Channel 4 News found 25 Conservatives, 14 Labour and four Liberal Democrats had benefited from the expenses loophole, which is not against parliamentary rules. Many of the MPs bought their London properties with the help of the taxpayer under the previous expenses system that allowed claims for mortgage payments. 46 MPs - including Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy (left) and former Conservative health secretary Andrew Lansley (right) - have claimed more than £1.3million for rent or hotel rooms at the same time as receiving rent from properties . But since the claims were banned by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) following the expenses scandal, the MPs have switched to renting out the properties they own and instead claimed expenses for rent and hotels. Under the current system, MPs are allowed to claim £20,600 a year in London rent and £150 a night for hotels. Labour’s shadow culture minister Chris Bryant has claimed £35,350 in the past two years to rent a property in London despite already owning a penthouse. He bought the two-bedroom apartment, which has a private lift and porter, in 2005 and claimed around £1,000 a month in mortgage claims. But when the rules changed he moved into another flat and let out the property he already owned for around £3,000 a month. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy owns a property two miles from Westminster that he bought with taxpayer help. But in the previous two years he claimed £39,372 to rent another flat for himself. Labour’s shadow culture minister Chris Bryant (left) has claimed £35,350 in the past two years to rent a property in London despite owning a penthouse. Former Liberal Democrat defence minister Sir Nick Harvey (right) has charged the taxpayer £39,772  for the rent of a flat, despite owning a house in Lambeth . Former Liberal Democrat defence minister Sir Nick Harvey has charged the taxpayer £39,772 in expense claims for the rent of a flat, despite owning a house in Lambeth, which he has let out to tenants since the rule change. Andrew Lansley, the former Tory health secretary, has claimed more than £7,440 since 2013 to stay in London hotels, despite owning a flat with his wife in upmarket Pimlico, which was bought with help under the old expenses system. SNP MP Angus MacNeil owns a flat in Lambeth, a short walk from the Houses of Parliament, which was paid for with taxpayer help. But he has claimed £42,177 in hotel expenses om the three years since 2012/13. Former Chairman of the Committee for Standards in Public Life Sir Alistair Graham said MPs should be seen to be upholding the spirit of the rules that state they must not ‘exploit the system for personal financial advantage’. Former Chairman of the Committee for Standards in Public Life Sir Alistair Graham (above) said MPs should be seen to be upholding the spirit of the rules that state they must not ‘exploit the system for personal financial advantage’ He told Channel 4 News: ‘It’s not always just about exactly what the rules say. It is about you taking personal responsibility that public funds are used in a proper and appropriate way that your constituents would be comfortable with. ‘I’m sure we will hear all sorts of sob stories about why it’s justifiable to do what they’ve done. ‘But they must know in their heart of hearts that the public will see this as MPs on the make.’ Last night MPs said the rules banning mortgage claims had forced them to let out their second home to be able to afford the mortgage payments. Sir Nick Harvey said: ‘This situation is not of the MPs’ choosing. MPs have been obliged to let out their own properties since 2010 because the new rules say they cannot claim mortgage interest – only rent. ‘Letting income covers the mortgage and other outgoings and is of course taxed. It is not MPs’ fault that the rules compel them to rent a separate flat to live in.’ Mr MacNeil blamed the current rules and said MPs should be allowed to claim for flats they own, as they did in the past. Mr Lansley said he normally commuted to Parliament from his home in South Cambridgeshire and only stayed overnight in London hotel about once a month. He told Channel 4 News: ‘My expense claims have always sought to minimise the cost to the taxpayer. My relatively few overnight stays in London (barely once a month in the last year) meant that my expenses claims would be lower for occasional hotel stays in sitting weeks than for the costs of maintaining a flat in Westminster.’ Mr Bryant and Mr Murphy did not respond to a request for comment.","46 MPs used expenses loophole, which is not against parliamentary rules .

"Human rights commissioner Gillian Triggs has again defended her decision to give $350,000 to a refugee who killed his pregnant wife. In a senate estimates hearing on Friday, Ms Triggs was grilled by coalitions senators after she backed her recommendation that John Basikbasik should receive $350,000 in compensation for being 'arbitrarily' held in a detention centre after the government ruled he was too dangerous to be integrated back into society. Ms Triggs said it was her role to remind the government of their 'international obligations' and hold them accountable for breaching human rights. The human rights commissioner was forced to defend her decision in a senate estimate hearing after she recommended $350,000 be awarded to a man who killed his pregnant wife . 'While the government of course has an executive power to detain someone, that executive power must be exercised in a way that is necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim,' she said. 'I think most fair-minded Australians would say that holding someone for eight years after he has served his prison sentence is something that does require at least the regular consideration of his case, and regular consideration of whether or not alternative forms of detention or supervision might be used.' Mr Basikbasik was involved in the West Papuan independence movement and gravely opposed Indonesia's occupation of his home. Mr Basikbasik reportedly canoed to Australia, arriving on 13 June 1985 . He was granted refugee status in 1986 and reportedly committed a number of violent offences before beating his pregnant 28-year-old partner and unborn child to death with a bicycle. After spending seven years behind bars for the horrific crime his sentence had come to an end however Mr Basikbasik was still deemed a danger to society. The government was not able to deport him because of his genuine asylum seeker status so instead they chose to release him into Villawood Detention Centre, where he remained for a further eight years. The human rights commissioner said Mr Basikbasik's human rights were breached adding it was 'standard procedure' to recommend compensation for anybody in Australia who had been detained 'contrary to those international obligations.' 'His human rights have been breached, and where there has been a breach, there is a recommendation for compensation' Ms Triggs confirms his detention was lawful however her report claims the compensation estimate reflects the level of indignity Mr Basikbasik suffered through losing his freedom and liberty. 'I appreciate the public wants to know how these sums are computed but again I think a fair minded person would say to be held for eight years without a charge, without a trial, and without consideration as to whether alternatives could be considered for this man, especially in light of the psychiatrist's evidence that a management plan had not been developed for him, would consider the compensation proposed was a reasonable one,' she said. Mr Basikbasik was held in Villawood Detention Centre for eight years after a serving a seven year sentence . Challenging the government for her apparent trial by media Ms Triggs said they always had the opportunity to challenge her decisions, however rarely did. 'Normally it would be for members of parliament to read my reports, to question them if they chose to, and if appropriate, for the attorney to appeal against them. 'That has not been done and unfortunately the choice has been made to do so in the pages of a particular newspaper, where the facts and legal reasoning were grossly misstated.' This isn't the first instance the relationship between the commissioner and the current government appeared strained. Tony Abbott has repeatedly called for Ms Triggs to resign from her position as Human Rights Commissioner . Tony Abbot publically slammed Ms Triggs for her 315-page report into the treatment of children in detentions centres. The Prime Minister labeled it a 'partisan report' and 'political-stitch up' immediately demanding her resignation. Ms Triggs was allegedly offered a job by attorney general George Brandis in return for her resignation. Shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus wrote to the Australian Federal Police at the time asking if Mr Brandis had in fact committed an offence by making the offer.","Gillian Triggs came under fire in a senate estimates hearing on Friday .

"Nazir Afzal (above) has resigned from the Crown Prosecution Service despite being cleared of improper conduct . One of the UK's most senior prosecutors dramatically resigned yesterday despite being cleared of improper conduct. Nazir Afzal, who led the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in North West England, was accused of sending a text message to a defendant. An internal inquiry exonerated the highly experienced lawyer, who was honoured by The Queen in 2005, of any wrongdoing. But he nevertheless handed in his resignation as more senior colleagues insisted his departure is due to an 'on-going drive for efficiency'. The resignation is a direct blow to Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders who has faced criticism for pursing campaign agendas instead of serving the general public. Mr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences. This included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions. He said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice. More recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall. He also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse. Mr Afzal took up his post in 2011 and led a huge team of about 700 lawyers, legal staff, and administrators. He was responsible for all criminal prosecutions across Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and Cumbria. Earlier this week his staff received an email earlier this week saying it had always been his intention to step down in 2015. Mr Afzal led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache (left), who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell (right), who was also acquitted of child sex abuse . In the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS. After studying law in Birmingham, Mr Afzal qualified as a solicitor and worked in private practice until he joined the CPS in 1991. He began his CPS career in central London and has prosecuted and advised on many high profile cases. Mr Afzal was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community. A CPS spokesman said: 'We are continuing to reduce the number of staff employed across the organisation and Nazir Afzal is leaving the Service as part of this ongoing drive for efficiency. 'This is entirely unrelated to any issue of conduct and we are satisfied that there has been no impropriety on the part of Mr Afzal.'","Nazir Afzal led the Crown Prosecution Service in North West England .

"The CIA official who led the hunt for Osama Bin Laden is being removed from his post, it has been revealed. The head of the agency's Counter­terrorism Center, who also directed drone campaigns which killed thousands, has been in the position for nine years and is described as a 'true hero'. His move is part of a major restructuring under CIA director John Brennan, and ends a tenure which has seen the center become a paramilitary unit, The Washington Post reported. The official, who has not been fully named by the paper as he is still undercover, is a convert to Islam and is believed to be in his 50s. The CIA official who led the hunt for Osama Bin Laden is being removed from his post as part of director John Brennan's (pictured) restructuring. The agency veteran has been described as a true hero . Known by his agency identity Roger, he presided over a campaign of espionage and armed drone strikes that have killed both terrorists and  civilians. Many of Al Qaeda's most influential leaders have been slain under his leadership, but the main threat has since shifted to ISIS. In a Post profile written in 2012, he was described as chain-smoker and 'not at all a team player' by colleagues. He was also the basis for the character 'The Wolf' in the film Zero Dark Thirty and is said to have spent hours on the treadmill reading terrorism reports. But agency spokesman Dean Boyd paid tribute to the senior official as news of his departure surfaced. He said: 'After nearly a decade of outstanding work in this post, including the takedown of countless terrorists and many other successes in protecting the country, he will be moving on in connection with the CIA modernization plan announced last month.' Roger is believed to be staying on at the CIA and will be reassigned. His successor is known as Chris and is said to be an agency veteran who has already been in a number of high profile positions . Earlier this month Brennan ordered a sweeping overhaul of the spy agency, aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into traditional intelligence gathering. Known by his agency identity Roger, he was the basis for the character 'The Wolf' in Zero Dark Thirty (not pictured). Kyle Chandler (left) and Jessica Chastain (right) during one of the scenes . The move was prompted after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency's management structure. These included what deputy CIA director David Cohen called 'pain points' - or organizational areas where the CIA's bureaucracy does not work efficiently. US officials said that Brennan decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive. Historically, electronic eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the US government. But the CIA felt that it too had to reorganize to keep up with the technological 'pace of change,' as one official put it.","Official known only by his agency identity, 'Roger', is stepping down the as Counter­terrorism Center's head .

"Afghan president Mohammed Ashraf Ghani told the U.S. Congress on Wednesday that the ISIS terror army has begun to infiltrate his country 'like a dangerous virus,' and warned his fellow Muslims not to be romanced by its 'anger and hatred.' Ghani said Afghanistan is the new 'frontline' for the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, which has been 'sending advance guards to southern and western Afghanistan to test for vulnerabilities.' So far, he told a joint meeting of Congress, 'Afghanistan's people have rejected the allure of violent Islam. But sooner or later extremism will come knocking at our door.' He urged people in 'Muslim majority countries' to challenge Islamist terrorism 'from within the religion.' 'Silence is not acceptable,' the Afghan leader declared. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . TERROR WARNING: Afghan President Ashraf Ghani addressed a joint meeting of Congress at the US Capitol on Wednesday, warning that ISIS is threatening to undo years of post-9/11 rebuilding in his country . HERO'S WELCOME: Ghani entered the House chamber to thunderous applause before thanking the US government and taxpayers for more than a decade of financial and military support . 'LAZY UNCLE JOE': Vice President Biden chuckled, and then grimaced, when Ghani unfortunately used his first name to represent an imaginary dependent family member (standing in for Afghanistan) who refuses to be self-sufficient . 'The heart of the issue remains who is entitled to speak for Islam,' Ghani told a packed House chamber at the U.S. Capitol. 'Leaders, intellectuals, and those many millions of Muslims who believe that Islam is a religion of tolerance and virtue must find their voice.' Ghani insisted that 'Islam is a religion of peace,' and praised the Muslim world for its 'gloriously tolerant and inquisitive past.' His speech came against the backdrop of a spreading Islamist radicalism that has helped ISIS – which he referred to by its native name 'Daesh' – conquer large swaths of Iraqi and Syrian teritory by leveraging a fundamentalist brand of Islam as a pretext for military might. That extremism, Ghani warned, 'is becoming a system – one that, like a dangerous virus, is constantly mutating, becoming more lethal, very media savvy, well financed, and thriving on state weakness and an overall lack of regional coordination.' At the same time he thanked American taxpayers for supporting his country's post-9/11 resurgence and urged Congress to keep the money flowing – to a point. 'I have no doubt that, provided that they continue to receive equipment and training, our armed forces will stand firm against any efforts by outside extremists to build a base inside our territory,' he said. But 'we don't want your charity,' he insisted. 'We have no more interest in perpetuating a childish dependence than you have in being saddled with a poor family member who lacks the energy and drive to go out and find a job.' And in a throwaway line that wasn't in the prepared text that circulated among lawmakers Wednesday morning, he chuckled: 'We're not going to be the lazy Uncle Joe.' Vice President Joe Biden, seated behind him, could be heard on C-SPAN's camera feed chuckling twice as loudly. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Wednesday that the U.S. has 'a vested interest in the ability of Afghans to secure and stabilize their country after the investments of the American people and the extraordinary sacrifices of our service members.' Ghani, Corker added, is now responsible for 'mobilizing a reliable, effective security force in a region where terrorism remains a major threat.' From the podium in the House chamber, the Afghan leader agreed. 'Properly supported, Afghanistan is uniquely positioned to block the spread of extremism,' he claimed. 'We have none of the historical inferiority complexes that fuel resentment against western domination. After all, we defeated most of the empires.' TROOP DRAWDOWN? President Barack Obama said Tuesday that he wouldn't order the quick military withdrawal he was expected to institute in the wake of the official end of American combat in Afghanistan at the end of 2014 . THANK YOU: Ghani thanked Americans over and over for supporting and stabilizing his country in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, perpetrated by al-Qaeda terrorists who had taken refuge there . 'With the bitter exception of the aberrant Taliban regime, Afghan Islam has traditionally been inclusive and reflective, not violent and angry,' he said. 'And after thirty-six years of conflict our people are well-vaccinated against the seduction of ideologically based conflicts.' In a more dramatic departure from his prepared remarks, Ghani paused to express his hope that Afghanistan would someday become 'ordinary.' 'Our people, our children, desperately want to be normal,' he said. 'Ordinary is what has escaped us, and we'd really like to be leading ordinary lives: to go to school and come back, to shop without being blown up, to play volleyball without being attacked.' 'So many children have I held in my arms who have been mutilated,' Ghani continued. 'That must not be permitted! It cannot be permitted! It will not be permitted!' Ghani faces the challenge of establishing Afghanistan's military and civil self-sufficiency as President Barack Obama supervises a slowed-down but inevitable drawdown of the U.S. military forces that have kept the country from falling apart since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. That deployment, initially ordered by President George W. Bush to punish and contain the al-Qaeda network that brought down the World Trade Center from its Afghan bases of operations, cost 2,315 servicemen and women their lives and brought another 20,000 home with wounds and other injuries. 'We owe a profound debt to the soldiers who have lost limbs to buried bombs, to the brave veterans, and to the families who tragically lost their loved ones to the enemy’s cowardly acts of terror,' Ghani said Wednesday. And more than a decade later, he pledged, 'Afghanistan will be the graveyard of al-Qaeda and their foreign terrorist affiliates.' 'Never again will our country be a host to terrorists. Never again will we give extremists the sanctuary to plan their destructive plots.'","Mohammed Ashraf Ghani spoke to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday .
Said the ISIS terror army is already testing his country's vulnerabilities in border regions .
Key to defeating the terrorists, he said, is making it clear that they don't speak for all of Islam .
Also thanked Obama for 'seamless handover' of military operations even as the US has slowed down its troop withdrawal ."
"With the average cost of a wedding hitting £25,000, thrifty brides are always on the hunt for ways to budget when it comes to planning the big day. And now, George at Asda is hoping to help - by launching a wedding collection for bridesmaids and pageboys starting from just £7. Dubbed 'the most affordable range anywhere on the high street', the supermarket claim that it's half the price of rivals such as Debenhams and Next and is a 'saviour for cash-strapped brides-to-be'. George at Asda has launched a Wedding Collection of bridesmaid and pageboy outfits starting from £7 . The new range is designed for children aged 9 months up to 14 years, with girls' bridesmaid and flowergirl dresses start at £12, boys' formal shirts at £7 and suit trousers at £10. A complete outfit for a flowergirl will cost from £28, whilst pageboys can look sharp in a shirt, tie, waistcoat, suit and  shoes for £51. Girls' bridesmaid and flowergirl dresses start at £12 and there will be 14 options in total . Pageboys can be kitted out in a shirt, tie, waistcoat, suit and shoes for £51 form the supermarket's new range . The new launch comes on the back of research by the store revealing that the average number of bridesmaids at a UK wedding is now four, with two-thirds of brides coughing up in excess of £500 to kit out bridesmaids, flowergirls and pageboys. Kate Moss sparked the 'more is more' trend with 14 flowergirls and two page boys at her wedding to Jamie Hince in 2011. But Poppy Delevingne went one (or rather, three) better with an impressive 17 bridesmaids and two pageboys when she said 'I Do' in May last year. To kit out Poppy's entourage in the new collection from Asda would come in at £578. Asda decided to venture into bridesmaid and pageboy outfits after research revealed that two-thirds of brides cough up in excess of £500 to kit out their entourage . The Duchess of Cambridge's  flowergirls were kitted out in Nicki Macfarlane designs and with prices starting at a minimum of £210 per frock, Asda say the royal flowergirls' dresses were 90 per cent more expensive than  the highest priced dress  at George, which would set you back £20. A spokesperson for the supermarket said: 'George was the first supermarket retailer to offer wedding clothing for adults in 2008 and it was a huge success. 'We want brides and grooms to have a perfect day to remember that doesn't break the bank, and now they can have as many supporting cast as they need!'.

"A man who was brutally beaten and left for dead after witnessing his mother's murder is still fighting for justice 36 years on - and says he knows who is responsible for her death. Eric Garrett, from Muncie, Indiana, was just four when a man entered the home he shared with his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, on March 25, 1979 and savagely beat them with a blunt object - killing her and fracturing the little boy's skull. A few weeks later, when he was finally well enough to speak with police, he named the attacker as Richard Green, his mother's on-off boyfriend and a married father-of-four. Even though prosecutors concluded Green was not responsible for the attack, Garrett continues to stand by his childhood claim, while neighbors have also recounted the couple's troubled relationship. Witness: Eric Garrett, pictured left, is calling for a new investigation into the 1979 murder of his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, right. He says he saw her boyfriend in their apartment before the attack . 'This case isn't unsolved, it's just unprosecuted,' Garrett, now 40, told NBC News. Paula Garrett and Green had met at the restaurant where Paula worked as a waitress and the night before her death, he was at her apartment, investigators told NBC's Dan Slepian. Green told police that he left late that night and then visited her apartment the following afternoon, where he came across her body. He then alerted neighbors. But family members told NBC's Dan Slepian that Green had been possessive and abusive, and that Paula had been trying to break up with him at the time of her death. A neighbor, Larry Smith, added to NBC that he often heard the couple fighting and the night she was killed, he heard Green shout: 'You think you're going to get away with this?' The following day, Green barged into Smith's apartment and told the neighbor that Paula had killed herself, he said. When Smith rushed into the apartment with Green, 'I immediately realized this was no suicide', he said. 'Blood was everywhere.' He also noticed that her son was covered in blood on the ground but was opening his eyes. He picked up the boy's limp body - all while Green did nothing, Smith said. When Eric was well enough to speak to police, he named the man and picked his photo from a lineup. He told NBC that he had been sleeping when Green walked in and switched on the light, giving him a good view of his mother's killer. But a defense team today would raise issues with Garrett's claims, considering his age, the passage of time and the injuries he sustained in the attack, experts told NBC. Questions: No one has ever been charged in the murder of Paula Garrett, left, or the attack on her son Eric, when he was four. Her boyfriend was initially arrested but was freed after passing a lie detector test . Two months after the death, Green was arrested and charged with his girlfriend's murder, although he protested his innocence. His wife and children also stood by him. During a bond hearing, a neighbor testified that they saw Green rushing away from the home around 3am on the night of the murder. He underwent two polygraph tests, both of which he failed. But there were questions over how the tests were carried out so police took him to Chicago for a further test. After taking it, Green went to the restroom and escaped police custody. The next day, after it emerged he had passed the third test, police spoke to him on the phone and convinced him to turn himself in. He was taken back to Indiana where prosecutors dropped the charges - to the anger of police, The Star Press reported. Despite the decision, Eric's father, Robbie Garrett, said that his son maintained Green 'sent my mommy to heaven'. In 1981, the case was turned over to a countywide homicide investigation team after a grand jury decided the original probe was 'incomplete and one-sided'. The city later withdrew this decision. Prosecutor Michael Alexander told NBC that there was no specific evidence indicating Green was the killer. He suggested that the killing could have been motivated by a robbery or a sexual assault. Testimony: Neighbors said they often heard the young single mother, pictured with her son, arguing with her boyfriend, while one testified that he saw the boyfriend, Richard Green, near her apartment that night . 'I was pretty well convinced he didn't commit the crime based on evidence at the scene,' he said. 'I didn't like the idea of charging someone on phony evidence.' Police officers from the original case and members of Eric's family have since called for officials to reopen the case, and Delaware County Prosecutor Jeff Arnold said that he has met with Eric and has asked police to look for further leads. But right now there is no new evidence to bring charges, he said. After the attack, Eric, who was struck as many as 15 times with the blunt object, was left with partial paralysis on his right side and still has nine dimples on his head where his skull was fractured. He was raised by relatives and graduated high school. He still lives in the area with his dog. Green refused to speak with NBC and his daughter told reporters to stop contacting them.","Eric Garrett and his mother, Paula Garrett, 22, were beaten with a blunt object in their Indiana home in 1979 and she was killed .

She told police that her children (aged 13 and 16) usually catch the bus to Nerang State High School, but she decided to drop them off to discipline one for misbehaving.

"A seven months-pregnant woman whose baby was cut from her womb made a desperate 911 call after the brutal attack on Wednesday pleading for help as she was 'bleeding out'. The 26-year-old, identified at one point by the dispatcher as Michelle, spoke faintly on the six-minute call: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The woman was able to give the dispatcher the address of the home in Longmont, Colorado where she had been attacked, adding that she was in the basement and had locked the door. She has multiple wounds, she said, and that the attacker broke a glass and stabbed her in the neck. The 911 dispatcher pressed her for the attacker's name and the woman responded that she didn't know the assailant and had gone to her home answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes.

The mother survived the attack. Scroll down for the 911 call . Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, allegedly stabbed the 26-year-old in the stomach and pulled out the baby, killing the fetus in the process. She had lured the victim to her Colorado home using a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Lane, 34, who is married and has two daughters, was driven to hospital by her husband following the horrific attack where she reportedly told staff she had a miscarriage . According to this online profile, Dynel Lane had registered for baby gifts and boy's clothing and noted her due date as November 14, 2014 . The dispatcher repeatedly reassured the victim that help was on the way and when her voice began to fade away, she urged her: 'You stay with me, don't go to sleep.' Police rushed to the scene and could hear the victim calling for help inside the home. An officer found the victim in the basement. Lane had left the house when police arrived. The victim was taken to Longmont United Hospital where she underwent surgery and is expected to recover. The baby did not survive the attack. Longmont police Cmdr Jeff Satur told Daily Mail Online that the female suspect was taken to hospital by her husband. Lane was reportedly carrying the victim's dead baby and telling hospital staff that she had suffered a miscarriage. The husband is not a suspect, the police chief said. ABC7 reported that the husband believed his wife had suffered a miscarriage. Police would not comment on whether the suspect had recently been pregnant. Comments on Lane's social media referred to a pregnancy last year. A relative said on Thursday that Lane had lost a child of her own more than a decade ago when he accidentally drowned. Lane's son was 19 months old in 2002, when he drowned in a shallow pond at the home of her parents near Pueblo, Colorado. Investigators at the time ruled the death an accident. Lane and her now ex-husband were devastated by the child's death, said Aaron Cruz, the boy's paternal grandfather. The couple had two daughters together and had been trying for a boy. A July 2002 obituary for Lane's son, Michael Alexander Cruz, in the Pueblo Chieftan said the boy loved playing with his sisters, cousins and friends and had just learn to sing his first song, Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Lane's then-husband wasn't home at the time of the drowning, the newspaper reported at the time. She and their two daughters, then five and three, searched for the boy until they found him in the fish pond. He had been playing a game with his sisters while their mother was busy in another part of the house, the newspaper said. Lane also lost her grandmother earlier this month, according to her social media posts. According to social media, Lane had remarried and was assistant manager at a franchise of a company, Once Upon A Child, which buys and sells 'gently-used' children's clothing. KDVR reported on Wednesday that a baby registry was set up in Lane's name last year and listed her due date as November 14, 2014. The clothing in the baby registry was for a boy. Public records revealed that Lane held a certified license as a nurse aide which expired in 2012. After speaking to the victim, police were able to arrest Lane at the hospital at 7.46pm on Wednesday. Lane was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault, and child abuse knowingly and recklessly resulting in death, the Boulder District Attorney's Office confirmed on Thursday. Police are looking for any other mothers who may have responded to Lane's ad for baby clothes.

Under Colorado law, the charges are complicated by the fact if a child was not  born alive, then homicide charges could not be brought. The Boulder County DA's office does not expect to file charges until next week. Investigators have not released the name of the suspect or the pregnant woman but said they did not know each other. The 26-year-old mother-to-be had gone to the home alone to answer the Craigslist ad in Longmont, a town 30 miles outside Denver.

"President Barack Obama says he takes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'at his word' for saying there'd never be an independent Palestinian state as long as he's in office, but still believes a two-state solution is the key to peace in the area. Netanyahu has softened his position since making the comment just before he won re-election last week. He said in a statement on Monday that a Palestinian state would not be established on his watch. But the change in tone doesn't seem to be swaying Obama, who said he spoke to Netanyahu on the phone on Thursday.

'I did indicate to him that we continue to believe that a two-state solution is the only way for the long-term security of Israel, if it wants to stay both a Jewish state and democratic,' Obama told The Huffington Post on Saturday. 'And I indicated to him that given his statements prior to the election, it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible.' Obama says the U.S. will evaluate other options for establishing peace between the Israelis and Palestinians as a result of Netanyahu's rejection of longstanding U.S. policy. Obama says he indicated to Netanyahu when they spoke this week that the U.S. continues to believe a two-state solution is the only way to keep Israel secure. The comments were Obama's first on the Israeli election outcome. He spoke in an interview with The Huffington Post. 'We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,' the president said. The Huff Post reported  Obama said he was most disappointment at Netanyahu's Election Day warning about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls 'in droves.' 'We indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of Israel's traditions,' Obama said in the interview. 'That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly. 'And I think that that is what's best about Israeli democracy. 'If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the meaning of democracy in the country.'","Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he does not support the creation of an independent Palestinian state and that it won't happen on his watch .

"Struck off: Kelvin Loraine, 31, travelled 400 miles to have sex with the girl once she turned 16 . A teacher who groomed a teenage girl and made her enter a 'slave contract' before travelling 400 miles to have sex with her once she turned 16 has been struck off. Kelvin Loraine, 31, met the then 15-year-old girl on an online chatroom in March 2013, after which she sent him dozens of naked images of herself and performed sex acts on Skype at his behest. Shortly after the girl, referred to as Child A, turned 16, Loraine travelled more than 400 miles from his home in Durham to have sex with her in a hotel room in Plymouth, the National College for Teaching and Leadership was told. The disgraced teacher, who taught maths at a Sunderland school, admitted to also having let her watch him perform a sex act on himself via the video chat. He admitted receiving up to 40 photographs of her naked body - although he claimed this happened after her 16th birthday. A professional conduct panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership said Loraine admitted unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute after a private meeting in Coventry. He had already received a caution from Durham Constabulary last July for possessing an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of the child - with whom he first came into contact in the spring of 2013. In a written ruling the panel said: 'Child A would have been 15 years old at that time. They had daily contact online and by phone. Mr Loraine admits his communications, online and by phone, with Child A were romantic and sometimes sexual in nature. 'He admits he became aware she was 15 years of age at some point after the relationship commenced and at least 6 weeks before Child A's 16th birthday. 'Mr Loraine accepts Child A sent approximately 30 - 40 photographs of her naked body to him, sometimes but not always at his request. 'Mr Loraine asserts that this did not occur until after Child A's 16th birthday and during these communications Mr Loraine requested that Pupil A touch herself intimately using her finger, her hairbrush and a sex toy and that he viewed her performing these acts via Skype. 'Mr Loraine admits that this was for his sexual gratification. Mr Loraine also admits that, shortly after Child A's 16th birthday, he and Child A entered into a 'slave contract' - the written terms of which are attached to the Agreed Statement of Facts. Bad teacher: Loraine met the then 15-year-old girl on an online chatroom after which she sent him dozens of naked images of herself and performed sex acts on Skype at his behest (stock image) 'Mr Loraine admits that his conduct was sexually motivated. On 30 November 2013, shortly after Child A's 16th birthday, Mr Loraine arranged to meet her at a hotel in Plymouth and travelled there from his home in Durham. They then engaged in consensual sexual intercourse.' He agreed to the police caution on the basis she was 16 when the picture in his possession was taken and he was unaware an individual had to be 18 for such pictures to be legal. The panel said the inappropriate relationship started when she was 15 and continued after she turned 16. Although he was not her teacher he did tell her he was a teacher. The panel said this had the potential for establishing her trust in him and influencing her behaviour. They said: 'The panel is satisfied it is necessary for a prohibition order to be imposed in order to protect pupils and other members of the public, maintain public confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct.' They also recommended the case was so serious there should be no provision for him to apply to have it set aside in the future. Paul Heathcote, decision-maker for the National College for Teaching and Leadership panel, said: 'The panel is satisfied Mr Loraine's behaviour is incompatible with being a teacher. 'He was the instigator of indecent images of a child being taken which he then had in his possession for his own sexual gratification.'","Kelvin Loraine, 31, met the girl, then 15, on an online chatroom .

"Susan Lenihan, 30, (pictured leaving court last week) admitted harassment after she 'terrorised' her neighbours for two years . A mother who threw eggs at neighbours and poured washing-up liquid over their car is facing prison sentence. Susan Lenihan, 30, spent two years 'persistently targeting' residents in the cul-de-sac they shared in Birmingham, West Midlands, after claims they told police about another neighbour having drugs. James Harrison and his wife Dominique Wilcox-Harrison said their family had been 'victimised' after Lenihan put up posters in her windows calling them a 'grass'. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard the mother-of-one had also shouted at the couple, warning them to 'watch your family' and threw eggs at him while he visited a disabled neighbour. Lenihan admitted a charge of harassment and her sentencing was adjourned until April 2, where District Judge Jan Jellema told her that all options were open, including imprisonment. David Palmer, prosecuting, said the abuse began after another resident's home was searched by police looking for drugs. Mr Palmer said: 'The defendant put up posters in her windows calling Mr Harrison and his wife a 'grass'. The posters also included the words 'act now'.' The court heard Mr Harrison was later prosecuted for dangerous driving but it was thrown out because Lenihan was not considered a credible witness. He also reported several incidents of damage to his car and on February 13 last year Lenhihan was seen spitting on his car after Mr Harrison fitted CCTV outside his home. Mr Palmer said an attempt at mediation between the two parties had failed and Lenihan threw eggs at Mr Harrison when he visited a disabled neighbour. 'The defendant opened a bedroom window and threw eggs in his direction,' he said. 'They landed on the ground next to him. It appears some of the yoke went on his shoes.' There was another incident in July when Mr Harrison found what was believed to be washing-up liquid on his car. He later checked the CCTV and saw the defendant spraying the car. The cul-de-sac in Shard End, Birmingham, where Lenihan lived near to James Harrison and his wife Dominique Wilcox-Harrison . Christopher Stewart, defending, said it was not just a 'one-sided campaign of terror'. Speaking after Lenihan pleaded guilty, Mr Harrison said his family had been victimised because 'we are as straight as it comes'. 'If we have a problem we talk to the person we have the problem with. 'These people don't like people who stand up to them so victimise and bully them with others in the hope we move and bow down. The court heard that Lenihan had accused the Harrison family of 'grassing' up another neighbour to police about possessing drugs. She put up posters in her windows saying they were 'grasses' and to 'act now' 'Why should the victims move when it's the bullies that should be moved and lose what they had – which in this case was a nice grove and nice neighbours.' He added that there were times when the families enjoyed summer evenings together, chatting and having a laugh. Mr Harrison also said he had never considered moving away and is hopeful that after her sentence is handed out she is moved out of the area.","Susan Lenihan, 30, 'persistently targeted' neighbours in her cul-de-sac .

"Spencer Matthews is back in the best shape of his life following a week on a gruelling army-style boot camp. The 26-year-old Made In Chelsea star showed off his impressive six-pack while out hiking at the No 1 Boot Camp in Marrakech. Former lothario Spencer was determined to get toned for the next series of the E4 reality show which starts again on April 13. Scroll down for video . Spencer Matthews headed to the No 1 Boot Camp in Morocco with his girlfriend Lauren Frazer-Hutton . Spencer and Lauren looked like they were enjoying working out while hiking through the Atlas Mountains . So he booked himself in to the boot camp which offers intensive daily military-style fitness sessions. And it has clearly paid off by the looks of his rippling pecs, biceps and abs. Spencer took his girlfriend of five months, Lauren Frazer-Hutton, on the trip - and in the mornings the couple would work-out with a group of 12 other campers staying at the luxury villa. They would take part in grueling sessions of cardio workouts, weights and circuits. In the afternoons they would often go on long romantic hikes together in the foot-hills of the Atlas mountains only coming back to the villa for the evening meal. Temperatures in Morocco got up to 20C and so Spencer was often seen walking around with his top off, whilst Lauren wore a pretty pink crop top. Spencer looked on a little bemused as Lauren did some stretches on the side of the road . Spencer stopped to do a few press ups on some rocks, it certainly beats going to the gym! The good-looking couple spent some time laying in the sunshine as the showed off their impressive tans . Spencer and Lauren flew out to Morocco last week and stayed at the boot camp’s luxury five-star villa just outside Marrakech. Every morning they were woken at 6am and had an hour of exercise before breakfast. At 8.30am they would have an hour and a half of cardio training – boxing or spinning, followed by a snack at 10am, then circuit training at 10.30am until 12. Lunch would be an hour and then they would have long hikes, followed by team games and then yoga and stretching exercise. The evening meal would follow at 7.30pm. Spencer and Lauren covered up for part of the walk - the couple have been dating for around five months now . Despite their tiring work outs Spencer still found time to have a bit of a laugh on the mouthain . All the meals were prepared fresh on site each day and were all local produce and organic. Breakfast would consist of eggs, fresh fruit salad, with a small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. A typical lunch would be fish or chicken brochettes cooked on the BBQ and a selection of salads, and dinner would be a soup and a chicken tagine, all served by the villa’s waiting staff. The calorie intake for each day would be limited to around 1,200 Kcal and the output of exercise around 2,000 Kcal, and generally most camper lose around 9lbs over the week. Back at the luxury villa and Spencer seemed happy to show off his toned torso . Lauren shows off her lean stomach as she limbered up on the mountain . Spencer limbered up on the mountain - he and Lauren would later head back to their villa for dinner . Both Spencer and Lauren were committed to making the most of their time at camp and attended all of the sessions which were run by former RAF Physical Training Instructor Andy Morris. At the end of his stay Spencer was back in to his amazing Men’s Health cover shape, which he achieved back in December 2013. When at the camp Spencer tweeted: 'Getting hammered (not the good kind) @no1bootcamp Marrakech with little @iamlaurenhutton. This stuff works! Hard work pays off. #FitA**' Previously Spencer has been known to party hard but he’s not drinking at all at the moment because he wants to get in great shape. And Lauren sent an Instagram message saying: 'Happiest when in the sun & with this one @spencermatthews.' Spencer previously went to the Ibiza branch of No 1 Boot Camp in October, he worked off his pudgy tummy and uncovered his six pack.","Spencer took a week long trip the No 1 Bootcamp in Morocco .

"Aldi is up to 30 per cent cheaper than the ‘big five’ supermarkets despite the fact they have been cutting prices on shopping basket essentials. The budget chain continues to undercut the giants on everything from fruit and vegetables to eggs and pasta, an independent study found. Aldi came out cheapest on a basket of 33 commonly bought items at a total of £42.15, a saving of almost £8 compared to the £50.11 charged by Asda. Tesco was next best at £53.97, then Morrisons on £54.29 and Waitrose at £59.98. An new study has found that Aldi, pictured, continues to undercut the big five supermarkets on everything from produce to eggs and pasta . The German retailer was a remarkable £18 – 29.9 per cent – cheaper than Sainsbury’s, which came in at £60.15 in the survey by The Grocer magazine. The figures suggest that families could comfortably save more than £1,000 a year by switching to a budget supermarket. The mainstream stores insist the figures are not a fair reflection of prices. However it is clear customers believe the discount chains really do make their money go further. Aldi’s sales are up 19.3 per cent on a year ago, giving it a market share of 5 per cent, which is almost on a par with Waitrose. The growth of Aldi and its rival Lidl has triggered the greatest change in shopping habits since the 1950s when the large supermarkets first arrived to push aside independent traders. Studies suggest their combination of low prices and awards for their upmarket ranges of food and drink has successfully attracted the ‘BMW classes’ to their no-frills outlets. The mainstream stores, which have lost millions of customers, have responded by slashing prices on high profile items such as milk and bread, which is hurting their finances. Tesco has issued a series of profit warnings and Morrisons last week announced trading profits have halved. Even Waitrose has been dragged into the price war and has just reported a 24 per cent fall in annual profits. Such has been the impact of price cuts that it is now cheaper to feed a family than a year ago, and CPI inflation is expected to show Britain is about to enter its first period of deflation since the 1960s. Research by retail analysts Him! has revealed a significant change in the type of people shopping at Aldi and Lidl. The proportion who are in the wealthiest AB demographic category is up from 12 per cent in 2013 to 31 per cent today. However, the low prices are part of a package which means service at the budget chains is often below what people have come to expect. The Grocer found Aldi came bottom in terms of store layout, clutter in the aisles and difficulty getting through the ‘illogical, frantic and cramped check-out’. Sainsbury’s said the figures in the study were skewed by the fact it covers only a small number of the many thousands of items it stocks. It said it was very easy to identify products that are around the same figure as Aldi, such as onions, cornflakes, jam and English butter. A spokesman said: ‘We don’t think this price comparison is fair. ‘It’s a very small selection of products that changes every week. It is a randomness that can’t ever really equal fairness. It also doesn’t match up with our internal data or external data sources. 'We have plenty of data like this which demonstrates that we have never been more competitive on price.’","Independent study finds that Aldi is 30% cheaper than the big five retailers .

"A two-year-old polar bear named Pixel has arrived at a wildlife park in Yorkshire to join England's only other polar bear. Victor, a 16-year-old, half-tonne bear who has lived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster since August has now been joined by younger male Pixel. The park said Pixel is 14 years younger and a third of the size of his new compound-mate. Pixel (pictured) a two-year-old polar bear from a zoo just outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands has arrived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster, where he joins resident 16-year-old polar bear Victor . On Monday, Pixel was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull . Once Pixel is settled the park plans to introduce him to Victor as soon as possible . Pixel soon made himself at home in his enclosure and immediately began exploring his new surroundings . 'Male polar bears will leave their mothers at approximately two years old,' said Animal Development Manager Simon Marsh. 'This means it is quite natural for Pixel to wander and find other males to hang around with. 'Pixel is very playful and finds everything interesting and will be sure to keep Victor and the visitors entertained.' The park said Pixel, who may one day be part of the European Breeding Programme, was brought to YWP from a zoo outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands in an operation this week. Pixel arrived at the park yesterday morning (pictured) before being released in the polar enclosure . Polar bears are a species that are increasingly being threatened in their native habitat . On Monday he was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull, arriving at the South Yorkshire park on yesterday morning. Mr Marsh said Victor, who weighs 480kg, gave a roar when he realised there was an new arrival at Project Polar, the park's purpose-built 10 acre polar bear reserve. He said: 'Victor was immediately on his guard when he realised another polar bear was there. But after a roar or two he settled down. Once released in the enclosure Pixel immediately took a dip following his long journey from the Netherlands . To his obvious delight the polar bear caught a fish in the large pond within his enclosure . 'Once Pixel is settled in the plan will be to introduce them together as soon as possible. Pixel is going to look so small compared to big old Victor.' Mr Marsh added: 'Polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause. 'Their native sea ice is disappearing due to climate change but we still have a chance to do something about it and at Project Polar we can share with visitors how they can help. 'It is also vital that we understand how to care for these bears appropriately in captivity and provide for their needs. 'The initial research into Victor has been extremely encouraging and Pixel's arrival is a bonus.' Pixel appears very pleased with himself as he returns his catch to the bank before eating it .

"Pakistani officials executed 12 people this morning in the country's single-largest day of executions since a moratorium on the death penalty was lifted in December. The executions  are sure to raise concerns over due process and proper oversight of the country's troubled criminal justice system, which rights groups say often does little to protect defendants. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted the moratorium on December 17, a day after Pakistani Taliban gunmen attacked a school and killed 134 students and 19 adults. The killings put pressure the government to do more to tackle the Islamist insurgency and the current wave of executions are a continuation of Pakistan's crackdown on the Taliban. Scroll down for video . Family: Relatives of convicted murderer Muhammad Faisal react after his execution in Karachi today . Grief: Pakistani relatives of convicted murderer Muhammad Faisal mourn after his execution in Karachi . Grisly: An ambulance carries the body of murderer Muhammad Afzal, who was hanged in Karachi today . Authorities at different jails in the country's largest province of Punjab today hanged 10 people who had been sentenced to death in murder cases, said the provincial Home Minister Shuja Khanzada. He said authorities planned to execute more convicted criminals in the coming weeks, adding: 'We have started a process, and it will continue.' The superintendent of the main jail in the southern port city of Karachi, Qazi Nazir, said they executed two convicted murderers and handed their bodies over to their families. Late last year, Pakistan's prime minister lifted the death-penalty moratorium specifically for terror-related cases after the December Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar killed 153 people, most of them children. Last week, in a controversial step, the government completely lifted the death-penalty ban for all cases. Human rights groups estimate Pakistan has roughly 8,000 prisoners on death row. A relative mourns beside the body of convicted killer Muhammad Faisal following his execution in Karachi . Day of death: A man chats on the phone as he sits next to the body of his relative Muhammad Afzal, who was convicted of murder and executed in Karachi earlier this morning . One of the most closely watched execution cases is that of Shafqat Hussain, who family members say was 14 when he was sentenced to death by a court in Karachi for the murder of a seven-year-old boy. Hussain's family proclaims his innocence and Justice Project Pakistan, the legal group handling his case, says Hussain was tortured into making a false confession. The death sentence cannot be used against a defendant under the age of 18 when the crime was committed and testimony obtained by torture is inadmissible. 'It's just a sham, there was no inquiry conducted at all,' said Shahab Siddiqui from Justice Project Pakistan, the legal aid group representing Hussain. This morning Interior Minister Chaudhry Nidar Ali Khan told the parliament that authorities were still trying to confirm whether Hussain was a juvenile when the alleged murder happened. Hussain is scheduled to be hanged on Thursday. Criticism: The executions are sure to raise concerns over due process and proper oversight of the country's troubled criminal justice system, which rights groups say often does little to protect defendants . Attack: Human rights groups say convictions in Pakistan are highly unreliable because its antiquated criminal justice system barely functions, torture is common and police are mostly untrained . So far, 39 people have been hanged since December. More than 40 are scheduled to hang in the next week, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. The ministry is reviewing the cases of hundreds more whose appeals have been exhausted. There are more than 8,000 Pakistanis on death row. The moratorium on executions had been in place since a democratic government took power from a military ruler in 2008. Human rights groups say convictions in Pakistan are highly unreliable because its antiquated criminal justice system barely functions, torture is common and police are mostly untrained. Some of Pakistan's allies have criticised the executions. 'Executing a person who committed a crime when he was underage is in violation of international law,' said European Union Ambassador Lars-Gunnar Wigemark. 'We do not believe that the death penalty is a deterrent. We are furthermore concerned with possible miscarriages of justice.' The ministry spokesman said of the 12 executed on Tuesday: 'They were not only terrorists, they included the other crimes, some of them were murderers and some did other heinous crimes.'","Officials carried out executions of 12 people at jails in Punjab and Karachi .

"President Barack Obama read 'Mean Tweets' on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live last night, but he was unfazed. After enduring the routine — in which celebrities read hostile Twitter comments about themselves — Obama told Kimmel: 'You should see what the Senate says about me.' The president also joked about the perks and restrictions he faces, revealing that he's not allowed to use cellphones that have recorders in them. (Hence his ever-present BlackBerry.) He also noted he can visit the dentist in the White House basement, but doesn't text and can't drive. Late-night appearance: Secret Service agents stand by as President Obama chats with Jimmy Kimmel during a break in  the show on which he appeared on Thursday night . Big time: The president swung by Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday and even read mean tweets about himself in a segment that most often features actors and other celebrities . Thanks Obama: The mean tweets were mostly lighthearted but the president had the opportunity to poke fun at himself several times when his interview with Kimmel began . Kimmel asked if that was because you need a birth certificate to get a driver's license. Obama — whom Kimmel introduced as the 'first Kenyan-born Muslim Socialist ever elected president' — deadpanned that Kenyans 'drive on the other side' of the road. With Sean Penn waiting in the wings, Obama said he was quite familiar with the actor's 1982 coming-of-age comedy 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High.' 'I lived it,' Obama said. 'I didn't just see it.' The President even read mean tweets about himself in a segment that usually features actors and other celebrities. One included the rather harsh joke: 'How do you make Obama's eyes light up? Shine a flashlight in his ears.' Another tweeted: 'Somebody send Obama some lifehacks on how to be a good president. Ha ha. Like, I bet that would help. Lol.' One member of the public also quipped: 'Is there any way we could fly Obama to some golf course halfway around the world and just leave him there?' President Obama declined to comment on his late night talk show appearance, despite much prodding by Jimmy Kimmel, about whether he immediately went to find out the truth about Area 51 after being sworn in as president. However, he did drop some interesting reveals on the audience about the strange things he cannot do as President of the United States, as well as one thing he can do (but doesn't). Obama revealed that he is not, for security reasons, allowed to drive a car as president. 'I can't drive,' he blurted, before realizing it sounded as if he wasn't able to drive at all. Kimmel quipped: 'Is that because you don't have a birth certificate?' 'In Kenya, we drive on the other side of the road,' the president joked back. Obama also revealed that he's not allowed to use a cell phone that has a recording device, which means he's banned from using many smartphones and must stick to the less high tech Blackberry. Among other restrictions, the president also doesn't get to head to the dentist when he needs a cleaning. Instead, he revealed, the dentist comes to him and does all the necessary work in the White House basement. One thing Obama does get to do in his massive Washington residence is raid the White House kitchen whenever he wants, he revealed. Though when asked by Kimmel if he can run down to the fridge n his underwear when he's hungry at night, Obama demurred: . 'I could, but I don't,' he said. After enduring the routine — in which celebrities read hostile Twitter comments about themselves — Obama told Kimmel, 'You should see what the Senate says about me' Got heavy: The Mean Tweets segment was the start of what was mostly a fun appearance on Kimmel, though the president did discuss recent events in Ferguson, Missouri . Kimmel spared the president from questions about the latest controversy involving the Secret Service — although Kimmel's security guard and sidekick, Guillermo Rodriguez, dressed in a full Secret Service getup of dark suit and sunglasses. The glasses, Kimmel joked, were simply hiding a hangover: 'Secret cerveza.' Obama's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live fulfilled a commitment the White House made after he had to postpone an appearance last year. Kimmel, at one point, asked Obama if he has 'Hillary Clinton's new email?' 'I can't share it with you,' the president quipped, 'I don't think she'd want you to have it.' During a more subdued segment, Obama reflected on Wednesday night's shooting of two police officers in racially tense Ferguson, Missouri, just days after he had delivered a speech on racial healing in Selma, Alabama. 'What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest, but there was no excuse for criminal acts,' he said.

Salute: US President Barack Obama  (2L) and US Senator Barbara Boxer (2R), Democrat of California, disembark from Air Force One . Power: Air Force One sits on the tarmac after US President Barack Obama's arrival at Los Angeles International Airport . President Barack Obama was given the full military protection with three US Military V-22 Osprey worth $68 million each flying next to him in Marine One on his way to be interviewed on Jimmy Kimmel Live . 'Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue — they are criminals, they need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides — law enforcement, who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understandably don't want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race — that they are able to work together to come up with some good answers.' After the 'Kimmel' taping, Obama attended a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the Santa Monica home of Chris Silbermann, president of ICM Partners, one of the top talent agencies in Hollywood. The event was closed to the press, but a Democratic official said the event attracted about 25 people who each paid up to $33,400. Obama is flying to Phoenix today to hold a roundtable event on veterans' health care.

"Bakery owner Karen McArthur (pictured) said that as a Christian she does not support gay marriage and 'knew in her heart' she could not make the cake . A Christian baker who refused to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan has said she 'knew in her heart' she could not make the order. Belfast-based Ashers Bakery refused to make a cake featuring an image of Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie below the motto 'Support Gay Marriage'. Karen McArthur, one of the owners, gave evidence on the second day of the high-profile legal action being heard in Belfast's County Court. Mrs McArthur told the court: 'I knew in my heart that I could not put that message on the cake.' Northern Ireland's Equality Commission took the case against family-run Ashers Bakery on behalf a gay rights activist customer whose order was declined. Gareth Lee, a volunteer member of the LGBT advocacy group Queer Space, claimed he was left feeling like a 'lesser person' when his order was turned down. It had been ordered for a private function marking International Day Against Homophobia last May. Mr Lee told the court yesterday that he was left 'shocked' and in 'disbelief' when Mrs McArthur rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for. Today Mrs McArthur told the court: 'The problem was with the message on the cake because, as a Christian, I do not support gay marriage.' District judge Isobel Brownlie heard that nine members of the McArthur family work in the business, which makes and delivers cakes across the UK and Ireland. Mrs McArthur and her husband Colin, who belong to Dunseverick Baptist Church, are the only shareholders with voting rights on how the company is run. Under cross-examination from Robin Allen QC, Mrs McArthur told the court she had been a born-again Christian since the age of seven and 'sought to please God' in how she led her life. She claimed she only took the order from Mr Lee in order to avoid a confrontation. 'I did not want to embarrass him or have a confrontation in the bakery,' Mrs McArthur told the court. Public opinion on the landmark civil case has been split in Northern Ireland and beyond. The Equality Commission, which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region, initially asked for the bakery to acknowledge it had breached legislation and offer 'modest' damages to the customer. But when Ashers refused, the commission proceeded with the legal action. Robin Allen QC, representing Mr Lee, said the baker's objection on religious grounds was unlawful. He told the court that Mr Lee had used the bakery in Royal Avenue in Belfast city centre 'regularly' before the incident. He said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service where images could be printed in edible icing on a cake. He said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to 'religious scruples'. The barrister told the court that the order was accepted by Ashers director Mrs McArthur and Mr Lee paid for it in full. Gareth Lee (pictured left)  a volunteer member of the LGBT advocacy group Queer Space, claimed he was left feeling like a 'lesser person' when his pro-gay marriage cake (right) which had been paid for was turned down . 'A contract was therefore concluded,' he said. Mr Allen said that, over the next few days, Mrs McArthur expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter-in-law, Amy, and the matter was then discussed with her son, Daniel. After that Mr Lee was informed that his order would not be processed due to the family's religious views, said the lawyer. Mr Allen said if companies were allowed to break contracts with individuals then 'the law is worth nothing'. He added: 'The rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the commercial sphere.' The barrister insisted that Ashers was not an 'explicitly religious' business and referred to an interview Daniel McArthur gave to a newspaper in which he claimed the majority of his  workforce were unaware of his family's faith. Mr Allen stressed the importance of anti-discrimination legislation in Northern Ireland, given its history of sectarian strife. A lawyer for Ashers said the refusal had been down to the content of the cake and was not connected to any characteristic of the customer. David Scoffield QC said: 'The defendants neither knew nor cared about Mr Lee's sexual orientation or his religious beliefs, if any, or his political opinions. 'The reason why the order was declined was because of the content and had nothing to do with a feature of the person making the order, or those with which he was associated.' Describing the case as 'complicated', Mr Scoffield branded the legal action as a 'knee-jerk' reaction. If a heterosexual person had requested the same cake bearing the same message they too would have been refused, the barrister said. Mr Scoffield added: 'It was the content of the cake, not the characteristic of the customer or anyone associated with him. 'There was no discrimination in this case.' Co-owner Colin McArthur was also called to give evidence. Although he had not provided a witness statement for the proceedings, he described how he had agonised over the moral dilemma but a family decision was made to refuse to make the cake. He said they talked about how they could 'stand before God' by making a cake promoting gay marriage. Daniel McArthur, general manager of Ashers has accused the commission of pursuing his family because of their belief that marriage should only be between man and woman . Mr McArthur said: 'I spent a day or two thinking it over and wrestling with it in my own heart. 'As far as I can recollect, either on the Saturday or Sunday we were both of the same opinion that we could not proceed and make the cake.' Meanwhile, Daniel McArthur, Ashers general manager, said the decision to decline the order had been made regardless of the legal consequences. Even though he was unaware of the 'ins and outs' of equality legislation, Mr McArthur said he could not compromise his deeply held Christian beliefs opposing gay marriage. He said: 'The reason for the decision was that, as Christians, we just did not feel that putting the message on a cake - gay marriage is clearly in contradiction of the Bible. 'We felt as Christians we could not put that message on a cake.' He told the court: 'We knew the decision in our conscience as Christians was one that we had to make. 'That's why I said to mum regardless, as Christians we are bound by what we believe. 'This is what we are bound to do.' The court was told Mr McArthur, the eldest of three boys, was appointed general manager at his parents' company two years ago. He said the family had not taken legal advice but he had telephoned a church elder to 'ask his thoughts' on the matter. 'We were not doing it in defiance of the law,' added Mr McArthur. 'I think it is quite obvious that we do not know a lot of the ins and outs of the law. 'Our Christian faith is of utmost importance to us. It is how we run our lives; it is how we live our lives; it is how we bring up our families. 'Before God, this is something we couldn't make.' Throughout the hearing Mrs McArthur clutched her husband's arm. The couple sat beside their son and his wife Amy in the main body of the court. On the other side of the large dock, normally used to hold criminals facing trial, Mr Lee sat listening intently, supported by male and female friends. The public gallery of courtroom number 12 in the large Laganside complex was almost packed to capacity with Christian campaigners as well as gay rights activists. Mr McArthur the younger has previously accused the commission of pursuing his family because of their belief marriage should only be between man and woman. Speaking ahead of the case, which began yesterday, Mr McArthur said he had been 'humbled' by the level of support from Christians worldwide and was putting his faith in God. Ashers Bakery, which employs around 80 people, has been backed by the Christian Institute lobby group, which has arranged public meetings and garnered financial backing for the legal action. Same-sex marriage remains a contentious issue in Northern Ireland and attempts to have it legalised have been repeatedly rejected by the devolved Assembly at Stormont. The cake row has prompted a proposal to include a so-called 'conscience clause' in equality legislation. The Democratic Unionist Party, whose MLA Paul Givan is bringing forward the Private Members' Bill, says businesses should have the right to refuse to provide services they believe could compromise their religious beliefs. However, Sinn Fein has vowed to veto the move. The hearing continues.","The owner of a Christian bakery refused to make a pro-gay marriage cake .

"They are popular with the likes of Boris Johnson and Beyonce. But selfie sticks, the extendable rods used by people to take photographs of themselves with mobile phones, have now been banned in the National Gallery. The move follows bans in galleries in France and America – including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The National Gallery has banned selfie sticks - extendable rods used by people to take photographs of themselves. The British Museum (pictured, visitors taking a snap with the Elgin Marbles) is revising its policy . The National Gallery, which allowed cameras for the first time last year, is expelling the gadgets because they fall under the category of ‘tripods’, which are already prohibited. Esther Saunders-Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the gallery, said: 'Photography is allowed for personal, non-commercial purposes in the National Gallery – however there are a few exceptions in order to protect paintings, copyright of loans, individual privacy and the overall visitor experience. Therefore the use of flash and tripods is not permitted. 'Our gallery assistants and visitor facing staff are fully briefed and instructed to ensure we are striking the correct balance between visitor experience and the security and safety of works on display. 'Therefore they will use their discretion on a case by case basis in preventing photography which puts the safety of the collection at risk or obstructs other visitors.' Paul Reynolds visited the National Gallery in London on December 31 and took this selfie. Writing on Twitter, he said: 'So I went to London's National Gallery and there was selfie sticks everywhere' While Katie Morais, from the British Museum, said: 'Visitors to the British Museum are permitted to take photographs in public areas, not including temporary exhibitions, for non-commercial purposes. 'The museum is currently reviewing its policy on the use of ""selfie-sticks"" and other apparatus within the museum grounds. 'The safety of objects and visitors is paramount to the British Museum and staff will politely inform visitors if the use of any equipment is endangering objects or other people on site.' Marta Valentini visited the National Gallery last month and went for a selfie with Van Gogh's famous 'Sunflowers' painting . Selfie sticks are currently allowed at the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate and the Victoria and Albert Museum in Kensington. A spokesperson from the National Portrait Gallery said: 'It is important that all our visitors enjoy their experience at the gallery and anything that may prove disruptive is reviewed on an ongoing basis.' Nina Sandhaus from the Victoria and Albert Museum, said: 'Visitors to the V&A are currently permitted to use selfie sticks in line with the museum’s general policy on photographing and filming with a hand-held camera for personal use.' The rods were one of the most popular Christmas gifts last year and Boris Johnson, Beyonce and Barack Obama - who used one during a video promotion at the White House - are among those seen with the devices. Tottenham Hotspur banned selfie sticks from White Hart Lane after a complaint from a fan, while they have also been barred at a number of galleries and museums in the US and France. The online Collins dictionary describes a selfie stick as 'an elongated stick to which you attach a camera or mobile phone to take a better photo'. Art critic Brian Sewell told The Times: ‘If the Americans and French were banning them, the UK should join in. They are possibly quite dangerous to the art work and cause appalling crowding around a painting. ‘Anyone who actually wants to go and see a painting can’t because people are too busy taking photos. I’ve seen things in the National Gallery which make my hair stand on end.’ Even Mar Dixon, 44, who organises an event which encourages youngsters to take a selfie in front of famous pieces of art, says the ban is a good idea. She branded the tools 'damaging' to precious works, and said they get in everyone's way. Visitors to the National Gallery backed the ban today, including, Morny Davison, who was waiting for the Inventing Impressionism exhibition to open. Pier Paolo Calore took this selfie of himself with one of the hundreds of paintings at the National Gallery . This couple (left) also took a selfie with the world famous painting while these girls (right) took a generic selfie in the National Gallery during their visit . She said: 'It is an interference in what one hopes is a reasonably calm experience looking at great pictures.' Another woman, who did not wish to be named, said art lovers would be 'thrilled' by the ban. 'It’s becoming impossible to see pictures,' she said. 'First there’s people with cameras then there’s cameras with sticks. They should have been banned some time ago.'

"Millions of patients will have access to a full range of hospital services seven days a week by 2020, David Cameron will pledge today . Millions of patients will have access to a full range of hospital services seven days a week by 2020, David Cameron will pledge today. Consultant-level care and scans will be offered every day to end the scandal of poor out-of-hours treatment. The Prime Minister will admit that Britons are ‘more likely to die’ if they turn up at weekends and outline plans to use £2billion to fund the move in England. His announcement ensures that the two main parties will now go head-to-head on the NHS at the start of the general election campaign. But Labour said the Conservatives had promised a seven-day NHS before the last election and failed to deliver it. And there were doubts about whether the commitment could be met without injecting billions of pounds or higher bills for agency staff and locums. The Prime Minister will insist that maintaining funding for public services is only possible with a strong economy, urging voters to stick to the Tories’ ‘long-term economic plan’. His reforms would be rolled out step by step, starting with emergency and urgent care and support services such as scans. Some hospitals are already providing services at the weekend. Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, rated outstanding by watchdogs, offers consultant-led emergency care from 8am to midnight, seven days a week. Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Trust offers services such as CT scans on weekday evenings and from 9am to 5pm at the weekend. At Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, an increase in consultants on weekend duty saw a 34 per cent rise in patients being discharged the same or the following day. In his speech at the Conservative spring conference in Manchester today, the Prime Minister will say: ‘For years it’s been too hard to access the NHS out of hours. ‘But illness doesn’t respect working hours. Heart attacks, major accidents, babies – these things don’t just come from 9 to 5. ‘And the truth is that you are actually more likely to die if you turn up at the hospital at the weekend. Some of the resources are not up and running. The key decision-makers aren’t always there. ‘With a future Conservative government, we would have a truly seven-day NHS.’ Scroll down for video . Consultant-level care and scans will be offered every day to end the scandal of poor out-of-hours treatment . Experts say weekend services are vital to cope with an ageing society. Studies also show that death rates among patients admitted on a Sunday are 16 per cent higher than for those admitted on a Wednesday. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS Medical Director, said it was ‘inefficient’ for diagnostic machines and pathology laboratories to lie dormant at weekends while access is ‘dogged by waiting lists’. Professor Sir Norman Williams, former president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said the planned reform could ‘transform the quality of care’ at the weekend. But Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said Mr Cameron was making the same promise he did five years ago. ‘It is typical of the brass neck of a man who thinks he can take the public for mugs,’ he added. And Dr Mark Porter, of the British Medical Association, called it ‘shameless political game-playing’ ahead of the election. He added: ‘It will, for example, take much longer than five years to train the extra doctors needed, and without a considerable increase in staff and resources, weekday services might face being scaled back, affecting patient care.’ Ed Miliband yesterday pledged to cap the profits of private firms providing NHS care. Kicking off his election campaign at the site of the 2012 London Olympics, he said Labour would halt what he called a ‘tide of privatisation’ in the NHS. Firms brought in to provide free treatment to patients would be hit with a five per cent profit cap, he said. But last night a former Labour health minister accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care. Ed Miliband yesterday pledged to cap the profits of private firms providing NHS care, bringing in a five per cent profit cap . Mr Miliband said yesterday that another five years of Conservative government would mean ‘the disintegration of our public services’. ‘We’ll scrap David Cameron’s market framework for the NHS and stop the tide of privatisation,’ he said. ‘The NHS will be the preferred provider. No company working with the NHS will be able to profit by cherry-picking: rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs. ‘We will cap the profits that private health companies can make from our NHS. ‘The standard rule will be a five per cent cap. The money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care, not for excess profits for private firms.’ Labour said the profit cap would apply to all NHS contracts worth £500,000 or more. Any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the NHS for any returns above that level. Local NHS commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances and the cap would not apply to GPs, pharmacies or dentists. Critics accuse Labour of hypocrisy, since expenditure on NHS services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before, when the party was in power. Lord Warner, a Labour health minister between 2003 and 2007, said the NHS could not survive without private sector providers, particularly during spikes in demand, which occur most winters. He warned that Mr Miliband’s profit cap ran the risk of being a pre-election promise ‘which doesn’t stand up when confronted with the reality of government’. ‘It’s far from clear how you would implement it,’ he said. ‘A lot of the private sector is currently providing services to the NHS at standard NHS tariffs. Is that a profit? ‘If you want to scare people, you can scare people. But all the work that was done in the Blair government on choice and competition showed that people didn’t have concerns on whether work was done by the private or public sector. What they were concerned with was whether they would have to pay and was their care safe.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We all know Labour want to “weaponise” the NHS but this is another policy from Ed Miliband that looks ill-thought through.’ Score of viewers complained of bias against Ed Miliband in Thursday’s TV election interviews. Regulator Ofcom received 250 gripes about his treatment at the hands of hosts Kay Burley and Jeremy Paxman. Channel 4, which hosted the show with Sky, said it received around 300 complaints, while Labour insiders said Miss Burley was too ‘aggressive’.","Hospital services will be available seven days a week under new plans .

The findings will be used to influence the work of charities which use gardening as therapy for those with disabilities. TV gardener David Domoney of ITV show Love Your Garden, who is designing the Chelsea project, said: ‘It’s amazing how much sense of well-being and happiness the sight of a plant can bring. ‘We’re hoping to identify the best-loved plant, be it the sight of red roses on Valentines, a field of sunflowers or even the magic of a Christmas tree. Plants lift our hearts just by the sight of them. We think there will be real differences between age groups and gender. It’s a fascinating experiment and a real talking point.’ The exhibit, which is being run with gardening charity Thrive and the Horticultural Trades Association, will feature 20 popular plants chosen by an online survey. Cameras will monitor eye contact, physical gestures and facial emotions to gauge visitor reaction to each plant. It is hoped the results will determine which varieties of plants make people the happiest, according to their age and gender. Above, daffodil 'Georgie Boy' named after Prince George . Doctors have long known of the impact of gardening on health. Last November a Government health adviser even suggested that doctors should start prescribing gardening courses on the NHS. Dr William Bird, who advises Public Health England on physical activity, claimed every £1 spent on access to community outdoor schemes could save the health service £5 in other treatments. Dr Bird said: ‘We are programmed as humans to be hunter gatherers, to live outdoors, we are not really adapted to urban life. A dose of green space, really connecting people back to nature, can make a huge difference. ‘Blood pressure reduces, muscle tension reduces, all of these happen within moments of going into a park or a garden. Even indoor plants have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mental health.’ To vote for your favourite ‘happy plants’, visit http://www.daviddomoney.com/happy-plant-top-100/ .","Experiment will be carried out at the Chelsea Flower Show in May .

"At 18 years old, Christie Swadling's biggest concern should be her subject quota at university. But instead she is battling an ongoing eating disorder and advocating a healthy diet to other young sufferers. 'Photoshopped adverts of models like Miranda Kerr definitely started off my body image issues because you think that's how you're meant to be,' Christie told Daily Mail Australia. 'I became skinnier than those models and because of my disease, stopped thinking about the models altogether and became obsessed with just losing more and more weight.' The social media motivator has had over 630,000 views on her 'Anorexia Nervosa nearly killed me' video on YouTube and has more than 8,000 followers on Instagram, illustrating her arduous journey from anorexia to finally gaining weight and then her changing her relationship with food. Scroll down for video . Christie's weight dwindled to just 31 kilograms before she was hospitalised and then began to gain weight . As a young girl, Christie was bullied for being 'chubby' and told to 'go back to Maccas' Christie wants to tell her story to others in order to motivate them to improve their quality of life . She collapsed due to malnutrition on her 17th birthday and was in and out of hospital constantly . Christie's struggle began in primary school when she was bullied for being 'chubby' due to her unhealthy diet. 'My family never had a healthy diet, I was always the kid that everyone was jealous of as I had the chocolate, the chips, the McDonald's,' she said. 'I got chubby at a young age and was bigger than all my friends.' The teenager from East Gosford, New South Wales, about an hour and half north of Sydney, was mocked for her weight and called names like 'thick' and was constantly told by high school bullies to 'go back to Maccas.' It was at this time that Christie began to exercise. She had no energy and a terrible relationship with food and even stopped being able to get out of bed . Christie is pictured here (left) at one of her thinnest points but she is now on the mend and has gained over ten kgs (right) 'I was eating next to nothing, maybe two meals less than 300 calories and there was a devil in my head telling me to be skinny constantly,' she said . Motivated by her healthy, soccer-playing dad, she began to play different sports and found happiness there. It wasn't until severe dieting began that Christie ran into trouble and she lost the ability to walk and became bed-ridden. 'It became a problem when I lost a lot of weight - 13 kilogram, I realised I was smaller than Miranda and one moment I liked it and then I didn't like it at all. Her weight dwindled down to nearly 30 kilograms and she lost all energy . 'I was eating next to nothing, maybe two meals less than 300 calories and there was a devil in my head telling me to be skinny constantly.'

Christie has 8000 followers on Instagram and posts images of the healthy meals she consumes . She is now doing yoga and pilates to build her strength after being so weak during the peak her illness . In her new Youtube video, Christie shows what she now consumes during the day . Her family did not notice her internal battle until it began to show physically, prompting her  mother to take her to a doctor. 'I ticked some boxes and they said: 'OK, you have an eating disorder', so they gave me some tips and told me to come back in three months,' Christie said. Christie got steadily worse after her diagnosis and was admitted to hospital where again her condition stabilised and she was released. It wasn't until she was admitted to hospital for the third time after she collapsed on her 17th birthday that she began to change her thoughts toward food and started eating properly. A happier and healthier Christie now enjoys her time with her family and friends and does not worry as much about her body image . Christie aims to help others by advocating a healthy lifestyle on her Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and blog . Now improving, the NSW-based teen hopes to help others with same battle . 'I looked in the mirror and felt disgusted at what I saw and became aware that I was slowly killing myself,' she said. 'I just started eating and eating and eating, it was that easy.' Christie now follows the '80 10 10 ' raw food diet and is inspired by social media health motivators like 'Freelee the Banana girl' and Loni Jane. She is back to exercising and is keen to improve her strength and flexibility through yoga and pilates whilst documenting her ongoing journey to her followers.

"Only 48 per cent now back the death penalty for ‘some crimes’, down from 54 per cent in 2013, according to a NatCen British Social Attitudes study. Public support for the death penalty has fallen below 50 per cent, a survey has found. Only 48 per cent now back the death penalty for ‘some crimes’, down from 54 per cent in 2013, according to a NatCen British Social Attitudes study. It is the first time that support has fallen below 50 per cent since NatCen began asking the public for its views on capital punishment in 1986. Support for the death penalty stood at 74 per cent in 1986 but had fallen to 59 per cent by 1998, according to the social research institute. The survey also found that at present Ukip voters are more likely to support the death penalty, with 75 per cent in favour. Rachel Ormston, co-head of social attitudes at NatCen, said: “The big change in public attitudes to the death penalty came in the 1990s at a time when attitudes to a range of other issues, like same-sex relationships and sex before marriage were also liberalising. “This more recent change is interesting because attitudes have stayed fairly steady for a number of years. “It could be the continuation of this liberalising trend or, perhaps, a response to the shocking botched executions in the United States that were widely reported in April and July of last year.” Clare Algar, executive director of the legal charity Reprieve, said: “This welcome finding finally debunks the myth that, given half the chance, the British people would vote to bring back hanging. “In fact, the trend is clear. Brits in increasing numbers agree that the death penalty has no place in a civilised society. The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah, America. Utah's governor signed a law that makes his state the only one to allow firing squads following botched lethal injections . “Capital punishment has little to do with justice or crime deterrence, and all countries, including the UK, should be working towards global abolition.” In one incident in the US last April, 38-year-old convicted murderer Clayton Lockett died 43 minutes after his lethal injection process began in Oklahoma. In July of that year, another controversial US execution took place involving convicted killer Joseph Wood, 55, who took two hours to die following the start of his lethal injection process at Florence State Prison in Arizona. The process should normally take around 10 minutes.","Only 48 per cent back capital punishment down from 54 per cent in 2013 .

"The name you use to refer to the Islamic State terror group can reveal whether you are a supporter or opponent of the jihadi organisation, according to a new study. Research has revealed those who call the organisation as 'Islamic State' overwhelmingly support it, while those who refer to it by its abbreviated name, ISIS, are mostly opposed to it. Not only does it reveal an individual's ISIS leanings, but researchers were also able to develop a model which accurately predicted future support of the terrorists. Those who refer to the jihadi group by its full name 'Islamic State' overwhelmingly support it, while those who call it 'ISIS' mostly oppose it, researchers have revealed . This was only made possible due to ISIS's widespread use of social media - unparalleled in modern conflicts - in attempting to recruit would-be jihadis from across the globe. The Qatari Computing Institute analysed 123million Arabic tweets by 57,000 Twitter users to reveal common traits among those in the pro or anti camps. The remarkable results showed 93 per cent of those referring to the group by its full name Islamic State were supporters, while 73 per cent calling it ISIS were opposed. The tweets used to determine support and opposition to the group were taken from mid-October to the end of December last year. During this time, former US Army Ranger Peter Kassig was beheaded, while the jihadis carried out numerous other atrocities against locals within their territory. Alarmingly, the results showed there was increasing support for the group on Twitter during the three month time period. The report stated: 'Anti-ISIS tweets generally peaked when news of ISIS human rights violations emerged such as the killing of hostages, accounts of torture, or reports of the enslavement of Yazidi women. 'On the other hand, pro-ISIS tweets generally peaked in conjunction with the release of propaganda videos and major military achievements.' They added: 'It seems that the top interests of both groups are rather different, except for one incident when an ISIS affiliate group attacked the Egyptian Army in Sinai.' ISIS brutality, according to the study, tended to galvanise opposition against the group and it was 'unclear' if it was effective recruitment tool. The researchers then looked further ahead. Using those accounts identified as pro or anti-ISIS according to how they referred to the group, they could determine - with 87 per cent accuracy - who was likely to become a supporter in future based on their use of hashtags from four years' previous. Hashtags relating to the Arab Spring, or ongoing conflicts within the Muslim world, showed those who were opposed to overturned political leaders were more likely to become ISIS supporters. 'Looking at discriminating hashtags suggested that a major source of support for ISIS stems from frustration with the missteps of the Arab Spring,' researchers concluded. 'As for opposition to ISIS, it is linked with support for other rebel groups, mostly in Syria, that have been targeted by ISIS, support for existing Middle Eastern regimes, and Shia sectarianism.' Researchers also revealed the ranked locations of the most pro and anti-ISIS tweets. In first place, for both those expressing support and opposition to the militants, was Saudi Arabia, where the militants self-proclaimed capital in Raqqa is based. All the top 10 locations were confined to the Middle East and north Africa, with the exception of Britain, which placed 7th on the rankings of most anti-ISIS sentiment. Saudi Arabia, followed by Iraq and Syria, were the top three countries identified as hotbeds of pro-ISIS Twitter users . Anti-ISIS tweets came from similar countries to those of a supportive nature. However, none of the north African countries made the list, while Kuwait came second and the United Kingdom was ranked seventh .","Those who refer to the group as 'Islamic State' are likely to be supporters .

"Children who are are older when they start school may do well academically and socially in the short-term - but are more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes as teenagers. A team of US researchers studied the impact that starting kindergarten has on children born 60 days before, and 60 days after the cut-off start date. And they found these negative outcomes are significantly more likely for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Children who are are older when they start kindergarten (a stock image is shown) are more likely to do well academically and socially in the short-term, but are also more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes when they are teenagers, a new study has claimed . Philip Cook, a professor in Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy and lead author of the study, said: ‘This research provides the first compelling evidence of a causal link between dropout and crime. ‘It supports the view that crime outcomes should be considered in evaluating school reforms. ‘Dropouts are greatly over-represented in prison, so we know there is a strong association between dropping out and crime. ‘But to establish causation requires an experiment. My analysis takes advantage of nature's experiment associated with birth date.’ Professor Cook and Songman Kang of Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea carried out the research, published in American Economic Journal-Applied Economics. It is said to be the first study to link dropping out of school, and crime. The study compared North Carolina public school students born 60 days before, and 60 days after the school cut-off date. At the time of the study, children in the state had to turn five by October 16 to be eligible to enter kindergarten that year. Old-for-grade students are more likely to be convicted of a crime before age 20, the study said. A stock image of a young drink driver is shown . Children typically attend kindergarten when they are five or six year's old. Previous studies have established that children born just after the school-entry cut-off date and are ‘old for grade,’ perform better academically than their younger classmates. This has led to some parents trying to gain an academic advantage for children whose birthdays fall shortly before the cut-off date, by enrolling them later. In addition to performing better academically, Professor Cook's study found old-for-grade students were one-third less likely to engage in delinquent behaviour while still in school. ‘Up until the 16th birthday, it is all positive,’ he said. ‘They are doing better, relative to their classmates, by every measure. 'It makes sense, because they are more mature.’ However, after the age of 16, the picture shifts. The old-for-grade students are more likely to drop out and be convicted of a crime before age 20, the study said. The explanation for the behavioural change lies in the age at which students may legally withdraw from school, which is 16 in North Carolina. ‘If they were born before the cut-off date, they have just 19 months between their 16th birthday and graduation to be tempted to drop out,’ he said. ‘If they were born just after and enter school later, they have 31 months, and for some of them, it is an irresistible temptation.’ ‘It's human nature,' Professor Cook said. ‘For a lot of adolescents, high school is a drag.’ Among the old-for-grade students, the likelihood of dropping out and being convicted of a serious crime is almost three-and-half times greater for those born to an unwed mother and just over two-and-a-half times greater for those whose mothers were high school dropouts.","Research looked at children starting kindergarten in North Carolina .

"A £14,000-a-year prep school attended by Prince Charles could be closed after it was found to be unsafe, and children were lagging behind in their mathematics and writing skills. Hill House Independent Junior School in Kensington in west London was rated 'inadequate' in every single category by Ofsted inspectors and its fate will now be decided by ministers who will review the report. An inspection of the exclusive  school, where alumni include Prince Charles and singer Lily Allen, criticised it for breaching health and safety measures as well as failing to ensure its young students make adequate progress. Hill House Independent Junior School was rated 'inadequate' in every single category by Ofsted inspectors . The former prep school attended by Prince Charles (pictured centre, introducing his mother, Queen Elizabeth to teachers) could be closed after Ofsted inspectors rated it 'inadequate' in all five areas . Hill House was also criticised for focusing on getting older pupils to practice entry tests for secondary schools at the expense of teaching them in depth about their subjects. The family run school, which is based at several houses in Kensington and Chelsea, has previously been described as 'eccentric' in the Good Schools Guide. It has almost 1,000 pupils who attend from the age of four to 11. The Department for Education said the next stage in the process is for ministers to review the report. A spokesman said 'all options' remained open, despite the school's independent status. This includes closure or helping leaders come up with an action plan to improve. Lily Allen is among the school's famous alumni . Among the criticisms leveled at the school by inspectors, who visited at the beginning of December last year, was the poor educational attainment by pupils. The report said: 'Too few pupils make adequate progress across the school, particularly in writing and mathematics. 'Leaders and proprietors do not have the capacity to secure essential improvements. They are not taking any action to secure effective teaching. They do not know if pupils are making the progress of which they are capable.' Behaviour and safety of pupils also achieved a blistering 'inadequate' rating by inspectors. While pupils were regarded as polite with 'excellent manners' and generally good behaviour, their safety was raised as a concern. Inspectors highlighted poor attention paid to health and safety. It said 'The safety of pupils and adults is compromised on some of the school sites. The report branded fire evacuation procedures 'flawed', with records lacking detail and staff lacking training to deal with problems. It said the supervision of children was sometimes 'lax' and some fire exits could be a hazard. Ofsted inspectors rated the school as 'inadequate' in each of the five categories of leadership and management; behaviour and safety of pupils; quality of teaching; achievement of pupils; early years provision. The prep school was ranked as inadequate in all five areas that were inspected by Ofsted in December . A spokesman from the Department for Education said: 'We have just received a copy of Ofsted's published report following an inspection at Hill House International Junior School. 'Ministers are studying that report and will confirm their decisions about regulatory action shortly. 'It would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied the findings, but all options remain open - including closure. Prince Charles is pictured fighting with Jim Dowdall while at the £14,000 a year preparatory school . The heir to the throne played circular cricket, one of the key activities of the school's field day . 'We have repeatedly demonstrated for all types of school that we will not hesitate to take tough action if required.' The school was founded in 1956 by the late Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Townend, and has been run by his son Richard for the last 13 years, supported by his wife. Hill House International Junior School was founded in London in 1951 by the late Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Townend. It is now run out of several houses in Kensington and Chelsea, and has a site in Switzerland. Five years later in 1956 Prince Charles went to the school - the first time an heir to the throne had attended a school outside the Royal household. The Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne visited the school for sports day in 1957. After his time at Hill House, Prince Charles was enrolled at Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire and later was moved to Gordonstoun in Scotland. Girls were first accepted into Hill House in 1981 and Lily Allen is a former pupil. The school offers trips to Switzerland as well as the chance to practice sport at the Duke of York’s Barracks in Chelsea. Pupils have gone on to win scholarships at a number of exclusive schools including Cheltenham Ladies' College, Eton and Harrow. Scholarships have also been awarded to pupils to study overseas including at St Mary’s Waverley in Johannesberg and New Canaan Country School, Connecticut. Hill House was founded in London in 1951 . While it offers trips to Switzerland and sports practice at the Duke of York’s Barracks in Chelsea, as well as compulsory swimming lessons, inspectors were less than encouraged by the way teachers ensure pupils make progress. The report said: 'Teachers do not routinely assess pupils’ progress in lessons. They do not ask searching questions to probe pupils’ understanding in order to adjust the activity and secure pupils’ better engagement and progress. It added: 'Older pupils do not learn in depth across a range of subjects. They spent much of their time practising test papers to secure a place in the school of their choice.' On its website the school lists a number of scholarships won by its pupils at exclusive schools including Cheltenham Ladies College, Harrow and Eton College. Inspectors also said that because the school measures pupils against its own system of attainment it is not possible to compare this with national achievement of children. Richard Townend, who now runs the school, has attacked the inspectors' findings, insisting that pupils attending the school are kept safe. In a letter to parents, he said : 'As I go around the school, I see happy children enjoying being at school, working hard and making great progress in a safe environment.' He added: 'We provide opportunities in art, music, drama and sport which others envy. 'Each Wednesday, the assembly astonishes visitors with its display of talent in our school and the feeling of corporate warmth, friendliness and support of the whole Hill House family - pupils, parents and tutors. These are things of the greatest value.' Mr Townend added: 'The school will explore in detail every criticism they have made and correct anything which needs attention'. The school has already asked the firm Capita to report on the school's health and safety standards and is holding a security audit. It was last inspected in December 2012, when it was rated 'good.' An emergency inspection last May, carried out at the request of the Department for Education, found the quality of education was effective but the school was failing to meet safety requirements, the Evening Standard reported.","Prince Charles previously attended Hill House Independent School, London .

"You wouldn't think you would find Australia's best bargain hunter 85 kilometres from the nearest shop. Ian Burnett, 46, has made an art of online shopping, securing deals on everything from Nintendo WII's to state of the art DVD recorders, for hundreds less than sold in retail. And he's happy to share his shopping tips. The biggest drawback? You'll have to spend hours on bargain sites, like CatchOfTheDay waiting for the best deals to appear. Ian Burnett from Jeparit Victoria has spent $28,000 over 8 years on CatchOfTheDay and has saved $10,000 . The father of four admits he has sat on the site for 12 hours straight before and spends a few hours on it a day . 'I've sat on the site for 12 straight hours before,' Ian told Daily Mail Australia. 'At 12 o'clock everyday, they release a new product... So you obviously have to be online for that.' Ian began using CatchOfTheDay in 2006 when they first started and were only releasing one product per day. 'They maybe had 1000 of the one product in stock and they'd just wait until it ran out,' he said. 'The first thing I bought was a Thompson DVD recorder and they were the awesome, expensive thing back then and I only paid $76.' His insider shopping tips include checking the site everyday after 12 for brand new bargain and signing up to their Facebook page to get exclusive deals. Ian's best bargain was a Nintendo WII that he purchased for his children, saving $300 off the retail price . His insider shopping tips include checking the site everyday after 12 for brand new bargain . He purchases gifts for his children, groceries and various household items from CatchOfTheDay . 'I also buy in bulk as they have a shipping cap,' he said. 'You can pick up 10 or 20 items and get them shipped for the same price as if you got one.' Ian also said he has paid for a yearly subscription to CatchOfTheDay free shipping before for $75 and for an avid shopper like him, that saves a lot. Comparing products to others sold at big retailers is also important according to Ian, as you can see how much is being saved. And for a father of four who works in a supermarket, he is very much in the know. Ian's proudest purchase was a Nintendo WII for his four children after they insisted it was all they wanted. He did not think he'd be able to fork out the $400 for one in retail so he used his skills to find one discounted to $99. 'I have also purchased a Tom Tom for $10 on a super bargain birthday sale,' he said. Ian has spent $28,000 in his eight years of using CatchOfTheDay and believes he has saved over $10,000. Ian's family have followed in his footsteps and are also crazy about finding online deals . Ian buys his products in bulk in order to save money on the shipping costs . 'The postie bringing it all to your door is so much easier than travelling to a shopping centre and spending hours looking for an item' His shopping tips include buying in bulk, signing up to Facebook and checking the websites everyday after 12 . Ian believes that even if he lived in a big city, he would still use online shopping due to its convenience . The 46-year-old father of four lives in Jeparit, 400 kilometres from Melbourne and the isolation means online shopping is Ian's only option. He not only purchases appliances and other household items, but also uses CatchOfTheDay to purchase his groceries too. 'I think that if I lived in a big city, I would still use online shopping,' Ian said. 'The postie bringing it all to your door is so much easier than travelling to a shopping centre and spending hours looking for an item.' Tragedy struck for the Burnett family last September when a spontaneous grass fire wiped out their Jeparit home, taking much of their online shopping haul with it. 'We tried to put it out, but our home was a 1985 federation style home made of old, dry wood so as soon as it hit, it went up in flames,' he said. Although still rebuilding their home, Ian is optimistic, especially in relation to his shopping. 'It just means I get to buy all this crazy stuff again!'","Ian Burnett lives 400 kms from Melbourne in a small isolated town .

"Robert Durst's enigmatic second wife is the 'mastermind' who controls the couple's real estate fortune, according to anonymous sources. Debra Charatan, 58, married the 71-year-old in 2000 and sources have claimed she 'knew things were going to blow up before he was arrested' last weekend. Charatan, a powerful real estate agent in Manhattan, is also understood to manage Durst's estimated $65 million fortune. Real estate millionaire Durst was arrested last Saturday in New Orleans for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman. Scroll down for video . Married: Debra Charatan (left) married Robert Durst (right) in 2000 and a source has described their relationship as 'extremely businesslike' Durst has been charged with murder in a Los Angeles killing 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas. His arrest came shortly before the finale of the HBO series 'The Jinx' which detailed his links to the three killings. The source told the New York Post that Charatan had allegedly arranged to fly Durst to Cuba ahead of his arrest and said: 'She knew stuff was coming down. 'She's very, very smart. Any time he's in trouble, she's leaving and going to these places. 'She's extremely cunning. People call her a shark.' Last night, Durst was moved to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, a jail equipped to deal with the mentally ill, an Orleans Parish Sheriff's spokesman said. In one episode of 'The Jinx', one interviewee said: 'A lot of people believe Debbie knows Bob's secrets, whatever they may be.' The source went on to describe Charatan and Durst's relationship as 'very businesslike' and said: 'He asks her opinion on things, and she tells him the truth.' They added: 'While the documentary was ongoing, she was acting like everything was fine. Only now is she's realizing that a volcano is about to erupt and it will be a real s**t show,' Arrested: Durst is pictured being transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on Tuesday . Sources have also claimed that Charatan 'knew a lot of stuff' about Durst when she married him in 2000. The pair had been close friends for years before that - even before Durst's first wife, Kathie, vanished in 1982. It is believed they first met in dated in 1988 and briefly lived together in 1990 before separating. The couple were married in December 2000 — a month after Durst discovered that authorities were reopening their probe into his first wife's disappearance. As his wife, Charatan gained spousal privilege, which meant she would not have to testify against him. Moved: Last night, Durst was moved to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, a jail equipped to deal with the mentally ill, an Orleans Parish Sheriff's spokesman said. Durst was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. A California police department is also interested in speaking with the law enforcement agencies that have investigated Durst in connection with a teenage girl who went missing in the late 90s, reported NBC News. Executed: Susan Berman was found shot outside her home in LA in 2000. Her friend, Robert Durst was charged with her murder on Monday . Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills has said that he would like to talk to investigators who have dug into Durst's past in connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997. In the documentary 'The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst', Durst mumbled about how he 'killed them all,' providing a dramatic finale to the series. Durst appears to confess to killing multiple people when he thinks the audio on his microphone is off. But Los Angeles Police have insisted his arrest has nothing to do with the recording or the screening of the documentary. Yesterday, authorities removed two boxes after searching the Houston home of Durst. A marked police car and three unmarked cars were in front of a 17-story building in Houston's Rice Village neighborhood where Durst has three condominiums. At least five plainclothes officers were working inside the guarded building. Two officers were seen walking to a nearby unmarked car, retrieving a small bag from the trunk and returning to the building. Dick DeGuerin, Durst's defence attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condominium building. He said: 'I think it's a publicity stunt. I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value.' Missing: Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack (pictured left),  has been missing since 1982. Her brother, Jim McCormack, said that following the HBO show he hoped Durst would have an 'epiphany of conscience' and tell them what happened to his sister .","Debra Charatan married the millionaire in 2000 in a 'secret wedding'

"Former NFL star Darren Sharper is accused of making two women drink a mystery concoction spiked with drugs before raping them in his hotel room, according to police reports. The Super Bowl-winning safety is said to have met the victims at separate parties in Los Angeles in November and January before inviting them back to his hotel so he could 'pick something up before heading to another venue. Instead when they got to the rooms, the 39-year-old then insisted they take a drink, which caused them to black out, and allegedly attacked them, according to the LA Times.

Another friend, who had passed out in the hotel living room having also taken some of the drink, then knocked on the door prompting Sharper to shout 'Hold On', the Times reported. The five-time Pro-Bowl started then got off and the victim got dressed and left. A similar report states how a woman met Sharper at a party in the Hollywood Hills on January 15, 2014. She told detectives the athlete, who played in the NFL for 14 seasons, offered to share a taxi with her to an after party.

After 10 minutes of drinking, the pair allegedly blacked out and woke up the following morning on a pull-out bed in the hotel room. Documents seen by the Times said one of the women felt a 'pain in her vagina' while the other could not 'remember anything' from the night before.

"Mobile phone bills should begin to fall after a watchdog ordered telecoms companies to slash the cost of calling another network. For years, mobile users have faced extra charges for so-called 'cross-network' calls to friends, family and colleagues who have a different provider. The charges, known as the 'mobile termination rate', is passed on to the customer who made the call, but also affect calls made from landline operators such as BT and TalkTalk. For years, mobile users have faced extra charges for so-called 'cross-network' calls to friends, family and colleagues who have a different provider . At the moment, these charges add 0.826 pence a minute to the usual cost of calls. However, Ofcom said yesterday that operators must slash them by more than 40 per cent over the next two years. By April 2017, mobile companies will be allowed to only charge 0.475 pence per minute extra. Matthew Howett, a telecoms analyst at Ovum, said: 'This is a good thing for the consumer. The main benefit will be to customers making calls from a fixed line, where fees are stubbornly high… so it is particularly good for the elderly.' Ofcom research has shown that older customers tend to use landlines much more than younger people. According to official figures, the vast majority of the population – 93 per cent – owns a mobile, and around three-quarters have both a landline and a mobile. Last year, around 16 per cent of adults in the UK relied solely on their mobile, and did not have a landline at all. Mobile operators have spent years lobbying to keep the mobile termination rate in place, helping to fatten their profits. The rates have been steadily reduced since the 1990s, when they were as high as 25p per minute, as mobile technology became more efficient and costs to the networks fell. However, yesterday the network operators expressed disappointment over Ofcom's decision to cut them further, and issued a veiled threat they could increase other charges to make up for the reduction. Last year, around 16 per cent of adults in the UK relied solely on their mobile, and did not have a landline . A spokesman for EE said: 'The proposed implementation puts at risk future investments and our ability to offer customers the lowest possible prices.' A telecoms source said that mobile phone companies would not be able to offer the same level of service if they do not get as much income from customers. Operators would face a choice to either allow the standards of their network and customer services to slip, or to recoup the money they have lost by increasing charges elsewhere. A spokesman for O2 added: 'There's no such thing as a free lunch. Mobile operators invest billions of pounds in their networks. The cost of handling calls from other operators comes at a cost and needs to be recovered from those operators.' Mr Howett said: 'The charges are based on the old-world of ancient switch networks. [It is time to ask] whether the system is still relevant'. Mobile operators, however, said they were pleased that Ofcom has given them two years to reduce the charges, as they had feared they would have to slash them overnight. David Hickson, of the consumer campaign group, Fair Telecoms, predicted that Ofcom would continue slashing the charges for cross-network calls. 'Landline users have effectively been subsidising mobile users for years. That has to go away,' he said. Mr Howett added that Ofcom would keep pressure on mobile companies to pass as much of the savings as possible to customers.","Ofcom ordered telecoms companies to cut cost of calling another network .

"They are seen by many as uncomfortable relics from the Victorian age. But it seems corsets are undergoing a revival – as well as the hourglass figures they create. One leading retailer, What Katie Did, which specialises in the garment, said it had seen sales grow by half in the last three months. Online retailer eBay also boasted of a 54 per cent surge in modern corset sales since December. Scroll down for video . Reality TV star Kim Kardashian posted a picture of herself wearing a corset in October, sparking a trend . What Katie Did founder Katie Thomas said she believes part of the rise in popularity is down to reality television star Kim Kardashian 'with her tiny waist and big hips'. Miss Kardashian posted a picture of herself wearing a corset on her Instagram page in October last year with the hashtag 'waist training'. Mrs Thomas said: 'It's more about being confident, powerful and being in control while looking good as well. It has absolutely nothing to do with men at all.' She added: 'This year is a peak year and the last peak year was 1955; before that it was 1895.' More recently, actress Lily James has shown off a tiny corseted waist in pictures for the Disney film Cinderella. Actress Lily James, 25, wears a pale blue ball gown, which goes in at the waist before billowing out . In pictures released ahead of the film, which will be shown in cinemas later this month, actress Lily James came under fire for her tiny waist. In the film, Miss James, 25, wears a pale blue ball gown, which goes in at the waist before billowing out. Rather than an extreme diet, Miss James, who rose to fame in television series Downton Abbey, revealed that her slimline figure was created by a corset. Speaking to American entertainment website E! Miss James told of how she had been restrained to a liquid diet in order to fit into the contraption. She said: 'If you ate food it didn't really digest properly, and I'd be burping all afternoon […] and it was just really sort of unpleasant. 'I'd have soup so that I could still eat but it wouldn't get stuck.' In an interview with The Huffington Post, Miss James added: 'I'm very healthy and I always have been. 'The costume is beautifully designed; it goes in at the waist and the skirt is big and full and accentuates the shape. I felt like a princess in it. Corsets are always hard to wear.' Miss James said she had been restrained to a liquid diet in order to fit into the tight-fitting corset . Madonna (left) sported a risque custom-made Givenchy corset at The Grammy Awards last month, while Kylie Minogue (right) wore a scarlet bodice during a performance in Australia last night . Costume designer Sandy Powell said that getting Miss James into the corset took up to 10 minutes. In an interview with fashion magazine ELLE, she said of the corset: 'Of course it feels different from wearing a T-shirt—it's restrictive. 'If the corset is made well by a proper corset-maker and fit to the exact measurements of the person wearing it, there should be no pain whatsoever. You put it on, it feels tight, and eventually it loosens up and molds itself to your body.' Stars including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Madonna have also been photographed in corsets. Actress Cate Blanchett, who was awarded a BAFTA for her portrayal of the queen in 1988 film Elizabeth I said of her costume: 'I'm one of those strange beasts who really likes a corset.' Yet now the type of underwear, which can reduce waist size by up to four inches, has also soared in popularity with normal women. Corsets are also being used by some as a weight loss technique. One online business The Corset Diet, claims that wearing a corset, which comes with a pricetag starting at £55, can help shed weight 'within weeks'. Yet critics of the corset warn that the garment can damage muscles and affect breathing. If too tight, a corset could bruise the kidneys and liver, experts have warned.","One leading retailer - What Katie Did - reported sales boom in three months .

"A mother is counting her blessings after surviving a bite from one of the most venomous snakes in the world. Yvonne Lorch was trying to move an eastern brown snake away from her cat, who was toying with it in the living room of her southeast Queensland home, when the deadly serpent lashed out and bit her hand on Wednesday afternoon. Unaware of the danger, she took it across to the next-door neighbour’s house, who insisted she call an ambulance and find out what breed of snake it was. When ambulance staff arrived they said it was a non-venomous python or tree-snake, but Ms Lorch's daughter Lisa Hetherington resolved to get a second opinion, messaging local snake catcher Richie Gilbert an image of the snake.

I wanted to make sure so I contacted an expert,’ Ms Everington told Daily Mail Australia. The snake catcher quickly called back to clarify it was in fact an eastern brown snake, the second most venomous serpent in the world. ‘We were in the hospital when he called. It was quite a shock, mum was pretty shaken,’ she said. But a stroke of luck meant the snake had inflicted a dry bite, meaning it didn’t inject any venom. ‘She definitely feels pretty blessed. It just goes to show it never hurts to get a second opinion,’ said Ms Everington. Ms Lorch tried to remove the snake from her living room when the deadly serpent lashed out and bit her finger . Yvonne’s daughter Lisa Everrington decided to double check with local snake catcher Richie Gilbert if the snake was a venomous species .

"Felicity Bassouls, 67,  is accused of harassing former England winger Ben Cohen after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year . England rugby and Strictly star Ben Cohen is to give evidence against his mother-in-law, who is accused of bombarding him with emails and calls after he split from his wife amid rumours of an affair. Felicity Bassouls, 67, who lives in the Highlands of Scotland, is accused of harassing the former England winger after he split from her daughter Abby in September last year. The World Cup winner, 36, was facing accusations that his marriage was ended by the 'curse' of the BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing. He had starred on the 2013 programme with Kristina Rihanoff, but denied they had a relationship. On Facebook he wrote: 'It is a sad world when two adults cannot have a friendship.'

"A restroom at a Wal-Mart in eastern Indiana has been closed indefinitely after an employee discovered a working meth lab inside. State police say a Wal-Mart employee alerted police after seeing a man he described as suspicious enter the restroom about 11:30 pm Thursday with a backpack and then leave without it. Police were called, and determined that inside the backpack were items that constituted a miniature meth lab, with chemicals used to 'cook' the drug were being mixed in containers. State police say people who make methamphetamine are leaving 'the deadly explosive chemicals in public places to return later to get the finished product,' rather than risk explosions and contamination at their own homes. Scroll down for video . Scene: An employee of the Walmart at 1501 E. 29th St. in Muncie alerted police officers to a backpack that had been left in this restroom, which was being used to mix dangerous chemicals to make methamphetamine . The incident occurred at the Wal-Mart in Muncie, Indianapolis, late on Thursday night . The discovery of such 'labs' are becoming routine for authorities. The fastest way to make meth is referred to as 'shake and bake', where the chemicals are mixed in two liter bottles, and later cooked in the oven until it crystallizes. However mixing the chemicals runs a huge risk of explosion, with the blast of one bottle capable of killing someone. The Star Press reports that members of a state police meth suppression team removed the dangerous chemicals. Delaware County Health Department inspectors closed the restroom and a nearby women's restroom until they could be 'decontaminated' by a professional cleaning company. An investigation into who left the backpack in the restroom is now under way. Brian Nick, director of National Media Relations for Walmart, said the store's surveillance video was being provided to police for that probe.

"Teaching assistant Emma Webb, 44, from Bracknell, Berkshire, had sex with two teenagers at her home and in her car in a 'disgraceful' abuse of power . A married teaching assistant who got two schoolboys to skip lessons to have sex with her has avoided prison because she had already served time for having affairs with five other pupils. Mother-of-two Emma Webb had sex with the boys at home while her husband was out, and performed a sex act on one of them in an empty maths classroom. The 44-year-old also lured the ‘inexperienced’ boys, then aged 15 and 16, into her car for sex in a ‘disgraceful’ abuse of her position, a court heard. The blonde began a fling with the 16-year-old after being assigned as his support worker following the death of his brother. In a text message, she told him: ‘If I was younger I’d be the girl for you.’ She then offered him a lift home and touched him while they were struck in traffic, before driving to a deserted car park and performing a sex act on him. Prosecutor Michael Roques told a judge at Reading Crown Court how Webb also began a fling with the 15-year-old after sending him ‘flirty’ texts. After luring him into the maths room and performing a sex act on him, she invited the schoolboy to her home for sex while her husband was at work. The court heard how, on another occasion, she drove the youngster to a secluded area of woodland, where they had sex in the back of her car. The judge, Recorder John Gallagher, heard how the boy had been reluctant to report the affair because he feared reprisals from Webb’s husband, who was a karate black belt. Webb wept as she was told she would not go to jail for the flings, which came to light following her suspension from the school. In 2012, she was jailed for 32 months after admitting to affairs with five other pupils at the same Berkshire school, which cannot be named for legal reasons. Her barrister Lucy Tapper told the court that Webb was now in a relationship with another man. Miss Tapper added: ‘She’s somebody who is determined to put these incidents behind her and is determined to move on with her life.’ Judge Gallagher told Webb that she was only avoiding prison because she had already been punished for offences that had taken place at the same time. He said: ‘You disgracefully abused your position of trust. ‘I accept that you had your own problems but the truth is that ultimately it was for your own gratification and you ignored the needs of these two boys.’ But Webb was spared jail at Reading Crown Court (pictured) because she has already served time in jail for after admitting 30 offences involving five other pupils, which took place at the school at the same time . He told Webb the 15-year-old’s grades had deteriorated because she encouraged him to skip lessons for sex, adding: ‘It undoubtedly affected his schooling and the reality is you abused his innocence, because he had no previous sexual experience.’ Judge Gallagher said the 16-year-old had also been badly affected by her behaviour. He added: ‘You were specifically his mentor. ‘A mentor is somebody who is meant to be getting a young person into the right way of behaving and the right way of treating others. What you did was precisely the opposite. ‘The fact is this is your last chance, there can be no more of this.’ Webb, of Bracknell, Berkshire, admitted 12 counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust and was handed a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. She was also given a two-year supervision order.","Emma Webb had unprotected sex with boys in 'disgraceful' abuse of power .

"After handing her teacher a 'sick note' to skip the day's PE lesson - Olivia McEvoy thought she had pulled off the perfect crime. But unbeknown to the 11-year-old, her mother Samantha had made no mention of her phony 'bad leg' as instructed, instead diagnosing her daughter with 'bone-idle-itus' and suggesting she be given 'a few extra laps'.

It was accompanied with the comment: 'Well here you go Olivia here's your note for PE, it will be sealed & in an envelope ready for her to hand to the head in the morning.' The Year six pupil unwittingly limped into class at St John's C of E Primary school in Sandbach, Cheshire, citing that she had a bad leg and even giggled to friends that she had got out of PE. The joke was revealed when the headmaster - who was in on the plan - read the letter and called Olivia into his study where he told her: 'There are things in life we don't enjoy but have to do them.' Foiled: The Year 6 pupil, pictured with her father Wayne and brother Kaylan (right), unwittingly limped into class at St John's C of E Primary school in Sandbach, Cheshire, citing that she had a bad leg . Olivia then discovered her PE kit had already been dropped off at reception after her scaffolder father Wayne, 34, had secretly given it to a classmate's mother who was taking them to school that day. Ms McEvoy said: 'Unfortunately she didn't have to do the extra laps but she actually really enjoyed PE and had a good lesson. But she wasn't speaking to me at all - not for the rest of the night. 'When she got picked up by Wayne she had a face like thunder. She didn't speak to him. It was parents evening that night and all the teachers thought it was hilarious. 'It was like an episode of Absolutely Fabulous, I call her Saffy because she is so clever and sensible. When she came home she said, ""mum I do not know why you think it's so funny"" which made it all the more amusing. 'We couldn't stop giggling when we wrote the letter. We had to search the house top to bottom for an envelope to keep the plan secret.' Ms McEvoy, who also has a three-year-old son called Kaylan, said she and her husband played the prank after Olivia came downstairs no fewer than a dozen times to nag her about writing the fake letter. Harsh lesson: Olivia's mother said: 'There's no chance she'll be doing it again in a hurry. It's a lesson to her that she can't get out of things she doesn't like' She said: 'She has tried every trick in the book to get out of PE. In the run up to this she has left her kit at home, only taken one shoe to lessons, has a tummy ache, her foot hurts - the teachers know her very well.' 'She doesn't like to move at all. She'd rather sit on her i-Pad or games console. It was about 10.30 pm and she was up and down the stairs, saying ""please write me a note, I'll do anything, I'll make you a brew, I'll clean, I'll look after Kaylan"". 'I kept saying, 'you are not having a note' and sent her back to bed. In the end when she came down again I shouted, ""get me a pen and paper then"". She added: ""I said 'so what's wrong with you?"" and she told me to write she that had a bad leg. She just didn't want to move and said it was too cold.' She said that upon agreeing to say that she had a sore leg, Olivia's face lit up before she tottered off to bed none the wiser. Played th part: Olivia, pictured with her little brother Kaylan, even walked into class with a limp so that teachers would believe her made-up injury . The mother added: 'She thought she was a winner. Wayne and I were literally sat there wetting ourselves writing this letter. 'Then I realised we'd need an envelope so she couldn't read it. It was 11pm and we were running around the house looking for an envelope. It was like we were the kids.' Ms McEvoy then took to Facebook to disclose to a few of her friends what she had done, posting a picture of the note before it went viral. She added: 'Everyone was saying I was terrible and couldn't believe I was going to send her with it. I can't believe how many people have shared it but I thought it was absolutely hilarious.' 'There's no chance she'll be doing it again in a hurry.

"Former TV weatherman Fred Talbot has been jailed for five years for sex attacks on young boys . TV weatherman Fred Talbot has been jailed for five years for indecently assaulting two schoolboys when he was a teacher. Talbot, 65, a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning show, was described  as a 'chancer' who used his  'extrovert personality' to gain the trust of his victims. Talbot, who was cleared of assaulting three other boys, was sentenced by Judge Timothy Mort at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court today. The judge told him: 'You deliberately and indecently assaulted the two of them for your own gratification.' Talbot, who sat in the dock wearing glasses and a purple jumper over a shirt and grey trousers, showed no emotion as he was jailed. He appeared relaxed as he entered the dock and acknowledged people in the packed courtroom. Suzanne Goddard QC, defending, said there was little that could be said in mitigation. She said Talbot had lost a stone in weight during his time in custody but was 'accustoming himself' to life in jail. Ms Goddard said: 'He knows he must now receive a custodial sentence. He has come to terms with that.' The jury at last month's trial heard that Talbot was 'obsessed' with teenage boys throughout his teaching career and 'could not help himself' around them when under the influence of drink. Among the prosecution witnesses at the trial were The Stone Roses' singer Ian Brown who said Talbot gave masturbation practice as homework. Scroll down for video . Prosecutors said Talbot's modus operandi was to first establish his 'good guy credentials' and then to break down the proper teacher-pupil boundaries, leaving his victims confused as he made his advances. Talbot, of Bowdon, Greater Manchester, was convicted of two counts of indecent assault in relation to two victims and cleared of eight counts of indecent assault in relation to three other complainants. Talbot rose to fame when he presented weather forecasts from his floating map on ITV's This Morning . Four of the complainants were teenage pupils at Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, where Talbot taught biology, while the other attended a high school in Gateshead, where the defendant was at teacher training college. The former science teacher denied anything sexual or even inappropriate occurred between himself and the Altrincham pupils, while he said sexual activity with the Gateshead complainant only happened when the boy had turned 16. Both of Talbot's victims were assaulted on school canal barge trips in the Cheshire area in the mid 1970s. The first victim, who thought he was 14 at the time, said the teacher abused him after a mock naked orgy involving up to 10 boys and Talbot. Talbot told him to share a bed with him as there were not enough bunk beds to go round and performed a sex act on him. It emerged that he had previously reported the weatherman to police on four separate occasions dating back to 1992 but no action had been taken. The second victim, who also thought he may have been aged 14 at the time, was abused on another barge trip in similar circumstances. Talbot sat in the dock wearing a purple jumper and grey trousers and was unemotional when sentenced . He said that boys would take turns to sleep in Talbot's bed during the trip and when it was his turn the defendant 'started talking to me about sexual stuff' before indecently assaulting him. The complainant said when he was aged in his late 20s he wrote to ITV Granada to tell them Talbot had abused him. The court heard that Talbot's teaching career came to 'an abrupt end' in May 1984 following an indecent proposal he made to two pupils at his home. He offered his bed for the night to the 15-year-old boys and said to them: 'Make sure you leave room for me in the middle.' Following the verdicts, it can be reported that a number of similar complaints against Talbot about offences said to have been committed in Scotland have been passed by police to the Procurator Fiscal. The offences took place when Talbot was working as a teacher in Altrincham, Greater Manchester . Edinburgh-born Talbot moved at the age of seven to Sale, Greater Manchester, and later studied A-levels at Sale Grammar School. After a spell at teacher training college in the Newcastle area he joined Altrincham Grammar School in 1974. He resigned in disgrace in 1984 and went into television a short time later, with one of his first jobs on a Saturday morning children's show. The investigation was triggered in December 2012 following publicity into a separate historic abuse inquiry at another Altrincham school, St Ambrose College, which led to a nine-year jail term for ex-teacher Alan Morris. Judge Mort told Talbot: 'You are a man of 65 with no previous convictions. You have been convicted by a jury from clear evidence of indecently assaulting two boys when you were a teacher.' The judge outlined the offences and Talbot's background as a teacher. He said Talbot's approach to teaching was 'different' and 'less formal' than other staff members at the school and described him as a 'popular' teacher. He said he may have taken pupils on as many as 38 trips and told Talbot the offences he had been convicted of were not isolated incidents. Judge Mort said: 'You had, on other occasions, abused your position to offend.' The judge said both victims had been affected by the abuse by Talbot, with one suffering from mental health issues since the incident. One of the victims made repeated complaints about Talbot to police before he was charged. Judge Mort said aggravating features included the degree of planning of the offences, the use of alcohol on the victims and the abuse of trust. He said: 'You calculated the boys would be too confused, guilt-ridden or embarrassed to disclose what happened.' Judge Mort sentenced Talbot to two and a half years for each offence, to run consecutively. He said he would serve half his sentence before being considered for release on licence. Ian Brown, the former singer with band The Stone Roses, gave evidence against Talbot during the trial . Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Graham Brock from Greater Manchester Police said after the hearing: 'While working as a science teacher Fred Talbot organised many trips with pupils. 'It was during these trips that he plied boys with drink and orchestrated situations to be alone with his victims in order to indecently assault them to feed his own sexual desires. 'You can imagine the excitement of a teenage boy setting off on a canal trip with friends and a teacher, who he should expect to look after him, only to return with his childhood destroyed. 'Put simply, these offences reflect an abhorrent abuse of trust by a man who has proven to have no regard for the innocence of youth he was employed to nurture. 'Had these offences occurred today, they would be considered child sexual exploitation and tackling this heinous crime is the absolute priority for Greater Manchester Police and our partners under Project Phoenix. 'Protecting children is everyone's responsibility and it is crucial that we work together to identify individuals who prey on vulnerable children. More claims against former weatherman revealed: Scottish prosecutors will study new allegations . A judge who jailed Fred Talbot for five years for indecently assaulting two schoolboys when he was a teacher has said details of alleged abuse involving the TV weatherman in Scotland can now be reported. Police investigating incidents of alleged abuse involving Talbot revealed yesterday they had submitted a report to Scottish prosecutors. Neil Usher, prosecuting, made an application to Judge Timothy Mort to lift an order banning reporting of the other alleged offences, which are said to relate to events over a 13-year period, from 1968 to 1981. Talbot, pictured in 1990, is also facing more claims which are now being looked at by Scottish prosecutors . He asked the judge to allow reporting of all that was heard in evidence during Talbot's trial and said he believed it was unlikely there would be further prosecutions in Scotland. Mr Usher said: 'A final decision has not yet been taken as to whether there will be a subsequent prosecution in Scotland. The indications are that's not likely.' Judge Mort said: 'I will lift that restriction.' A report relating to the allegations was received from Police Scotland yesterday and is being considered by the procurator fiscal. A statement from the Crown Office in Scotland said: 'The procurator fiscal has received a report relating to incidents involving a 65-year-old man, said to have occurred between January 1968 and January 1981. 'The report is currently under consideration by the procurator fiscal.'","Famed This Morning weatherman attacked boys when he was a teacher .

"Alzheimer's sufferer Zallu Hassan, 83, suffered horrific injuries (pictured) including a broken cheekbone and jaw and a fractured eye socket after the offenders stormed her home in Ilford, Essex . An 83-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer who was left with horrific injuries after 'pure scum' burglars stormed her home and attacked her was beaten so badly that her family feared she was dead. Zallu Hassan suffered severe facial injuries including a broken cheekbone and jaw and a fractured eye socket after the gang stormed her home in Ilford, Essex. Her devastated daughter, Tulay Ahmadi, 46, believes the intruders kicked her mother's head and stamped on her face during the attack overnight on March 9. Mrs Ahmadi, who raised the alarm after arriving at her mother's house and finding her in a pool of blood, is now offering a £10,000 reward for anyone who has information leading to the arrest of the offenders. She said: 'The people who did this are pure scum. 'They're so evil they'd probably do this to their own mothers.' 'My poor mum was so bad that we thought she was dead when we saw the blood coming out of her ears.' Mrs Hassan, who lives on her own, was attacked sometime between 6pm on March 9 and 8am the following morning. Mrs Ahmadi said the family are now trying to establish what was stolen as the house was ransacked but her mother has 'nothing of real value' and nothing obvious is missing. She said: 'They're just animals - any human being who has any kind of respect would not do this. 'If I could I would inflict the same pain onto them 10 times over. It's just horrific. 'She was upstairs in her bedroom when we found her there covered in blood.' Mrs Hassan, who has short-term memory loss, is now in a stable condition at Queen's Hospital, Romford. Mrs Ahmadi said: 'My mum was very mobile but I feel this has definitely advanced her Alzheimer's - she's become very reclusive since she was attacked. 'If someone knows something they should come forward - it could have been their mother lying with terrible injuries in a hospital bed.' 'I won't rest until I find out who did this.'

"Former First Lady Valérie Trierweiler (pictured) may be forced to undergo the psychiatric examination by the lawyers of the man she allegedly slapped . The former French first lady may be forced to undergo psychiatric evaluation by the lawyers representing the right-wing politician she allegedly slapped after he asked her about François Hollande. Valérie Trierweiler 50, allegedly slapped junior politician Mohamed Rizki in a Paris café last Thursday - and now his lawyers say they will seek to have a psychiatrist examine her to gauge her level of 'dangerousness.' Junior right wing politician Mohamed Rizki claims he had just asked after her former partner, President Hollande. He said: 'I simply asked her, ""how is François?"" 'Honestly, it was a simple question, without a second thought.' Mr Rizki's lawyer branded her reaction as 'totally disproportionate', adding that given Ms Trierweiler's alleged previous assault on  French finance minister's wife, 'we are entitled to question the state of her psychiatric health and her level of dangerousness'. Lawyer Emmanuel Marsigny told Le Parisien newspaper: 'As the legal system allows us to do in affairs of this nature, we are therefore going to request an expert psychiatric assessment to be carried out on Ms Trierweiler.' Ms Trierweiler, whose kiss-and-tell book about her relationship with the French president deeply embarrassed Mr Hollande, allegedly struck   outside a café. Mr Rizki has insisted there was no sarcasm in his question but that the ex-first lady, who is nicknamed 'The Rottweiler,' reacted 'very aggressively' and demanded an apology. 'She was very, very hysterical. And then she slapped me before turning on her heels,' he told Le Parisien. The incident took place near her home in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, which she once shared with Mr Hollande. Mr Rizki, 33, made a formal complaint to police and has now demanded a public apology. In happier times: French President François Hollande and Ms Trierweiler pictured when they were a couple . After news of the alleged slap was reported, Ms Trierweiler wrote on Twitter: 'Un seul mot #Stopàlamuflerie', which translates as 'One word #Stopboorishness'. Ms Trierweiler, a journalist, is notorious for her short temper and has been accused of being violent in the past. In September it was reported she slapped the ex-wife of Finance Minister Michel Sapin, after scratching her face and pulling her hair in a late night bar, the Telegraph reports. Her tell-all book, Thank You For This Moment: A Story Of Love, Power And Betrayal, depicts Mr Hollande as a deceitful, heartless hypocrite who mocks the poor and is set to be made into a film. The couple split last year after Mr Hollande's affair with actress Julie Gayet was revealed. Ms Trierweiler was rumoured to have gone on a rampage in the Elysee Palace after learning of Mr Hollande’s infidelity, smashing up more than £2.5million worth of vases, clocks and paintings, which were all part of France’s national heritage. Since leaving the Elysee she has been working extremely hard to improve her public image, but remains unpopular in France. She has also been accused of using her position as a former presidential consort to make as much cash as possible.","Former French First Lady Valérie Trierweiler allegedly slapped right-wing politician Mohamed Rizki outside a Paris café .

"A man was left in agony after fracturing his penis during sex. The 42-year-old had to undergo emergency surgery after snapping a fibrous membrane inside the organ. His erect phallus had inadvertently collided with his partner’s perineum, the area in front of the anus. The man heard a snap, felt his penis become immediately flaccid, and noticed a rush of blood from the tip. He was rushed to the A&E department of a Boston hospital as he was suffering severe pain, according to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine. A 42-year-old man rushed to hospital after fracturing his penis during sex. After accidentally hitting his erect penis on his partner's perineum, he heard a loud snap, saw a spurt of blood and felt searing pain (file picture) Doctors found he had torn his tunica albuginea, the watertight and fibrous outer sheath of one of the penis' inner chambers, the corpus cavernosa. The corpus cavernosa runs along the length of the penis and is filled with spongy tissue, into which blood flows to create an erection. The tunica albuginea helps to trap the blood in the corpus cavernosa, maintaining an erection. Picture shows a cross section of a penis.

The tunica albuginea helps to trap the blood in the corpus cavernosa, maintaining an erection. It is a whitish and fibrous membrane. The snap had led to a tear in the corpus cavernosa’s sheath, which meant blood leaked out, creating swelling. It was forced out of his body through the urethra, the tube by which a man passes urine, which is why he saw blood coming out of the end of his penis. When he arrived at hospital, he was taken straight to the operating room for emergency repair. Doctors said the consequences of such a fracture include erectile dysfunction, as scar tissue known as fibrous plaques can form in the penis, meaning . They warned it is also possible to suffer a curve or bend in the penis, and damage to the nerves in the genitals. Fortunately, the man, who was seen three and six months after surgery, regained his ability to obtain an erection - without any noticeable curvature or plaque forming in his penis. The news comes after MailOnline reported on the story of Edward Stalling, who endured a painful erection for several weeks. He has suffered a rare side effect to a sleeping tablet given to him in hospital. Mr Stalling was hospitalised for 10 days as doctors treated his prolonged erection. He developed fibrosis – where the arteries and muscles in the penis becoming hardened with fibrous tissue – as a result of the continued erection. He claims this has left him impotent and with difficulty urinating - and is suing the hospital for not making the side effects of the sleeping tablets clear to him.","Man, from Boston, had accidentally hit his  penis on his partner's perineum .

"A pub landlord has been fined £15,000 for employing an 'illegal immigrant' - despite the barman having a British mother and having lived in the UK for more than 50 years. Mike Hill, 50, had been paying 56-year old former postman Robert Jordan - a family friend over 30 years - to serve drinks and collect glasses at his Manchester pub since 2009. But unknown to Mr Hill, Mr Jordan had been living in the UK 'illegally' since 1962 as he was born in the US and moved to Britain with his British mother when he was just three. Robert Jordan, 56, (right) has lived in Britain since he was three years old but could be now be deported after it emerged he doesn't have UK citizenship. His employer, landlord Mike Hill (right), has also been fined . Last December, eight immigration officers acting on an anonymous tip off swooped on Mr Hill's pub the Bay Horse in Denton, Greater Manchester and arrested Mr Jordan as he was working behind the bar. Father-of-three Mr Jordan, known to his friends as Carl, was warned he would be deported back to his birthplace, . Licensee Mr Hill was meanwhile shocked to be issued with a Civil Penalty Notice by immigration officials for 'employing an illegal immigrant'. The fine has since been reduced to £10,000 on appeal. Mr Hill said: 'The whole thing is ridiculous but we don't blame Carl for any of it. He has lived here for 53 years and worked and paid his taxes since he was a teenager. How anyone can brand him an illegal immigrant is beyond me. 'It would be devastated for us as this bill could send us under but it is of course more devastating for Carl too if this all went through. His daughter was in here crying her eyes out the other day in the pub and he's a loss as to what to do about it. 'You hear stories of illegal immigrants being allowed to stay in the UK under some crazy human rights law yet Carl who has been paying his taxes all his life has been told he has to go. There seems to be no common sense about it. Mr Jordan (pictured in Blackpool aged six) was born to a British mother and an American father in the US - but after his parents split up, his mother brought him back to the UK . Now-56-year-old Mr Jordan (pictured, centre, in Blackpool aged 10) has lived in Britain ever since . Mr Hill added: 'When you have known someone 30 years you don't think they're American or whatever country they come from. I just think it could have been totally avoided and handled in a different way by the Home Office and whoever else. 'This must have cost thousands already - even to send eight enforcement officers and lock him up overnight.' Mr Jordan had been born in 1959 as the son of an American soldier and a British 'GI bride'. But when his parents split up three years later, he and his mother moved back to her native Manchester. He was later given an American passport but didn't realise he needed British citizenship to stay in the UK. After previously working as a railway guard, he has been working in Mr Hill's pub since 2009. Mr Hill said: 'I had no knowledge at all of Carl's immigration status. It was just a bit of a joke between people that he had an American passport. 'I have known him for 30 years and no-one ever thought anything of it. He explained he had an American passport because he was born over there and that's it. He never applied for dual nationality because he didn't think he had to. 'When he started working here we photocopied his UK driving licence as photo ID and had a P46 from his last job which had his National Insurance number on. They were the only checks we thought we had to do.' He has been left facing potential deportation after immigration officials told him he has no right to live here . His employer, pub landlord Mike Hill, is furious after he was hit with a £10,000 bill for employing him . Mr Hill added: 'I was at the bank on the day Carl got arrested and got phonecall off immigration saying I needed to go back to the pub. 'When I got back there were eight immigration officers there and four of them were interviewing Carl. They shut the pub because they said they had to secure the building then interviewed me. 'They asked me how long he had worked there and it seemed we should have got a copy of his passport and a photocopy of his birth certificate. We thought we had done everything by the book. 'They say they have reduced the fine from £15,000 to £10,000 because I have ""co-operated"" but I can't even afford to pay £10,000 - we are a small business. 'Carl's worked for big international companies but it's me getting the brunt. I said to the police 'what about fining Royal Mail? He worked there for 14 years'. They said it's nothing to do with them it was me who was employing him at the time. 'It's just ridiculous. It's pathetic when you realise he has paid all his taxes all these years and in two weeks time they could send him back to America where he doesn't know anybody. 'It's unbelievable when you have known someone that long to hear them being called an illegal immigrant is bad enough but then to be accused of employing him as one is even worse.' The Home Office has defended its actions insisting Mr Jordan should have sorted out his immigration status . Mr Jordan now has to report regularly to an immigration centre in Salford. He said: 'I have lived here nearly all my life. I went to school here, I've worked here for 40 years - but now I've been told I've been working illegally all that time, even though I've got a National Insurance number and paid my taxes. 'I've not been sleeping or eating. Every time I see my daughter she cries and that sets me off. 'I thought it would be alright because I've been married here, I've got three kids and all my family are here. I didn't think it was going to get this serious. 'I was only working part time at the pub anyway but Mike has had to let me go as he will get another fine if he keeps me on.' Home Office officials said Mr Jordan was warned in 2007 he needed to apply for residency but he had failed to provide enough evidence. A Home Office spokesman said: 'People born overseas to a British parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the UK, and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions. 'We are satisfied the penalty has been correctly issued to Mr Hill as Mr Jordan has not currently or at the time of the visit established he had permission to work in the UK. 'The matter of Mr Jordan having been employed by other organisations before taking up employment at the pub did not exempt Mr Hill from complying with the requirement for employers to conduct right to work checks.'","56-year-old was born in US to but British mother brought him here in 1960s .

"Udhai Ri's selfie, accompanied by the 'feeling sad' emoji, clearly shows his uncle's corpse in the background . A man has caused a storm on social media after posting  a selfie of himself with his uncle's corpse during a funeral. Udhai Ri, 34, from Jaffna Town in Sri Lanka, stunned friends and family when he snapped himself standing in front of his dead uncle lying on a funeral bed. The photo was then posted onto his Facebook and Twitter accounts. Accompanying it, using the Tamil translation for uncle, were the words: 'My peiriya appa passed away.' This was followed by a 'sad face' emoji and the words 'feeling sad'. But he was soon turned on by shocked online users. Facebook user Dinesh Devi posted: 'Oh, man! Really? This is disgusting. Show some respect.' Som Gamage wrote: 'What is this? A Deady? Could you sink any lower?' Nalin Kodikara added: 'I've never seen anything as disgustingly poor taste as this.' Mr Ri soon took the photo down but not before it had begun doing the rounds on social media. A friend of Mr Ri's said: 'He was very upset and wanted to express that and share his grief and final moments with his uncle with his friends. 'Being upset he wasn't thinking clearly though, as this was obviously a bad idea, to say the least. 'He apologises for any offence he has caused.' Although there's no doubt the selfie has become a bona fide cultural phenomenon, popularized perhaps most famously by Kim Kardashian, there remain some limits to its acceptability. Among the people to have gained notoriety are a man who took a photo of himself in front of his dead grandmother's casket, those smiling cheerily at the scene of the Sydney siege in December and people taking pictures of themselves before sometimes fatal accidents. A friend of Udhai Ri (pictured) said he was very upset and simply wanted to express his grief .

"As a Tory MP in the 1980s Harvey Proctor had a special talent. Some MPs courted attention through their colourful personal lives. Others with their extremist political views. Harvey Proctor found controversy in both. In an age before politicians were out of the closet – and when the age of consent for homosexual sex was 21 – it was an open secret in Westminster that the impeccably turned-out Proctor was gay. But his political downfall in 1987 – accompanied by newspaper headlines of teenage rent boys and spanking parties – was one of the most dramatic scandals in recent memory as he pleaded guilty to charges of gross indecency after repeated public denials that he had done anything wrong. Harvey Proctor, former Tory MP, had his home searched by police as part of a probe into historic allegations of child sex abuse . Downfall: Harvey Proctor on his way to magistrates' court in 1987 to answer charges of gross indecency . As for his politics, his views on immigration were considered so far beyond the pale that while serving as an MP he was beaten unconscious at a demonstration in Scarborough, had red paint thrown over him when addressing Coventry University, and burning papers were thrust through the letter box of his tiny terrace home in Billericay. He shared the house with his feisty mother Hilda. ‘I’m the only woman in his life,’ she once told reporters. It wasn’t quite true. There was also Margaret Thatcher. Proctor, who became MP for Basildon in the 1979 general election which swept Mrs Thatcher to power, was a lifelong fan of the Iron Lady. Proctor was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys to the media . But within weeks of being elected he was irritating her and the Tory high command with his strident views on migration, backing a motion calling for a ban on immigration from Commonwealth countries. Urging the abolition of the Commission for Racial Equality, he demanded the forcible repatriation of 50,000 ‘coloured’ immigrants a year, proposing a £7,000 payment to encourage them to go. He was also one of seven Tory MPs who rebelled against legislation allowing parents to exempt their children from corporal punishment in schools. And he attempted to halt the growing tide of political correctness by launching a campaign to save the golliwog. Born and brought up in Scarborough where he went to the local grammar, Scarborough High School for Boys, he eschewed his Christian name, Keith, and always went by his second name, Harvey. He studied history at the University of York, where he had his first of many brushes with notoriety. As chairman of the university Conservative association he invited Enoch Powell, who had been sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet after his ‘rivers of blood’ speech on immigration, to make a keynote address. There was a predictable uproar and the meeting became a riot. It was a sign of things to come – whenever Proctor addressed a university as an MP he was the subject of angry and often violent protests. After university he worked for the Conservative Party research department in Old Queen Street near the Houses of Parliament. By the time he became MP for Basildon in 1979, he was already a darling of the Tory Right as a leading figure in the notorious Monday Club, a lobby group for the Conservatives but considered so extreme that in 2001 the party severed all links with it. The group advocated voluntary or assisted repatriation for non-white immigrants, capital punishment, and denounced Nelson Mandela as a criminal and terrorist who deserved to be locked up. Tall and gangly – he was once described in the Commons as a loping greyhound – the softly spoken Proctor revelled in the notoriety of being one of the most outspoken voices on the Tory backbenches. On Wednesday, detectives arrived at Belvoir Castle (pictured) near Grantham – the seat of the Duke of Rutland – where Proctor has lived since 2003, and searched the 16,000-acre estate . When Labour-controlled Basildon council passed a motion of no confidence in him as the local MP because of his views on race, he was delighted. After the re-drawing of political boundaries jeopardised his majority in Basildon, he was selected for the safe neighbouring seat of Billericay, which he won convincingly at the 1983 election. Proctor was loved by his local party because of his uncompromising views. He called for the suspension of grants to students if they lacked self-discipline and for administrative and other non-academic parts of universities to be sold to the private sector. His devoted Tory followers in Basildon and Billericay were oblivious to his homosexuality. While he was out with political friends he never discussed his private life. ‘It’s not relevant to my work as an MP,’ was his stock reply. Fiercely ambitious, Proctor was consistently overlooked for ministerial preferment by Mrs Thatcher because of views on immigration which even some Tories viewed as racist. The Whips, in charge of party discipline, also feared his sexuality would be an issue that would return to haunt them. They were right. The first story to emerge in public about it was in 1981, when Terry Woods, a flamboyant art dealer who was his boyfriend, had left the MP’s London flat after a row and Proctor refused to let him back in. The fracas led to a court appearance in which Woods claimed he was in a relationship – albeit it a very tempestuous one – with the MP. Proctor repudiated the claim and got away with it. Lurid allegations surfaced in a Sunday newspaper in September 1986 claiming he had organised gay spanking sessions with canes and teenage rent boys in his flat – allegations he dismissed as monstrous. Proctor resigned after he was charged over spanking parties with teenage rent boys at his flat and lost his house and flat, before signing on the dole . He was embarrassed again soon afterwards when Woods, who remained his long-term lover, was found in his underpants by the police outside the MP’s apartment. He admitted that he ‘loved’ Proctor but insisted the relationship was not sexual. Days later a story emerged of how a naked Arab boy had been found under Proctor’s hotel bed on a Tunisian holiday. When police eventually charged him over the teenage rent boys in his flat, Proctor bowed to the inevitable and announced he was standing down as an MP, admitting to a charge of gross indecency and accepting a fine of £1,450. Proctor was ruined. He had to sell his house in the constituency and the flat in London and was on the dole for a year. But with the help of a £2,000 government grant and friends – including Jeffrey Archer, Michael Heseltine and other MPs who between them raised £75,000 on his behalf – he turned from politics to hosiery, opening a shop, Proctor’s, in Richmond selling shirts, gaudy waistcoats, silk ties, and natty cuff links. Infamously, he hung a sign in the shop window saying: ‘Shirt lifters will not be prosecuted.’ Initially business seemed to be flourishing – John Major, when he became Prime Minister, ditched his Marks & Spencer shirts in favour of Proctor’s more elegant wares – and he opened a second shop in Knightsbridge. But he could never escape his past. One day in 1992, two men walked into the Richmond shop. One of them demanded: ‘Have you any boys for tying up before you spank them,’ and then the men started punching him. After a £2,000 government grant he set up a chain of shops under his name selling shirts, ties and cuff links . Proctor’s friend Neil Hamilton, then a government minister and in the shop at the time, came to Proctor’s aide and received a broken nose for his pains. From then on, the shops went into decline. They were forced into liquidation in 2000 and Proctor disappeared beneath the radar only to re-emerge in 2004 at the Duke of Rutland’s ancestral seat, the gothic Belvoir Castle, where he is the events manager. The 68-year-old Proctor now lives in a large country house on the 18,000-acre estate near Grantham – the birthplace of his heroine Margaret Thatcher. A house now being searched by the police.

"After a lifetime of working hard, pensioners deserve to raise a toast to retirement. And these days they’re doing just that – enjoying a daily tipple at 6.30pm. Some prefer to crack open a bottle a little earlier, around 4pm, but others can’t even wait that long... and say cheers with their first glass at lunchtime. Researchers found the majority of pensioners are making the most of their later years with a packed diary of social engagements, days out, short breaks, holidays and shopping, as well as time spent outside (file image) With such a relaxed start to the day, it’s no wonder that a poll of retirees aged 60 and over found 94 per cent are enjoying their post-work life, while half said they are having more fun than ever before. Improvements in healthcare and living standards mean that these days pensioners have the energy to manage a hectic social diary, buoyed up by an average disposable income of £330 a month, which allows them to go on three holidays, two weekends away and 17 day trips a year. The survey found that 6.30pm is retirees’ favourite time to enjoy a tipple or two. A third of those polled said they drink alcohol between 6pm and 7pm, while one in ten prefer a late afternoon drink between 4pm and 5pm, and a hardy one in 20 kick off their socialising between 1pm and 3pm. More than half said they drink wine, while the rest opt for spirits or beer. The study also showed that most pensioners eat out three times a month, but one in ten do so more than twice a week. This is despite family commitments, with retirees dedicating an average of six hours a week to looking after their grandchildren. Of those who do not already care for grandchildren, two-thirds said they would like to in the future. The average retirement consists of a daily glass of wine at 6.30pm, research has found (file picture) Most said they are active and exercise at least six times a month. The most popular activities are brisk walking, gardening and rambling. But a more ambitious 17 per cent participate in cycling, Zumba or salsa dancing. And one in 20 take at least five weekend breaks in Britain every year. Almost three-quarters said they feel a lot younger than their actual age, with the same proportion saying retirement is better than they expected. It’s no wonder then that 20 per cent of those polled said they wish they had retired years ago. Going on a cruise, taking up a new hobby and buying a dog are common achievements in the first year of retirement, while IT lessons and losing weight were also popular among those polled. Shortly after retiring, a third said they booked lunch dates with friends, a quarter revamped their house and one in ten signed up to Facebook. A glamorous few said they plan to or had already invested in makeovers or cosmetic surgery. Senior Railcard, which runs a rail discount scheme for train companies, polled 1,260 pensioners. Andrew Robertson, of Senior Railcard, said: ‘Our poll showed that adults in their 60s, 70s and 80s are determined to make the most of life in retirement and have no intention of slowing down. ‘For so much of our lives we are restricted by our working hours, so if pensioners are filling their time with holidays, day trips and meals out, that can only be a good thing. ‘This research shows that retirees place a lot of importance on travel when they finish work.’ A separate report published yesterday said the average pensioner had made almost £1,200 a month from their home in the last six months. Soaring property prices meant London homeowners were the biggest winners, making £20,700 a month since August, financial specialist Key Retirement said. Going on foreign or UK travel .

"Nick Clegg insisted yesterday his party was 'here to stay' as he predicted the Liberal Democrats would defy the odds to serve a second term in government. Despite consistently dismal poll ratings, the Lib Dem leader claimed it would win more seats than forecast and could still hold office with fewer MPs. Attacking his Conservative coalition partners, he compared David Cameron to 'Nigel Farage in a white tie' and declared: 'Cows moo, dogs bark – and Tories cut. It's in their DNA.' Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg salutes the audience after speaking at a party conference in Liverpool . Mr Clegg claims his party could stop a 'rag-tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the Scottish National Party from holding the balance of power after the election on May 7 . Nick Clegg hugs his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, a partner at a US law firm, after his speech in Liverpool . Mr Clegg also criticised Labour, despite making it clear he could foresee a coalition with either of the major parties. But he ruled out a formal coalition deal involving the SNP or Ukip. He went so far as to claim that only his party could stop a 'rag-tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the Scottish National Party from holding the balance of power after the election on May 7. The latest polls have consistently put the Lib Dems on just 7 per cent, with experts predicting they will lose at least half the 57 seats they won at the last election. But, bizarrely, Mr Clegg compared their hopes for the future to last November's landing of the Rosetta space probe on the surface of a comet. 'What an audacious, optimistic thing to have ever dreamt of attempting,' he said. Speaking at the party's spring conference in Liverpool, he added: 'I want us to take just a little bit of the spirit of that audacious project and to think big.' Mr Clegg, who appeared to have matched his pink tie with the bubblegum-pink dress worn by his wife Miriam, watching from the front row, said his party would 'defy the odds and win this May'. He added: 'I have a message for all those who are writing us off again: The Liberal Democrats are here to stay. I've heard the predictions, I've seen the polls. But let me tell you this: We will do so much better than anyone thinks.' However, his upbeat speech was overshadowed by an attack from Left-winger Tim Farron, who is thought to want his job. Mr Farron, the Lib Dems' former president, said a second coalition with the Tories would tarnish the party's reputation 'over the next generation'. He said he would give the party just two out of ten for its handling of coalition government. Mr Clegg, who appeared to have matched his pink tie with the bubblegum-pink dress worn by his wife Miriam, watching from the front row, said his party would 'defy the odds and win this May' Wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez and Women's minister Jo Swinson listen to the keynote speech in Liverpool . The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'I have a message for all those who are writing us off again: The Liberal Democrats are here to stay' Former leader Paddy Ashdown was unable to suppress a yawn as he watched Mr Clegg deliver his speech . But former leader Paddy Ashdown said yesterday that Mr Farron should keep his ambitions in check. Lord Ashdown, who struggled to stifle a yawn during the conference, said of Mr Farron: 'I think his well-known ambitions would be better served with a little more patience and a little more judgment. 'Tim is a very able guy but judgment is not his strong suit.' Lib Dem insiders firmly believe the party could be back in ministerial posts even if they emerge with as few as 30 seats on May 8. They expect the Tories to emerge as the largest party, and hope they will be within 30 seats of a majority – 326 seats – so the Lib Dems can prop them up. Mr Clegg's 46-year-old wife – a partner at a US law firm – does not get on stage to embrace her husband as other political wives do after their speeches. Yesterday, it was Mr Clegg who came down the steps – as at previous conferences – and hugged her before they left to cheers from the party faithful.","Mr Clegg claims Lib Dems will will more seats than forecast in May election .

After a seal pup is born, the mom spends all her time close to her baby and hardly interacts with other seals. The Weddell seal population of Erebus Bay, Antarctica has been extensively studied for over 40 years; one of the longest running studies of a long-lived mammal. Because of the isolation, the animal are relatively undisturbed by human activities.

"A freight train loaded with crude oil derailed in northern Illinois on Thursday, bursting into flames and prompting officials to suggest that everyone with one mile to evacuate, authorities said. The BNSF Railway train derailed around 1.20pm in a rural area where the Galena River meets the Mississippi, according to company spokesman Andy Williams. The train had 103 cars loaded with crude oil, along with two buffer cars loaded with sand. A cause for the derailment hadn't yet been determined. No injuries were reported. Scroll down for video . Smoke and flames erupt from the scene, in which a train carrying 103 cars loaded with crude oil, on Thursday near Galena, Illinois . The BNSF Railway freight train loaded with crude oil derailed around 1.20pm in a rural area where the Galena River meets the Mississippi . Only a family of two agreed to leave their home, Galena City Administrator Mark Moran said at a news conference late Thursday, adding that the suggestion to evacuate was prompted by the presence of a propane tank near the derailment. The derailment occurred three miles south of Galena in a wooded and hilly area that is a major tourist attraction and the home of former President Ulysses S. Grant. The Jo Daviess County Sheriff's Department confirmed the train was transporting oil from the Northern Plains' Bakken region. Earlier in the day, Moran said eight tankers had left the track. But Williams said at the news conference that only six cars derailed, two of which burst into flames and continued to burn into the night. BNSF spokesman Andy Williams said that six cars derailed from the tracks and two burst into flames . Firefighters could only reach the train by a bike path and were unable to stop the flames. They had to pull back for safety reasons and let the fire burn out itself . Firefighters could only access the derailment site by a bike path, said Galena Assistant Fire Chief Bob Conley. They attempted to fight a small fire at the scene but were unable to stop the flames. Firefighters had to pull back for safety reasons and were allowing the fire to burn itself out, Conley said. In addition to Galena firefighters, emergency and hazardous material responders from Iowa and Wisconsin were at the scene. The derailment comes amid increased public concern about the safety of shipping crude by train. According to the Association of American Railroads, oil shipments by rail jumped from 9,500 carloads in 2008 to 500,000 in 2014, driven by a boom in the Bakken oil patch of North Dakota and Montana, where pipeline limitations force 70 per cent of the crude to move by rail. Emergency responders from Wisconsin and Iowa joined the Illinois teams in an attempt to stop the fire, but for safety reasons retreated . Since 2008, derailments of oil trains in the United States and Canada have seen 70,000-gallon tank cars break open and ignite on multiple occasions, resulting in huge fires. A train carrying Bakken crude crashed in a Quebec town in 2013, killing 47 people. Last month, a train carrying 3 million gallons of North Dakota crude derailed in a West Virginia snowstorm, shooting fireballs into the sky, leaking oil into a river tributary and forcing hundreds of families to evacuate. The ruptures and fires have prompted the administration of President Barack Obama to consider requiring upgrades such as thicker tanks, shields to prevent tankers from crumpling, rollover protections and electronic brakes that could make cars stop simultaneously, rather than slam into each other. In a statement, the Federal Railroad Administration said it was sending investigators to the Illinois derailment site and that the agency will conduct a 'thorough investigation,' to determine the cause. The derailment comes in the midst of a nationwide discussion about the safety of transporting crude oil by train . Since 2008, derailments of oil trains in the United States and Canada have seen 70,000-gallon tank cars break open and ignite on multiple occasions, resulting in huge fires . BNSF spokesman Michael Trevino said railroad employees were on the scene and additional personnel were headed there. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner also put state personnel and equipment at the ready for deployment. The train's destination wasn't immediately known. Chicago, which is 160 miles east, is a major rail hub for shipments from both North Dakota and Canada's oil sands. It was unclear if the train's tank cars were older models widely criticized for being prone to puncture during accidents. About 40 to 50 oil trains come through the area each week, Jo Daviess County Emergency Manager Charles Pedersen said. As seen from near Bellevue, Iowa, smoke rises from a train derailment Thursday. The train's destination wasn't immediately known .","Authorities had to evacuate everyone in an one-mile radius of fire .

"Amira Abase, 15, and three other pupils at one school in east London fled to join ISIS . The school where four pupils fled to Syria to become ‘jihadi brides’ is to be investigated by counter-extremism officials.

Fears of a wider problem of fanaticism at the school in East London have emerged when four of their friends and fellow pupils had their passports confiscated before they could make the same journey.

The Department for Education said officers from its ‘due diligence and counter-extremism division’ will investigate potential links to extremism. The academy, rated as ‘outstanding’ in its 2012 Ofsted review, is currently putting on weekly talks for parents giving advice on the issue. But parents fear this is merely ‘papering over the cracks’ and have called for a thorough investigation. Parents have also started holding their own meetings to discuss the growing problem of Islamic fundamentalism at the school. Some have been producing and distributing leaflets which give advice on spotting the signs of radicalism. Nazrul Islam, whose 13-year-old son attends the school, said: ‘Lots of parents around here who have children that go to Bethnal Green Academy are all very concerned. ‘After what happened with the girls leaving, parents are worried that their children might be radicalised too – but they don’t know how to stop it. ‘We have been left in a horrible situation and now parents are worried they don’t know what their children are doing. The police told the school that they were concerned about the girls. Did the school then contact the parents? What did they know and what did they do about it? We need to get to the bottom of it.’ Davis Lewin, deputy director at the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ‘It is vital that the authorities investigate the situation at the school. Parents and the public deserve answers. If there is a problem in Bethnal Green Academy, it must be addressed urgently. If not, we must know where these children are being indoctrinated with this hateful ideological poison.’ The probe at Bethnal Green Academy has been launched after four girls left their homes to join Islamic State. Classmates Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, fled to Syria last month . Last week a judge banned five girls – three of whom are 16 and two 15 – from travelling abroad after they showed an interest in going to Syria. He ordered their passports to be confiscated and for them to be made wards of the court. Four of the girls, from Bethnal Green Academy, are associated with the four girls who have already joined IS to become ‘jihadi brides’. The fifth is schooled at home. Concerns for their welfare were raised by police after classmates Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, fled to Syria last month. The trio followed in the footsteps of 15-year-old Sharmeena Begum, also from Bethnal Green Academy, who left for Syria in December. it emerged last night that Amira’s (pictured) father Abase Hussen has not been seen by neighbours for a month . Meanwhile, it emerged last night that Amira’s father Abase Hussen – whose close links to extremism were exposed by the Mail – has not been seen by neighbours for a month. One neighbour said: ‘I haven’t see him for a long time now – maybe a month. I haven’t seen any of the family. He isn’t at work because he doesn’t work. He has an injury so he can’t work.’ A second neighbour added: ‘I used to see him in the mosque before his daughter went to Syria, but after that I haven’t seen him anymore. He used to take his children to the mosque. He was very religious.’ Mr Hussen, who told MPs that police were to blame for his daughter fleeing to join IS, played a central role in a notorious protest at the US embassy in London. Video footage shows him shouting ‘burn, burn USA’ and standing next to an American flag that has just been set on fire. The 47-year-old marched alongside extremists carrying jihadi flags and placards bearing incendiary anti-Western messages. Many of Britain’s most radical Muslims were at the rally in September 2012, including hate preacher Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of Fusilier Lee Rigby’s killers. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Our understanding of the challenge [of extremism], and the way we monitor the ability of schools to respond to it, has advanced hugely. As part of this, this government set up a dedicated due diligence and counter-extremism division within the Department and they are working tirelessly to see if and where we can offer help to schools with pupils or former pupils who have since travelled to Syria or other areas of concern. ‘The Secretary of State has asked them to review those schools where we have evidence of links with pupils who have travelled to Syria.’","Bethnal Green Academy will be investigated by counter-extremism officers .

"One of the convicted Bali Nine drug smugglers facing life in an Indonesian prison has spoken of his terror for fellow traffickers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran in an emotional online plea for help. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen was arrested with Chan and Sukumaran in 2005 for his role in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali and into Australia. In an online campaign to raise funds for a fifth appeal against his life sentence, the 31-year-old describes his anguish for the first time. 'Today as sit in my jail cell and watch the way the Indonesian government is handling the execution of my fellow Australians I am terrified,' says Nguyen. 'Terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.' Scroll down for video . Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison . 'Agonisingly certain I will be next': Tan Duc Thanh Nguyan has launched an emotional plea for help with a MyCause campaign to raise funds  for his legal costs, and those of fellow Bali Nine prisoners in Indonesia . Nguyen was arrested in Bali as a 22-year-old and sentenced to life in prison. He's now desperately hoping to raise money through his My Cause campaign to pay the legal costs of his latest appeal, which will be heard with fellow inmates Si Yi Chen and Mathew Norman. 'By the time you read this there may only be seven of us left,' he writes. 'With recent events surrounding my friends Andrew Chan and Myuren Sukumaran on death row I fear that the rest of us will never be able to have a fair trial.' While they are still alive, he says, 'we have hope.' Funds raised will be used to cover costs for of all three men, and any remaining money will be donated to support legal costs of the remaining Bali Nine group, also fighting for their lives. Nguyen says his family, who run a bakery in Brisbane, have spent all their life savings on his legal costs over the last ten years and are swamped with those debts. He said one of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through. 'I live with that regret every single morning when I wake and every night in my noisy bare jail cell as I try to sleep,' he says. 'I now know my decision to take part in this crime meant that not only myself suffers but those around me and those who love me. I am a brother, a son, an uncle and someone’s nephew.' The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali . Tan Duc Than Nguyen, pictured here with fellow Bali Nine prisoners, says he has spiralled into depression watching events unfold for Chan and Sukumaran in Indonesia and is desperate for his own life . Nguyen has been trying to repair his relationship with his family since being convicted almost 10 years ago, and said he is haunted by the memory of his mother coming to visit him for the first time in prison. His parents were given asylum in Australia after fleeing Vietnam and taking refuge in the Philippines, where Nguyen was born. Describing his parents as hard-working and courageous, Nguyen said that he threw away what they fought so hard for and that he will never be able to make it up to them. 'I tell you now, there isn’t any code of honour among drug dealers and in the end it will destroy you and everyone around you.' The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006 . The Bali Nine consists of nine Australians who were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of the country and into Australia . Nguyen and his family know well that another appeal could be risky. Following a previous attempt in 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty, before reducing it again to life in prison in 2008. 'For five years I appealed and never had a chance. During one appeal my sentence changed from life to death,' Nguyen writes. 'But desperation has driven me to try again. A roll of the dice – for my life.' 'Am I guilty? Yes. Am I sorry? More than anyone will ever know.' Nguyen, who is currently being held in a jail in Malang, says he was moved from Kerobokan prison because he needed help. 'I had spiralled into the deepest depression. I hated myself and pushed everyone away. I woke up every day feeling angry that I had woken. Disgusted that I was still alive.' he says. Now, he says he is trying his best not to lose hope, waking early each day to train and box at the gym and read. He is also teaching English to other prisoners and encouraging them 'to work through their problems at the gym.' The hard line stance of Indonesian President Joko Widodo has frightened Nguyen to the point where he believes he may not receive a fair trial, but he says an appeal is his only chance. The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members) Despite international pressure and official protests from the governments of Brazil, Holland, France, the Philippines and Nigeria, Mr Joko has remained unwavering on the executions. 'No one prefers death. Death is an easy way out. I deserve the suffering I’m going through. But an appeal means hope. Without that hope there isn’t any future,' Nguyen has told the Daily Telegraph. His sentiment has been echoed by supporters of Chan and Sukumaran as they await the outcome of their last-ditch appeal. The appeals were adjourned until next week, and Australian authorities have continued to negotiate with the Indonesian government for clemency and life imprisonment for the pair. High profile Indonesian authorities have reportedly urged President Joko to reconsider the executions, amid concerns that if the executions go ahead the nation's reputation will be tarnished. 'Cracks are showing. They know that after these executions, there are many more to come,' one source, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fairfax. 'I’m terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next,' Nguyen said of Chan and Sukumaran . Nguyen has  been watching the fate of the condemned Bali Nine ringleaders very closely as he prepares to launch another appeal . Nguyen is currently being held in a jail in Malang, where he shares a cell with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens (above) Nguyen has been in close contact with his friend Scott Rush (above), whom he enlisted as part of the plot . Rush was found with 1.3 kilograms of heroin strapped to his body when he was just 19 . Nguyen is currently  sharing a cell in Malang with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens, and has been in close contact with his friend Scott Rush, whom he enlisted as part of the smuggling plot. Rush was found with 1.3 kilograms of heroin strapped to his body when he was just 19, and has struggled with drugs since his conviction. Nguyen said that it has been terrible to see his friend 'destroy himself'. The 31-year-old is preparing to launch his fifth appeal as Chan and Sukumaran wait for the outcome of their latest appeal, and said that he hopes desperately their lives don't end by execution.","Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen was convicted in 2005 .

"A US Army National Guard solider and his cousin have been arrested for attempting to join ISIS and planning a  'Charlie Hebdo' style terrorist attack on home soil. Specialist Hasan Edmonds, 22, a U.S. citizen and member of the Illinois National Guard, was arrested on Wednesday at Chicago Midway International Airport by members of the Chicago FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) while trying to fly to Cairo, Egypt, the Department of Justice said in a statement. His cousin, Jonas Edmonds, 29, who is also a U.S. citizen, was arrested without incident at his home in Aurora, Illinois, on the same day. The pair have posed for pictures together on Facebook, while Hasan has uploaded images of his tattoos. Scroll down for video . Jonas (left) and Hasan Edmonds (right) were arrested by members of the Chicago FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) on Wednesday . Hasan (left), a member of the Illinois National Guard, and his cousin Jonas (right) got in touch with an undercover FBI agent and spoke about plans to travel to Syria and plan an attack on home soil . The statement added: 'Both defendants were charged in a criminal complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois with one count of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization.' In late 2014, Hasan came to the attention of the FBI. The investigation subsequently revealed that he and Jonas  had allegedly devised a plan for Hasan to wage violence on behalf of ISIL. Hasan, a current member of the Illinois Army National Guard, planned to use his military training to fight. As part of their plans, Hasan  booked an airline ticket to travel on Wednesday from Chicago and arrive in Cairo on Thursday, with layovers in Detroit and Amsterdam. The pair (Hasan pictured left and Jonas right in a mugshot before beginning a prison sentence for conspiracy to commit armed robbery in 2005) were planning to wage 'war on behalf of ISIL'  the FBI complaint reads . According to the criminal complaint, both defendants also planned for Jonas  to carry out an act of terrorism in the United States after Hasan had left. The pair allegedly met with an FBI undercover employee and presented a plan to carry out an armed attack against a U.S. military facility in northern Illinois, an installation where Hasan  had been training. The agent had reached out to Hasan and added him on Facebook. Jonas asked the FBI undercover employee to assist in the attack and explained that they would use Hasan's uniforms and the information he supplied about how to access the installation and target officers for attack. According to the documents he saw a body count of between 100 and 150. Hasan said it would be closer to 120. The FBI complaint added that the pair said: 'Honestly we would love to do something like the brothers in Paris did' - referring to the attack on the headquarters of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. 'Disturbingly, one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack,' said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin, in a statement. He added: 'According to the charges filed today, the defendants allegedly conspired to provide material support to ISIL and planned to travel overseas to support the terrorist organization. Hasan, 22, a U.S. citizen, was arrested on Wednesday at Chicago Midway International Airport after he checked onto a flight to Cairo, Egypt . 'In addition, they plotted to attack members of our military within the United States. Disturbingly, one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack. I want to thank the many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who are responsible for disrupting the threat posed by these defendants.' 'We will pursue and prosecute with vigor those who support ISIL and its agenda of ruthless violence,' said U.S. Attorney Fardon. 'Anyone who threatens to harm our citizens and allies, whether abroad or here at home, will face the full force of justice.' 'The arrests today are the culmination of a successful investigation that involved a great deal of coordination and communication with our law enforcement and military partners,' said Special Agent in Charge Holley. 'Throughout the course of this investigation, the defendants were closely and carefully monitored to ensure the safety of the public and our service men and women.' If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Jonas already was convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and served five years in a Georgia prison between 2005 and 2010.","Specialist Hasan Edmonds, 22, was arrested at Chicago Midway Airport .

"Each March, devotees from across Thailand travel to the Nakhon Pathom province to have their bodies adorned with intricate traditional inkings. About 30 minutes outside of Bangkok is the Wat Bangphra Buddhist temple, famous for the daily tattoos, known as 'Sak Yants,' given by the monks that live and train there. These 'magic tattoos' are believed to have mystical powers, the ability to ward off bad luck and the power to protect wearers from harm. Scroll down for video . Each March, devotees from across Thailand travel to the Wat Bangphra Buddist temple to receive 'magic tattoos' Buddhist monks adorn adherents with intricate inkings that are believed to have mystical powers and provide strength and security . First introduced by Buddhist monk, Luang Por Pern, the Bangphra temple brings together thousands of adherents on the first Saturday of March each year. Beginning the evening before, adherents may visit the temple to begin the process of tattooing. Artists work through the night to complete the detailed designs, inked on visitors' chests, backs, legs and arms, which are believed to provide those who wear them with strength and security. Aside from simply amassing new body art, adherents also visit the monastery to pay their respects to the temple's master tattooist. A devotee acts like a tiger while under the spell of the 'magic tattoo' during the annual festival at Wat Bangphra Buddist temple in Thailand . Wearers often a deep trance and may take on the characteristics of their animal tattoos. As such, some visitors may need to be subdued . The practice was first introduced by Buddhist monk, Luang Por Pern, who lived and practiced at the Bangphra temple . Participants receive tattoos via a traditional steel rod sharpened to a point during the Magic Tattoo Festival in the Nakhron Pathom province . As well as having tattoos applied or touched up, believers also visit the temple to pay respects to the temple's master tattooist . These intricate tattoos have deep religious meaning and are believed to provide strength and security to those who have them . Often, during that process of tattooing, devotees enter a deep, meditative-like trance. As the crowd forms outside the temple, a path may be cleared for those in the otherworldly state to make their way inside. It's believed that adherents who fall under such a spell will then take on characteristics of the animals that they have tattooed on their bodies, growling like a tiger, for example. Those who invoke the spirit of their animal tattoos may need to be subdued and soothed before entering the temple, similar to how a captured animal would need to be calmed down. During the festival, Buddhist monks use traditional needles to tattoo devotees, who believe that the inkings have mystical powers . A devotee in a state of trance, and clad in silver amulets, mimics an animal while visiting the temple to pay his respects . Devotees are also sprayed with holy water during the festival, which is held on the first Saturday of March each year .

This particular devotee, also in a state of trance, mimics the tiger that he has tattooed on his chest . Many attendees believe that the tattoos covering their bodies help to ward off bad luck and protect them from harm . Traditionally, the tattoos are done with a 'mai sak,' a long bamboo stick sharpened to a point, by the Buddhist monks. The ink is made from several ingredients, which may include snake venom, herbs and cigarette ash. Monks bless the tattoo upon its completion and then blow on it, which is believed to infuse the inking with power.

"A couple have been accused of locking their autistic 13-year-old daughter in a basement and forcing her to wear diapers. Court papers say the girl from Brookfield, Wisconsin, continually showed up at school with dried feces on her, and that her stepfather called her 'Stink'. He also refused to let the helpless youngster use the family bathroom or furniture because he believed she was 'disgusting'. Scroll down for video . A couple from Brookfield, Wisconsin, has been accused of locking their autistic 13-year-old daughter in the basement of this house, forcing her to wear a diaper and sending her to school covered in feces . Police were alerted when an anonymous caller said the youngster was 'being treated like an animal'. Prosecutors say the child has low-level autism and some cognitive disabilities, and was forced into the basement every day after school. There she would be made  to put on an adult onesie and a pull-up diaper,Fox 6 reported. In the morning she would then get on the school bus. The girl's mother and stepfather, who have not been identified, are charged with child neglect. When police removed the girl from their home in Brookfield, just west of Milwaukee, the temperature in her basement bedroom was around 50 degrees. Court papers say the couple referred to the girl as 'Stink' and her stepfather refused to let her use the family bathroom or sit on the furniture because she thought she was disgusting . An anonymous caller tipped police, saying the girl was being treated like an animal. Emily Levine, executive director of the Autism Society of Southeastern Wisconsin, told WISN: 'It makes me cry, or want to punch somebody. Both. I can't understand wanting to hurt a child.

"A&E departments across England are 'near breaking point' experts have today warned, as they called for an end to the fixation with the four-hour waiting target. A new report by the Nuffield Trust said an 'undue' focus on the national target can 'distort' behaviour inside hospitals 'in ways that are not in the interests of patients or staff'. Focus on the target can mean a significant amount of time is spent by staff reporting up the chain to those who commission healthcare, and regulators, with a potentially detrimental impact on the quality of care. The think tank's critique  What's Behind The A&E 'Crisis'? comes as NHS England reveals emergency departments have not achieved the benchmark in England since July 2013. It comes as the latest figures, published today, show performance is getting worse. In the week ending March 1, 91 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in A&E before being discharged or admitted to a hospital ward - short of the 95 per cent target. The Nuffield Trust think tank today warned A&E departments across England are 'near breaking point', as they called for an end to the fixation with the four-hour waiting target . It marks a slight fall from the previous week, when performance was 92 per cent. But authors of the Nuffield Trust report argue that while the four-hour target has 'played an important part in improving patients' experiences', it is just one part of a complex system of urgent care. The report argues a set of 'richer performance indicators' should be considered alongside the weekly waiting time performance figures. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, and the report's co-author, warned: 'England's A&E system is near crisis. 'With the financial squeeze set to continue, there is no relief in sight if we keep up the current approach. 'We need to rethink our assumptions as many of the ""magic bullet"" solutions suggested miss the point. 'It's not about more people turning up, but about a system with a squeeze on hospital space and staff, which needs to get better at discharging people safely and on time.' Every minute of every day, an average of 40 patients arrive at emergency departments in England. The speed with which people move through A&E 'has come to be regarded as a sentinel marker of the health care system'. The chair of the British Medical Association, Dr Mark Porter, agreed, adding the four-hour wait has become 'disproportionate'. Responding to the Nuffield Trust briefing, he said: 'Doctors want to treat patients on the basis of their individual need, rather than an arbitrary target. 'Moving away from a system that prioritises targets above all else to one which takes a wider view of how services are performing would improve the quality of patient care by preventing rushed admissions, or leaving those most in need waiting longer for treatment. 95 per cent – the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in A&E before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital. 92 per cent – average performance against the four-hour target by major A&E departments in 2014. Three hours 43 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving A&E. Two hours 17 minutes – the average time spent in A&E by a patient who is sent home after leaving A&E. More than one hour, four minutes – how much longer on average a patient over the age of 75 spends in A&E compared with those aged under 75. 'By fixating on one narrow measurement, we risk focusing on the symptoms rather than the causes of rising pressure on A&Es, which are linked to wider pressures across the NHS and social care sector. 'Cuts to social care mean hospitals have become a holding place for many older patients who can’t be discharged because there is simply nowhere for them to go. 'This ‘exit block’ leads to bed shortages and patients waiting for hours on trolleys to be admitted. Outside of hospitals investment in general practice is declining while demand is on the rise and more care is moved into the community - this simply isn’t sustainable. 'We can only get to grips with pressure on A&Es if we look at health and social care in the round, and ensure every part of the system is fully resourced and working well.' Focus on A&E performance has intensified since the start of the year, as 'unprecedented' winter pressures saw medics face a worsening situation. In January figures revealed A&E waiting times had plummeted to the lowest level in a decade. But the authors of the Nuffield Trust report point out A&E is only part of a broader urgent care system. GP practices, out-of-hours services and the telephone service NHS 111 all have key parts to play. The four-hour target counts the patients who spend a total of less than 240 minutes between arrival and leaving the department, having been either discharged or admitted to an inpatient bed in another part of the hospital. The authors said: 'The target has played an important part in improving patients' experiences of care at A&E. 'Before the target was introduced, 12-hour waits were not uncommon.' When the benchmark was first introduced in 2004, performance began to rise. In 2005-06 the target, then of seeing 98 per cent of patients within four hours, was met for the first time. In 2010, the expectation was relaxed slightly, with the target lowered to 95 per cent of patients who should be treated and discharged or admitted within four hours. The report notes a range of pressures placed on A&E departments, but states the most significant issue  'is not the numbers of people presenting at A&E, but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole' The pressure on the urgent care system is caused by high bed occupancy rates, tight resources and staff facing increasing strain, the report states. 'There is no doubt that the system is near breaking point,' they wrote. But there are other signs of the impending crisis, which will be accelerated by the 'continued financial squeeze'. The number of patients waiting on trolleys for more than four hours before being admitted to hospital has almost trebled, and delayed ambulance handovers at the doors of A&E have risen by more than 70 per cent. The think tank highlight the latest problems in A&E 'are part of a well-established decline since 2012'. But they argue the picture is not as straightforward. A&E ‘waiting’ time . The length of time a patient spends in the A&E department between being seen by A&E staff and either being admitted or discharged. Unlike other NHS waiting times, this is not the length of time a person waits before they are treated. Attendance . Any visit to A&E, whether it results in an admission or discharge. The average cost to the NHS is £124 per attendance. Admission . What happens to a patient who is transferred from A&E into another ward within the hospital for further treatment. The average cost to the NHS: £1,657 per admission. Discharge . What happens when a patient leaves A&E to go either home or to an outpatient clinic. Traditional arguments have blamed the pressure on A&E with a rising tide of patients arriving at the doors of emergency departments. The report however, noted 'attendance has not risen much beyond what we would expect because of population change'. Furthermore fingers have been pointed at the impact of the NHS 111 phone line, cuts to social care and changes to the GP contract in 2004, which gave family doctors the option to opt out of providing out-of-hours care. Instead, the most significant issue facing A&E units across the country 'is not the numbers of people presenting at A&E, but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole'. That, the authors argue, is stemming the flow of patients through the hospital system from the front door back to their homes, or rehabilitation in the community. The briefing recommends that many answers to the current situation already exist. The authors recommend policy makers should take a longer-term and broader view of performance in A&E, introducing a more complex set of indicators to sit alongside the four-hour waiting target. 'The complexity of the system and the highly politicised nature of the A&E have impeded progress,' the authors said. 'Problems will not be solved if policy-makers, political leaders and regulators continue to micro-manage A&E. 'With change so urgently needed, it is imperative that there is a cross-party consensus on how to move forward and that action is not postponed or delayed for political reasons.' A spokesman for NHS England said: 'This report makes some important suggestions about how the NHS could respond to winter pressures. 'We are already undertaking a number of the actions that the Nuffield Trust suggest - for example improving access to care outside hospitals, encouraging local health leaders to identify where to focus investment and using a richer range of different data indicators so we better understand how pressures are affecting different parts of the system. 'We also recognise the need for more fundamental change, so we welcome contributions such as this that will help us to identify how we can work more efficiently and drive up standards of care across the country.'","Nuffield Trust report warns A&E units in England are 'near breaking point'

"Andy Murray said it was impossible to choose between brother Jamie, and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier as best men, so will invite all three . Andy Murray has announced he will have three best men at his wedding when he marries to long-term girlfriend Kim Sears next month. The British tennis star says the honour will be shared between his brother Jamie, close friend and fellow tennis player Ross Hutchins, and former training partner Carlos Mier. Murray, 27, is due to marry Miss Sears, who he has been dating for nine years, in a ceremony at his luxurious Comlix House Hotel in Dunblane on April 11. The Wimbledon champion has previously played best man at brother Jamie's wedding when he married Alejandra Gutierrez at Cromlix House in 2010, and when Ross Hutchins got hitched to Lindsay Wood last year. Murray told how he was not feeling nervous about the wedding but would be more apprehensive about starting a family. He said he couldn't choose who should be his best man and so decided on asking all three to keep up with Kim, who is having four bridesmaids. He said: 'I'm actually not nervous about getting married to be honest, we've been together about nine and a half years so, we've lived together for six, seven years as well so I don't think a whole lots going to change. 'I think I'll be more nervous about starting a family because I feel like for me, that would be more life changing, in a good way but, I kind of feel we have been married already in the way we spend our lives together and live together so I'm not that nervous about the day at all. 'I'm going to have a couple of best men. Jamie's going to be one of them, Ross is also going to be a best man. 'Hopefully my good friend Carlos from Spain, in Barcelona. 'The thing for me is it's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because Kim has four bridesmaids and I was saying well, 'why is that fine for you?' 'Imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you've had since you were at school. it's very difficult to chose one. Murray is due to marry girlfriend of nine years Kim Sears (second left) at his Cromlix House Hotel in Dunblane next month (pictured, Murray as best man at brother Jamie's wedding at the hotel in 2010) Murray said it was unfair that Kim was allowed to name four bridesmaids, while he was only allowed one best man, so picked three including his brother (pictured, the pair play together during the 2012 Olympics) 'She was like, ""Come on, come on, pick one"". I said, ""No, it's difficult, so I think I'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come"".' Murray and Hutchins are former roommates and known to be very close. When Murray won the Brisbane International in 2012, he dedicated the win to Hutchins. In a post-match speech he paid tribute to a 'friend' who was watching back home, adding 'you're going to get through', a reference to Hutchins diagnosis with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer. Ross Hutchins (left) was a roommate of Murray's, and Murray supported him through his battle with cancer, while Mier (right) was Murray's best friend while he was training in Spain . Murray will wed Kim Sears at the Cromlix Hotel which he owns in Dunblane, where he grew up, during a ceremony to be held there next month . Murray has since revealed that his double-handed victory salute, in which he points both index fingers at the sky, was a sign to Hutchins to show he was thinking of him. Mier, meanwhile, was Murray's roommate and hitting partner while he was at Academia Sánchez-Casal in Spain. The Peruvian has continued his friendship with Murray over the years, and still joins the Scot for the occasional practice. Speaking about his choice of best men, Murray added: 'I didn't spend loads of time with my brother when we were 15-20, he was training in France. The £1.8million hotel contains its own chapel (pictured), which is where Murray's brother Jamie got married to Alejandra Gutierrez in 2010 . The wedding party will have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from. Pictured: The Eden Room at the luxury hotel . The hotel underwent an extensive redevelopment after it was bought by the tennis ace and re-opened last year where suites can go for up to £600 per night . 'I was training in Spain, and my friend Carlos, he was my best friend during that time, which were very important years of my life when I moved away from my family and my friends and he was the guy who was always there for me, he was my best friend though that period. 'I feel like he knows extremely well from then, my brother knows me obviously since I was a child, and Ross over the last six or seven years, we've become extremely close and we've been through a lot together as well. 'So, picking one was for me, a very, very difficult thing to do because I had three guys who were clearly my three best friends and I would like all of them to be involved in some way.' Murray said he had no firm plans for a honeymoon yet but added: 'We will probably do it later in the year, probably in the off season. I'm not sure where we're going to go yet but there's a few ideas.' Murray proposed to Miss Sears, his girlfriend of nine years, in November last year with a three-carat diamond engagement ring, believed to be worth around £200,000 (pictured) Miss Sears has long been pictured at Murray's side, cheering him on from the sidelines (pictured, left after he won Wimbledon in 2013, and right after being caught swearing at the Australian open earlier this year)","Murray to marry Kim Sears at £1.8million Cromlix House Hotel next month .

"The average Wall Street bonus rose two percent in 2014 as hiring in New York City's financial sector picked up, according to a government report on Wednesday. The average bonus for New York City's security industry rose to $172,860 in 2014, the highest level since the financial crisis, said a report by the office of the New York State Comptroller. The loftier bonuses came despite a 4.5 percent drop in broker/dealer profits in 2014 to $16 billion, the report said. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The average Wall Street bonus rose two percent in 2014 as hiring in city's financial sector picked up according to a government report . The decline in profits was due to weakness in some trading divisions, costly legal settlements at large banks and higher capital reserve requirements imposed by regulators after the financial crisis. The industry added 2,300 jobs in New York City in 2014, the first year of positive job growth in the sector since 2011. 'The cost of legal settlements related to the 2008 financial crisis continues to be a drag on Wall Street profits, but the securities industry remains profitable and well-compensated even as it adjusts to regulatory changes,' said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. 'The resumption of job growth in the securities industry bodes well for New York's economy, but it remains to be seen whether this trend will be sustained.' 'One area that anecdotally we keep hearing is a growth sector is compliance,' DiNapoli said. The average increase in bonuses in 2014 was well below the rise notched in the previous two years. Average bonuses fell from a peak of $191,360 on average in 2006 to $100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis. Average bonuses had fallen from a peak of $191,360 in 2006 to $100,850 in 2008 during the financial crisis . The average salary including bonuses on Wall Street was $355,500 in 2013, according to an October report from the comptroller's office. 'The compensation is five times the average for private employment in the city,' DiNapoli said. 'But it's a challenging work environment, and in recent years because of the downsizing it's been harder to get these positions.' Authorities have blamed inflated mortgage-backed securities that plummeted along with the U.S. housing market for the financial crisis in 2008. Regulatory reforms since have included larger reserve requirements, new limits on proprietary trading and measures intended to reduce risk. Securities firms now pay a smaller share of bonuses in the current year with more deferred. DiNapoli added that it's important to be concerned about excessive risk-taking and possible regulatory rollbacks to be sure there isn't another meltdown, noting the industry is key to the economic viability of the city and state. The goal should be a business model with sustainable profits, he said, not the short-term, high-risk, high-reward profits 'that invariably results in the periodic downturn or crash as we had.'","Bonuses for New York City's security industry rose on average by two percent in 2014 .

"British Islamic State hostage John Cantlie twice tried to escape his terrorist captors and suffered 'weeks and weeks' of torture as a result, a freed ISIS prisoner has revealed. Cantlie's punishment for trying to flee the Sunni extremists was so severe that the journalist almost drowned during one waterboarding session in northern Syria. Both of Cantlie's attempts to escape ISIS were carried out with the American journalist James Foley, who became the first Westerner to be beheaded on camera by the terror group's British executioner-in-chief Mohammed Emwazi - also known as 'Jihadi John' - last August. According to the former prisoner, during one of the escape attempts,  Foley, 40, had the chance to escape but refused to take the opportunity after his friend Cantlie, 43, was caught by the guards. Ordeal: British ISIS hostage John Cantlie (pictured in an ISIS propaganda video) twice tried to escape his terrorist captors and suffered 'weeks and weeks' of torture as a result, a freed prisoner has revealed . Tragic: Both of John Cantlie's (left) attempts to escape ISIS were carried out alongside American journalist James Foley (right). During one of the escape attempts, Foley, 40, actually had the chance to flee the prison but refused to take the opportunity after his friend Cantlie, 43, was caught by the guards . Sick: James Foley (left) became the first Westerner to be murdered by the terror group's British executioner in chief Mohammed Emwazi, also known as 'Jihadi John', (right) in a shocking filmed beheading last August . The details of Cantlie's punishment were revealed by Javier Espinosa, a Spanish journalist who was held by the radical Islamists between December 2013 and March last year. Mr Espinosa, a correspondent for Spanish newspaper El Mundo, wrote in the Times: 'Foley and Cantlie tried twice. The first was a failure before it started. They were caught trying to get off their handcuffs with a skeleton key they made. 'On the second occasion, the American showed his true humanity. After getting out of the room where the prisoners were, he had to wait for Cantlie who was to escape second. 'The guard saw that Cantlie (had freed himself) and Foley could have tried to escape on his own, but gave himself up. ""I couldn't leave John on his own"", Foley said. 'The attempts by Foley and Cantlie caused them weeks and weeks of punishment. Blow after blow. Attempted drownings. More blows. ""They were literally trying to kill us for weeks until they realised that we had given up trying to escape"", Cantlie had said.' Cantlie, who has been held captive for over two years, has appeared in multiple propaganda videos for the extremist group, often dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sitting behind a desk. Foley was the first of several hostages to be beheaded in a video posted online by ISIS last August. Film: Cantlie last appeared in a documentary-style production titled From Inside Halab, the ancient name for the Syrian city of Aleppo, reporting on a range of topics including education, drone strikes and Sharia law . Forced: John Cantlie, who has been held captive for over two years, has appeared in multiple propaganda videos for the extremist group, often dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sat behind a desk . Story: Details of Cantlie's punishments were revealed by Javier Espinosa, a Spanish journalist who was held along with his colleague Ricardo Garcia Vilanova (left) by ISIS between December 2013 and March last year . Freed: The moment journalist Javier Espinosa was reunited with his son on the tarmac of a Spanish airport after spending months in captivity, held by ISIS terrorists . Three British teenage jihadists were in custody last night after a dramatic security operation stopped them joining Islamic State fighters in Syria. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Turkey after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. But last night they were released on bail. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.' Investigators hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so. The case highlights the difficult balancing act the security services face in dealing with would-be jihadists desperate to sign up to the militant Islamist cause. The details of the escape attempts follow hints by Cantlie that he suffered waterboarding - a torture technique associated with America's CIA - in a propaganda video released by ISIS. In the fifth episode of a series titled Lend Me Your Ears, released in November, he said: 'Now, unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State. 'Some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors, as Muslim prisoners are waterboarded by their American captors.' Cantlie last appeared in a documentary-style production titled From Inside Halab, the ancient name for the Syrian city of Aleppo, reporting on a range of topics including education, drone strikes and Sharia law. The hostage seems well in the film released last month, appearing dressed in black trousers and a brown coat, although he ominously described it as 'the last in this series'. Mr Cantlie's father Paul, 80, died from complications following pneumonia last year. His sister, Jessica Cantlie, has previously appealed for 'direct contact' with the militants holding him. ISIS has posted a number of videos of hostages being murdered, including British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning last year.","British journalist, 43, made two separate attempts to escape ISIS captors .

"For many women, being mistaken for a celebrity is the ultimate compliment. But for Sabrina May, who was compared to Gemma Collins, it only made her cringe. Every time that Sabrina from Essex was out in public, she would be mistaken for the The Only Way Is Essex star. In fact, one night somebody even asked the size 22 florist for her autograph. After five years of this unwanted stardom, Sabrina decided that it was time to make a change to her appearance - and she lost seven stone and slimmed down to a size 10 as a result. Scroll down for video . Sabrina May, 29, used to be mistaken for TOWIE star Gemma Collins before she lost seven stone in weight . Sabrina, 29, who at her heaviest was 16st 12lb, said: 'I've always been a TOWIE fan and thought Gemma was great. 'We were both big, bubbly, blonde Essex girls with a love of pie and chips and cocktails. However, I still never thought I was as big as her. 'I was kidding myself about my weight. I was genuinely surprised and gutted when people started mistaking me for her. 'When I was asked to sign the autograph I knew it was time to change - it was the wake-up call I needed.' Sabrina, who at her heaviest was 16st 12lb, left, was even asked for her autograph when someone mistook her for Gemma Collins but she went on to shed the pounds on a health kick, right, and is now a size 10 . Sabrina admits her whole family would sit down and tuck into giant home-cooked dinners, which left them all feeling overweight . Every time that Sabrina from Essex was out in public, she would be mistaken for the The Only Way Is Essex star Gemma Collins, right . Sabrina says she began putting on weight in her early twenties when her lifestyle changed after leaving college. The mother-of-one, from Chelmsford, said: 'I stopped being so active when I was a student.' And she admits her whole family would sit down and tuck into giant home-cooked dinners, which left them all feeling overweight. Sabrina said: 'My father Paul was a big guy who loved his food. He used to say life was too short for dieting and to just have what you enjoyed. But unfortunately, when he was 26st, he died. 'Of course, we all knew that at his weight he wasn't the healthiest but we had no idea just how serious it was.' After losing her father, who was overweight, she was  terrified that her own weight might take her away from her own son so she decided to do something about it . She heard about the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan on Facebook and liked the fact it gave her 24-hour access to online support with other slimmers so she signed up . In January 2012, Paul was taken to hospital but medics struggled to diagnose his condition. Just ten days later he died of multiple organ failure and doctors confirmed that his weight had played a part. Sabrina said: 'He was just too unhealthy and his size made him hard to treat. 'I was lost without him and terrified that my own weight might take me away from my son. I didn't want to put him through what I was going through losing dad. 'I knew I didn't want to leave my Taylor, who is now three, without a mum.' The plan also allowed her to eat lots of her favourite foods, but cooked in different ways. They are always served without carbohydrates . Sabrina also made sure she visited the gym and the weight soon started to drop off . She vowed to ditch the chips and get slim but her grief always led her back to the fridge. And unfortunately for Sabrina, she loved unhealthy foods and would feast on large bowls of pasta, crisps, wine and chocolate. Her weight rocketed when she fell pregnant with Tyler in 2010, and she remained a size 22 after he was born. Sabrina said: 'I would live on milky coffee all day telling myself I was being healthy. 'But at night, when my son was in bed, I would binge eat anything and everything I could get my hands on. 'It never seemed odd to me because all my family loved food. I still made an effort with my hair and make-up and wore smart clothes, so I thought I looked OK.' Before she lost weight, Sabrina loved unhealthy foods and would feast on large bowls of pasta, crisps, wine and chocolate and never used the gym . Her weight rocketed when she fell pregnant with Tyler in 2010, and she remained a size 22 after he was born . Like a lot of people trying conventional diets, Sabrina found she was back to the fatty foods within a month. A year later, when she went out with friends to her favourite Essex haunt, she was asked to sign the autograph and decided enough was enough. Sabrina said: 'I just laughed it off and made a joke of it but inside I was mortified and vowed I would diet.' She heard about the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan on Facebook and liked the fact it gave her 24-hour access to online support with other slimmers. As a single mother, the one-off payment appealed too - so she signed up in April 2013. In the first ten days Sabrina lost a stone and says the motivation to continue came from the Facebook page, which she could log on to for support night and day. After she started weightlifting at the gym, she began to see results on her stomach. Sabrina says it used to flap around, but it is now smooth and toned . The plan also allowed her to eat lots of her favourite foods, but cooked in different ways. They are always served without carbohydrates. Sabrina says: 'I had a cooked breakfast every day and enjoyed big lunches and dinner. To be honest, I was probably eating more than I had been when I was fat.' Four months in and she had already dropped 4st and was a size 16. She said: 'I was thrilled but I still looked like Gemma so I wanted to keep going, especially because my tummy was still massive.' In December 2013, Sabrina started working out at a gym to boost her weight loss and tone up. And finally, after she started weightlifting at the gym, she began to see results on her stomach. Sabrina says it used to flap around, but it is now smooth and toned. Within 13 months she had dropped down to 9st 12lb and is now a size ten. Sabrina still works the Essex look, but has not been mistaken for Gemma since she started losing weight. She added: 'I still love Gemma but I'm pleased that I don't get mistaken for her any more.'","Sabrina May, 29, was always mistaken for TOWIE star .

"Controversial: Hertz installed the cameras as part of the in-car NeverLost app in 2014 . Car rental company Hertz has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles. The controversial device was installed as part of the in-car navigation system and guide, NeverLost 6 app, which was introduced in 2014. Drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy, but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on. They also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming. The cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary. To start a conversation, the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature hasn't been integrated into the system. Rich Broome, a spokesman for Hertz, told the Daily Mail Online it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely. He added that there is 'nothing behind the lens' and there is no timetable to connect the device. However some drivers who regularly rent from Hertz have still expressed their concern at the camera's presence. One customer wrote on the forum Flyertalk: 'I am a regular renter from Hertz (President's Circle). This week after the usual excessive wait for the Hertz airport shuttle, I got into a rental car at O'Hare airport. 'I immediately noticed the new NeverLost and I was completely shocked to see a camera built into the device looking at me. The system can't be turned off from what could tell. Further investigation revealed that the camera can see the entire inside of the car. 'I know rental car companies have been tracking the speed and movements of their vehicles for years but putting a camera inside the cabin of the vehicle is taking their need for information a little too far. Breach of privacy? Some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device, but the hire car firm said there is 'nothing behind the lens' and the camera simply doesn't work . 'I find this to be completely unacceptable In fact, if I get another car from Hertz with a camera in it, I will move our business from Hertz completely. I influence car rentals of many others and I don't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light. 'Given what Hertz has invested in this system, I wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this. Business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer.' The company told a Twitter user who criticized the use of the lens: 'The camera in the NeverLost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time.' Mr Broome added that if any customer has any concerns with the device, they can simply switch to another car. Only 20 per cent of the cars have a camera inside. It is not the first time in-car recording technology has caused a stir. Last year Chevrolette released a new Corvette with a 'nanny cam' inside - aimed at keeping an eye on suspicious valets. But General Motors were forced to send an advisory to customers warning them not to use the product as it is illegal in some states.","Devices installed as part of the in-car navigation and guide system .

"Two 'petite' firearms officers who won a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns have spoken out against the 'malicious' police force amid claims they are being 'starved' back to work. Victoria Wheatley and Rachael Giles won their sex discrimination case against the Civil Nuclear Constabulary on the grounds they could not reach the trigger at a hearing in February last year. But now both women believe their careers are over, a remedy hearing at Central London Employment Tribunal heard today. Ms Wheatley branded the organisation's attitude towards her as 'disgraceful' while Ms Giles claimed the case had brought her 'a great deal of stress and anxiety', adding: 'They are making me choose between my mental health and paying the bills.' Bullied: Firearms officer Rachael Giles, who sued the British Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) after claiming her firearm was too big for her small hand, says she has been bullied by the 'malicious' force . Both women, in their 30s, are still employed by the constabulary but are on sick leave due to stress on pensionable pay - resulting in them not getting full pay. They had returned to work after winning their case last year but Miss Wheatley complained they only did 'menial' jobs which was 'completely belittling and humiliating.' They are part of the armed CNC and help protect power stations at Sellafield in Cumbria and Chapelcross in Dumfries and Galloway. Both claimed at the original tribunal that their reputations were damaged because their unsuitable equipment - a Glock 17 - meant they received lower marks than men in firing range tests while protective gear was too big for their small heads and legs. The tribunal found the CNC guilty of indirect sex discrimination but dismissed claims of victimisation. In going though the series of complaints made by the women today, John Cavanagh QC, representing the CNC, noted that Miss Giles felt the force's treatment of her has been 'malicious and unpleasant'. Miss Giles, who was diagnosed with depression in February 2014, claimed: 'I believe that my career with the constabulary is at an end.' She added that she has 'no faith in the constabulary and that I would be treated fairly'. She suggested that her mental health has not been helped by the time it has taken to try and resolve the case, and even doubts whether the CNC believes they have done anything wrong. She added: 'The constabulary has behaved in a particularly malicious manner. I believe this has been to intimidate.' Mr Cavanagh also said that Miss Wheatley had claimed that she had been put on pensionable pay. Petite: Both complained that the handle of her Glock 17 pistol (pictured) was too big for her hands . He noted that she believes 'this was an attempt to starve her back to to work so that the claim can be made that she is fit and well and totally unaffected'. The women were also left disappointed because they felt nothing had changed in the force despite them winning their sex discrimination case last year. Giving evidence today Dr Stephen Tyrer, a consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, told the tribunal: 'They were hoping for change but nothing happened.' The psychiatrist added he believed both of the women were suffering from 'adjustment Disorder' - a short-term condition that occurs when a person has great difficulty coping with, or adjusting to, a particular source of stress. Describing Miss Giles' condition further he added: 'She's had a depressive illness that has prompted treatment. 'It has taken a very long time to deal with and this has exasperated the claimants' mental health issues.' He believed both women would need a course of cognitive behaviour therapy to help combat their stress. However the tribunal did hear the constabulary has since ordered an equality impact assessment and offered the women the chance to re-take their shooting tests with a G4 gun which has a smaller handle. But Mr Cavanagh said: 'They had both rejected the offer that they could take the shooting test with a different gun with a smaller handle.' The constabulary had applied to appeal the decision but their application to appeal was rejected in June 2014. The hearing - expected to last four days - continues.","Victoria Wheatley and Rachael Giles won  case against the Civil Nuclear Constabulary last year on the grounds they could not reach the trigger .

"Britain should ban major Russian tycoons like Roman Abramovich from London, Vladimir Putin's most prominent foe has demanded. The owner of Chelsea Football Club and his family should be hit by new Western sanctions aimed at hurting the strongman's regime and those who propped it up, claimed Alexei Navalny. He called for the same curbs on leading Arsenal FC shareholder, Alisher Usmanov, in a bid to force the Kremlin's hand over Ukraine. Britain should ban major Russian tycoons like Roman Abramovich from London, demanded Vladimir Putin's most prominent foe, Alexei Navalny (pictured) These Russian moneymen are seen as close to strongman Putin, but sanctions so far have not hit them directly. Navalny, released from a short jail sentence in Moscow this week, is seeking to inspire the Russian opposition after the brutal murder of fellow Putin foe Boris Nemtsov in the shadow of the Kremlin. 'You can draw up a blacklist of about 1,000 people who will no longer be allowed entry into Western countries, and you can do it quietly, without any big announcement,' the anti-corruption blogger and lawyer told The Financial Times. Navalny believes that if tycoons such as Abramovich (pictured) can't get to their London residences, it will put pressure on Moscow to pull out of Ukraine . 'Usmanov, Abramovich, and their families - if they can't get to their residences in London or in Switzerland, that will make a difference.' It was essential to hit the wealthy clans who help Putin control Russia, he said. To weaken Putin's resolve over Ukraine, he warned the West: 'You have to hit the propagandists of war, the ones who finance the war.' This was the only way to stop him, he said. Russian oligarchs 'all hate him but they feel they can't but remain silent'. 'A few years ago, we thought this was just nepotism, but now we realise that this is long-term planning: he is installing dynastic rule,' he said. Some wealthy tycoons untouched by sanctions backed Putin to the hilt yet flew to the West to enjoy weekends. He said of the slain Nemtsov that he was a 'communicator' who was 'not afraid'. Navalny added: 'He could bring together everyone in the opposition from liberals to the far left, but he would also talk to people inside the system, like the Communists, who did not accept his views but were open to dialogue with him.' With Nemtsov now dead, Navalny is seen as Russia's most effective and charismatic opposition campaigner.","Alexei Navalny says if tycoons can't get to London, it will pressure Moscow .

"Motorists face a new speed camera blitz and £100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of Britain’s busiest roads . Motorists face a new speed camera blitz and £100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of Britain’s busiest roads. Until now, lower speed limits have been restricted to smaller roads in residential areas or near schools. But in a major policy shift, 20mph limits are to be introduced on major arterial roads – and policed by the latest digital speed cameras. Campaigners say it is the start of a radical new nationwide attempt to slow traffic down. London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday revealed that eight pilot schemes will be run on ‘Red Routes’ – the main arterial roads that carry a third of the capital’s traffic. Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and many other towns and cities say they also intend to introduce the new limits. Motorists caught breaking the 20mph limit face a minimum £100 fine and three points on their driving licence. The AA says the new limits are being driven more by ‘dogma’ than road safety. A spokesman said: ‘These 20mph zones are popping up like spring daffodils. ‘There is a lot of fear among drivers that, with 20mph being a relatively unfamiliar speed, widespread speed camera use will make them look more at their speedometers than at what is happening on populated streets in front of them.’ If the 18-month trials in London are judged a success, the 20mph limits will be made permanent and imposed on 30 miles of key ‘Red Routes’ considered by transport bosses to be ‘more local road than motorway’. Some 175 miles of residential streets, about a quarter of the capital’s roads, already have 20mph limits. The trend is spreading across Britain. Following a pilot scheme, Bristol has spent more than £2.3million installing 20mph signs. Manchester is consulting on half the city being similarly covered, and 6,000 Edinburgh residents have signed a petition against a £2.2million scheme to make up to 80 per cent of the Scottish capital a 20mph zone. Alec James, of Sustrans – a charity campaigning for healthier and cheaper transport – said of the London announcement: ‘This is a significant step up – and the next step on the road for more 20mph limits. Mayor of London Boris Johnson, pictured, wants to introduce new 20mph speed limits across the city . Upper Street in Islington, pictured, is also going to be hit by a 20mph limit as part of the 18-month trial . ‘It’s pioneering. For the first time 20mph limits are being imposed on main arterial roads – not just quiet residential roads where there is little traffic. We expect other cities to follow London’s lead.’ But the AA says while 20mph limits have their place, they should not be introduced where they will increase traffic jams and pollution – and where residents want them, not imposed in a ‘blanket’ fashion. A blanket rollout of 20mph zones in towns and cities will result in millions of pounds in fines pouring into Treasury coffers, the AA warned last night. Motorists caught on speed cameras going over 20mph will be fined a minimum of £100, and get three points on their licence. The money goes to the Treasury. Until 2007, Safety Camera Partnerships kept all the cash they raised from fines, often using it to buy more cameras to generate more money. This led to motorists complaining that the cameras were being used as ‘cash cow’ revenue-raisers. To defuse the controversy, the system was scrapped and all fines are paid directly to the Treasury, which in turn returns the cash as a general road safety grant to pay for cameras and ‘other measures’. The AA says it does not oppose 20mph limits where appropriate and where they are supported by residents, but it fears many councils and campaign groups are being driven by ‘an inherent or institutional prejudice against the motor car’. A spokesman said: ‘The blanket rollout of so many 20mph limits and zones is going to push lots of money into Treasury coffers and give them a cash windfall. Worried drivers may feel well and truly fleeced if they are caught on camera and fined for being marginally over the speed limit.’ Other councils which have implemented or are committed to adopting new 20mph limits include Portsmouth, Oxford, Bristol, Newcastle, Warrington, Sheffield, York, Middlesbrough, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Brighton & Hove, Leicester, Cambridge, Coventry, Bath & North East Somerset, Darlington, Wigan, Rochdale, Shipley, Bury, Bolton, Nottingham, Calderdale, together with numerous London boroughs. Under the new London scheme, the first road to convert to 20mph next month will be Commercial Street in Shoreditch, linking into plans for Tower Hamlets and Hackney to become 20mph boroughs. Transport for London said: ‘Safety cameras across London are being upgraded to new digital cameras which will have the capability to help police enforce 20mph speed limits’, adding that it hoped the new limits will reduce the number of pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent by 2020. Rod King, founder of the ‘20’s Plenty for Us’ campaign group, said: ‘The current 30mph national limit is being rejected as “unfit for purpose” for communities so we’re setting out a series of government actions required for a planned transition to a UK default urban limit of 20mph by 2020.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Research shows 20mph zones can save lives and this government has made it easier for councils to introduce them. ‘It is for local authorities to set speed limits and for the police to decide how best to enforce them.’ The spokesman added: ‘We are undertaking a three-year research project to better understand the effect of 20mph zones and their impact on local communities.’ r.massey@dailymail.co.uk .","Speed limits on major arterial roads to be lowered in major policy shift .

"Maddie Munden works as an official toast tester for Asda in Leeds, nibbling 50,000 slices a year . For Maddie Munden a slice of toast in the morning is anything but a hasty breakfast grabbed on the way to work. The 41-year-old nibbles on up to 90 loaves a week, chewing her way through 50,000 slices of bread every single year in her job as an official toast tester in a Leeds supermarket. Ms Munden tastes bread to ensure it is suitable for sale, ranking loaves by their taste, density and smell. And despite spending her working day eating toast Ms Munden insists the aroma of a freshly baked loaf or toasted slice of bread is still 'the ultimate smell.' 'Some people can't believe it when I tell them I'm tasting bread on daily basis, sometimes solidly from 9 til 5, but it's when the baker in me really comes out and having been in the industry for over 25 years, not much gets past me - only the really great stuff,' said Ms Munden. And despite eating bread on a daily basis, Ms Munden manages to stay fit by eating fruit and vegetables as well as going for an odd run round the block. Ms Munden comes from a baking background and began working at just 16. Four years later Ms Munden was awarded Master Baker Status and now works for Asda in Leeds. She added: 'I spend every waking minute thinking lighter loaves, bouncy buns and trends in breakfast treats, but bread is still one of my favourite foods. 'One of the most important parts of my job is making sure that our customers are getting the best and tastiest loaves and with over 300 lines in the in-store bread category, it's a full time job. 'We look at the life of the products and the density - I can't bear a heavy loaf. 'To me the smell of toast or bread baking in the oven is the ultimate smell.' Ms Munden rarely eats a whole slice of toast, but instead usually takes a bite from the crust and centre to get the full texture. As part of her official tasting role, Ms Munden also has to keep on top of the latest trends in bread and toast. She said cornbread is one of the most popular varieties at the moment, as is a combination of healthy grains with white loaves. Ms Munden, who spends most days munching on toast, still insists that bread is her favourite smell . The tester has been in the baking industry for 25 years and said baking is more a way of life than a job . Ms Munden tastes dozens of slices of toast a day, but has managed to remain slim. She added: 'I try and stay fit by going mountain biking and also by doing the odd run around the block as often as I can. I also try and maintain a balanced diet, and eat a good mix of fruit and vegetables each week too.' And to add some variety to her tasting role, Ms Munden recently got to turn her hand to cookies. In an average week Ms Munden might nibble through up to 90 loaves to test their taste, smell and density . Ms Munden is involved in watching out for new bread trends as well as developing new products in store . She said: 'It was nice to take a break from testing toast and taste the new cookies instead. 'I love being able to use my imagination to develop something the UK shoppers have previously been unable to buy in store. That's my favourite part of the job - seeing someone in store walk away with one of my products and I know they're in for a treat. 'I enjoy baking as far more than just a job - it's a way of life.'","Maddie Munden works as a toast tester for Asda supermarket in Leeds .

"A plus-size adult film star is using her career as a platform to reclaim the word 'fat' and show the world that all women - no matter what their size - are sexual beings. April Flores, from Los Angeles, made her porn industry debut after the famous adult film star Belladonna offered her a scene in one of her movies. The 38-year-old, who never imagined she would be in an adult film, thought the experience would be a one time thing, but it eventually became clear that performing was something she wanted to dedicate her life to. 'My goal with my work has been to show other women that we can be sexual and feel worthy of desire in the bodies we currently inhabit,' she told Daily Mail Online in an email. 'I want to show other women that they don't have to put off their happiness until they lose [a certain] amount of weight.' Confident: April Flores, from Los Angeles, is an award-winning plus size porn star . Speaking out: The 38-year-old is calling for larger women to reclaim the word 'fat' in the hopes that it will help them to feel more secure about their bodies . Part of April's mission is removing the negative connotations associated with the word fat. In 2013, April starred in Fat Girl, a book of photography shot by her husband Carlos Batts, who died a month after its release. 'Fat is not a bad word. I see it as a description and nothing more,' she said of her book's title. 'I plan to keep using fat in my projects as a way to change the negative connotation to a positive one.' April explained that society is reluctant to view fat women as sexual beings because they are never represented that way. 'Fat is never equated with sexuality or pride,' she said. 'I feel that in media, fat women are usually depicted as over-the-top characters, often filling the role of the punchline. 'It is still acceptable to make fun of an overweight person.' She added: 'I actually think society is reluctant to see a woman of any size as a person in control of her own sexuality.' Not so funny: April believes that it is still acceptable for society to use overweight people as the 'punchline' of a joke . Feel desired: The adult film star believes that women shouldn't have to lose weight in order to embrace their sexuality . April isn't sure there will ever a time when a young girl won't be phased by being called fat, noting that her issue is with those who verbally attack women in the first place. 'How can a girl not react to the way someone is trying to put her down?' she asked. 'The real question we might want to ask is if there will ever be a time people [will] stop judging young women and girls?' April noted that women are 'conditioned top think that think that thin equals desirability' and essentially happiness - a notion that she also fell prey to when she was younger. After losing weight and becoming a 'thin person', she realized she was still unhappy with her life. 'I had the realization that happiness would come from a choice to be happy,' April said. 'I realized that happiness would originate in my brain and not on my scale.' April's late husband, whom she was married to for 10 years, also helped her to learn to love her body. The couple first met in an art gallery where he had approached her about modeling for him. They married three years later. She became his muse and he greatly supported her adult film career. Tough times: Although April wants women of all sizes to feel confident in their appearance, she says it is impossible for a girl not to 'react to the way someone is trying to put her down' Helping hand: April's late husband, whom she was married to for 10 years, also helped her to learn to love her body . 'I was lucky to have a partner who was always very complimentary and genuinely attracted to my body in every state he saw it in,' she said. In the porn industry April is known as 'BBW', which is short for 'big beautiful woman'. She believes that the growing interest in the BBW industry would be less of a niche if more people were honest and open about being attracted to women of size. 'I have met men that are completely out and proud for their preference for fat women,' she said. 'I have also met men that admit that they keep their preference to themselves.' April explained that there are some people who are genuinely not attracted to her body type, which she said 'is fine', but there are also plenty of people who are. 'If more people had this discussion, then the stigma might lessen and there would be a greater understanding of how varied sexual desire really is,' she said. April has had many firsts as a BBW star. In 2014, she won the AVN BBW Performer of the Year award, which she said was a 'huge thrill' because it was the first time Adult Video News added that category to the awards ceremony. She won the award this year as well. Super star: Since starting her career in the porn industry, April won numerous awards and accolades for her performances and her late husband even published a book, titled Fat Girl, which featured risque images of her . Lasting memory: While April's late husband Carlos Batts (R) passed away in 2013, the level of confidence that he helped her to achieve remains . She was also the first BBW start to cover AVN magazine, as well as the first plus-size adult entertainer to have a sex toy molded from her body. April, who is launching her website Fat Girl Fantasies this spring, said she is excited to share her perspective after 15 years of being in front of the camera. She explained that her site will 'feature beautifully created work', which includes all body types, ethnicities, and sexual and gender identities. 'We are constantly made to feel that we aren't good enough from so many aspects of life,' she said. 'I want my work to be a counter to this negativity. I want to do what I can, in my own way to be the a source of encouragement for women to feel good about themselves.' April said that if she can tell women one that it would be that they are 'unique and beautiful just the way [they] are'. 'Life is so short and it can be hard, but we need to enjoy this moment and this day.'","April Flores, from Los Angeles, is an award-winning film star and has starred in more than 15 adult films .

"A multimillionaire food tycoon's son who left a toddler brain damaged and paralysed following a horror car crash has been jailed for a second time after assaulting a man. Antonio Boporan Singh, 28, was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder after two men were punched, kicked and one was hit with a champagne glass at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar. Singh, heir to a £130million chicken fortune, has already served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road in November 2006. Scroll down for video . Antonio Boparan Singh, right, pictured with his food tycoon father Ranjit, right at an earlier court appearance. The 28-year-old has been sentenced to a year in jail after attacking a man in a brutal bar attack . His latest jail sentence comes after a brawl at the upmarket Birmingham bar last April. During the fight, one victim, Jarondeep Kooner, was slashed across the face with a champagne flute by Theodore Mullings-Fairweather, who then repeatedly kicked and stamped on the man as he lay injured on the floor. Singh from Little Aston, West Midlands - who earlier paid £400 to secure a VIP table at the bar - left the club with Mullings-Fairweather and alongside Edward Ansah and Nathan Pringle. But as they walked into a nearby street the group saw a 31-year-old man with his shirt ripped. Assuming him to be part of the group involved in the fight, Mullings-Fairweather and Singh punched and kicked him to the ground before running off. The minute-long attack was captured on CCTV and left both victims, Harprit Singh and Mr Kooner, requiring hospital treatment. Mr Kooner, 22, suffered a fractured eye socket and has since lost use of an eye. Two men were punched, kicked and one hit with a champagne flute in the attack last April at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar, pictured . Singh had pleaded guilty to one count of inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder at Birmingham Crown Court in February, and was given one year in jail on Friday. Mullings-Fairweather, 25, from Selly Oak, Birmingham admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and was jailed for eight years. He also received another eight years for a separate offence of robbery after stealing a cash box from outside a Tesco store. Singh's father Ranjit Singh Boparan owns 2 Sisters Food Group - a Birmingham-based food-manufacturing company. Established in 1993 as a frozen retail cutting operation, it has grown rapidly and expanded to cover 36 manufacturing sites in the UK, eight in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and one in Poland. The group employs 23,000 people, and has annual sales of £3.4billion. It is listed 14th on the 2014 Sunday Times Top Track 100. The company is now the third largest food company in the UK by turnover. Brands include Fox's Biscuits, Goodfella's, Donegal Catch and Green Isle. Harry Ramsden's was sold to Boparan Ventures Ltd in 2010, the private investment branch of his business empire. Pringle, 32, from Erdington, Birmingham, and Ansah, 24, from Sutton Coldfield, both admitted violent disorder and were given 18 months imprisonment. Addressing Singh, Judge Simon Drew QC said: 'The assault occasioning actual bodily harm took place after the violent assault and should be considered entirely separate and was a gratuitous attack. 'It involved you kicking a man on the ground to the head. These courts regard that conduct as very serious.' Michael Wolkind, defending, said Singh had not been drinking that night and said he led a 'cautious' lifestyle. He added the 28-year-old had dedicated his life to the Boparan Charitable Trust, which helps sick children. After the hearing, Detective Constable Allan Jones, who led the inquiry, said: 'This was a violent attack which devastated the lives of two young men. 'Both needed extensive medical treatment and the 22-year-old has suffered permanent sight loss as a result of this group's actions. Singh had previously been jailed for 21 months for hitting the car Cerys Edwards was in while overtaking at 70mph in a 30mph area in November 2006. The youngster, now nine-years-old, was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive. Speaking after the sentencing, the father of Cerys's father, Gareth, 50, from Sutton Coldfield said: 'I think his sentence is very lenient considering his previous conviction. Toddler Cerys Edwards, who was left unable to talk and walk and requires a ventilator to breathe, after the car she was travelling in was hit by Singh . The impact of the crash was so severe that Cerys, pictured before the incident, was ripped from her baby seat and her spine was fractured . 'He won't learn anything from this and he will just do it again and again. I think it would take someone actually dying for him to stop and think. 'It's just absolutely ridiculous what he has done. He is the son of a millionaire, he couldn't want for anything. I just can't get my head round that mentality. He's out of control.' Singh, was just 19 when he caused Cerys' life threatening injuries while speeding in his powerful Range Rover Sport. The impact of the crash in Sutton Coldfield was so severe the 11-month-old was ripped from her baby seat and her spine fractured. The car was bought by his wealthy parents, Ranjit and Baljinder Boparan, who run the 2 Sisters Food Group, the third largest food company in the UK by turnover with an annual revenue of £3.4billion. The outrage over Singh's sentence at the time sparked a campaign demanding government action. Singh crashed the Range Rover his parents bought him when he was overtaking the Edwards family car at 70mph in a 30mph area . More than 13,000 campaigners supported tougher sentences and a petition was also delivered to Westminster by Cerys's parents in July 2009. Labour's former Justice Minister Jack Straw called the Edwards family himself to give them the news about what became known as 'Cerys's Law'. As a result of the changes anyone convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving now faces up to five years in prison instead of the previous maximum of two. Cerys was awarded £5 million compensation in 2012 along with a guaranteed annual payout of £450,000 for the rest of her life. At the time Judge Martin McKenna, sitting at Birmingham County Court, described it as the 'saddest and most tragic case' he had ever come across.","Antonio Boporan Singh admitted his part in the brutal attack on two men following a bar brawl in Birmingham .

"Killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was able to hide his psychological problems from airline bosses because of a 'gaping hole' in the system for assessing pilot health, an air safety expert has claimed. Lubitz had torn up a sick note declaring him unfit to fly on the day he crashed a Germanwings plane into a rocky ravine in the Alps, killing himself and everyone on board. The 27-year-old is believed to have consulted medics about severe psychological and visual disorders and been told he was too ill to fly by two doctors before the crash. But due to confidentiality rules, this information was not passed onto Gemanwings operator Lufthansa and he was able to fly the doomed Airbus A320 that day. Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz was able to conceal his health issues from Lufthanza because of Germany's privacy laws which mean GPs cannot disclose information about their patients' health and the onus rests of employees . Under patient confidentiality rules, which also operate in the UK, pilots do not have to disclose their profession to GPs and doctors are not able to pass on their concerns to airlines. The onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on the 'honesty' of pilots. Tony Newton, a British pilot who has flown Airbus A320s for 20 years and who also works as a Civil Aviation Authority examiner, said that the system 'has to change'. 'It's a gaping hole in the system. It would happen in the UK as well,' he said. 'As a pilot, my medical life at work and my medical life at home are absolutely separate, unless I choose otherwise. Nobody checks that you communicate your health problems to the airline. 'Pilots have a yearly medical examination, which includes a chat about how we've been feeling psychologically, but it's fairly low-key. 'If I go to the GP, there it no requirement for me to disclose that I'm a pilot. 'And if I see the doctor for something that may affect my ability to perform my duties, he is prevented from communicating that to the airline because of medical confidentiality. 'The onus is on me to hold my hands up and tell the aviation authorities. The system is not well policed. It relies on honesty. A simple headstone has been laid in Seyne-les-Alpes, the closest accessible site to the area of the crash . Flowers have been laid at the headstone, known as a stele, to remember those who died in the crash . 'There is a legal obligation for pilots to tell their employers if they have surgery, or an illness that requires more than 21 days off work, or have been prescribed a long list of certain drugs. 'But the GP doesn't get involved.' Lubitz had visited Dusseldorf University hospital in February and more recently on March 10 and is believed to have been concerned about vision problems. An ex-girlfriend claimed he had always dreamed of flying larger planes but had recently recognised his ambition could not come true because of his mental health problems. The co-pilot had previously been treated by psychiatrists for 'burnout syndrome' which required him to take a break from pilot training in 2009. He was allowed to complete his training in 2013 and get a pilot's licence, under the condition he had regular medical exams. But it appears that because of confidentiality laws governing GPs, Lufthansa would not have been informed about Lubitz's struggles unless he told them himself. French gendarmes have been at the crash site, recovering clues and body parts from the wreckage . Dozens of search workers have been deployed by helicopter because the crash site is so inaccessible . Officials confirmed that Lubitz's remains have already been found, and not a single body had been recovered . Mr Newton added: 'I'd like to see a more robust mechanism. Most pilots don't go around intentionally exploiting it, but the door is open for someone who has serious mental problems to hide it from the aviation examiner. 'It also leaves the door open for mistakes. 'A pilot friend of mine quit smoking with help from a drug prescribed by his GP. 'He mentioned it casually to the airline examiners a few months later, and they told him he shouldn't have been flying under the influence of that drug. 'He had no idea. If there had been a crash, it would have been appalling. 'It's very dangerous and the system needs to be tightened up.' Lufthanza said it was unaware of any psychosomatic or other illness affecting the co-pilot. German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported investigators had found evidence to suggest Lubitz was concerned he was losing his eyesight, possibly because of a detached retina. The condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients and is often marked by flashes in the eye. Relatives of victims, including Philip Bramley (centre) have gathered at the site of the crash in Le Vernet . Flowers and candles have been laid by mourners at the headquarters of Germanwings in Cologne . It causes blurred vision and without treatment can lead to blindness. The newspaper reported that it is unclear whether his vision problems had physical or psychological causes. Lubitz is believed to have locked pilot Patrick Sonderheimer out of the cockpit when he left to go to the toilet before he put the plane into a descent. Black box recordings revealed that Sonderheimer hammered on the door asking to be allowed in, but Lubitz failed to answer. Minutes later on Tuesday morning the plane crashed into the Alps at a speed of 400mph, killing everyone on board. Among the dead were three Britons - including a seven-month-old baby. Since the tragedy a picture of Lubitz has emerged as a passionate and dedicated flyer who had previously struggled with a bout of depression. He was focused on flying, having joined a glider club when he was just 15. Committed and ambitious, his former girlfriend Maria told German newspaper Bild that Lubitz had hoped to fly larger planes, such as the Boeing 747 jumbo jet. 'She said that he recognised in the last month that his dream cannot come true because of his mental illness,' Bild reporter John Puthenpurackal told the Sunday Times. Lubitz's former girlfriend also said he would get 'angry' about his conditions at work and struggled with the pressure of holding onto his job. She claimed she ended the affair because she realised the pilot had problems. French Red Cross members and residents living nearby have paid tribute to the 150 people killed in the crash . While Maria claims to have been in a relationship with him, he shared his Düsseldorf flat with a woman who was believed to have been his fiancée. Large quantities of prescription medicines for treating mental illness were found at his flat. As well as his passion for flying, he is believed to have been an avid runner - training for the Iron Man endurance rest in Hawaii. Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said he met the father of Andreas Lubitz at a memorial on Thursday for relatives of those who died in the crash. 'He was distraught with grief. He was a completely broken man who is carrying all the responsibility of this drama on his back,' Bartolini said on BFM-TV. 'He lost a loved one, but also because his son is perhaps the (cause) of this tragedy.'","Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz tore up a sick note declaring him unfit to fly .

"These 170-year-old images reveal what life was like in the world’s most famous canal city before it was mobbed by hordes of gondola-riding tourists. Some of the earliest photos of Venice – snapped in the 1840s and 1850s – show an empty piazza in front of St Mark’s Basilica, the Ca’ d’Oro palace under restoration, and a Grand Canal with very little boat traffic. The tranquil scenes are a far cry from modern-day Venice, which is visited by an estimated 10 million tourists a year. Scroll down for video . This photo from the book shows Venice's tranquil Grand Canal and Ca' d'Oro palace under restoration in 1845 . The Ducal Palace (right), Zecca di Venezia (left) and the St Mark's Campanile bell tower are pictured, circa 1851 . The black and white photos, discovered in a UK country auction in 2006, have been confirmed as daguerreotypes – images developed on a polished metal plate – that belonged to influential Victorian art critic and writer John Ruskin. The ‘lost photographs’ were taken mostly by Ruskin, who died in 1900 at the age of 80, while he was working on his three-volume treatise on Venetian art and architecture. They include the largest collection of daguerreotypes of Venice and possibly the earliest surviving photos of the French and Swiss Alps. The photos have been preserved and identified by collectors and historians Ken and Jenny Jacobson, who have co-authored a book that documents Ruskin’s photography. A small group of people gathers at the piazza in front of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice in 1845; today the square is teeming with tourists . These photos show animal heads (left) and Noah's vine carved into pillars at Ducal Palace, which is now a museum . John Ruskin snapped or collected the images while he was working on his three-volume treatise on Venetian art and architecture . Based on their suspicion that the images belonged to Ruskin, the Essex couple acquired the lot at an auction in Cumbria, where Ruskin lived. A bidding war with another collector raised the price to £75,000 from an original estimate of just £80. Ken Jacobson, who has been collecting historic photos with his wife for almost 45 years, said: ‘The discovery of 188 previously unknown John Ruskin daguerreotypes has been the most exciting of our career. This photo shows Palazzo Gritti-Badoer with laundry hang drying on lines outside (circa 1846-1852) Ducal Palace was a popular photography spot; this image shows a south-facing window looking out towards a lagoon (circa 1849-1852) This photo from John Ruskin's collection shows moored boats in the harbour at Arona, Italy on a summer day in July 1858 . ‘The propitious circumstances of this find were truly magnified many times over by the fascinating discoveries we made during our research and the generosity, intelligence and friendship we shared with other scholars and our conservators. ‘We feel that the quality and unorthodox style of many of Ruskin’s daguerreotypes will come as a major surprise to both photographic historians and those in the field of Ruskin scholarship. ‘It is an astonishing accomplishment for a polymath better known for his achievements in so many other disciplines. Ruskin’s daguerreotypes would be a sensational new revelation in the history of photography even if he were completely unknown. We hope the work will be as intriguing to others as it has been to us.’ Published by Bernard Quaritch, the 432-page book, Carrying Off the Palaces: John Ruskin’s Lost Daguerreotypes, contains a fully illustrated catalogue raisonne of the 325 known daguerreotypes, plus details about the Jacobsons’ research.","The 170-year-old photos snapped or collected by the influential art critic are some of the earliest of Venice .

"After three months of closure, the Lindt Chocolate Café at the centre of the Sydney Siege is set to reopen in a matter of days. Workers at the scene of one of Australia's most infamous terror attacks  told The Daily Telegraph the Sydney CBD cafe will reopen by the end of the week. The café made headlines around the world in December when gunman Man Haron Monis held staff and patrons hostage there for about 17 hours. Scroll down for video .

Lawyer and mother Katrina Dawson, manager Tori Johnson and Monis died when police stormed the building on December 16. The sudden opening comes only one month after Lindt's chief executive Stephen Loane announced plans to recommence business. Mr Loane revealed in a statement that a key feature of the new store would be a memorial to the siege victims. 'We have taken this decision after careful consideration of a number of ­factors, the most important of which was consultation with our staff,' he said.

Louisa Hope, 52, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs a walking stick to move around, was one of the hostages that failed to get away and told 60 Minutes how she saw Mr Johnson die. Hostage Marcia Mikhael, 43, said Monis, who had a history of violence and extremism, told her he had a 'plan' to die in the standoff.

"RAF pilots have been banned from flying the new Lightning II fighter jets in a storm over fears the £100million plane could explode if struck by lightning. The Ministry or Defence said that the stealth F35-B, which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks, could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm. Named ‘Lightning II’, it was even at risk of its namesake while on the ground with pilots told to move it under cover if less than 11 miles away from a storm. RAF pilots have been banned from flying Lightning II fighter jets in a storm over fears it could explode . The fighter was created under  the U.S. 20-year Joint Strike Fighter programme, with the U.S. Government having ordered 2,500 of the Lockheed Martin planes. In Britain, 14 of the aircraft have been ordered to replace the ageing Harrier jump jet on the decks of the new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers. But a recent Pentagon report highlighted concerns over the placement of the jet's fuel tanks, which are located all the way through the wing, through the fuselage, around the inlets and back toward the engine. Pierre Sprey, a former Pentagon analyst who helped design the F-16 in the early 1970s, compared the engine to 'a blowtorch surrounded by fuel.' There was also a risk of catching fire if the fighter plane was shot at. Last June, an F-35 burst into flames as it was taxiing for take-off at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, because the engine had cracked during previous flights manoeuvres. One of the Pratt & Whitney engines broke apart, pushed through the top of the aeroplane, and caught fire while the pilot was preparing to take off. The entire fleet of F-35s was grounded for three weeks, and the plane missed its international debut. But that was not the end of problems for the fighter jets. The single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft boasts a helmet mounted display system which is supposed to offer a 360 degree view of the outside of the aircraft. But the MoD admitted there were still 'unresolved issues' surrounding the technology. The Ministry or Defence said that the stealth F35-B, which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks, could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm in case it was hit by lightning . SNP defence spokesman Angus Robertson, who brought up the safety issue in a series of parliamentary questions, told the Mirror the MoD were 'burying its head in the sand' over the jet's failures. He said: 'When they named the aircraft Lightning I don't think they expected that very thing would render them totally useless. Adding to this ­embarrassment is the revelation none of these new jets have yet broken the sound barrier.' The RAF website states that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was built to be a 'multi-role, all weather, day and night aircraft'. Planes have a top speed of 1,300mph, a range of 1,450 miles and can carry a range of weapons including air-to-air rockets and satellite guided bombs. The design also uses stealth technology which will allow pilots to minimise its radar signature.","The MoD has banned pilots flying £100m Lightning fighter jets in storms .

"Terry Thomas is one of a set of triplets who have been arrested after a student was shot with a stray bullet on Tuesday in Cleveland, Ohio . A set of triplets have been arrested after a schoolgirl was shot in the hip by a stray bullet during a stand-off between two vehicles. Tyrese Thomas, Terry Thomas and Terrance Thomas, all 18, were involved in the shootout in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, police said. One of the bullets hit Precious Marshall, 17, as she was walking home from softball practice around 5.10pm. She said she was on her way to a prom dress fitting and was 'puzzled' when she heard gunfire. 'I paused like ""oh my god what am I going to do?"" My mind was telling me run, but my body wasn't moving,' she told WKYC.com. When Miss Marshall, who knew the suspects when she was younger, realised she had been hit she ran inside the nearby Glenville Recreation Center. She was taken to the MetroHealth Medical Center but the bullet could not be removed as it was too close to her spine. It is not known whether Miss Marshall will have to have an operation but she said she can no longer play softball. The triplets were arrested around five hours later. Miss Marshall, who is still on crutches, said she thought she saw someone jump out of a black car before the shooting began. The other car is thought to be red. She added: 'Police should be around more. Like every corner.' Tyrese Thomas (left) and Terrance Thomas (right) have also been arrested. Miss Marshall was taken to the MetroHealth Medical Center but the bullet could not be removed as it was too close to her spine .

"Five former patients of Desmond D'Mello have tested positive for hepatitis C after claims he ignored infection control rules . Five former patients of a dentist accused of putting lives at risk amid claims he flouted infection control rules, have tested positive for hepatitis C. Desmond D'Mello's alleged refusal to follow NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days. NHS England alerted 22,000 patients after fears they could have been exposed to blood-borne diseases including HIV and hepatitis while being treated at the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham. A total of 4,526 patients were tested and five were diagnosed with hepatitis C as a result, health bosses confirmed. No cases of hepatitis B or HIV were found. The recall was issued in November,  and an investigation into apparent breaches of infection control procedures by Mr D'Mello was launched. The dentist, who ran his practice for 32 years, was suspended. Dr Doug Black, Medical Director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'We have always been clear that the risk to patients was low, but we still had a duty to inform patients of this and offer the option for them to be tested. 'Treatments are available for all of the blood-borne viruses tested for, so we are pleased that these individuals have been identified and offered clinical support to aid their well-being. 'Now that this patient screening exercise is complete, we will be focusing our efforts on what we can learn from this incident and ensuring all our findings are shared with the General Dental Council to inform their ongoing investigation into Mr D'Mello.' Mr D'Mello is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission and the General Dental Council after he was secretly filmed by a whistleblower failing to change his medical gloves between patients or properly sterilise equipment. The dentist went to ground after his work was called into question and has never spoken publicly about the allegations. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, East Midlands said: 'With such a high number of people being tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, the small number of positives that have been picked up as a result of screening is in line with what we would expect to see due to the very low prevalence of these blood-borne viruses within the community. 'Effective treatments are available for all blood-borne viruses, which is why it is important to identify anyone who may have been at risk of infection, so treatment can be started if necessary.' Mr D'Mello, who ran the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham, which has now changed name and is under new ownership, sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days amid allegations he failed to follow NHS safety procedures . Patients who tested positive were informed by their GPs and referred for further clinical advice and testing. Since August 2014 the former Daybrook Dental Practice has been under new ownership by Southern Dental, which is not in connected to this incident. A spokesman for NHS England said any former patients of Mr D'Mello who have not yet accessed testing and wish to do so should contact their GP. Many of his former patients are taking legal action against the dentist. Around 200 are building cases with legal firm the Dental Law Partnership. David Corless-Smith, a solicitor with the company, said last week: 'Desmond D'Mello was a master of five-minute dentistry and you can't do much that is going to last a long time in five minutes. 'We have 200 of Mr D'Mello's former patients bringing claims for nervous shock of being told they may have contracted a life-threatening infection but half of those are pursuing claims for poor treatment.'","Desmond D'Mello was suspended amid claims he flouted safety rules .

"Guo Hong, 29, always has at least three or four male students for her cheerleading classes, which is highly unusual in China . There aren't many things which could entice groups of male students in China to sign up for cheerleading classes - but the 'most gorgeous' teacher in the country is certainly one of them. Guo Hong, 29, started off teaching two classes at Zhejiang University in eastern China one semester ago but is now running twice as many. Though considered much more suitable for female students, it is proving very popular with many male ones also, no doubt keen to catch the eye of their beautiful instructor. The multiple national dance champion's class is so popular you now have to make it through a strict three stage application process to get in as the numbers applying are so high. Even students who haven't been selected have been known to turn up for Guo's lessons, which are the most popular PE classes at the university. At least three or four male would-be cheerleaders are always lining up for lessons, which is highly unusual in conservative China. Not long ago Korea's 'most beautiful PE teacher' was a hot topic online, with fans posting about her 'angel's face with a devil's body' and lamenting 'it's such a pity she's other people's PE teacher.' But now China has its answer in Guo, after students posted pictures online which went viral, saying: 'Look at this, we definitely have the prettiest PE instructor in the country.' Her classes  draw observers from the sidelines and participants who have already completed their credits for PE but have joined the course anyway. Scroll down for video . Students who haven't been selected have been known to turn up for Guo's lessons, which are very popular . Pharmacy major, Xu Qianhao, says that he is curious about this course and saw it as a fresh challenge. Even with the huge subscription rate he was able to still get through to secure his place. Xu said that the lessons are exciting and demanding and after one semester he feels he has a much better sense of coordination and the physical demands are greater than he expected. Jiang is a Resources, Environment and Urban Planning student who has signed up for two semesters of the cheerleading course. When asked why he replied, red faced: 'When I first applied it was because other students said that boys were able to get high final exam scores. 'I didn't expect that each lesson will be led from start to finish by the teacher which is very interesting. Also the teacher often chooses songs that are nice so I chose this course for two semesters.' Guo with her many trophies and awards. She used to run two classes but now takes four because of demand . Guo said: 'I started artistic gymnastics when I was four years old and have been involved in sports since then. 'I am a technical cheerleading national champion, competitive aerobics national champion, miss aerobics national champion so essentially all the courses that I trained in at university I have achieved national champion status in. 'However at present I most like cheerleading.' Zhejiang University's Cheerleading group was created by Guo after she arrived. At the time she had to recruit members one at a time as well as arrange the weekly training sessions. 'Usually we train twice a week but when we are coming up to a competition we will train four to five times a week. 'The courses are free because I enjoy participating myself.'","Guo Hong, 29, started off teaching two classes at Zhejiang University .

"A municipal court judge who resigned after being slammed in a Department of Justice report has announced he is stepping down from two more roles. Ronald J. Brockmeyer left his Ferguson position earlier this week after he was directly criticised in the report, which was prompted by the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. He also left his post as a Dellwood prosecutor. He has now announced he will no longer be the prosecuting attorney in Vinita Park and Florissant. Scroll down for video . Ferguson municipal court judge Ronald J. Brockmeyer (left) resigned on Monday following a scathing report from the U.S. Department of Justice. He has also left three other roles. State appeals judge Roy L. Richter (right) was appointed to take his place in Ferguson . The report, released on March 4, singled out the 70-year-old and suggested he was behind Ferguson’s aggressive strategy of using its municipal court to generate revenues. It added that Brockmeyer was particularly 'creative' when it came to traffic fines and fees, including dismissing tickets for himself and friends. Announcing his resignation Brockmeyer said he wanted to help the city 'begin its healing process' and to promote public confidence in the court. Roy L. Richter, a state appeals judge, was appointed by the Missouri Supreme Court to take his place and make 'needed reforms'. Richter will be authorized to overhaul court policies in order to 'restore the integrity of the system' and ensure the respect of defendants' rights, according to the high court. He will start on March 16. Chief Justice Mary Russell said she believes Richter will bring a 'fresh, disinterested perspective' to the court. 'He is able and willing to implement needed reforms,' she said. 'Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the Court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis.' But Vinita Park Mayor James McGee said that Brockmeyer’s service would be 'dearly missed'. A Justice Department investigation found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court. Brockmeyer stepped down to help the city 'begin its healing process', he said . Two Ferguson Police Department commanders - Rick Henke and William Mudd - also resigned last Thursday after racist emails were discovered by the DoJ's investigation, while Mary Ann Twitty, a court clerk, was fired. It is unclear whether the three were the recipients or senders of the 'racially biased' emails included in the 102-page civil rights report. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that President Barack Obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man can't hold 'a steady job'. Mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a New Orleans woman was paid by 'CrimeStoppers' to terminate her pregnancy. The Justice Department highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless women dancing, with the caption 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion'. The report states that the emails illustrate racial, ethnic, or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the DoJ's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week. Evidence found shows not only racial bias, 'but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case'. In fact, the report states, there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails. Instead, the emails were forwarded along to others. The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. Sgt. William Mudd (left) and Capt. Rick Henke (center) resigned from their positions on Thursday. City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty (right) was fired over racially charged emails discovered in the report . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the DoJ's report 'searing' and said the investigation showed policing and municipal court practices were 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents'. He said: 'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles revealed last week that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DoJ, Reuters reports. Knowles did not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would step down. The DoJ's investigation into the St. Louis suburb came after a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson (right), fatally shot an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown (left), in August last year . The grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light . The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment . The report highlighted the department's practices, saying the city's focus on revenue greatly impacted on the police department's approach to law enforcement and the role of Ferguson's municipal court. It states: 'The Ferguson Municipal Court handles most charges brought by the FPD, and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice, or protecting the rights of the accused, but of maximizing revenue.' It also highlighted the fact that African-Americans make 'extraordinary' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor,  unfairly charged violations. The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. The report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help. The clerk responded: 'Your ticket of $200 has magically disappeared!' Some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause.","Ronald J.

"Colorado's legal marijuana is three times stronger than it was a generation ago and is often contaminated with heavy metals, pesticides, fungus and bacteria, a startling chemical analysis of 600 samples has found. Additionally, modern pot has very low levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, the compound that medical marijuana advocates say gives the drug its healing properties. In most samples, the CBD levels were so small they were undetectable. The findings come from Andy LaFrate, a Ph.D. chemist and the founder of Colorado testing firm Charas Scientific. LaFrate will present the results of his research today at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Scroll down for video . Andy LaFrate, the founder of Charas Scientific, knows that most people think it's a joke when he says he tested 600 samples of Colorado's legal pot . In fact, LaFrate used highly accurate liquid chromatography to isolate all of the compounds within the marijuana samples - and got some surprising results . LaFrate's survey of Colorado's marijuana casts doubt on claims that by legalizing the drug for recreational use in 2012, it would make it safer to consume. 'It's pretty startling just how dirty a lot of this stuff is,' he told Smithsonian.com. Also alarming is the fact that people using marijuana for its reported medicinal properties usually have no way of knowing how much CBD is actually in their products. Colorado only requires marijuana dispensaries to test and advertise the levels of THC - the compound in pot that gets user 'high.' CBD and contaminant levels are not tested. 'I've heard a lot of complaints from medical patients because somebody claims that a product has a high level of CBD, and it turns out that it actually doesn't,' LaFrate says. Children who are given marijuana to control epilepsy can actually be worse off because they're being given strains of the drug with virtually no CBD and high levels of THC, which can trigger seizures, he added. LaFrate's tests used liquid chromatography, a highly accurate method of chemical analysis that separates out the component parts of a substance. LaFrate says more testing is needed on the effects of contaminants on people who consume marijuana . He found that Colorado's legal marijuana has THC levels of 18 to 20percent. Sometimes THC is as high as 30percent. Marijuana from the 1980s usually had THC levels of less than 10percent - meaning modern pot is two to three times stronger than it was a generation ago. It's no coincidence that Colorado's marijuana is dramatically stronger and has dramatically lower CBD levels than the pot of yesteryear. Growers responded to a demand from consumers for more potent pot by breeding varieties with higher levels of THC and less CBD. LaFrate says he found very small levels of genetic variation between 'strains' of marijuana. This means, the claims of pot with exotic names - 'Skunkberry,' 'Ghost Train Haze,' 'Girl Scout Cookies' - are usually just slick marketing ploys. Additionally, much of Colorado's marijuana is contaminated with high levels of fungus spores and bacteria. It's not known what levels of those microorganisms are safe for marijuana and more study on the subject is needed, LaFrate says. Many samples also contained traces of cancer-causing heavy metals, which come from the plants growing in contaminated soil. Others had high levels of pesticides. LaFrate warned that the marijuana growing industry is getting by on it's hippy reputation and that many consumers believe the plants are grown naturally using organic methods - when in fact, that usually is not the case at all. Even more troubling were the 200 samples of marijuana concentrates - or pot extract - that LaFrate tested. These are used to make edibles and can contain up to 90percent THC. Because they are concentrated doses, they can also contain very high levels of heavy metals and pesticides - as the THC level is dialed up, so are the levels of background contaminants. The solvents used like alcohol and heptane to make the concentrates also contribute startling levels of contaminants, LaFrate warned.","Modern pot also has very low levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, the compound that advocates say gives marijuana its medicinal properties .

"The BBC has hired bodyguards to protect its director general around the clock after he received a death threat for sacking Jeremy Clarkson. The bill to licence fee payers for extra security is expected to run into thousands of pounds after a menacing email to Tony Hall, apparently from an obsessive Top Gear fan overseas. But Scotland Yard insisted the threat was not considered grave enough to warrant diverting its own officers to guard Lord Hall. Scroll down for video . Close protection: BBC director general Tony Hall, second right, gets out of a Range Rover outside his £1.5million home in Oxfordshire . The BBC has hired bodyguards to protect its director general around the clock after he received a death threat for sacking Jeremy Clarkson . The email was sent on Wednesday, hours after the BBC boss announced that Clarkson’s seven-figure contract would not be renewed after his attack on a Top Gear producer. In response, the BBC hired security firm London Protection Services Ltd to protect Lord Hall, 64, and his wife Cynthia, 62, at a cost estimated at more than £1,000 a day. Guards in marked and unmarked vehicles were seen outside the couple’s £1.5million 18th century home in Oxfordshire. The BBC’s head of security made an urgent appeal on Wednesday for former Special Forces personnel to take part in the operation, the Mail on Sunday reported. A security source told the paper: ‘A select group of close protection officers were told that, as a direct result of the Top Gear punch-up and Jeremy Clarkson being sacked by the BBC, the D-G had received a death threat. ‘Some of the operation was visible, as a deterrent, while other bodyguards would have kept a very low profile.’ Lord Hall sacked Clarkson, 54, after an internal inquiry found he had launched an ‘unprovoked verbal and physical attack’ on junior producer Oisin Tymon, 36. Visible security: Lord Hall leaves his home last week accompanied by guards, with the bill expected to run into the thousands . The row broke out after the star complained no hot food was available at the Yorkshire hotel where the TV crew were staying after a day’s filming. Last night Scotland Yard said police were investigating an allegation of threats to kill after the email to Lord Hall. A spokesman added: ‘Inquiries are ongoing to establish where the email came from. At the moment we think it was sent from abroad. ‘We do not have any officers guarding him. The security is being organised by the BBC.’ Police sources played down the seriousness of the potential threat to Lord Hall. One said: ‘This is very much a local investigation by the bobbies in the borough of Westminster. It would be wrong to think that there are a crack team of detectives on it. ‘We’ve not considered it necessary to take officers away from other duties to guard him.’ Tory politician Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘The police are best placed to know how serious this threat is. Obviously the person who sent it is some kind of nutter. But you never know what these people are capable of. ‘The BBC are in a difficult position. If they do nothing about it and something dreadful happens, they will be criticised. But if they take some action and nothing happens, they will be accused of over-reacting.’ London Protection Services boasts of having 1,000 certified guards available nationwide and is said to charge £300 per man per shift. The BBC said: ‘We wouldn’t comment on security matters.’ n Chris Evans has denied rumours that he is being lined up to replace Clarkson on Top Gear. The Radio 2 and One Show host, 48, who collects classic cars, has said he would not take the job even if it was offered.","BBC hired bodyguards to protect Lord Hall after he received a death threat .

A van driver who tried to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine in wine bottles has been jailed for five years. Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, Merseyside was stopped by Border Force officers at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Coquelles, France last May and told them he had been in Belgium doing plastering and collecting solar panels. Officers found boxes containing more than 100 wine bottles in the back of Dyer's van, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The substance inside the bottles appeared oily and later checks showed the liquid tested positive for amphetamine. Dyer was arrested and checks on the van showed it had been hired in Warrington, with Dyer supplying the hire company with a false address. For previous trips he had also used hired vehicles, taking them abroad illegally. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne at street-level purity, with a potential street value of almost £8million. Last month, Dyer admitted importing controlling drugs and he was today sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne, with a potential street value of almost £8million . Matthew Rivers, from the NCA's Border Policing Command, said: 'The story Dyer told to explain his trips to the continent was a lie. Our investigation proved that in reality he was a professional courier who travelled to the Netherlands to source drugs. 'This was a huge quantity of amphetamine, enough to make many hundreds of thousands of street-level doses and fuel further criminal activity.' Paul Morgan, director of Border Force South East and Europe, said: 'This seizure means a significant quantity of drugs failed to reach the streets and demonstrates Border Force's commitment to keeping them out of the UK. 'We work closely with law enforcement colleagues, including the NCA, to prevent drug trafficking and do all we can to put those responsible behind bars.'","Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, stopped by Border Force officials in France .

"Three police officers have been questioned as part of an investigation into the suspicious death of 13-month-old Poppi Iris Worthington . Three police officers have been questioned over alleged misconduct relating to the suspicious death of a 13-month-old baby whose case has been shrouded in official secrecy. Little Poppi Iris Worthington, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, died in December 2012. But a draconian order imposed by judges has prevented any details of her death being revealed, despite a long-running police probe. During an inquest in October last year that lasted a mere seven minutes, a coroner simply ruled that the cause of Poppi's death was 'unascertained' and failed to disclose any other information. But it has now emerged that three officers from Cumbria Police have been questioned under caution over misconduct allegations. It can also be revealed that one officer, who was suspended after concerns that the force did not respond ‘properly and appropriately’ to the girl's death, has since retired from the force. The news comes after the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said it would be investigating whether opportunities to obtain 'key evidence' were 'identified and appropriately acted upon'. The IPCC said it received a referral from Cumbria Police on June 27 last year and began its independent investigation on July 2. The body has since spoken to 13 witnesses and three police officers, who have been interviewed under caution. But the watchdog refused to disclose a copy of the Cumbria Police referral, which gives details of the exact allegations under investigation. A spokesman said the public interest in openness and transparency is 'outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations'. After Poppi's death, a far-reaching injunction prevented the media from revealing various details about the case, including the hospital in which she died. The opening of the inquest in also took place in private. According to coroners' rules, inquests should always be held in public unless exceptional matters of national security are involved. But following a challenge by media groups, the senior coroner for Cumbria, David Roberts, wrote to the Attorney General to ask for a new hearing. Lawyers representing several newspaper groups - Associated Newspapers Limited, which publishes MailOnline, Times Newspapers Ltd and Guardian News & Media- had written to Mr Roberts to argue the inquest was insufficient and therefore unlawful. One officer, who was suspended over allegations the force did not response 'properly' to the young girl's death, has also since retired from the force. Cumbria police is being investigated by the police watchdog . In a written reply to law firm RPC, Mr Roberts, said: 'My own view is that it would be desirable for a fresh inquest to take place, not least so that conclusions as to how, when and where Poppi Worthington came by her death can be recorded. The IPCC probe is being overseen by senior investigator Catherine Hall and commissioner Carl Gumsley (pictured) 'Neither I nor Mr Smith has power to hold a further inquest without the permission of the High Court. However, it is open to me to seek a fiat (order) from the Attorney General to pursue an application under section 13 of the Coroners Act for an Order that a fresh inquest is to be held and I will now be doing so.' The police investigation had led to the arrest of two people, including Poppi's father Paul Worthington, 46. Last week it emerged the 46-year-old and a 30-year-old woman arrested will not face further action. The IPCC probe is being overseen by senior investigator Catherine Hall and commissioner Carl Gumsley. In a statement, an IPCC spokesman said: 'We are independently investigating the force's response to Poppi's death - whether its investigation was conducted thoroughly and appropriately and whether investigative opportunities to obtain key evidence in the investigation were identified and appropriately acted upon.' FOI officer Philip Johnston said: 'Enquiries by the police and the IPCC into the concerns arising from the circumstances of Poppi Worthington's death, including criminal matters relating to members of the public and issues of police conduct relating to Cumbria Constabulary, are currently ongoing.' He added: 'I have concluded the public interest in openness and transparency is at this stage outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations and the inquest and in maintaining confidence in the IPCC's law enforcement functions more generally.'","EXCLUSIVE: Poppi Worthington, from Barrow-in-Furness, died in 2012 .

"An archive of highly-classified test reports has come to light revealing how the Nazis killed thousands of German citizens by bombing their own cities with V-2 rockets - for target practice. The top-secret SS documents, much of which are written in coded German, are said to offer proof Adolf Hitler used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles. The incredible 20-page archive  is made up of reports which were only issued to 'Kommandostelle S', a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it. An archive of highly-classified test reports has come to light revealing how the Nazis killed thousands of German citizens by bombing their own cities with V-2 rockets - for target practice . The top-secret SS documents, much of which are written in coded German, are said to offer proof Adolf Hitler used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles . The burn marks are said to be proof of the documents' sensitivity, as someone clearly tried to torch them . The incredible archive is made up of reports which were only issued to 'Kommandostelle S', a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it . Deadly: A V-2 rocket launched in Germany from a fixed site in the summer of 1943 . They show how the desperate Nazis used their own settlements as targets while developing the deadly weapons during World War Two. It means thousands of Germans died at the hands of their own leader in 1944 and 1945 - who then blamed the carnage on Allied Forces. The V-2 rockets - the V standing for Vergeltungswaffe, or Vengeance Weapon - were fired at London and the south east of England, as well as targets on mainland Europe, killing over 7,000 people. The warheads were launched in the final months of the war as Britain advanced closer to victory and were considered Hitler's last role of the dice. However, it is widely agreed that if the Nazis has developed the rockets sooner they may have won the race to develop the atomic bomb and gone on to win the war. The V-2 rockets - the V standing for Vergeltungswaffe, or Vengeance Weapon - were fired at London and the south east of England, as well as targets on mainland Europe, killing over 7,000 people . The documents show that Hitler fired V-2 rockets from a test centre in what was then Pomerania into surrounding cities, killing his own people . Royal Air Force reconnaissance photograph of V-2 rockets at a test stand . The remarkable archive was rescued from the flames at the end of the conflict and has remained in the possession of a German collector ever since. Now it is set to go under the hammer at Chiswick Auctions, in London, on March 18, where it is expected to fetch £2,500. On Wednesday, Chiswick Auctions spokesman Richard Westwood-Brookes said: 'The V-2 was the first truly ballistic missile which might have brought victory to Hitler had he won the race to develop the atomic bomb in 1945. 'A note which comes with the archive from a researcher indicates that these were final test firing reports for the rockets and were issued in very limited numbers of no more than 10 to 12 copies. 'The present archive could prove to be a highly important new source of information on what was by far the most important technological and scientific development to have come from the Second World War. 'The V-2 was the first real ballistic missile. Its effects were devastating. Powerful: The first V-2 attack on Britain hit Chiswick in London in September 1944 and left a gigantic crater . 'Had Hitler been successful in developing the technology of the atomic bomb then he would have had the capability of firing it long distances. 'With the use of this rocket - unquestionably this would have led to the Nazis winning the war.' The document, which is typed on sheets of A4 paper, shows a large number of V-2 rockets were fired from the Peenemunde region where experimental devices were tested. They were fired against the Allies with missiles claiming thousands of lives in London, Antwerp and Liege. But shockingly, the reports also reveal many of the original test firings were at German towns and cities - mainly in the area of Pomerania. It is believed special units were then sent to evaluate the extent of the damage caused and report back to the Fuhrer about their effectiveness. Mr Westwood Brookes added: 'Perhaps the most remarkable fact which comes from these papers is that many of these test firings were fired at German targets. Devastation: A V-2 rocket attack left this block of flats in Limehouse, London, in ruins . 'This is evidence enough of how desperate the Nazis were becoming after D-Day and the relentless advances of Allied forces across Europe. 'Many of these test firings at German towns and cities resulted in considerable casualties and substantial damages to houses and other properties. 'I have never seen such concrete evidence to substantiate that Hitler actually used his own towns and cities as target practice.' After the war the majority of V-2-related documents were  destroyed by the Germans before the Allies moved in by orders of the SS. Mr Westwood-Brookes said: 'The fact that several of the sheets in the present archive have clearly been in a fire suggests that these very papers were rescued from such destruction. 'This really is an exceptionally rare find and one that offers a chilling insight into Hitler's war efforts during his final months.' The V-2 rocket was developed by Wernher von Braun, a German aerospace engineer and space architect. He was a member of the Nazi party but after the war went to work in America for Nasa and eventually helped develop the technology that put man on the moon in 1969. The V-2 was the most advanced weapon used in the war until the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Launched from mobile units, the 46ft (14m) tall rockets were powered by liquid ethanol and oxygen and weighed almost 13 tonnes, fully fuelled. The V-2s were also Hitler's answer to his country's disappointment that the V1s (or doodlebugs) didn't knock Britain out of the war. They were launched vertically and could travel at 3,335mph to hit targets more than 200 miles away, making it the world's first long-range combat-ballistic missile.","Most of the top-secret documents are written in coded German .

"A legal stoush between two of Australia's most popular social media personalities is over after the parties settled outside court. Leanne Ratcliffe - better known as 'Freelee the Banana Girl - and her partner Harley Johnstone promised a court they will not disparage popular Instagram personality Kayla Itsines, 23, online. Ms Itsines, the 23-year-old behind the Bikini Body Guide fitness program, lodged an injunction against the pair in March after alleging the couple posted 'defamatory' remarks on YouTube last month.

Freelee the Banana Girl, pictured, is most famous for a stunt several years ago where she ate 51 bananas for a YouTube video . In a fiery Facebook post addressed to her followers, Ms Itsines said she was taking court action because of 'false claims that my partner takes steroids' and 'claims I'm starving myself or other people'. She argued she was 'standing up for myself, friends and family' in bringing the lawsuit. On Tuesday morning, lawyers told the South Australian Supreme Court that the parties had successfully reached a deal in the last week. Under the terms of the agreement, Ms Ratcliffe and Mr Johnstone will be barred from making disparaging statements about Ms Itsines in social, print or electronic media. After the court hearing Ms Itsines' lawyer, Mike Hayes from Lynch Meyer, told Daily Mail Australia the parties had agreed on amended terms of an injunction Ms Itsines had lodged on March 2. Judge Brian Withers made the orders permanent this morning. He also scheduled a further hearing in May to ensure the orders were carried out. The case will not proceed to trial. Outside court, Ms Ratcliffe told South Australian newspaper The Advertiser that she would abide by the terms of the deal. 'Recalling every detail of it (the settlement) is a little difficult, but I understand it and I will follow it,' she was quoted saying.

"Puppy killer Nathan Thompson has spoken out after his court hearing claiming he is a dog lover. The 25-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty and as a result, has been banned from owning, acquiring, buying or possessing any animal for a decade. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. Nathan Thompson, 25, allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured) 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated. RSPCA NSW Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy said it was definitely one of the worst animal cruelty incidents he has seen in his career. 'This is a far more significant situation where there is an element of pre-planning and a deliberate attack on the animals,' he said. Nathan Thompson allegedly loaded 11 bull terriers cross puppies into his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri on Wednesday, according to the Daily Telegraph.. Scroll down for video . Thompson (pictured) leaves East Maitland Court after pleading guilty to animal abuse . Magistrate Caleb Franklin granted Thompson bail to be sentenced on April 28. The  25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon and bashed a number of them to death with a rock. Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies. Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived. David O'Shannessy, told Daily Mail Australia on Friday he was shocked by the incident. 'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said. 'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive. Nathan Thompson, the man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies,  pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed. 'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr O'Shannessy said. Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable and has improved significantly despite serious head injuries. The clinic has received offers to re-home the puppy, however they are choosing to focus on the puppy's recovery and not get ahead of themselves.

"This is a nightmare moment for any dog owner: recognising their missing pets served in a roast shop. And it just happened to a five-year-old from northern Vietnam. A picture of a little girl crying by a dog she believed to be her pet has quickly gone viral on the internet, according to People's Daily Online. The unidentified girl reportedly lives in the countryside of north Vietnam.  She had raised a dog 'Flower' for three years and was deeply saddened when her beloved pet went missing mysteriously. Devastated: The little girl, who is believed to be living in northern Vietnam, finds her beloved pet 'Flower' already cooked outside a dog meat stall. She has searched for the dog for a few days after it went missing mysteriously . She had spent great effort searching for 'Flower', but to no avail. A few days later, when the child passed by a local dog meat stall, she instantly recognised a dog lying on the street - and already cooked. 'That's Flower,' cried the girl while rushing over to the dog. The picture broke the heart of hundreds of thousands on the internet. Many agreed that the tragedy is too much for a five-year-old to take and have appealed for a ban on the consumption of dog meat. Dog meat is treated as a delicacy in several Asian countries, including Korea, Vietnam and China. A documentary made by Channel 4 last autumn revealed that seven tonnes of live dogs are shipped to the nation's capital Hanoi every day with one slaughter house owner saying he killed up to 30 dogs a day. Many of the dogs are pets stolen from gardens and front porches at night.","Picture has gone viral of a little girl crying beside her roasted pet dog .

"Starbucks has announced that its baristas will start pro-actively talking to customers about racism, in an attempt to 'create a more empathetic and inclusive society - one conversation at a time'. Starting on Monday, staff at the 4,700 cafés across America will have the option to write 'RaceTogether' on cardboard cups, which is the slogan of a Starbucks anti-racism campaign. It is hoped that customers who encounter the slogan on their coffee cup will be inspired to discuss the deeper issues affecting America. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Starbucks boss Howard Schultz has instructed staff to write 'RaceTogether' on cups in an effort to draw customers into a discussion about the state of race relations in America . Talking point: Although Starbucks says that nobody will be forced into a discussion, baristas will attempt to speak to customers about racism in America by writing slogans on their coffee cups . The move is the brainchild of Howard Schultz, 61, the company's boss, who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics, from gay marriage to gun control. His decision came in response to the escalating racial tension that emerged when grand juries failed to indict white police officers involved in the killings of Michael Brown, 18, in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, 43, in Staten Island, New York. Last year, Schultz travelled to Starbucks branches in the cities most affected by racial tension, including Los Angeles, St Louis, Chicago, New York, Oakland and Seattle. Mr Schulz met about 2,000 Starbucks staff on the tour, and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address. 'It's an emotional issue,' he said. 'But it is so vitally important to the country.' Last week, the company ran full-page advertisements in the New York Times and USA Today, highlighting race tensions in the country. The page was black, with the words 'shall we overcome?' in the centre, and the company logo at the bottom. The campaign will continue on Friday, when every copy of USA Today will carry an insert about racism, which will also be stocked at branches of Starbucks. Schultz kicked off the campaign last December with a letter that appeared in TIME magazine. 'Last week, one thing became clear: we cannot continue to come to work every day aware of the difficult and painful experiences facing our nation, and not acknowledge them, together, as a company,' he wrote. 'Indeed, despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues, we at Starbucks should be willing to talk about them.' Schultz has a track record of using his public profile to highlight issues close to his heart. In 2013, he wrote an open letter requesting customers to leave their guns at home when they visited his stores, even in states where they can be carried legally. 'We believe guns and weapons should not be part of the Starbucks experience,' he said. He also spearheaded a petition to end federal shutdown in the same year, and launched a scheme to boost job creation in the U.S. by selling bracelets in its cafés in 2011. Starbucks is also intending to employ 10,000 former members of the armed forces and their partners over five years. Those who oppose Schultz' views get short shrift. In 2013, an investor said that the company's open support for gay marriage was harming sales. Schultz responded by suggesting that he sell his shares. Schulz will reportedly discuss the Race Together initiative at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, according to Fortune.","Howard Schultz, boss of Starbucks, gave the order in response to the race-related violence sweeping America .

"Jon Hamm has completed a stint in rehab, it has been revealed. The Mad Men actor spent 30 days at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut for alcohol abuse, his rep told TMZ. The 44-year-old star checked in at the end of February. It was not revealed when he checked out, but the TV icon was seen at a special screening of Mad Men in New York City on Saturday. Scroll down for video . After treatment: Jon Hamm completed a 30-day stint in rehab, his rep announced on Tuesday; here he is pictured at LAX airport the same day . The facility: The Mad Men actor received treatment at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut for alcohol abuse . Inside Silver Hill: Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates . Hamm's publicist told the site, 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon Hamm recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. 'They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward.' On Tuesday he was spotted at LAX looking well dressed in a white double-breasted coat, black cardigan, grey trousers and black boots. He was also wearing a full beard, sunglasses and a hat. Just after he checked out: Hamm attended a special screening of Mad Men on Saturday in New York City with the cast of the hit AMC show; here he is pictured with January Jones . She has helped him: Hamm's publicist told the site, 'With the support of his longtime partner Jennifer Westfeldt, Jon  recently completed treatment for his struggle with alcohol addiction. They have asked for privacy and sensitivity going forward'; here the couple is seen in December . It is not known if Hamm has been in rehab before. His Mad Men character Don Draper was known for heavy drinking. The Silver Hill Hospital is a psychiatric hospital that was established in 1931. The facility provides comprehensive psychiatric and addiction treatment services. The campus sits on 42 acres and the buildings have a New England style to them. Though the facility is considered upscale, the rooms are pared down. Some even have two beds as often patients have roommates. His character enjoyed cocktails: Don Draper often drank alcohol; here Hamm is pictured with Mad Men co-star Jessica Paré as they both hold up drinks . Raising a glass: The enigmatic advertising executive is famed for his love of booze . Bottom's up: Don celebrates with a glass of the hard stuff in sixties based drama Mad Men . Speaking to Esquire in 2014, Jon revealed his sisters once encouraged him to see a therapist  following the death of his mother from a brain aneurysm. 'I had no concept of what that even meant,' he said. 'I’m a 20-year-old idiot, in the Midwest. This is not Woody Allen New York. We don’t sit around and talk about our feelings. We certainly don’t sit around and compare shrinks.' 'I went to the lady. Sat down and talked to the lady. I gotta say, it helps. Talking to anybody helps. Talking to your friends helps. But your friends are your friends. They’ll tell you what you want to hear. 'The shrink doesn’t sugarcoat it: ""Hey, you’re f***ed up. Do this, this and this. Don’t do this any more."" It’s a wonderful third-person perspective that you get from an analyst. It’s invaluable, I think.' On the move: The 44-year-old actor was seen dressed in layers as he walked through the airport . Work ahead: Jon had a guest starring role on Tina Fey's Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . He added that his performances as tormented advertising executive Don are based on personal experience. He said:  'I hope that lends a deeper resonance. It’s not anything I’m doing consciously. All we can do as actors is bring our own personal experience to the role. 'My mother died when I was ten, so I did have far more experience of being raised outside my family than I had from my own home, probably.' The right scruff! The Bridesmaids star is sporting a generous amount of facial hair that evokes a far more rugged image than his Mad Men Don Draper character . In an interview with the Mail On Sunday in 2012, the actor admitted that his parallels with heavy drinker Don stopped at the character's love of  hard liquor. ‘I don’t drink as much as Don Draper,’he said. ‘I would be unconscious if I did.’ He also revealed to suffering from 'clinical depression' following the sudden death of his father when he was 20. 'I very much knew what the idea of permanence was by that point. I dropped out of school, moved into the basement of my older half-sister Julie’s house, enrolled in a local college and sank into depression,' he said. An end: Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season beginning on April 5 as the AMC drama airs its final episodes . ‘It was the classic definition of clinical depression; you want to stay in bed all day, you sleep till four o’clock in the afternoon. I didn’t have any drive to get up and do anything. It was rough: it stinks. 'Other people who are better than me at putting thoughts into words describe it as a black cloud that descends on you. You become numb. You feel so overwhelmed that it’s hard to take any step towards solving your situation.' Jon's portrayal of the flawed Madison Avenue businessman will end in its seventh season, which begins on April 5. He earned a Best Actor  Golden Globe Award in 2008 for his role. Ready to promote the show: On Monday the star was seen with his cast again on the Today show in NYC . Since wrapping the series in July, Jon had a guest starring role in Tina Fey's uproarious Netflix series The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Jon played Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne, a doomsday preacher who lures four women into an underground bunker for years after convincing them of an impending apocalypse - but they are later rescued. The Office alum Ellie Kemper plays the title character opposite Tituss Burgess, Carol Kane and Jane Krakowski. 'I was very glad they asked me to be a part of it,' he revealed to The Daily Beast. 'Ellie Kemper is a really nice person, and I felt honored to be able to play in the sandbox with the cool kids again.' Incredibly, Jon was 34-year-old Ellie's eighth grade teacher in 1993 after he graduated from the University of Missouri with an English degree and taught acting class at the same school he attended years earlier, John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri. Heavy drinker: Jon told the Mail On Sunday in 2012 that he would be 'unconscious' if he consumed as much alcohol as Don . 'I remember walking the red carpet at the Emmys and seeing Ellie there and going, ""You're here, too! This is so great!""' Speaking to GQ in a recent interview, Jon expressed fear about finding work after his run on Mad Men. 'Look, the one constant thing I've had in my career is now removed,' he said. 'And that's an eye-opener: Are people still going to take me seriously? Am I just going to do romantic comedies for the rest of my life? 'What's next? And I don't know, you know? I wish I was smug enough to have had a grand plan.'

"A Seattle man fled the United States with his 9-year-old son on a sailboat last fall, taking his son thousands of miles away to the island nation of Niue, northeast of New Zealand. Jeffrey Ford Hanson pleaded guilty on Monday to one count of international parental kidnapping. Hanson's friends reportedly told police that the father had issues with alcohol and drugs, including crystal methamphetamine and oxycontin. Hanson's son, 9-year-old Billy, was visiting his father in July and was supposed to be sent back to his mother in Pennsylvania on Sept. 4, but the boy was not on the flight. The boy's mother contacted authorities and they issued a U.S. federal arrest warrant on Sept. 12. Family: Jeffrey Ford Hanson fled the United States with his 9-year-old son Billy on a sailboat last fall . Taking off: Hanson and his son were on his boat 'Draco' (pictured) Hanson and the boy's mother were divorced, but he had monthly visitation rights for up to six consecutive days, according to court records. Authorities found Hanson and the boy on Oct. 29 on Niue, which is located in the South Pacific Ocean and is northeast of New Zealand. They took Hanson into custody and worked to reunite the boy with his mother in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Hanson's friends told Seattle Police Detective Bryan Van Brunt that Hanson lived on a boat, was dangerous and had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, according to an affidavit attached to a criminal complaint. One friend, Carey Jambresic, told Van Brunt that Hanson planned to take the boy by boat to Washington's San Juan Islands. Jambresic told the detective that the boy could not swim and said Hanson was actively smoking crystal methamphetamine, taking oxycontin and drinking alcohol, the affidavit said. Another friend, Dawnya Robinson, told the detective that Hanson sent her a text message saying he was leaving the country, going to Mexico and taking his son, the affidavit said. Discovery: Authorities found Billy and his father on Oct. 29 on the island country of Niue, located in the South Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand . Hanson told another friend that he had enough money to keep his boat, Draco, afloat, and made references to Cape Horn on the southern tip of South America. Hanson was brought back to the U.S. in November where he was formally charged in a Los Angeles federal court. He was then moved to Seattle. He pleaded not guilty on Dec. 18 in U.S. District Court in Seattle and his trial was set for Feb. 17. It was later moved to May 11, but during a hearing early Monday, he changed his plea to guilty. Sentencing was set for June 6. Hanson faces up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000.","Jeffrey Ford Hanson fled the United States with his 9-year-old son Billy on a sailboat last fall .

"Taxpayers' money is being handed to fast-food firms such as Nestle and PepsiCo while ministers fail to tackle the obesity crisis, a damning study says. Huge corporations are among those being given grants worth hundreds of thousands of pounds while the NHS faces a growing burden from illnesses linked to weight gain. One firm was given almost £500,000 to help improve its chocolate while others were handed large sums to make biscuits or sell ice cream. Taxpayers' money is being handed to fast-food firms such as  PepsiCo as the UK fails to tackle its ongoing obesity crisis . The revelations, contained in a study led by the UK Coronary Prevention Group, has sparked fresh claims that the Government is too close to food firms and is doing ‘too little’ to tackle the £47billion annual cost of obesity. The charity said seven in ten middle-aged adults are overweight despite the millions spent on the Government’s anti-obesity strategy and it has called for a radical overhaul of healthy-eating policies. Its report identified a string of occasions when public cash was given to firms who make millions marketing junk food for projects that undermine public health. £86,472 from public funds to help companies make confectionery wafer biscuits. £31,000 government grant to help a farmer convert a barn into an ice cream shop. £637,812 handout to help a company improve its chocolate blending equipment. £24,750 to develop 3-D chocolate printing for personalised gifts. 0%VAT charged on unhealthy cake mix, drinking chocolate and salt – compared with 20 per cent levied on mineral water and healthy snacks such as roast almonds and dried fruit. It found the Government’s Technology Strategy Board gave £637,812 to a joint project with Mondelez – the parent company of Cadbury – for ‘confectionary production’. Another grant of £487,268 was given to Nestec, part of Nestle, to research ‘chocolate cooling technology’. The board also put £356,076 into a joint project with PepsiCo to research dehydrated snacks. Meanwhile, the Rural Development Programme for England gave two grants in 2010 – £12,500 towards biscuit production and £11,400 to help convert a barn into a chocolate-making unit. The year before, the quango handed over £143,000 to convert a farm building for ice cream production. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council put £100,173 into a project designed to improve the ‘sensory properties’ of confectionary wafers. Some £180,000 went on two other projects involving wafers. The UK Coronary Prevention Group says the Government has ‘failed’ on obesity and ‘done too little’ to tackle dietary habits. UK Coronary Prevention Group said seven in ten middle-aged adults are overweight despite the millions spent on the Government’s anti-obesity strategy and it has called for a radical overhaul of healthy-eating policies . Professor Philip James, chairman of the charity’s trustees, said: ‘Some of these grants are greater than the amounts spent by local health services tackling overweight in adults and children.’ The group has now identified 200 measures including a ban on fast-food outlets near schools and business-rate cuts for alternatives offering healthy dishes. Supermarkets would also be required to offer price promotions on healthy food, while there would be strict controls on all food sold in schools and hospitals. The report comes after it emerged last month that the Government’s anti-obesity drive was being overseen by a firm that also helps promote fast food. PR business Freud Communications earns £3million a year to run crucial public-health campaigns – including Change4Life – while also working with companies including Mars, KFC, PepsiCo and Walkers crisps. Experts claim that thousands by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks . Researchers have claimed that rather than giving taxpayer funds to fast food firms, the government should be putting up the price of full sugar drinks like Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Experts at the University of Liverpool and the Children’s Food Campaign claim that thousands of cases of diabetes and cancer could be avoided, saving the NHS £300million, by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks. The academics' work will fuel the growing campaign to extend the principle of a duty on unhealthy products from cigarettes and alcohol to some types of drink and food. Health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill-health as the ‘new tobacco’. The Liverpool team calculates that a tax of 20p per litre – 12p per can – would reduce the number of cases of diabetes by just under 50,000 over 20 years. They estimate there would be a fall of 33,000 in cases of stroke and heart disease and some 9,000 fewer victims of bowel cancer. These figures relate to England alone and the researchers estimate it would lead to savings of £300m in the cost of treating these people over the 20 years, releasing money for other patients.","A study found thousands of pounds were being given to junk food firms .

"A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU. The unnamed man, who is in his 60s, was one of thousands of Western men who visit Russia every year to find love. It is not known where or how he met his young wife, but he assumed that she would not be allowed into the EU without a visa. A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU (file picture) Because of these fears, he 'folded' her into a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train as he set off back to Nice, in southern France. At Terespol station, on the border between Poland and Belarus, the woman was found by immigration officials, who immediately arrested the couple. After searching the suitcase, Polish customs spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'The Russian wife of the owner of the bag was inside.' There were initial fears that she might have been kidnapped or abused in some other way, however it became clear that she was fine. Mr Sienicki added: 'She was in good shape and wasn't in need of any medical attention.' Despite this, the arrests were deemed valid because the couple had attempted to avoid border controls, which is a criminal offence. The newly-married couple were on their way back to Nice (pictured), France, when their bizarre ploy was rumbled . The wives of men with EU passports can  travel wherever they like in the EU, so if the woman had simply sat next to her husband there would have been no problem. The Russian bride was said to be in her thirties and extremely supple, making it relatively easy for her to fit inside the suitcase. The couple had risked a three-year jail sentence by attempting to evade border control. Mr Sienicki said: 'This was the first time I've seen someone travel like this. She very well could have been a victim of human trafficking.' The couple were eventually released after questioning and were allowed to carry on with their journey.","Pensioner assumed his new Russian bride wouldn't be allowed into France .

"Owners of vicious dogs will not be jailed even if their pet kills, under proposed changes to sentencing. The Sentencing Council published plans yesterday recommending that a dog owner receive a lesser sentence if the animal was provoked into the attack. An owner could also avoid prison if they tried to get their dog under control before its victim died, or if the animal killed while they were momentarily distracted or briefly lost control. Owners of vicious dogs will not be jailed if their killer animal was provoked into an attack, under proposed changes to sentencing (file picture) The changes will now be subject to a three-month consultation period. The Council is led by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and sets down rules that judges and magistrates must abide by. Its report said that new guidelines are necessary to deal with the new law and guide the courts on cases ‘of the utmost seriousness involving a fatality’. However, critics accused the changes of undermining the Dangerous Dogs Act, put into force last year, which increased the maximum sentence a dog owner whose pet kills can receive to 14 years. The reformed law was brought in after 14-year-old Jade Anderson was mauled to death by four dogs when she visited a friend’s house in 2013. But the plans published yesterday say that if the dog owner or handler has ‘lesser culpability’ then a deadly attack by their animal could lead to a community sentence rather than a prison term if they are convicted under the Act. Jade Anderson, 14, was mauled to death by four dogs in 2013, prompting the introduction of the Dangerous Dogs Act . Such a sentence could mean less than a month’s unpaid work or four months of electronic tagging. The proposals recommend that the maximum sentence might go to ‘someone who has bred or trained a dog to be aggressive and uses the dog as a weapon or to intimidate people, whose dog carries out a fatal attack’. Evidence of lesser culpability, the consultation paper said, would include the provocation of the dog without any fault on the part of the owner. It would also bring a lesser sentence if the owner tried to restrain the animal, had tried to control it, could not have foreseen the attack, or had a momentary lapse of control or attention. Circuit Judge Julian Goose, a member of the Sentencing Council, said: ‘Most dog owners are responsible, care for their pets properly and keep them under control but some irresponsible owners put others at risk of injury or death and we want to ensure that the courts have the guidance needed to help them sentence offenders appropriately. ‘In drawing up our proposals, we have been very aware of the potentially devastating impact of these offences on victims. Long sentences are available for the most serious offences. Sentencers are also encouraged to use their powers where appropriate to ban people from keeping dogs or to order them to pay compensation to victims.’ Trevor Cooper of the Dogs Trust said: ‘We are pleased to see the proposals recognise that there can be a range of culpability on the part of offenders for these offences, and that courts should carefully consider the appropriate sentence in each case.’ But criminologist Dr David Green of the Civitas think-tank disagreed: ‘If there is a fatal attack the owner should always be held responsible and society should signal its strong disapproval by insisting on a prison sentence. To do otherwise is putting a low value on human life.’ He added: ‘It might be that you have your dog on a lead and someone pokes it with a stick. But if you have a dog, whatever the circumstances, you cannot allow it to kill someone. If you do you should go to jail. The starting point for causing a death should be a serious custodial sentence.’","Rules would also apply if owner tried to get dog under control before death .

"A mother-of-three has credited a slice of pizza with saving her life after she detected a breast lump while eating it. Melanie Thorpe, from  Cumbria, found the lump while brushing the crumbs from her salami and mushroom pizza off her shirt. Concerned, she  saw her GP and just five days later was given the devastating news she had breast cancer. Melanie Thorpe, with husband Craig, detected the lump in her breast while brushing the crumbs from her salami and mushroom pizza off her shirt . Mrs Thorpe, 52, said: 'I felt absolutely fine and have always been fit and healthy so I had no idea there could have been something wrong. 'It was November 2012 and my youngest son had gone off to university - as a family we always sat at the table to eat, but my husband Craig and I had pizza and were sitting with it on our knees. 'I dropped some on my shirt and went to brush it off and felt a lump. 'I had never noticed it before. 'It wasn't big. but it was substantial and I could definitely feel it - it wasn't just like when you have a spot on your skin.' The next morning she phoned her GP - and was given an appointment within the hour. 'They referred me to Royal Lancaster Infirmary and I had an appointment later that day,' said Mrs Thorpe. 'I met with a surgeon and they did scans. It was all so fast.' Just five days after finding the lump, Mrs Thorpe (pictured before her illness), was given the devastating news she had cancer. She underwent a mastectomy, breast reconstruction and chemotherapy . Scans revealed she actually had two lumps, both of which were cancerous. In January 2013, Mrs Thorpe underwent eight-and-a-half hours of surgery. Mrs Thorpe, who is mother to Adam, 29, Alex, 27, and Niall, 20, said: 'I had to have a full mastectomy, but they did reconstructive surgery at the same time. 'I always say I went to sleep with two boobs, and woke up with two boobs.' Doctors deemed the surgery to be a success and Mrs Thorpe went on to have six rounds of chemotherapy. She now has six-monthly check ups to make sure the cancer has not returned. She added: 'The doctors told me had I not found the lump so early it would have grown and been terminal. 'So I guess the pizza saved my life.' As a result, she is now backing an early diagnosis campaign. 'It is so important to get the message across so that people get checked out if they feel any any slight changes,' she said. Breast lumps are common and have a number of different causes - and 90 per cent of them are benign. Although most lumps aren't breast cancer, any unusual changes to the breasts should be checked by a GP as soon as possible, explain experts writing for the NHS Choices website. If your GP finds a lump on examination, they will routinely refer you to be seen by a hospital specialist. While 90 per cent of breast lumps are benign, experts stress it's important to be breast aware and take note of any changes or warning signs . There are several types of benign (non-cancerous) breast lump, most of which are harmless and are caused by hormonal changes that occur at different times in a woman's life, such as during the menstrual cycle. Common types of benign breast lump include: . *a fibroadenoma – a firm lump that moves around easily in the breast and is more common in younger women . * a breast cyst – a smooth, firm fluid-filled lump most commonly seen in women aged 30 to 60 . * a breast abscess – a painful collection of pus that forms under the skin of the breast, usually as the result of a bacterial infection . The website advice stresses it's important to be 'breast aware' so you can identify any problems in your breasts and get them checked out as soon as possible. This means being familiar with your breasts and what is normal for them, and examining them regularly for any changes. If you are 50 years or over, it's also important to attend breast cancer screening appointments every three years. But don't wait until your next screening appointment if you notice any problems in your breast. You also should see your GP if you notice any other changes to one or both of your breasts, such as: . * an area of thickened tissue . * nipple discharge, which may contain blood . * a change in the size or shape of your breasts . * dimpling on the skin of your breasts . * a rash on or around your nipples . * a change in your nipple's appearance – for example, becoming sunken into your breast . * persistent pain in your breasts or armpits . * a lump or swelling in your armpits .

"'Unacceptable': Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson has spoken out about women not being rewarded equally in the workplace . Companies with more than 250 workers will be forced to publish details of their gender pay gap in a major Government U-turn. Liberal Democrat MPs are pushing to bring into effect measures in the 2010 Equality Act – which were not implemented by the Coalition – making companies publish the difference between male and female pay. Conservatives resisted the plans on the basis that companies should not be loaded with more red tape as the economy recovers from the financial crash. But government sources said that with Labour backing a change in the law, the Tories were confronted with the prospect of defeat in a crunch vote in the House of Lords. One said Conservative ministers had agreed the reform would be introduced, but only after a consultation with business leaders on exactly how it will work. Former Conservative deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine said he opposed the legislation because it would create ‘more bureaucracy, more forms, more deterrent for companies to take on people’. The new law will make it compulsory for larger companies to publish the average difference between the pay of their male and female employees. A voluntary approach to pay transparency encouraged by the Government has so far led to only five of the country’s larger companies revealing their gender pay gaps. Labour says that analysis of the Office for National Statistics’ annual survey of hours and earnings show that over a career, from the age of 22 to 64, a woman earns an average of £209,976 less than men. Gloria de Piero, shadow minister for women and equalities, said firms which had already decided to publish gender pay gap data had said ‘the ceiling didn’t cave in’, adding: ‘It just enabled them to see they had a problem and get to grips with it.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘While the Liberal Democrats have made real progress in areas like shared parental leave and extending the right to request flexible working, the labour market is still stacked against women. Gloria de Piero, shadow minister for women and equalities . ‘It simply cannot be acceptable that, in the 21st century, women on average still receive a smaller pay packet than men. ‘We can’t wait and we can’t dither. We need to sort this out now. Finally, we are now in a position for the Government to vote through our party’s manifesto commitment for large companies to publish the difference in average pay between male and female employees. ‘These measures will shine a light on a company’s policy so that women can rightly challenge their employer where they are not being properly valued and rewarded.’ A Lib Dem source added: ‘In discussions this week it was clear that the Tories wanted to delay taking any action on equal pay and kick the can down the road, just like they have for the last five years. ‘It’s a huge U-turn from the Tories but it’s welcomed. At last we can take some real action.’ The change in the law will be made in an amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill. Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson said: ‘It is utterly unacceptable that women are not being equally rewarded in the workplace.’ A Tory source said: ‘We have made sure there must be proper consultation with business about how it works – not something either Labour or the Lib Dems were concerned with.’ It will take 70 years before the gender pay gap closes worldwide, the United Nations has claimed. And it will be another 81 years before women have the same chance as men of becoming a chief executive, and 50 before women are just as likely to lead their country. According to the International Labour Organization, there is not a country in the world which has yet achieved gender equality. The UN agency found women who start families before they turned 25 suffered a particularly large ‘wage penalty’. Executive director of UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, said world leaders must ensure that ‘promoting gender equality’ was a ‘top issue on their agenda, which it isn’t now’.","Lib Dem MPs are pushing to bring new measures into effect regarding pay .

"President Obama said Tuesday that he has a 'businesslike' working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, but that the two men have virtually irreconcilable differences in their approaches to establishing a Palestinian state as a road to Middle East peace. 'We believe that two states is the best path forward for Israel's security, for Palestinian aspirations, and for regional stability,' Obama said during an afternoon  joint press conference with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. 'That's our view, and that continues to be our view.' Netanyahu, he said, 'has a different approach.' 'And so this can't be reduced to a matter of, somehow, ""Let's all hold hands and sing Kumbaya"",' the president told reporters in the East Room of the Whtie House. 'This is a matter of figuring out, ""How do we get through a real knotty policy difference that has great consequences for both countries and for the region?""' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO KUMBAYA: Obama said Netanyahu would likely kill off any chance for a two-state solution in the Middle East, and it couldn't be achieved simply by holding hands and 'singing' for peace . Benjamin Netanyahu . TENSIONS: Israeli security forces stand guard following clashes with Palestinian youths during protests against Jewish settlements in the West Bank . Netanyahu declared in the final days before last week's high-intensity elections that there would be no Paleestinian state as long as Israeli voters continued to give his Likud party enough seats in parliament to establish a governing majority and keep him as prime minister. 'I took him at his word, that that's what he meant,' Obama said, later saying of prospects for a two-state solution that 'that possibility seems very dim.' 'We'll continue to engage the Israeli government as well as the Palestinians,' he insisted, 'and ask them – Where are they interested in going? And how do they see this issue being resolved?' 'But what we can't do is pretend that there's a possibility of something that's not there. And we can't continue to premise our public diplomacy based on something that everybody knows is not going to happen, at least in the next several years. Netanyahu had said in 2009 that he would be willing to endorse a 'demilitarized' Palestinian state as long as it recognized Israel's right to exist. But his pledge barely a week ago seemed to erase that option. After the election, Netanyahu clarified his campaign promise about never allowing a Palestinian state to take root. 'I said that the conditions for that today are not achievable for a simple reason,' he said during a Fox News Channel interview. 'Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinians, rejects consistently the acceptance of a Jewish State. He's made a pact with the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas that calls for our destruction.' 'And the conditions in the Middle East has changed to the point where any territory you withdraw from is immediately taken out by Iranian backed terrorists or by ISIS.' 'Right now we have to get the Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table,' he added, 'break their pact with Hamas and accept the idea of a Jewish state.' DISTRACTION: The president was in the East room with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai to talk about a potential troop withdrawal, but talk of Israel occupied nearly 20 minutes of the press conference . 'ASPIRATIONS' OF MAHMOUD ABBAS: While Palestinian-aligned terrorists call for the destruction of Israel, Obama aims to create conditions for the Palestinian Authority's peaceful coexistence with Israel . Obama declared on Tuesday that those conditions were unworkable. 'He pointed out that he didn't say ""never"",' the president said of Netanyahu's apparent flip-flop. 'but that there would be a series of conditions in which a Palestinian state could potentially be created.' 'But of course the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet any time soon.' Obama brushed off a follow-up question from a reporter about whether his administration would try to force the issue through the United Nations Security Council, where the U.S. has for decades blocked measures designed to establish a Palestinian state despite Israel's objections. He said he would wait until Netanyahu assembled his new coalition government before decidign whetehr to take action. Obama also took pains to clarify that any reassessment of U.S.-Israeli relations wouldn't have an impact on defense arrangements with Tel Aviv. 'Our military and intelligence cooperation with Israel will continue – unabated, unaffected – and we are absolutely committed to ensure that the Israeli people are safe,' he said, 'particularly from rocket attacks and terrorist attacks aimed on civilians.'","President said he takes Bibi at his word and believes he won't green-light a Palestinian state: 'That possibility seems very dim'

"A blind sled dog named Gonzo is never far from his brother Poncho, who for years has acted as his sight on the trails in New Hampshire. Now that the Alaskan husky brothers are nearing age 10, NH Sled Dog Rescue is looking to retire them and hope to send the two inseparable friends to the same family. Both Gonzo and Poncho were born with sight but in 2010, trainers started to realize Gonzo was losing his sight when he started tripping over his food. Inseparable: Blind sled dog Gonzo (left) is currently up for adoption with his brother Poncho (right), who has been acting as his sight on the trails for years. Both are currently up for adoption, and their rescue center hopes to find them a home where they can live together . When his blindness was initially diagnosed, a veterinarian urged his owners to keep him on the sled dog team, and that's when Poncho stepped up to the plate. 'At first it kind of upset him (Poncho) because it slightly hindered his ability to run straight because Gonzo was leaning up against him,' musher Wes Guerin told WMUR. 'Over time, Poncho kind of realized he was the only thing keeping his brother on the trail. He started to help him. If there was a left turn coming up or a right turn, he'd pull him this way or nudge him that way and do whatever he had to do to make sure he (Gonzo) didn't run off the trail or anything like that,' Guerin said. On the off occasion that Gonzo has run off the trail, Poncho has picked him up out of ditches by dragging him by the collar. A dog's seeing eye dog: Gonzo's sight first started failing in 2010, but his brother Poncho stepped in and helped direct him on sled dog runs. Poncho (left) and Gonzo (right) pictured above in 2013 . Runners: For years the brothers ran with Muddy Paw Sled Dog Kennel in Jefferson, New Hampshire giving tours in the winter months . 'I've run dogs in a lot of places, all over the country, and it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen sled dogs do,' musher Neil Beaulieu told the Associated Press in 2013. While the reliance on Poncho worked for several years, Gonzo eventually had to quit sled running this fall, when a doctor removed the other eye that was giving him limited sight. Since then he has become quite accustomed to life as an office dog while his brother continues to exercise with the other 131 dogs at the no-kill shelter. Retirement-ready dogs at NH Sled Dog Rescue can be adopted for a fee of $250, part of which goes to supporting the shelter. This year they have about 40 dogs up for sale at their Jefferson, New Hampshire facility. Alaskan huskies can live to age 16.","Gonzo the sled dog started losing his sight ten years ago .

"Conservative MP Priti Patel has accused her Labour election rival of sending her misogynistic and racist tweets, one of which likened her to a 'sexy Bond villain'. Ms Patel, who represents Witham in Essex, has called for John Clarke to be de-selected  after he compared her to a 'village idiot' on Twitter. He has since apologised, but Ms Patel has urged Labour leader Ed Miliband to take action against Mr Clarke, who she labelled a 'nasty piece of work'. Conservative MP Priti Patel (left) has accused her Labour election rival John Clarke (right) of sending her misogynistic and racist tweets, one of which likened her to a 'sexy Bond villain' The mother-of-one told Mr Miliband that Mr Clarke had been making 'derogatory, sleazy and demeaning comments, which had misogynistic and racist undertones to them'. In December, Mr Clarke responded to a tweet featuring Ms Patel's comments on the Autumn statement, writing: 'Witham calling: the village is missing its idiot! Come home Priti Patel...' Later that month he added: '@pritipatelmp was elected to represent the constituents of Witham, NOT the Indian community (note I didn't say Asian...why?)' In February he sent Ms Patel a link to another tweet asking: 'There's a woman on the Conservative front bench who looks like she'd be the Sexy Bond Villain. Who is she!? #PMQs' He wrote: '@pritipatelmp If you're the ""sexy Bond villain"" does that make me Bond, James Bond? (Cue the music!)' In December, Mr Clarke responded to a tweet featuring Ms Patel's comments on the Autumn statement, writing: 'Witham calling: the village is missing its idiot! Come home Priti Patel...' In February Mr Clarke sent Ms Patel a tweet which likened her to a James Bond villain . Ms Patel told Labour leader Ed Miliband that Mr Clarke had been making 'derogatory, sleazy and demeaning comments, which had misogynistic and racist undertones to them' Last week the former teacher and university lecturer emailed Ms Patel to say: 'I would like to apologise to you for any offence caused and assure you that any inaccuracies will not be repeated' The next week he wrote: '@pritipatelmp Did the character Deepa on the Channel 4 programme UKIP first 100 days remind u of anyone? 'Like....Selling out principles, etc'. Ms Patel, who was elected in 2010 with a 15,000 majority, also accused Mr Clarke of 'lies' after he claimed in a leaflet that she employed her husband Alex Sawyer on more than £50,000 a year. 'He has been trolling me for ages and ages,' she said. Priti Patel was elected to the seat of Witham in Essex in the 2010 election, having been placed on the Conservatives 'A-list' of prospective candidates following David Cameron's selection as party leader. She won the seat, created following a boundary review, with a 15,000 majority. Ms Patel was born and raised in London after her parents came to Britain from Uganda in the 1970s. She studied at Keele University and the University of Essex, and after graduating, was given a job at Conservative Central Office but then left to work in the press office of the Eurosceptic, single issue Referendum Party. She rejoined the Conservatives in 1997, working in William Hague's press office, but left to join Weber Shandwick. Ms Patel stood as a Conservative candidate in the 2005 general election but lost the Nottingham North poll in a landslide to long-standing Labour MP Graham Allen. Ms Patel is known for her strong stance on crime, but has been criticised for her support on tobacco industry positions and had voted for the smoking ban to be overturned in 2010. She is married to marketing director Alex Sawyer, and the couple have a son, Freddie, who was born in  2008. 'I wrote to Ed Miliband and asked him ""what are you going to do about this nasty piece of work? Is this party policy? Do you sanction this sort of behaviour?"" 'I have had no response so I wrote him another letter asking him ""what are you going to do?"" 'On Friday I got a one-line email from him saying ""Ms Patel I apologise"" and that was it,' said Ms Patel, whose parents were Ugandan immigrants of Indian heritage who moved to Britain in the early 1970s. Last week the former teacher and university lecturer emailed Ms Patel to say: 'I would like to apologise to you for any offence caused and assure you that any inaccuracies will not be repeated.' A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The candidate has apologised for any offence caused and we are satisfied that any inaccuracies will not be repeated.' But Ms Patel retorted last night: 'Until Ed Miliband turns around and says 'this is not acceptable, we are taking action against this individual', it is simply not enough.' She added: 'It is not just what he has put on Twitter, it has been his conduct for what has been a considerable period of time. 'I could take further action if I want to. 'I am going to get back in touch with Ed Miliband and say: ""Are you going to stand by this guy? Are you sanctioning this kind of behaviour basically?"" 'The apology does not go nearly far enough. 'As if he can brush that under the carpet after publishing a leaflet with loads of lies about me. 'In my opinion he is totally unsuitable for public office.' Conservative Party vice chairman Rebecca Harris has also demanded that Mr Clarke is sacked and replaced. 'This sort of behaviour does nothing to improve the image of politics in the eyes of the public, and I believe may be a deliberate attempt to appeal to the most unpleasant racial prejudice in our society,' she said.

"The alleged rapist who was lynched by a mob in India offered his victim £50 to keep quiet about the attack, she has claimed. Shocking pictures showed the angry mob of 2,000 people after they broke into a prison, kidnapped the man, stripped him naked and mercilessly beat him to death in front of a frenzied crowd. The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college on February 24, and he was arrested a day later. Now the alleged rape survivor has spoken out, accusing the lynched man of giving her £50 to not tell anyone about the attack. Scroll down for video . Furious: Several thousand people gathered as the man (pictured, top) accused of raping a girl last month was mercilessly beaten to death . Lynched: The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death. It is unclear whether he is dead in this shocking image . Shocking: The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college multiple times in February and he was arrested a day later . Offer: The woman says that the man offered her £50 to keep quiet about the alleged attack . Speaking anonymously to a local TV station, the woman said: 'The accused person was my neighbour. 'It was only after the incident...he told me, he gave me the money to keep silent...I took the money and gave it at the police station.' The pictures showed the mob after they overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man. According to local media reports, he died while being dragged four miles through the streets as people beat and pelted him with stones. It was reported that the crowd tore down two gates before dragging him to the town's clock tower. It was said they also set fire to homes and shops in an area where the suspect ran his business. Several people were injured when police used batons and opened fire, while officers were hurt when the mob pelted them with stones in Nagaland state in northeast India. A 25-year-old believed to be part of the mob was injured when police opened fire and he later died in hospital. The police later removed the man's body. Accused: The alleged rapist has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express . Protesters: A mass rally was held in Dimapur by those who oppose the rape of a student last month . But the family of the lynched man have maintained his innocence and say the medical report of the rape complainant proves that she was not sexually assaulted. The man has been named by Indian media as Syed Sarif Uddin Khan and his brother Jamal said the killing was 'politically motivated' and accused police of 'falsely implicating his brother on behest of Naga groups, who want to root out non-tribals from the state'. Nagaland's indigenous tribal groups, especially the largest Naga tribe, have for years accused the growing population of Bengali-speaking Muslims from nearby Assam state and Bangladesh of illegally settling on their land and usurping resources. Nagas have previously campaigned to evict Bengali-speaking immigrants from their territory, who they claim entice local girls into marriage for getting tribal status. Jamaluddin, an Indian army sergeant, accused Nagaland's government of 'deliberately dubbing him as a Bangladeshi... to justify the killing'. 'The girl's medical report didn't confirm rape but still my brother was jailed and then handed over to the mob who lynched him just because he was a Bengali-speaking person. 'There are multiple members of our family serving in the Army. How could they have killed him claiming he was Bangladeshi? My brother was made a scapegoat.' Police had initially claimed that the man was an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant. 'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it . India is in midst of a raging controversy over a government order to ban the broadcast of a documentary about the December 2012 gang-rape of a young student. The incident, which sparked outrage both in India and around the world, highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the country. The Indian government has also asked YouTube to block access to the documentary, claiming that its broadcast violated certain key agreements with the filmmaker. But the Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch the documentary, which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'. The documentary, called 'India's Daughter', was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack. The film by award-winning Briton Leslee Udwin, who produced 1999 indie hit East is East, was due to air on the BBC and Indian news channel NDTV to mark International Women's Day this Sunday. But it was dropped by NDTV following the ban and the BBC brought forward its screening to Wednesday, citing a strong public interest. India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh vowed there would be consequences for the Corporation, telling NDTV: 'We had asked to not release the documentary but BBC still released it. 'We will investigate and the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) will take action accordingly. The conditions have been breached so action will be taken accordingly. I won't comment any further.' Protest: The woman's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens . The hour-long documentary aired as part of the long-running Storyville series on BBC Four, and is believed to have been accessed by many in India online. The victim's family showed their support for the film, saying the rapist's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think. The victim's father, who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies, told NDTV the film was 'the bitter truth'. 'Everyone should watch the film,' he said. 'If a man can speak like that in jail, imagine what he would say if he was walking free?' The victim's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed Singh's views were widespread in India. Horror: The crew obtained an interview with killer Mukesh Singh, who said the student was to blame . 'I don't care what the government does, bans the film, doesn't ban the film, the only thing I know is that nobody is afraid,' she said. 'It is not only Mukesh who thinks like this.' Mukesh Singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012. Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack. The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines. Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape. Many in the country still believe that women are subservient - illustrated by convict Singh, who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected. 'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back,' he said. 'She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after 'doing her', and only hit [her friend] the boy.' He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two' and insisted: 'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night. 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. 'Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. About 20 per cent of girls are good.'","Woman who was allegedly raped says man tried to buy her silence .

"After undergoing spinal surgery last week, television presenter Peter Overton is being nursed back to health in hospital by his wife Jessica Rowe. The 48-year-old journalist shocked fans last Monday when he posted a selfie from his hospital bed showing oxygen tubes in his nose. His wife, Studio 10 presenter Rowe, has spoken of her part in her husband's recovery, claiming she has taken on the role of Florence Nightingale. Scroll down for video . On the mend: Channel Nine newsreader Peter Overton is recovering in hospital after undergoing spinal surgery on Monday. He posted a selfie to Twitter with wife Jessica Rowe by his side and she has told Daily Mail Australia that the sudden nature of her husband's back problem gave them a' fright' ‘I'm doing my best Florence Nightingale,' the mother-of-two told her colleagues on Studio 10. 'As I talk to you I'm actually hiding around the nurses station trying not to disturb anyone.' The 44-year-old said her husband is still in a lot of pain but she hopes to have him home with her and their two children in the near future. ‘He’s going ok, he’s still in quite a bit of pain but hopefully I’ll have him home soon,' she said. 'It’s been a bit of a full-on week but he’s getting there.’ According to 9News, Overton was in constant pain while reading the news last week and had lost almost all feeling in his right arm and hand. Nine explained that he took leave for treatment on Thursday and an MRI scan revealed that he had a ruptured disc near the top of his spine. The risk of permanent nerve damage was so great and his pain so bad that a neurosurgeon made the decision to operate 'almost immediately'. 'But he is doing really well and I am under instructions to bring a really good coffee, a double shot,' Rowe said. Peter Overton and his wife Jessica Rowe pictured with their two children Allegra and Giselle and Peter's Parents Dr John Overton and his wife Charlotte celebrating at a restaurant in Sydney's north . Nine newsreader Peter Overton, 48, has been wracked with pain for more than a week while on the set of the 6pm news and had lost almost all the feeling in his right arm before being diagnosed with a ruptured disc and undergoing emergency back surgery to avoid permanent damage . The news veteran shocked the industry when he posted a selfie from his hospital bed with his wife Jessica by his side. 'My darling wife a delight 2 see after emerging from spinal surgery,' he captioned the image uploaded to Twitter. '& Tks my [Channel Nine] mates 4 fab support,' he added. Overton was believed to be suffering back problems at work recently and looked like a shadow of the typically smiling face that's beamed into Australian homes each night for the 6pm bulletin, as he recovered in hospital from an operation to relieve what was originally believed to have been a pinched nerve. It's since been revealed the problem was much more serious and Peter risked permanent damage if surgery was not undertaken to fix a ruptured disc. The TV personality looked pale and a little shaken, clad in a white hospital gown. 'He’s recovering, the great news is the surgery went really well and his doctor is really pleased and he is expected to make a full recovery,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'He’s already looking forward to getting back to work as soon as possible and doing the school runs so I can get back to work too. 'The signs are good after the way it happened, the urgency of it because it was so unexpected, he’s recovering well, so we can’t ask for any more than that.'

Friends as diverse as celebrity chef Matt Moran, Today Show host Deborah Knight, and radio presenter Ben Fordham all sent their best wishes to the popular presenter. Writing on Twitter, Deborah Knight wished Pete well, writing, 'Oh Pete- no wonder you were in pain! Speedy recovery.' Jessica's Studio 10 co-host and Shark Tank  presenter Sarah Harris wished the couple 'lots of love' while 2GB presenter Ben Fordham said, 'Hope you're OK,Pete.' MasterChef and Paddock to Plate star Matt Moran wrote, 'get well buddy'. Show of support: Channel Nine news colleague and Today Show presenter Deborah Knight was quick to wish Peter well on Twitter . Former Channel Nine star and now 2GB radio presenter Ben Fordham joined the chorus of support . Food for thought! Celebrity chef and MasterChef star Matt Moran was thinking of Peter as well . Peter has been an enduring face on Australian television screens for almost 25 years. After beginning as a sports reporter, he eventually became a contributor for 60 Minutes and now anchors Nine's nightly news bulletin. Some of his more memorable and award-winning TV moments include his coverage of the Thredbo landslide disaster in 1997, co-anchored by Tracy Grimshaw, and the Queensland floods stories which saw him win a joint Logie in 2012. He was awarded another Logie - shared with the Nine News team- in 2014 in honour of the network's coverage of the Blue Mountains bushfires. Peter Overton has had a coveted news career, winning several Logies, most recently in 2014 as part of Nine's bushfire coverage . Before Pete's surgery it appeared Jessica, 44 and her media personality husband are expanding their property portfolio, having purchased an investment property on Sydney's North Shore just before Christmas, according to the Sunday Telegraph. The modern two-bedroom apartment is located in the landmark Cammeray Towers building, the newspaper reports, and boasts water views of Middle Harbour, and a balcony. It is unknown how much they purchased the property for, however recent sales in the same block have been snapped up for between $800,000 and $1.1million.

"Whether James Corden’s reign as the host of American chat show The Late Late Show is a success in the long-run remains to be seen, but his debut last night proved one thing categorically: James Corden has arrived. Corden’s career has already seen him co-star in a Disney film with Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep and win a Tony award for his performances on Broadway beating Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John Lithgow, and James Earl Jones. This made those look like amateur dramatics. Scroll down for video . James Corden made his debut as the host of American chat show The Late Late Show last night . At 36-years-old Corden’s younger than his rivals on other networks and never before presented a chat show . It wasn’t just that the guests for his first show were Tom Hanks and Mila Kunis. As major as they are, they were almost incidental. The devil was in the detail. To say CBS were determined to ANNOUNCE Corden’s arrival and put him on the map is an understatement. The President of CBS himself, Leslie Moonves, appeared in a segment bestowing upon Corden the opportunity of the job in the manner of a Golden Ticket a la Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory. Several big names  also made fleeting appearances trying to find it and get the gig too, with such illustrious stars as Chris Rock, Billy Crystal, Simon Cowell, Lena Dunham, Chelsea Handler, and Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne reduced to the status of Corden's supporting cast. Other cameos came from Shia LaBeouf, Arnold Schwarzenegger as his personal trainer, Jay Leno knocking him about a bit, and Meryl Streep giving him a pep talk using lyrics from Lady Gaga. Phew. There was probably a celebrity kitchen sink in there too. It’s little wonder Corden was overwhelmed. So many members of the public and the media have given their opinion over the past few weeks on whether James Corden will cut it that judging him after only one programme seems almost reasonable. But hey that’s showbiz. Corden himself has been around long enough to know that. Welcome: Celebrity guests Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks were almost incidental in last nights proceedings . Corden managed to secure an exclusive from actress Mila Kunis with the news that she had already married Ashton Kutcher . At 36 he’s younger than his rivals on other networks and never even presented a chat show before but he’s been building up to this moment since the days he appeared in a Tango ad and an episode of Hollyoaks 15 years ago. His first episode presenting The Late Late Show must go down as a success. Besides delivering the likes of Hanks, Streep, and Arnie, Cordon secured an exclusive from Mila Kunis with the news that she had married Ashton Kutcher – even though the revelation was probably rehearsed rather than spontaneous. The parodies with Tom Hanks also showed Corden in his element – being funny, and clearly having a great time. Nonetheless, watching Corden bounce out on to the set for his much-discussed debut, like a boisterous, British Tigger and nervously tap his question cards while he gabbled to Hanks and Kunis, made you worry whether he can add being an American chat show host to his repertoire. Opening sketch: Corden started the show with a sketch showing him winning the 'golden ticket' Advise: Former chat show host Jay Leno imparted some words of wisdom to the 36-year-old father-of-two at the start of the show . You even almost felt sorry for him. This is a strange thing to say and somewhat ironic, considering the self-confessed “chunky unit” from High Wycombe is not so much living the American Dream as fulfilling the fantasy of every ambitious actor, comedian, and TV presenter across the globe. You didn’t envy him. But you had to admire his courage. After all, there are no audiences more demanding or instantly unforgiving than the critics or viewers of American television. And the nightly, late-night, talk show is one of the great staples of American television – a tradition that made the likes of Johnny Carson, Merv Griffin, Jay Leno, and David Letterman among the most famous stars in the country, making their weekly UK equivalents Jonathon Ross, Graham Norton, and even Parkinson look like part-timers. Corden represents a risky choice, even without the minor detail that he has never presented a chat show before. True, Corden is taking over The Late Late Show from another relatively obscure Brit - Scotsman Craig Ferguson, whose reign lasted an impressive/incredible ten years. But as Piers Morgan found out when he succeeded CNN legend Larry King, these are different times. The appointment of an English star now causes instant controversy with American audiences and the U.S. press not to mention jealousy from other comedians or presenters. Arnold Schwarzenegger was among a host of celebrities making a fleeting appearance in the show . Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep assured the British comic that he was ready for his big break in America . Emmy award winning actress Allison Janney also gave Corden her support in the opening show . Shia Labeouf was also on hand to provide some last minutes pearls of wisdom to the British star . Fellow Brit and Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne made a fleeting appearance on the screen . Corden’s biggest dilemma is whether he should play safe or whether he needs to be more edgy. Another issue is how much of a twist Corden can give such a well-established format. Americans’ fondness for Johnny Carson, Letterman, Leno, and Ferguson’s Late Late Show has been based on a familiarity established over decades. They were essentially the same every night. On the other hand, the likes of Stephen Colbert, Conan O’Brien, Jon Stewart, and Saturday Night Live have thrived thanks to their subversive, satirical, bite and unpredictability. So far Corden has hedged his bets. His version of The Late Late Show sticks faithfully to the formula of a house band, smooth comic monologue, and sketches. But there have already been rumours that some celebrities and their PRs are unhappy with the major change Corden and his UK producer have introduced – bringing the guests out on to the sofa at the same time and chatting to them together. This was a feature of The Johnny Carson Show but faded in favour of giving stars the spotlight, being recently revived in this country by Graham Norton. Corden is young, largely unknown, and a novice - prompting several cries on American forums and social media of ‘who?’ In theory, his position gives him a chance to start from scratch, and make a name for himself as a distinctive original like fellow Brits abroad, Ricky Gervais, Russell Brand, and Sacha Baron Cohen. Corden paid tribute to his parents who were in the audience of his debut show after travelling over from the UK . The problem is, this is not James Corden’s style. In fact, Corden’s main handicap may be the characteristic that is usually his biggest asset. Despite his clearly prodigious talents, Corden’s appeal has always been based on his everyday charm, gregarious enthusiasm, and evident excitement at what he’s doing. But it’s hard to imagine that America will tolerate any repeats of Corden’s excruciatingly sycophantic interview with Gary Barlow and star-struck sketches with David Beckham. During his years presenting A League Of Their Own, the way Corden’s been in awe of cricket star Freddie Flintoff and co. hardly bodes well for coping with America’s A list. After all, The Late Late Show is not breakfast television. The clue’s in the name... It’s true that his lovable cheek was such a hit in the Broadway production of One Man, Two Guvnors that he won a Tony, but you doubt his arrival will really be what one CBS presenter helpfully hyped as ‘the next step on the evolution of late night comedy.’ For a sketch Corden played dress-up with Tom Hanks as they parodied some of the actor's best loved movies . The sketches gave Corden the chance to do what he does best, 'Ham it up' and 'play the fool' Corden 'gave it his all' during the opening show as he attempted to win over the America audience . Big performance: Corden’s appeal has always been based on his everyday charm, gregarious enthusiasm, and evident excitement at what he’s doing . Hanks and Corden finished by singing ‘You've Got A Friend In Me’ from the Disney movie Toy Story . Corden will certainly struggle to provide the softly cynical insights and streetwise quips about the workings of celebrity and showbusiness that the likes of Letterman, Leno and their successors Conan O’Brien and Jimmy Fallon rely on in their interviews. It was hard to believe that Americans were going to respond well to the persona of a modest, apologetic Brit that Corden has presented. America likes its stars to be special not ordinary. Corden’s approach has been that of the bumbling, stunned ‘civilian’ who can’t believe his luck or done anything to earn his ‘Golden Ticket.’ American audiences are too sophisticated not to see through the mock humility when he says ‘it’s almost too much for my tiny brain to take in’ or ‘I’m talking as if I have any authority on this. I know nothing !’ A much better balance came in Corden’s anecdote about becoming annoyed that a photographer was taking pictures of him dining, only to find they were of Mila, who was eating in the same restaurant. The way that Corden and Hanks dressed up and parodied the star’s most famous movies gave Corden his chance to do what he does best: ham it up and endearingly play the fool, not least when he put a wig on to be Meg Ryan from Sleepless In Seattle. They finished by singing ‘You've Got A Friend In Me’ from Toy Story. The grand finale saw Corden take to a grand piano to sing a song about his first night in the American limelight. No one could say he didn’t give it his all.

"Statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, researchers claim. A breakthrough study found that the cholesterol-lowering drugs improved outcomes for those suffering from the common cardiac disorder. The medication has already been linked to a reduction in heart attacks. Prevention? Cholesterol-lowering statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, Scottish researchers found . But the latest research is the first to show the benefits for those at risk of heart failure – which occurs when the organ struggles to maintain adequate blood flow to the body. Scientists from the University of Glasgow said their findings herald a ‘significant benefit’ for the near-one million Britons affected by the condition. Exerts from the university’s Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences reviewed 17 statin trials involving more than 100,000 patients as part of their analysis. Lead researcher Dr David Preiss said: ‘Heart failure is disabling, expensive to treat, especially in more advanced stages, and patients have a poor outcome. ‘While it has been assumed that statins reduce the development of heart failure simply because they reduce heart attacks, to our surprise this had not been definitively shown before. ‘The results of this analysis clearly show a modest, but significant benefit, reducing hospital admission for heart failure by 10 per cent, which is clinically important.’ Heart failure happens when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. Around 100,000 Britons a year are thought to die from it. Damage: Heart failure (pictured) affects nearly a million Birtons and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body . Figures show 15 per cent of patients with the condition die in hospital – twice the European average – partly because of late diagnosis and treatment that fails to adequately control symptoms. Signs including swollen legs, tiredness and shortness of breath – which usually worsen following exercise. Dr Preiss added: ‘It is probable that statins decrease the degree of ischaemia [lack of blood flow] that occurs before a heart attack, leading to a decrease in the number of people with other ischaemic events and reducing the chronic impact on the heart. ‘Further study of the potential mechanism is needed.’ The study found a 10 per cent reduction in first hospital admissions for heart failure, although researchers believe the impact of statins has been underestimated. The study was reported at the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress in Glasgow and was published online in The European Heart Journal. Between eight and ten million adults take statins – which are now the most widely prescribed drugs in the UK. The NHS estimates they save 7,000 lives a year in the UK, despite growing concern over the extent of side effects such as increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Doctors once prescribed the drug to those with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade, but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005. Under current guidance, the threshold is even lower. Those who have a 10 per cent or greater risk are being offered statins, including patients aged 80 and over. Cholesterol-lowering drugs can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent, researchers claim. A new study shows for the first time that statins improve the outcome for those suffering from a common heart disorder. Researchers from the University of Glasgow carried out a review of 17 statin trials including over 100,000 patients. The new drugs block bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs . A new type of cholesterol-lowering drug may halve the risk of a heart attack or stroke, new research suggests. People taking the experimental drug for high cholesterol were half as likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke as those taking conventional statins. The results could offer an alternative to the estimated one in three Westerners with high cholesterol who have been unable to manage their condition with diet, exercise and statin drugs currently on the market. The results are 'really impressive and very encouraging' for the new drugs, said one independent expert, Dr Judith Hochman of NYU Langone Medical Center. The U.S. government will decide this summer whether to allow two of these drugs on the market. The drugs are evolocumab, which Amgen wants to call Repatha, and alirocumab, which Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi have named Praluent. They lower LDL or bad cholesterol more powerfully and in a different way than existing drugs, by blocking PCSK9, a substance that interferes with the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. Side effects remain a question, though, especially on thinking, confusion and memory - problems the FDA has already voiced concern about and asked the companies to track. Although the drugs are linked to a reduction in heart attacks, this did not explain the benefits in heart failure. Lead researcher Dr David Preiss, at the university’s Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, said: ‘Heart failure is disabling, expensive to treat, especially in more advanced stages, and patients have a poor outcome. 'While it has been assumed that statins reduce the development of heart failure simply because they reduce heart attacks, to our surprise this had not been definitively shown before. ‘The results of this meta-analysis clearly show a modest, but significant benefit, reducing hospital admission for heart failure by 10 per cent which is clinically important.’ Heart failure affects nearly a million Birtons and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body. Signs and symptoms including leg swelling, tiredness and shortness of breath, usually worse on exercise, can affect the patient’s quality of life. Dr Preiss said: ‘It is probable that statins decrease the degree of ischaemia (lack of blood flow) that occurs before a heart attack, leading to a decrease in the number of people with other ischaemic events and reducing the chronic impact on the heart. ‘Further study of the potential mechanism is needed.’ The study found a 10 per cent reduction in first heart failure hospital admission but researchers believe the impact has been underestimated. Overall, 200 patients with heart disease would need to be treated over 5 years to prevent one hospital admission. The study was reported at the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress in Glasgow and was published online in The European Heart Journal.","Glasgow researchers reviewed 17 statin trials involving 100,000 people .

"After the body 17-year-old  girl who went missing in early March was found face down and partially nude off the side of the road her best friend and friend's boyfriend were charged with her murder. Alexis Marie Garcia, of Birmingham, Alabama, was the victim of a brutal beating at the hands of her best friend and her friend's 39-year-old boyfriend, police said. Samantha Wright, 18, and Shannon Yager have been charged with capital murder. The capital charge comes from Garcia being killed after an alleged robbery and kidnapping, Blount County District Attorney Pamela Casey said. When Wright was interviewed by investigators, she said that drugs including meth and heroin were used the night of Garcia's death by all three parties. Alexis Marie Garcia, 17, was reported missing by her mother on March 5. Her body was found in Remlap, Alabama, on Monday . Samantha Wright (left), 18, and her boyfriend Shannon Yager (right), 39, were taken into custody on March 15. They are accused of beating Garcia to death in a drug-fueled attack earlier this month . Garcia's mother filed a missing persons report with the Birmingham Police Department on March 5, after last seeing her on March 1, police records show. Wright said she, Garcia and Yager had driven to Tucker Mountain Road in Remlap on the night of the incident, March 8, and she passed out. She said woke up to see Garcia taking off her clothes and making advances on Yager, according to AL.com. Blount County Sheriff's Department received a phone call from Wright's father on March 9, in which he said that his daughter called him after she woke up in a room covered in blood. She said she had blacked out and didn't know where she was, but told her father that she had been walking in the woods with Yager and Garcia, court records show. During interviews with investigators, Wright said that she started attacking Garcia (pictured) after she woke up from being passed out to see Garcia taking off her clothes and making advances on Yager . She reportedly told him that she believed something bad had happened to Garcia but didn't know where she or Yager was. A few days later Garcia's mother called investigators to tell them that there were some teenagers in the area who might know information. Deputy Mark Moon questioned a 13- and 14-year-old who said Wright told them she had done something she might regret later and that she might have killed someone, court records show. She reportedly told them that when she saw Garcia taking off her clothes and making advances toward Yager, she beat the girl unconscious. Wright then took the teens into the woods and threatened to kill them if they told anyone, court records show. Wright (left in both photos) reportedly called her father the day after the attack and told him she was covered in blood, didn't know where she was and couldn't find Garcia or Yager (right in both photos). Both Wright and Garcia have been charged with capital murder . Wright and Yager were found in St Clair on Monday and taken to the county jail - Yager had two outstanding warrants and Wright went voluntarily. During her interview with investigators, Wright told officials she was wearing Garcia's shoes and jeans. The teenager's jeans, shoes and underwear were missing when her body was found. When Yager was interviewed, his story varied from Wright's and he claimed that the last time he saw Garcia was near the car on Tucker Mountain Road. Garcia's body was discovered at about 10am on Thursday and investigators obtained capital murder warrants against Wright and Yager. Garcia's (pictured above) body was discovered at about 10am on Thursday. When Wright was questioned by officials, she said she was wearing Garcia's jeans and shoes when she was taken into custody. Garcia's body was found without shoes, jeans or underwear .","Alexis Marie Garcia's body was found in Remlap, Alabama on Monday .

"From Twitter abuse to derogatory comments on Facebook and abusive posts on Reddit, online bullying is a growing problem. Now a new survey has revealed that unpleasant and hurtful behaviour is becoming increasingly common in real life as well. One woman who knows all too well how that feels is Harnaam Kaur, 23, from Slough in Berkshire who has been growing a beard since the age of 16. Scroll down for video . Standing up to bullies: Harnaam Kaur, 23, appeared on This Morning to talk about her experiences . Facial hair: Ms Kaur began growing a beard aged 16 after developing polycystic ovary syndrome . She is one of the millions of British adults who have been bullied at some point in their lives, with most targeted about their appearance. Ms Kaur, who is now an anti-bullying campaigner, appeared on ITV's This Morning which commissioned the survey to discuss her experiences. Her problems began after she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that causes excess hair growth. As a result, the teaching assistant endured years of cruel taunts about her looks and spent thousands of pounds desperately trying to get rid of her beard. But after converting to Sikhism, a religion that forbids cutting hair, she decided to embrace her looks and allowed her beard to grow. Targeted: Ms Kaur, a teaching assistant, was bullied after developing facial hair due to her PCOS . Brave: Since becoming a Sikh, she has embraced her facial hair and appeared in a photography exhibition . Hard: Ms Kaur initially spent thousands trying to get rid of her facial hair but has now embraced it . PCOS is a common condition affecting a woman's ovaries, with three main features. These are cysts developing in their ovaries, the ovaries not regularly releasing eggs, and high levels of male hormones - 'androgens'. The syndrome is associated with irregular hormone levels in the body, including insulin. There is no cure for the condition, but medicine is available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth and fertility problems. Most women with the condition can get pregnant - but sometimes need a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling. This involves destroying tissue in the ovaries making androgens including testosterone . 'When I first started growing my beard it was for religious reasons but as the years have gone by I’ve kept it for more personal reasons,' she said in an interview conducted after her photo was included in an exhibition celebrating the world's best facial hair. 'It makes me feel like a brave, confident woman who isn't afraid to break society’s norms.' Sadly, Ms Kaur's experience of being bullied isn't unique. Women are slightly more likely to suffer abuse, with 55 per cent saying they had been bullied compared to 54 per cent of men. Nevertheless, both sexes suffered mental bullying such as unkind remarks, with 64 per cent of women claiming to have had to put up with cruel comments and 37 per cent of men. Male respondents were considerably more likely to have been subjected to physical attacks, with almost 20 per cent saying they had been beaten up by bullies. While small numbers reported being bullied because of their ethnicity or sexuality, the vast majority, 50.6 per cent, said they were bullied because of their looks. Speaking about the results, a spokesman for This Morning said: 'These numbers reflect the current bullying culture-situation among adults today. 'There are some  shocking results that our viewers have disclosed and on This Morning today we will go through these with guests who have suffered similar experiences. 'This Morning is a topical lifestyle programme and prides itself on covering every issue effecting its viewers and we hope all experiences and advice featured today will offer help and support to all currently being bullied.'","55 per cent of women and 54 per cent of men have been bullied .

"Arrested: Gina Louise Causey has been arrested for a false rape claim against a fictitious police officer . A Louisiana woman has been arrested after falsely claiming she was raped to hide from her husband the fact she had fallen pregnant through an extramarital affair say police. Gina Louise Causey, 40, was charged with criminal mischief after she arrived at Mandeville Police station with her husband on Tuesday crying rape. Causey spun an outlandish tale, claiming she was sexually assaulted by a police officer. She said he had raped several other women and he had caused her to become pregnant. According to Mandeville Police Cpl. Kevin Covert, her story was 'like something straight out of Hollywood'. She told police she was abducted at gunpoint in broad daylight while eating lunch at Mandeville lakefront. Her attacker then made her lie on the floor of his car and drove for 'only a minute or so' to a nearby house where he took her inside and raped her. Causey then said the fictitious rapist demanded she hand over her driver's license and he took a picture. He then put it into a box 'wtih several other women's driver's licenses' and told her if she went to the police he would know according to NOLA.com . Tall story: Casey said she was raped at the Mandeville lakefront on Tuesday by a police officer . The story was apparently too much for officers who doubted it from the start. They found inconsistencies with her time line and where she claimed to have been raped. When confronted Causey folded and admitted she made the whole thing up to hide an extramarital affair from her husband and that she had become pregnant. She has been booked on a misdemeanor charge and is unlikely to face jail time.",Gina Louise Causey was charged with criminal mischief but wont face jail .
"These horrific images show the squalid conditions inside a fly-infested, dirt-ridden home where a five year-old boy was neglected so badly that he did not know what a bath was for. The youngster had endured such a miserable upbringing that he told his foster carer that 'Santa' had stopped coming to visit his house, even though he had 'been good'. Today, as his mother and her partner were spared jail for child cruelty, images from inside the family's council house in York reveal the 'unimaginable filth' in which the child was forced to live. Squalor: These horrific images show the squalid conditions inside a fly-infested, dirt-ridden home where a five year-old boy was neglected so badly that he did not know what a bath was for . 'Unimaginable filth': Police found piled-up dirty crockery and rotten food strewn across the  house in York . 'Unkempt': The council house's lounge contained a double bed that was covered in dog hair, dirt and clothes . Rubbish and rotting food can be seen littered around the filthy home, while every work surface in the kitchen is covered in dirty crockery or moldy food. Amid a stench of rotten food wafting through the property, there was also an abundance of insects and flies which swamped the tiny, cramped rooms. Shockingly, dog faeces, dog hair and clothing were also found strewn across the house, including on the carpet, the doors and even on a double bed, which had been set up in the living room. Among the chaos was a filthy mug, with the words 'top daddy' ironically emblazoned across the front. Authorities had been alerted to the boy's plight after he escaped from the house and his frantic mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang the police. He was later found a mile from his council house in York and told police he had 'woken up and looked around the house and nobody was home'. York Crown Court had heard how police then visited the house and found it in unimaginable filth with every surfaced piled high with dirty dishes. Filthy: Officers discovered the mess after the boy escaped from the house and his mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang the police. He was found wandering alone, a mile from the home . Chaos: The living room was packed full of boxes, plastic bags and a haphazard toy book, full of broken toys . 'Top daddy': Ironically, police found a filthy mug languishing in the living room, with the words 'top daddy' emblazoned on the side . It emerged that foster carers had found several of his baby teeth had their roots exposed with abscesses while six had to be removed. There was no toothbrush suitable for his use in his house. Prosecutor Aisha Wadoodi said: 'Every work surface in the kitchen was covered in dirty crockery and rotting food. There was only rotting food in the fridge. 'The floor was covered in dog hair and clothing. The back yard was covered in dog excrement. The lounge contained a double bed that was covered in dog hair and dirt. 'The property was very dirty and unkempt. There was an odour of stale and rotting food and a lot of insects and flies flying about everywhere.' She said it later emerged the little boy didn not know what a bath was for or how to be washed. The boy's 43-year-old mother (left) and her partner, 42, (right), whose faces have been obscured by MailOnline for legal reasons, were spared jail despite admitting two charges of child cruelty . 'Very serious neglect': There was also said to be a stench of stale, rotten food, wafting through the home . Concerns: Sentencing, the judge said he had 'grave concerns' about the couple's failure to accept help . Ms Wadoodi added: 'The foster carer reported that when she first gave him a bath he seemed very frightened and she also observed that he had wax coming out of his ears. 'He showed considerable discomfort while eating. He told his foster carer that Santa doesn't come to his house.' The court heard how the boy's school contacted the mother in 2013 expressing concerns about his hygiene and tiredness. Although this temporarily improved, the court heard how his hygiene then spiralled again towards the end of the academic year. The prosecutor added that, months down the line, his foster mother now describes the child as 'a lovely little boy, very chatty, open and likes to please people'. Grime: This close-up picture of the kitchen shows rust, dirt and grease lining the appliances . Victoria Smith-Swain, for the 43 year-old mother, said she had a long history of depression which she described as 'forty years of baggage surrounding her childhood'. The woman and her 42-year-old partner admitted two charges of child cruelty but were spared jailed. Sentencing them at Leeds Crown Court, Judge Rodney Jameson QC described the case as 'very unhappy' and involved 'very serious' child neglect. He said: 'It is almost inconceivable you let yourself and your child live in this squalor without some psychiatric difficulty. 'You knew the problems that you had and were offered help but didn't take it. 'I have grave concerns about your failure to accept help. I find this a very worrying aspect of the case.' The mother was handed a 18-month prison sentence suspended for two years, while her partner was jailed for six months, also suspended for two years. The couple were also ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.","Police alerted to boy's plight when he was found wandering streets alone .

It can end the failed austerity experiment, end the spiteful blaming of the poor, the sick, the vulnerable for the mistakes of the wealthy. ‘This election can be a turning point in history.’ Miss Bennett announced that free social care for over-65s would be a pledge in the party’s manifesto, due to be released at the end of the month, because she said it was vital in a ‘decent, humane’ society. She did not explain how this would be funded, but said ‘those who have the most’ should contribute and said the party would introduce a new wealth tax, a financial transaction tax and higher income tax for those earning more than £100,000. Caroline Lucas, the party’s former leader and only MP, said there had been talks with the SNP and Plaid Cymru about acting as a left-wing bloc of MPs at Westminster in the event of a Labour government. ‘With the rise of the SNP, and with our own Green surge, we have the chance to forge a new grouping in Parliament. A progressive alliance,’ she said. She added that the parties were united in their ‘opposition to austerity and cuts to essential services’ and would work to block the Labour party ‘when they ape the Tories’.

Caroline Lucas, the party’s former leader and only MP, said there had been talks with the SNP and Plaid Cymru about acting as a left-wing bloc of MPs at Westminster in the event of a Labour government . Over 1,300 Green Party members are expected to attend the three-day conference this weekend. They will debate matters including a motion ‘to remove our policy to ban all cars’. A poll conducted by ComRes for ITV News yesterday revealed that the party is most likely to be associated by the British public as ‘idealistic’ (41 per cent) and ‘amateurish’ (35 per cent). But it also found voters are more likely to associate the Greens with the phrases ‘A party of the future’ (21 per cent) or ‘appealing’ (18 per cent) than they would associate with the Liberal Democrats (9 per cent and 11 per cent respectively).","Miss Bennett said the general election could be 'a turning point in history'

"A report into the death of Joe Lawton, 17, who killed himself after being arrested for drink driving, has confirmed 'failings' at the station where he was held . A report into the death of an A-grade student who killed himself days after being arrested for drink driving found 'evidence of a concerning culture' at the police station where he was held. Joe Lawton, 17, shot himself dead at his parent's £850,000 home in Disley, Stockport, two days after being held at Cheadle Heath police station for drink driving. During an inquest into his death, lawyers for his parents claimed that police had mocked him for his middle class upbringing and his new car, contributing to his death. Now an Independent Police Complaints Commission report into Mr Lawton's death, made public for the first time, confirms there were 'failings' at Cheadle Heath police station where the teen was held. The IPCC probe, which was kept hidden from the teen's inquest but has been revealed by the Manchester Evening News, uncovered 'evidence of a concerning culture' at Cheadle Heath. Following the report one Greater Manchester Police sergeant was moved from custody duty due to ‘inappropriate behaviour’, while another was given ‘management advice’, the report says. Two custody detention officers were also subjected to sanctions as a result of the investigation, according to a copy of the IPCC report obtained by the Manchester Evening News. Mr Lawton was stopped by police in Hazel Grove in August 2012 while driving his new Peugeot 207 home from a party, just weeks after passing his test. A breathalyzer showed he was over the drink drive limit and he was arrested. Lawyers for Mr Lawton's parents Nick and Jane (pictured) told an inquest their son was bullied for his middle class upbringing. The report, revealed today, found 'evidence of a concerning culture' among police . The teen, who had recently gained one A and four Bs in his AS-Levels and was working on his university application and travel plans, was then held for seven hours overnight. But due to an 'anomaly' in custody laws meaning 17-year-olds are treated as adults, Mr Lawton's parents Nick and Jane were not informed of the arrest after he opted not to tell them. Two days later he was found dead at home by his father. Next to the body was the police charge sheet, and a note saying he thought he had 'ruined his life'. His parents have since led a successful campaign to have the age limit raised to 18, after an inquest was told Mr Lawton's suicide could ‘very likely’ have been avoided if they were informed. The IPCC report, together with a response from Greater Manchester Police, were prepared in time for the inquest but were not submitted as evidence, meaning this is the first time they have been made public. Nick and Jane Lawton said the inquest was turned into a ‘gruelling and frustrating’ process by the police's failure to reveal the reports. In a statement, they hit out at the ‘behaviour and attitude of the custody officers’, adding: 'We love Joe and will continue to miss him every day for the rest of our lives.' Mr Lawton's parents were not informed that their son had been arrested in August 2012 due to an 'anomaly' in custody laws. Parents Nick and Jane (pictured) have since successfully campaign to have the law changed . The IPCC said the force has said it has ‘learned lessons and had been improving working practice’. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who gave evidence at the inquest, said: 'Our thoughts continue to be with the family of Joseph Lawton, and we sympathise with the issues they have raised following this tragedy. 'When Joseph died in 2012 there was a confusing anomaly where the Police and Criminal Evidence act led the police to treat 17-year-olds as adults, whilst the Children’s Act stated that 17-year-olds should be treated as children. 'Following the case and a judicial review in 2013 the government have changed the legislation relating to 17-year-olds in custody. 'The new legislation states that when a 17-year-old is arrested they are now treated as children for the purposes of informing people about the child’s detention. 'While in custody Joseph made the decision that he did not want anyone to be informed of his arrest. However, if this happened today we would have informed his parents.'","Joe Lawton, 17, killed himself after being arrested for drink driving in 2012 .

Fireworks, singing, dancing and music-playing are a constant theme of the celebration. The locals say that everything that is bad is burnt, and reborn fresh for spring. Each neighbourhood of the city is required to produce a 'falla' - a wooden sculpture that is eventually burnt. There are different speculations regarding the origin of the Falles festival. One suggests that the Falles started in the Middle Ages, when artisans disposed of the broken artifacts and pieces of wood they saved during the winter by burning them to celebrate the spring equinox. Valencian carpenters used planks of wood called parots to hang their candles on during the winter, as these were needed to provide light to work by. With the coming of the spring, they were no longer necessary, so they were burned. Over time, and with the intervention of the Church, the date of the burning of these parots was made to coincide with the celebration of the festival of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters. The timing of the events is fixed and they fall on the same date every year, though there has been discussion about holding some events on the weekend preceding the Falles, to take greater advantage of the tourist potential . The five-day celebration is full of joy, fireworks and singing, although the Offering of the Flowers is a more sombre occasion .

"When the US President visits the Queen, you’d expect only the finest wines to be served. But President Obama had to endure a vin very ordinaire at Buckingham Palace, as guests at the occasion of his state banquet were given a wine civil servants had secretly judged to be ‘soapy’ and ‘harshly acidic’. Officials in charge of the Government’s wine cellar, which is managed by the Foreign Office, provided bottles of 2004 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos, despite the batch having been found wanting according to the Government hospitality stock report. Royal toast: The Queen and President Barack Obama during a state banquet at Buckingham Palace in May 2011 . Listing the drinks to be served to visiting dignitaries, the 60-page document has been obtained by this newspaper under Freedom Of Information laws. The Queen’s banquet for Mr Obama at Buckingham Palace on May 24, 2011, was the culmination of his first state visit to Britain. The 170 guests included Prince Charles, David Cameron and film stars Kevin Spacey and Tom Hanks. On the menu were dishes of sole, Windsor lamb and charlotte a la vanille mousse for dessert. The guests were given a selection of wines and ports, including the Chablis. Robert Alexander OBE, head of Government Hospitality, inspects a bottle inside the Government's Wine Cellar . The stock report grades wines with a rating of A1, A, B, or C and records what officials think of them after tastings. Bottles of 2004 Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos were served to President Obama despite the batch having been found wanting . The Burgundy is rated B and in October 2008 was described as being ‘slightly soapy’. A tasting in February 2011 noted the wine, which can sell for up to £100 a bottle, had a ‘harsh acidity’. But despite these concerns, it was served up at the banquet three months later. Shortly after the meal, the following note was added to the file: ‘Used on US State Visit. Feedback from the Palace.’ There is no explanation of what that feedback might have been, although a comment added a month later suggests it might not have been positive. An official wrote: ‘Bottle variation, drink by 2013.’ MoS Event magazine wine expert Olly Smith said: ‘The notes seem to suggest there might have been issues with “bottle variation” which occurs as a wine ages. 'Individual bottles can be affected in different ways, depending on the amount of oxygen which has interacted with the wine.’ The Foreign Office said: ‘All wines for use on state visits are carefully selected… the Palace regularly offers informal feedback on wines supplied for state visits.’ Bottles of Chassagne Montrachet Cru Virondot 2002 lined up in the Government's wine cellar .","Barack Obama was served Chablis at a Buckingham Palace state banquet .

"Cabinet Office Minister Rob Wilson claimed he received ‘darkly veiled threats’ to drop claims that police failed to warn a young mother she was working with a dangerous paedophile who went on to abuse her son . A Tory Minister is embroiled in an explosive row with Britain’s top policewoman amid claims she ‘threatened’ him over a child sex abuse case. Cabinet Office Minister Rob Wilson said Sara Thornton, the chief constable of Thames Valley Police, tried to stop him raising allegations of police errors in a ‘sickening’ paedophile scandal. Wilson claimed he received ‘darkly veiled threats’ to drop claims that police failed to warn a young mother she was working with a dangerous paedophile who went on to abuse her son. And he said one of the ‘threats’ was made by Ms Thornton. But Ms Thornton, said to be David Cameron’s favourite police leader, hit back angrily last night. In a statement to The Mail on Sunday she rejected the allegations as ‘unfounded’. ‘I categorically deny ever making any sort of threat –veiled or otherwise – to Rob Wilson MP.’ And she said the claims entitled her to sue him for libel. The clash involves a woman who worked as a carer for two disabled children. She did not know their father, David Cullen, was on the Sex Offenders’ Register. He was supposed to be monitored by Thames Valley Police. But the woman claims police blundered by failing to alert her to his paedophile record. Cullen was subsequently jailed for life after abusing her young son 25 times in six months. Mr Wilson, who is the woman’s local MP in Reading, offered to raise her case in the Commons in 2008. But he says police tried to stop him. ‘There were all sorts of darkly veiled threats if I went head-to-head and toe-to-toe with Thames Valley Police,’ he said. ‘I had phone calls from at least two members of the force who rang me up directly about this and tried to stop me raising it in Parliament, even though it was quite clearly the right thing to do. ‘They said things like “Really, Mr Wilson? So early on in your Parliamentary career? Do you want to make an error about getting involved in raising this issue? There may be more to this than meets the eye. You could be getting into a very difficult situation.” ’ The Mail on Sunday has confirmed that Mr Wilson claims Ms Thornton was one of those who tried to deter him. He said he had raised the case not to attack the police but to highlight concerns about how his constituent – who cannot be named as she has a legal right to anonymity – had been dealt with. He said: ‘I wonder whether there is something systemic within the police, that, where difficult personal cases are involved, they don’t want to get involved.’ But Ms Thornton, who is next month set to become the boss of the new National Police Chiefs’ Council, said: ‘Such allegations are unfounded and libellous. I will be writing to Mr Wilson directly to seek clarification on exactly what he has alleged. ‘I am extremely concerned that such serious allegations, relating to alleged events over six years ago, now appear to have been made via the media and not with the force directly via any formal complaint, either at the time of the case in 2006 or at any point since.’ But defiant Mr Wilson last night stood by his claims. He criticised Ms Thornton for threatening to sue him and claimed she was continuing to try to stop the matter being discussed openly. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I absolutely stand by my comments. The purpose was to draw attention to the fact that mistakes had been made by Thames Valley Police in the past. 'Unfounded': Thames Valley chief constable Sara Thornton has categorically denied making any threats . ‘It is very disappointing that Sara Thornton is making legal threats which will prevent proper open discussion. From the very beginning I have sought transparency and openness and it is a shame that the police are still seeking to close down a reasonable and honest debate. ‘My intention is to ensure that should similar cases arise in the future, they are dealt with properly.’ Mr Wilson previously led criticism of the BBC for failing to report the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Last year he was promoted to the Cabinet Office where he is responsible for the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War. His differences with Ms Thornton follow criticism of Thames Valley Police over the way it handled the Oxfordshire child sex scandal in which as many as 373 children could have been targeted for sex by gangs of men over the last 16 years. Earlier this month, Ms Thornton repeated an apology to victims and their families after an official review found the force had made mistakes. Mr Wilson said he referred obliquely to the conduct of police when he defied the alleged ’threats’ and raised the matter in a Commons debate in 2008 when he said he was there ‘to represent my constituents without fear and favour.’ In a BBC interview, the mother whose child was abused by Cullen claimed police had placed his human rights over their duty to her child. She said: ‘They told me he had human rights. And I said what about my human rights? What about my son’s human rights? I had the right to protect my son.’","Cabinet Office Minister Rob Wilson claim to receive ‘darkly veiled threats’

"Hundreds of sex offenders who are supposed to be closely monitored have been missing for up to 14 years - but police have refused to name dozens in case they breach their 'human rights'. Police forces across Britain have lost track of 396 registered sex offenders, including rapists and paedophiles, but they won't be identified in case it 'endangers their safety unnecessarily', one force said. The sex attackers are meant to be kept under close surveillance after being released from jail because many pose a 'risk of serious harm to the public'. Scotland Yard, the UK's largest force, has lost track of 167 sex offenders, including one who had been missing for 14 years . But figures released yesterday found that some have been missing for more than a decade. There are 23 from Greater Manchester are among the almost 400 missing nationally and police believe 11 have fled abroad and the other 12 are subject to 'periodic reviews' in a bid to trace them. But the force said today it would not name them to protect their rights. A spokesman said: 'It is not the policy of GMP or the Police Service of England and Wales to routinely name sex offenders whether they are missing or not as this would be a breach of their human rights. This also may endanger their safety unnecessarily and may also lead to the identification of victims.' Scotland Yard, the UK's largest force, has lost track of 167 sex offenders, including one who had been missing for 14 years. Among the missing is failed asylum seeker Patrick Mosekwe Kanda, 36, who was jailed in 1998 for raping a child. When the Congolese national was released in 2003 he was allowed to live at an address in Dagenham, East London, instead of being deported. Sara Payne, whose daughter Sarah was abducted and killed in 2000 by convicted paedophile Roy Whiting, said: 'It's completely unacceptable that any registered sex offenders have disappeared from authority management, putting the public at risk' Like other dangerous predators, Kanda was placed on the sex offenders register and was supposed to be monitored by police and probation officials. But Scotland Yard last month admitted it had lost track of the rapist two years ago and issued an appeal for information relating to his whereabouts. A spokesman for the Met force blamed London's 'diverse multicultural population' for losing so many sex offenders and admitted that many have probably fled the country. Last night Sara Payne, whose daughter Sarah was abducted and killed in 2000 by convicted paedophile Roy Whiting, said: 'It's completely unacceptable that any registered sex offenders have disappeared from authority management, putting the public at risk. 'It's time to take some serious pro-active action to bring them back under the police radar.' The NSPCC described the figures as 'alarming' and said there are 900 police staff currently responsible for monitoring 46,000 registered sex offenders. This equates to one officer being tasked with monitoring 51 sex criminals. Jon Brown, the NSPCC's head of sexual abuse programmes, said: 'About half of those on the register are offenders who have raped or sexually assaulted children, or committed online child abuse image offences. However most just receive one police visit a year after they have been released from prison. 'The monitoring of registered sex offenders in communities needs urgent attention by the government to ensure it is fit for purpose.' 'It seems this area is currently chronically under resourced and the number of dangerous individuals on the register is increasing yearly.' Claude Knights, chief executive of children's charity Kidscape, added: 'We know that sex offenders are at their most volatile and dangerous when they are living in chaotic and unsettled circumstances. 'Registered sex offenders who are of no fixed abode are very difficult to assess and monitor, and most importantly are not complying with notification requirements. 'The safety of our communities depends on predators being on the appropriate radars. We have a duty of care to potential victims.' Protection: Greater Manchester Police (headquarters pictured) said today it would not name the missing sex offenders 'as this would be a breach of their human rights' The figures emerged from Freedom of Information requests submitted to all police forces in Britain. One convicted sex offender from Gloucestershire has been missing since the year 2000, another in Northumbria disappeared in May 2002. Meanwhile Humberside Police said the whereabouts of one registered sex offender has remained a mystery since September 2004. West Midlands Police said 39 registered sex offenders were missing, including one since 2006 and nine who have disappeared between 2010 and 2012. In Manchester, police have lost track of 25 sex attackers, including one who disappeared in September 2005 and three others who went missing in 2006. Both Essex and Sussex police forces said 11 registered sex offenders are missing from their respective areas, while Cambridgeshire Police said it has lost track of 10 on their list. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK has some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders and we are committed to ensuring the system is as robust as possible. 'It is for the police to manage offenders in their area, but we work closely with forces to ensure legislation is effective and that officers have all the tools they need.'","Forces across Britain have lost track of 396 registered criminals .

"A fashion designer whose clothes have been worn by Cara Delevingne and Paris Hilton has been fined after she pursued a cyclist and deliberately knocked him off his bike following a row. Lamis Khamis, 42, was behind the wheel of her black 2.0 litre Audi when she got into a row with a man riding an electric-powered bicycle at a roundabout near Shepherd's Bush Green, in London. After the man kicked her car, Khamis followed him and drove her car into him at low speed, knocking him off his bike. Fashion designer to the stars Lamis Khamis has been fined £600 after she followed a cyclist in her car and deliberately knocked him over after the pair had argued and he kicked her Audi on a London roundabout . Khamis was fined £600 after a judge ruled that on her part 'it should not be described as road rage', but added that the cyclist could have been injured. The designer launched her own brand in 2001 after she graduated from Camberwell College of Arts. She set up a stall to sell her wares in Portobello Market in London and has since then attracted the attention of model Cara Delevingne, who has been pictured wearing her designs, Paris Hilton and musician Chris Brown. At a hearing at Isleworth Crown Court Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and a valid MOT on May 17. The fashion designer, who graduated from the Camberwell College of Arts, has worked with celebrities including Rita Ora (pictured) Model Cara Delevingne is pictured wearing a Lamis Khamis creation (left), while Katie Price worked with the designer in 2011 on fashion line Day 22, which she promoted on the Pure Spirit catwalk (right) The court heard that after the cyclist kicked the side of her car as they argued at the roundabout he made a dent, costing around £300 to repair. Recorder John Gallagher said: 'He rode off, but because his cycle had no registration plate you followed in an attempt to obtain details from him. 'You, in an attempt to stop him, drove into him and he fell off his cycle. Your actions were deliberate, but it was not a case of running a person down because you were only travelling at 10mph and he sustained no injuries. Lamis Khamis is pictured with Paris Hilton (centre), who is a fan of her designs and Sam Pemberton (left) 'However, this was a deliberate act and he might well have been injured and you did not consider the risks and alternatives.' Mr Gallagher also gave Khamis six penalty points on her licence. But he added: 'You are a mature lady who has never been in trouble with the police in the past and you have a clean driving licence and in twenty years have had no disqualifications.' The court heard that the prosecution had previously dropped a more serious charge of dangerous driving. Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and was fined, after the judge ruled the incident was not one of road rage, but that the victim could have been injured in the incident .","Lamis Khamis was driving in Shepherd's Bush when she got into an argument with a man on an electric bicycle who kicked her black Audi .

In the sketch, which features several black men getting pulled over by police, Rock tells viewers that they probably won't 'get their ass kicked' by police if they 'obey the law' and 'use common sense'. He also advises them to stop immediately when they see flashing police lights in the mirror, turn off 'loud rap music', choose to give a 'white friend' a ride and avoid travelling with 'a mad woman'. Rock, who recently revealed he is working on a follow-up to his acclaimed comedy film, Top Five, filed for divorce from his wife of 19 years, Malaak Compton-Rock, in December last year.

Earlier this month, a damning US Department of Justice report found that police exhibited racial bias in Ferguson, Missouri, where black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by a cop last August. The 105-page document revealed the city's police department and court system 'reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias', while city officials were found to have 'discriminatory intent'. Last November, a grand jury chose not to indict officer Darren Wilson for killing 18-year-old Brown.

Kind-hearted: Black cabbie Roshan Varma managed to track down the Australian couple who left their camera in his taxi . Memorable holiday: The couple travelled to New York, Europe and London to celebrate Su's 40th birthday . Mr Varma, 45, picked up the couple on Sunday evening from The Shard, and quickly struck up a conversation with them. He dropped them at London Paddington station where they caught the Heathrow Express to the airport. But when the cabbie picked up his next customers, they pointed out there was an expensive camera on the back seat. He contacted Australian airline Qantas and Heathrow Airport, but feared he would never be able to track them down. 'I picked up this Australian couple at The Shard in London and took them to Paddington to catch the Heathrow Express,' Mr Varma said. 'We were chatting away, they were a lovely couple, nice young decent couple and off I went and I thought that was the end of it -  until I picked up another customer and they said ""oh someone has left a black carry case in the back of the cab with a camera in it"". 'I tried Qantas but they didn’t get back to me and I contacted Heathrow. And then another cabbie told me to contact Lostbox.' Yesterday, Mr Varma contacted lost and found site Lostbox and in less than five hours his message had been seen by one million people. Today, Mr Fox contacted the site to say it was the camera he and his wife had left behind. 'And then it was shared and the next thing I know we’ve found the guy,' the taxi driver added. 'We get a bit of bad press at the moment but it’s nice to show London cabbies go the extra mile. 'The camera is an expensive bit of kit, I didn’t go through all the pictures but these are obviously happy memories from their time going round the world.' Mr Fox told MailOnline: 'We are blown away by the efforts the cab driver took to track us down. The kindness of Roshan the taxi driver and all the people who liked and forwarded on the post has just blown us away' The Aussie added: 'This positive social media experience has now turned a disaster into one of the most memorable holiday experiences' Internet appeal: Mr Varma contacted the website Lostbox on Thursday and in less than five hours his message had been seen by one million people . 'A cab friend of mine, Mike, has said his daughter is flying over to Australia later this month and she could reunite it then.' Mr Fox told MailOnline: 'We are blown away by the efforts the cab driver took to track us down. 'He was friendly and kind which is why we were chatting to him, which probably helped tracking us down given he knew we are from Sydney, Australia. 'The kindness of Roshan the taxi driver and all the people who liked and forwarded on the post has just blown us away. 'The reason we were on holidays to New York City, Europe and London was to celebrate Su's 40th birthday, so to have the photos of our trip found is so wonderful to enable us to preserve memories of such a great holiday.' On Friday, Mr Fox contacted the lost and found site to say it was the camera he and his wife had left behind . He added: 'This positive social media experience has now turned a disaster into one of the most memorable holiday experiences.' Clare Owen, director of Lostbox, said that in a matter of hours from Mr Varma getting in touch, more than 3,714 comments were posted, 'tagging' people in Australia. She said: 'We were contacted yesterday afternoon by Roshan on Twitter. 'We shared the story to our website and from there to Twitter and Facebook. It was shared thousands of times on Twitter but tens of thousands on Facebook. 'We knew this was going to be a big one because in the first hour it reached 30,000 people and then last night after 25,600 shares, Peter Fox got in touch from Australia to say it was his camera. 'He verified the type of camera it was which we hadn’t disclosed.' 'Astounded': Peter Fox was on holiday in the UK with his wife Su Harris when they left their expensive camera in the taxi .

"Prosecutors are considering further charges against disgraced TV weatherman Fred Talbot, pictured . Prosecutors are considering further charges against disgraced television weatherman Fred Talbot, who last month was convicted of abusing schoolboys as young as 14. The Crown Office in Scotland was handed a report from police investigating historical allegations of abuse that are said to have taken place over a 13-year period between 1968 and 1981. Talbot, 65, will be sentenced in Manchester tomorrow after a jury found him guilty of indecently assaulting to pupils in the mid-1970s during his former career as a biology teacher. The former This Morning star attacked two teenagers on school trips on a canal boat while he was teaching in the 1970s and now faces jail. However Talbot, who taught at Altrincham Grammar School near Manchester, was cleared of eight other indecent assaults on three other boys. Talbot was remanded in custody after the conviction on 13 February. Both of the victims, said to be 14 or 15 at the time, were assaulted on school  trips in the Cheshire area. Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard Talbot was 'obsessed' with teenage boys throughout his teaching career and 'could not help himself' around them when under the influence of drink. Talbot resigned in disgrace from the school in 1984 after making indecent comments to two 15-year-old pupils but hid the indiscretion when his big TV break came a year later. During the late 1980s and early 1990s Talbot was a regular on ITV's This Morning, where he presented weather updates from a floating map in Liverpool's Albert Dock. He continued to cover his tracks when police first investigated him in 1992 and lied again to detectives when they uncovered a host of diaries which were littered with references to sexual encounters.

"Christopher Dearlove coughed over nurses telling them he had Ebola to try to get a hospital bed . Britain's most prolific 'hospital hopper' has been jailed after shutting down an A&E department  by pretending to have Ebola. Homeless Christopher Dearlove, 59, was banned from entering any NHS building unless he had a genuine medical problem in 2010 after making up ailments to get a free bed for the night. But earlier this year he forced Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby into lock-down after telling nurses he had Ebola, coughing over them and demanding treatment. He was jailed at Grimsby Crown Court for 14 months. Dearlove, who is an alcoholic, had been drinking for almost four hours when he walked into the Grimsby A&E in February. The man, who is thought to be homeless, told nurses he had recently returned from West Africa where his wife had died of the disease. He claimed he had tested positive for Ebola at Johannesburg airport before coughing over staff. Using a false name, he was then heard saying: 'It’s not my fault if everyone becomes infected.' Part of the A&E was forced into lock-down as nurses rushed into protective clothing. He was arrested after a member of staff recognised him and phoned the police. It is not thought Dearlove received any testing or treatment at the hospital. Sentencing, Judge David Tremberg said: 'You gave hard pressed medical services more cause for concern and work. 'They should not be diverted from genuinely sick and injured patients and not be indulging in your fantasies. 'Claiming Ebola and coughing on people is a particularly unpleasant and unattractive act.' Part of Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby was forced to close as a result of the stunt in February . In carrying out the stunt Dearlove broke an anti-social behaviour order issued in 2010 which banned him from visiting hospitals unless genuinely ill. It was imposed after he told nurses at various facilities that he was a haemophiliac with AIDS and coughed up fake blood to get a room. On separate occasions he claimed to have been experiencing weight loss, night sweats and pain in his chest in order to be admitted. From 2006 the NHS began distributing images of the fraudster to stop A&E departments across the country from admitting him. The alcoholic would give a false name and medical history and list symptoms he knew were likely to secure him an isolated room. Each of his stints cost between £400 and £1,000 according to the NHS security management service. Every time he was admitted. Defending at Grimsby Crown Court, Ernie Lidster said he had a psychiatric disorder. Dearlove was jailed for 14 months at Grimsby Crown Court (above).

"The Lib Dems could creep back into government even if they lose half of their MPs, senior figures close to Nick Clegg have claimed. Publicly the party has boasted that it will fare better than disastrous polling ratings suggest, but privately the leadership fears it could be reduced to just 30 MPs, compared to the 57 it won in 2010. But insiders suggest this could be enough to put them back in power, most probably with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg will use his speech to his party conference in Liverpool today to insist the Lib Dems 'are here to stay'. In some recent polls the party has been as low as just 5 per cent, with predictions of big losses against Labour in the north of England and the SNP in Scotland.

But privately the mood is less upbeat. Senior Lib Dems admit the election will be 'really tough' and as many as half of their MPs will be ousted. In a bizarre twist they claim this could still be enough to put the party back in government, and keep Mr Clegg as Deputy PM. Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown at conference.

It is suggested that if the Tories fall between 10 and 30 seats short of a majority, a deal could be done. However, a power-sharing agreement with Labour looks less and less likely. A source said: 'Reaching 325 is the key. If the Tories have 295 then we would be the ones to get them to that number. 'Around 30 would be enough. I can't see any way in which Labour forms the largest party. Everything is in favour of the Tories. 'It is going to be really tough.

"Thousands of tourists and residents basking in the hot sun filled streets of the art deco district of Miami Beach to celebrate its 100th birthday on Thursday. 'Happy Birthday, Miami Beach,' yelled one of the party promoters through a loudspeaker from one of the bars along Ocean Drive - the seaside avenue lined with hotels, bars and restaurants. It was closed to traffic all day for the festivities. People strolled about sipping mojitos or beer, riding bikes or walked to the beach in swim trunks to enjoy a gala concert featuring opera singer Andrea Bocelli, Gloria Estefan and ex-Bee Gee Barry Gibb as a week of celebration came to a close.

It is known for great weather, vibrant nightlife, art deco architecture and homes belonging to such stars as Matt Damon, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Shakira. 'Everything is over the top,' said Peter Van der Pot, a Dutchman who visits the city periodically and came this time to take a cruise. 'It's like the American dream. Everything is very well organized. The architecture is fantastic. But it is very expensive. The fact that the city was turning 100 caused some European visitors to smile.

Miguel Gonzalez, who arrived from Cuba in 1980 and has lived in Miami Beach ever since, celebrated the day's fun with friends and family. But he complained that the city has become more expensive in recent decades, with major real estate projects and the restoration of the art deco district, the city's crown jewel with more than 700 buildings boasting that architectural style.

"Labour MPs are said to be hatching a secret plot to stop the party brokering a coalition with Nicola Sturgeon's SNP . Labour MPs are hatching secret plans to wreck any deal with the Scottish Nationalists by holding an emergency summit after the Election. A meeting of the entire Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) would be convened in order to veto any attempt by Mr Miliband to win Downing Street by brokering a deal with Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP. Labour MPs say the possibility of forming an alliance with a party which wants to break up the UK is already alienating many of their core voters on both sides of the border. John Cryer, chairman of the PLP, is understood to have told Mr Miliband’s aides that his MPs will not tolerate a repeat of the situation after the 2010 election, when Gordon Brown tried to stay in power by striking a deal with Nick Clegg, but without consulting his party. Mr Miliband publicly insists his only concern is to achieve an outright Labour majority. But plans are being made by senior Labour MPs, subject to security arrangements, for the PLP to meet inside the Commons on Sunday, May 10 – three days after the Election – if there is a hung Parliament. A weekend meeting is highly unusual, but it would be the only chance for MPs to gather after all of the constituencies have declared, but before the start of negotiations to form a new Government. As the polls stand, Labour will not win enough seats to form an administration, and its only option might be to try to stitch together a three-way ‘grand coalition’ with the nationalists and Lib Dems. The SNP – which currently has just six Westminster seats out of a total of 59 in Scotland – is on course to win as many as 56, mainly at Labour’s expense. Although Mr Miliband insisted on Friday that talk of an agreement with the SNP was ‘a piece of nonsense’, he has stopped short of ruling it out. Last night, Labour MP Graham Stringer demanded that the leader listen to his party. ‘I do not think there is any way that the PLP would support a pact with the SNP because it would do such long-term damage to the party’s electability,’ he said. ‘We need to slam the door on a deal with the nationalists. It is not just harming our vote in Scotland – the prospect of an alliance with a party which wants to break up the UK is also hitting our prospects south of the border.’ Ed Miliband insisted that talk of an agreement with the SNP was 'nonsense' but stopped short of ruling it out . Labour’s former Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, said on Thursday he did not know why his party had not ruled out a pact, adding that it ‘couldn’t possibly do a deal with a party that wants to be out of the United Kingdom and give up our nuclear deterrent’. Labour nerves have been rattled by the successful launch of a new Tory campaign poster, which shows a miniature Ed Miliband in the top pocket of former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is expected to win a Westminster seat. One Labour MP told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We will not tolerate coalition negotiations taking place above [our] heads again, and certainly not if it means getting into bed with the SNP ... This has been accepted in principle by Miliband’s office.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Our focus is on one thing and one thing only: a majority. We don’t need, don’t want and are not planning for a coalition.’ Mr Cryer was not available for comment.","Labour MPs are planning to wreck an deal with the SNP after the election .

"It's a pivotal policy for the Federal Government but questions are being asked of the Prime Minister's understanding, or lack thereof, around metadata after his bizarre claim that he never worried about police looking into his, when he was a journalist. The problem with his attempt to allay fears of the modern day media is that metadata was hardly a player when Tony Abbott was reporting in the 1980s and early 90s, before the advent of the Internet. 'In the days when I was a journalist there were no metadata protections for journalists,' he stated to a gathering of reporters on Wednesday. But if you do the math, his argument simply does not stack up. I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister said. His writing career ended before the internet began . While metadata does include some traditional methods of investigation; including phone numbers and length and time of calls, the overhaul's main thrust is aimed at computer based functions, particularly the online and email world. The Internet came to be, effectively, in 1992. Full text searches were not available for two years after that and email access came to being about the same time. By then, Tony Abbott was well and truly ensconced as press secretary to Opposition Leader Dr John Hewson, his days as a writer for The Bulletin and The Australian all but over. 'I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister said. 'A contested warrant is more like a court case and if you had to have a court case to access metadata, well, the whole process would absolutely gum up,' he said. In trying to explain the planned two-year retention, Mr Abbott has previously stated that he believed metadata to be the 'sites you're visiting'. 'It's not what you are doing on the internet, it's the site's you are visiting, it's not the content it's just where you have been. 'It's the person you are sending it to, the person sending it, it's the date and the place it's posted from.' Federal Labor had earlier agreed to support new metadata laws with amendments. The government bill, which is expected to pass parliament by the end of next week, forces telecommunications companies to keep two years of customer data, such as the time and length of a phone call. The laws would allow for warrant-less access by government agencies. The government has agreed to a number of Labor amendments, including better protections for journalists. Australian Press Council chairman David Weisbrot, has expressed his concern the laws could crush investigative journalism and dissuade whistle-blowers from coming forward. 'A healthy democratic society requires robust free speech and a free and vigorous press to hold governments and other powerful interests to account,' he said. 'I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister told the Canberra media gallery . Metadata is the footprint left by electronic communications. The worry for journalists is that sources might be hesitant to come forward knowing that metadata could lead investigators to their door. 'These are not hypothetical concerns,' Professor Weisbrot said. He said governments were increasingly chasing down leaks and stripping away whistle-blower protections. 'These legitimate concerns cannot be addressed effectively short of exempting journalists and media organisations.' Attorney-General George Brandis had previously said that in a 'newly dangerous age' it was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed . A parliamentary committee recommended in February the laws be passed, but called for safeguards for journalists. It recommended the issue of protecting journalists' sources be referred to a separate inquiry to report to parliament within three months. Attorney-General George Brandis had previously said that in a 'newly dangerous age' it was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed.

"An 18-year-old girl, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase in a Colorado park, died from a drug overdose. The Mesa County Coroner's Office reported that Kelly Mae Myers died of a 'mixed drug intoxication'. They said they have not yet determined the circumstances surrounding her death. Myers' body was found in Cactus Park, Mesa County on February 28. The teenager had been missing since December 18. Kelly Mae Myers, 18, died of a 'mixed drug intoxication', according to the Mesa County Coroner's office. Her body was found stuffed in a suitcase at a Colorado park on February 28 . Police say Eduardo De La Cruz, 30 (left) was staying at the same hotel where Myers died. Raymond Cordova, 47 (right), an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house and allegedly dumped her body . Colorado police ruled her death as 'suspicious' but have not yet officially declared it a homicide. Officials said they would not release any more information regarding Myters' cause of death at this time because of the ongoing investigation, according to Fox 13 Now. Myers' body was put inside a suitcase and kept in a West Valley City hotel before it was transported to the Cactus Park area, a search warrant obtained by The Deseret News revealed. Police are currently investigating two persons of interest, Eduardo De La Cruz and Raymond Cordova,  in connection with Myers' disappearance. De La Cruz, 30, is being held on suspicion of trafficking heroin but is not an official suspect in the Myers case, police said. Myers' body was found stuffed in a suitcase at Cactus Park in Mesa County, Colorado, on February 28, two months after police believe the teen died at a West Valley City hotel . He was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'. De La Cruz was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation. Myers was last seen in Grand Junction with friends and was believed to be heading to Salt Lake City for a party. Relatives who reported her missing in Colorado said the teenager's disappearance was 'out of character'. Myers' mother Kim Lee told Fox 13 Now she had never heard of De La Cruz or Cordova before they were arrested. 'This wasn't just a piece of trash that you stuffed, and I hate saying that word, but you put in a suitcase,' she said. 'This was a human being, this was my daughter.' Cordova, 47, an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house, a police affidavit stated. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel in West Valley City. De La Cruz had checked into the hotel the day Myers is believed to have died, police say. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel . An informant told police Myers' body was placed in a black suitcase with a 'hard shell' and that he got into a car with Cordova and the suitcase, according to The Deseret News. He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'. They then drove to Cactus Park and disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states. On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. She described 'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. The housekeeper added that it smelled 'as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states. Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail for investigation of drug-related charges. Myers  had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine and police initially believed she had fled Colorado for Utah. Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City. A search team was not sent out for the teenager until January 19. 'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time. Myers went missing December 18, when family thought she had hitchhiked to friends in Utah .","Kelly Mae Myers, 18, went missing from Colorado home on December 18 .

"It was the clash that finally lifted the threat of Napoleon’s imperial ambitions from Europe and brought peace after decades of war. The Battle of Waterloo also marked a new era for France, freed from the yoke of Bonaparte tyranny. But it seems that the French don’t see it that way, even after 200 years. The defeat of Napoleon’s army outside a Belgian town by Britain, Prussia and allies from Northern Europe still appears to be something of a sore point. The victory by the Duke of Wellington (left) in 1815 stopped dictator Napoleon Bonaparte's (right) conquest of Europe, and sent the Emperor into exile for the second and final time. Paris is attempting to block the creation of a two Euro coin commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo . Britain's £5 coin that has been issued to mark the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo . In an extraordinary intervention, France has blocked plans for a two euro coin to commemorate Wellington’s 1815 victory over Napoleon. President Francois Hollande claimed the Belgian project would be a ‘symbol that is negative’ and undermine eurozone unity. Now the Belgians have scrapped plans to have the commemorative coin produced next month to avoid a diplomatic row. Hollande’s government argued the battle was still a bad memory for the French people. A Brussels source said: ‘Belgium have withdrawn the project because it would not be in their interest to cause upset to the French.’ Last night British politicians said France’s reaction to the coin – and Belgium’s subsequent cave-in – was ‘absurd’. Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘I know the euro is a useless currency but I didn’t know that the French still could not cope with the fact they were defeated. 'It is absurd, I would have thought the French would have been quite keen to have got rid of an emperor. The French should grow up a bit.’ MP Philip Davies added: ‘It shows how thin skinned and small minded the French are, how desperate Hollande is politically and how weak the Belgians are. What a shower.’ A draft design of the coin was submitted to the Council of the European Union by Belgium in February this year. It was expected to go into production next month but France objected to the coin last week, claiming in a letter to the Council of Europe that producing the coin would ‘risk… engendering unfavourable reactions in France’. A two Euro coin marking the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, in which the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon Bonaparte (pictured), has been proposed by Belgium, where the battle took place . The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815, stopped the advance of Napoleon and sent him into exile for a second and final time. In the one day of fighting there were around 55,000 either killed, wounded, or missing in action. However, the battle ushered in more than 50 years of peace. While the proposed design of the coin has not been revealed, it is understood to have featured a battle scene. The UK has issued a £5 coin to mark the bicentenary. The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time. France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am. The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army. This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender. The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'. Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses.","Belgium, where the historic battle took place, proposed the two Euro coin .

"Nicolas Sarkozy’s most senior aide regularly mocked him as a ‘dwarfish Napoleon’, an ‘airhead’ and a ‘nutter’, it was claimed last night. The revelations will come as a huge blow to the former French president, 60, who is aiming for re-election in two years. Adviser Patrick Buisson, 65, was credited with steering Mr Sarkozy into the Elysee Palace, where he served between 2007 and 2012. Nicolas Sarkozy's (left) most senior aide Patrick Buisson (right) regularly mocked him, it has been claimed . But a book called The Bad Genie claims Mr Buisson frequently mocked the 5ft 5in politician, who wore stacked heels, especially when with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni. Mr Buisson, who is an expert on opinion polls, said Mr Sarkozy could 'do nothing without me' and would call him all the time. 'It was the Dwarf' or 'the Little One', Mr Buisson would tell colleagues after receiving a call from Mr Sarkozy. Mr Buisson was viewed as a 'compass' and 'genius' by Mr Sarkozy, despite also being referred to as a 'nutter' or 'airhead'. Sarkozy wore stacked heels, especially in the presence of his third wife, supermodel Carla Bruni . Mr Buisson would not think twice about slamming the phone down on Mr Sarkozy, saying: 'I'm having lunch, you're bothering me'. He would also put Mr Sarkozy's voice on speaker, and laugh about him with friends, saying: 'He can do nothing without me, Naboleon'. The nickname was a cross between 'Napoleon' - the legendary French leader - and the term 'nabot', which means dwarfish. Authors Ariane Chemin and Vanessa Schneider, who both write for Le Monde, said Sarkozy would phone Mr Buisson for 'reassurance' more than his wives. Mr Buisson fell out with Mr Sarkozy last year, after it emerged that he had recorded many of their conversations without the politician's consent. In one, Carla Bruni dubs her husband a 'kept man', thanks to her fortune amassed during her time as a model in the 1990s. Mr Sarkozy went on to sue his former mentor for around 70,000 pounds, saying: 'In my life I've known betrayal, but rarely one like this.' Mr Sarkozy was defeated by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, in 2012 after just one term in office. The conservative leader of the UMP Party is determined to get back into power, but is facing a range of corruption enquiries. They include claims that he received millions in back handers from former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. Mr Sarkozy denies any wrongdoing.","Patrick Buisson, 65, credited with steering former president into power .

"Former Australian netball captain Liz Ellis has championed a controversial netball ad after critics claim it draws uncomfortable parallels to a domestic violence ad. The Fox Sports ad, which is promoting the upcoming ANZ Netball Championships, depicts Diamonds star Sharni Layton with a badly blackened eye. An injury Ms Ellis claims she earned 'giving her all' in training earlier that week. ‘I love the ad,’ Ms Ellis told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Standing tall: Sharni Layton didn't want to use make up to cover the black eye she sustained in a training session . Liz Ellis penned a though provoking article hitting back at critics of the ad saying it shows what netballers are capable of . ‘It’s great because it shows what netballers are capable of and it doesn’t shy away from the fact that they are physical,’ she added. Ms Ellis penned a column for The Age defending the controversial ad after critics claimed Ms Layton’s bruised and bloodshot left eye was distasteful. She hit back saying more people need to recognise that these highly trained athletes are not only capable of putting their body on the line, but they love it. ‘I think people don’t want to emphasise the fact that it is a physical game and women can go hard.’ Australian TV journalist Sam Squires claims the ad could have conveyed the message that womens sport is tough without such a 'confronting image.’ Sam Squires likened the sports injury to one sustained at the hands of an abuser . Liz Ellis is adamant that women play with a level of physicality that can sometimes lead to injuries . ‘It screams violence not toughness,’ she said in an article on her website. Respectfully disagreeing, Ms Ellis said it would be a mistake to see elite female athletes, playing with the ferocity that men would, and assume it's an act of violence. 'The game isn’t violent, the players don’t go out there to inflict pain, there is no malice. Netball is a tough game and that’s what it portrays.' 'I don’t think this conversation would have happened if it were a blokes sport,' she added. Twitter users expressed their support by backing Ms Ellis' claims that women and girls can be tough on court. Star player Sharni Layton sustained the controversial eye injury in a training session and was offered to cover it up with make up before shooting the ad. She declined as she saw no reason to cover up the realities of the game. Ms Ellis says people don't want to emphasise the level of physicality involved in netball . Ms Ellis said she was elated to see a role model for young girls who can say 'look at what I can do, not at how I look'. 'This is so vital because of the way society is. Little girls from a young age are reinforced that it’s all about how you look,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'What sport does is that it flips it from what your body looks like to what your body can actually do. How high can you jump? How fast can you run? How far can you throw?' Ms Ellis wants young girls to focus less on what they look like on court and more on what their body can actually do . The ad highlights the athletes physical prowess but has been heavily criticised . While Ms Ellis is adamant this particular ad doesn't trivialise domestic violence, she said can see why people would assume 'that when a woman is bruised she is a victim.' Ms Ellis said the notion of domestic violence is becoming 'all pervasive' due to the unfortunate fact that it is far more likely for a woman to suffer injuries at the hand of a partner than on a netball court. ‘We can’t ask people to change that perception until women aren’t victims. And that’s where we have to start,’ she added. The #likeagirl campaign, which the ad is loosely based off, took off in June last year after releasing a video which challenges the perception of what the phrase ""like a girl"" means.","Ad for ANZ Netball Championship shows star Sharni Layton with black eye .

"A 21-year-old man has undergone the world's first successful penis transplant. The 'ground-breaking' operation took South African surgeons nine hours to perform, and allowed the patient to urinate normally and become sexually active again. Three years ago the man, who remains unidentified, was forced to have his penis amputated after a botched circumcision. Each year thousands of young men, mainly from the Xhosa tribe in South Africa, have their foreskins removed in traditional rituals, with experts estimating around 250 losing their penises each year to medical complications. Scroll down for video . A 21-year-old man has become the first person in the world to undergo a successful penis transplant, in a nine hour operation at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa . The operation was carried out by surgeons from Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, using a penis donated from a deceased person. They said the procedure allowed the man to regain all function in the newly transplanted organ. Nine more patients will now receive penile transplants. Professor André van der Merwe, head of the University's Division of Urology, said they were surprised by the patient's rapid recovery. He said: 'Our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery. Professor Frank Graewe, another of the hospital's surgeons who assisted on the operation, said: 'It's a massive breakthrough. We've proved that it can be done – we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had.' 'It was a privilege to be part of this first successful penis transplant in the world.' Professor van der Merwe said  having a penis amputated is known to have a seriously adverse psychological effect on men. 'This is a very serious situation,' he said. 'For a young man of 18 or 19 years the loss of his penis can be deeply traumatic. As part of the procedure, doctors transplanted a new penis, donated by a deceased man. The pictures, left and right, show the veins and blood vessels they connected . After the nine hour operation, the man recovered rapidly. The procedure has allowed him to become sexually active again. The picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man's genital region . He doesn't necessarily have the psychological capability to process this. There are even reports of suicide among these young men.' He added that finding a donor organ was one of the main challenges to the procedures, and called the man who donated his penis, and his family, 'heroes'. The procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical South African hospital. The planning and preparation for the study started in 2010. After extensive research Professor Van der Merwe and his surgical team decided to use techniques developed for the first facial transplant. The operation was the second time that this type of procedure was attempted, but the first time in history that a successful long-term result was achieved. Image shows the nerves in the donated penis, which were joined to the man's groin area. This was the first successful operation of its kind, as a previous attempt did not lead to long-term recovery . A man in China received a transplant in 2005 but that man asked surgeons to remove the new organ two weeks later. Professor Van der Mewe said the procedure could eventually also be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last-resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction due to the side effects from medication. The South African Government praised surgeons who performed the operation. Dr Beth Engelbrecht, head of Western Cape Government Health, said: 'We are very proud to be part of this ground-breaking scientific achievement. 'It is good to know that a young man's life has been significantly changed with this very complex surgical feat. 'From experience we know that penile dysfunction and disfigurement has a major adverse psychological effect on people.'","Man underwent 9 hour operation at Tygerberg Hospital South Africa .

Meerkat effectively turns your phone into a portable webcam and lets you live stream whatever you point your handset's camera towards. It has a simple premise: press the Stream button, point the phone's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account . The app was built by architecture student Ben Rubin and was on display at this week's SXSW Festival in Austin. It has a simple premise: press the Stream button, point the phone's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account. There is also a Schedule button to start recording at a later time. This tweet is posted with a [LIVE NOW] message. An optional #meerkat tag is added to the end of the tweet to make it easy to find. That user's followers can reply and retweet the link, to get more people involved, and watch it through the app or on a desktop browser. So far, streams have included US chat show host Jimmy Fallon rehearsing a monologue for The Tonight Show and live streams of sports. Other more mundane, and in some cases disgusting, streams have included people riding on a bus or even picking their nose . Notably, some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user's TV. This means that people who can't afford a cable TV subscription could watch a game online. The top searches on Twitter include  #meerkat and #meerkat live sports  (shown) So far, streams have included US chat show host Jimmy Fallon rehearsing a monologue for The Tonight Show, Spotify streaming a live spin class with DJ and live streams of sports. When Meerkat first launched last month it imported a user's Twitter followers as well as showed who they were following. However, this was said to have annoyed Twitter and the social network cut off Meerkat's access to this service. Twitter recently bought a live-streaming service called Periscope which is a direct rival to Meerkat. Meerkat has found a way around this though by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite Twitter users. Notably, some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user's TV. This means that people who can't afford a cable TV subscription, for instance, could watch a game through someone's Twitter feed.

Everything that happens on meerkat happens on Twitter. Streams will be pushed to followers in real time via push notifications. People can only watch it live. No reruns. Watchers can restream any stream to their followers in real time. Scheduled streams will be distributed in the community by their subscribers. Your own streams can be kept locally on your phone, but never on the cloud. Everyone can watch on web. But people could use screen capturing software during the stream if they wanted to record and keep it. And, in theory, the app raises privacy concerns especially if live footage features people being filmed either surreptitiously or by accident without permission. There is also the wider issue of hacking. If a hacker was able to take control of a user's phone and camera they could use the service to live stream any footage they wanted. Of course, this is an issue that affects a wide range of apps, and not just Meerkat, but its immediacy and live nature highlights the problem more than on other services. There is also potential for pornographic footage to be streamed.

Researchers from the University of Exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing a community of invertebrates at night. They exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a ‘white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating the type of sodium street lamp still found in much of the UK and further afield. The experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid. The low intensity amber light was shown to prevent flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid-summer. The study showed that low intensity amber light caused by street lighting in cities (a stock image of London at dusk is shown) prevented flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid summer . Bright lights in Europe’s cities may be causing urban blackbirds to reach sexual maturity quicker their country cousins. Animal biologists from Glasgow University and the Max Planck Institute for Orntihology in Seewiesen, near Munich, fitted tiny light loggers to the backs of 100 blackbirds in the city of Munich and in a nearby forest. The light loggers tracked the amount of light birds in both environments were exposed to each day and sent the data to experts. They found that the additional light from artificial sources caused the city birds to perceive the days to be longer by 49 minutes on average. The additional light had an effect on the city birds’ photoperiod, which is the part of the day that organisms use to time their daily and seasonal biology. As a result, the birds in early March experienced the day length that their country counterparts experienced in late March, according to the study published in journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. The city birds’ perception that they were living at a later point in the year caused them to reach sexual maturity in anticipation of breeding season 19 days earlier than the forest birds. Study leader Dr Davide Dominoni of the university, said: ‘Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious environmental changes affecting the habitat of wild animals. ‘The global increase in light pollution poses new challenges to wild species, but we’re very much in the early stages of understanding the effects of exposure to light at night.' They found that the number of aphids declined under the light treatment in mid-August due to the limited amount of food available. Professor Kevin Gaston, Director of the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) said: ‘These are the first findings from major long-term experiments … and already reveal how profound the impacts of artificial night time lighting can be on even simple communities of organisms.’ Dr Jonathan Bennie added: ‘Our results suggest that by lighting up our night time environment we trigger complex effects on natural food webs. ‘While we are all aware that street lights often attract insects at night, we show that they may have more permanent, widespread impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.’ Another study carried out at the university, along with Bat Conservation Ireland, revealed that bats don’t like streetlights either and that activity was generally lower in street-lit areas than in dark locations with similar habitat. The findings have important implications for conservation, overturning the previous assumption that common bats benefited from street-lights because they could feed on the insects that congregated around them. The research, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, found that the activity of soprano pipistrelle, noctule and serotine bats was similar or lower in areas with street lighting compared with dark areas. An increase in the activity of the UK’s most common bat, the common pipistrelle, was only seen in locations where there was also a high amount of shelter from trees or hedgerows. The only species for which lighting appeared favourable was Leisler’s bat, a species common in Ireland but rare in Britain. Dr Fiona Mathews said: ‘People rarely see bats, and when they do it is usually because they are silhouetted by a light. ‘Because clouds of insects accumulate around lights, there has been an assumption that the bats were getting an easy lunch. Another study carried out at the university, along with Bat Conservation Ireland, revealed that bats don’t like streetlights either and are less active around them. An increase in the activity of the UK’s most common bat, the common pipistrelle (stock image), was only seen in sheltered locations . ‘What our work shows is that they are actually usually just as active, if not more so, in adjacent dark areas. ‘We already knew that lighting was bad news for rare species such as horseshoe bats. ‘Now we have demonstrated that, for the common species of vital importance to our ecosystem, lighting is not helpful. Over recent decades, the number of streetlights, and the brightness of lighting, has grown enormously. ‘We also use increasingly powerful lights to illuminate outdoor areas around our homes. We urgently need to reverse this trend.’ The research analysed large-scale surveys conducted in Britain and Ireland, involving more than 265,000 bat calls at over 600 locations. The links between lighting and bats were explored at several spatial scales including car-surveys conducted by volunteers across Ireland, to shorter surveys conducted by bicycle, and detailed monitoring over multiple nights at specific sites. Despite frequently being depicted as blind, bats have good eyesight that is adapted for low light conditions. Dr Mathews explained: ‘When we walk out of a lit house into the dark, it takes a while for our eyes to adapt to the darkness. ‘The same is true in bats – they are dazzled by bright light and it takes time for their eyes to re-adjust. This could affect their ability to navigate. ‘In addition, it seems that their ability to hunt insects is reduced in the light. So although a bat may be seen flying round and round a streetlamp, it may actually be struggling to catch anything.’ In Februrary, a study claimed that humans and the urban enviornments we've created have affected the evolution of a whole host of species - triggering the growth of enormous spiders, the shrinking of fish and the emergence of birds with no fear of man. And the changes are happening faster than previously thought which ‘may have significant implications for ecological and human well-being,’ according to one expert. Maria Alberti, of the University of Washington College of Built Environments, said that until recently, it was assumed that evolutionary change would take too long to affect ecological processes immediately. ‘We now have evidence that there is rapid evolution. These changes may affect the state of the environment now. This is what's called eco-evolutionary feedback,’ she said. A new study claims that animals living in cities have evolved rapidly because of human influence. For example, Pacific salmon (b) have become smaller, blackbirds (d) have changed their migratory behaviour, Crespis sancta (e) disperses less seeds in built-up areas, earthworms (f) have become tolerant to metal, while white-footed mice (c) are carrying more ticks, leading to increased cases of Lyme Disease in humans . Professor Alberti explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities has not simply decreased, but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly. ‘Many species of mammals, birds, fishes, and insects have learned novel behaviours, such as diet, foraging skills, and anti-predator behaviour,’ the study says. For example, it cites research that found the bodies of fish changed in response to the construction of dams and that Pacific salmon have become smaller in urban areas. In contrast, a study published in August last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments. Professor Alberti said that changes in animals have an effect on ‘ecosystem functions such as biodiversity, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, detoxification, food production and ultimately on human health and well-being.’ In addition to the growing spiders and shrinking salmon, she cited earthworms with increased tolerance to metals and seeds of some plants dispersing less effectively. Earthworms have adapted genetically to a series of soil contaminates, including arsenic and certain plants also have also developed an increased tolerance for heavy metals in brownfield sites in cities. Worryingly, the study also points to evidence of changes in a type of urban mouse, that may have health consequences for humans. Some white-footed mice in New York were found to be a ‘critical host’ for black-legged ticks that carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Professor Alberti’s study says that thriving mouse populations allow more ticks to survive and lead to predictable spikes in human exposure to the illness. It also discusses how songbirds are becoming tamer and bolder, as well as changing their tunes to ensure their acoustic signals are not lost in the noisy urban background.","Researchers from the University of Exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing insects .

"New York Home Depot employee Kirk Soccorso said he was fired because he has 'Isis', the name of his ex-girlfriend, tattooed on the inside of his lip . A New York Home Depot employee says he was fired because he has 'Isis', the name of his ex-girlfriend, tattooed on the inside of his lip. Kirk Soccorso said he got the tattoo four years ago while dating his ex-girlfriend, who is named after the Egyptian goddess of nature. Soccorso said he had no idea 'until just recently' that the acronym stood for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, an extremist terrorist group. So when Soccorso overheard a co-worker using the word he decided to show off his old tattoo. Soccorso, who had been working at the Long Island store for six months as a tool demonstrator, said he was then let go from his job and told not to return. 'I feel a little lost,' he told News 12 Long Island. 'It was a good paying job.' Soccorso said it was never his intention to scare anyone and that he was 'just making conversation' when he revealed his inked lip. 'I want a chance for my job back,' he said. A spokesman for Home Depot told News 12 that the decision to fire Soccorso wasn't 'just based on the tattoo'. Soccorso, who said he didn't know what the acronym stood for until 'just recently', overheard a co-worker using the word and decided to show off his old tattoo.

"Providencia Paredes, the special assistant to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, has died. Paredes' son, Gustavo Paredes, announced her death on his Facebook page. Paredes died in Washington on March 18 at the age of 90. In his post, Gustavo Paredes wrote that his mother was born in the Dominican Republic and was the first person of Latino descent to work in the White House as part of president's inner circle. Remembered: Providencia Paredes (seen left and right), the special assistant to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, has died . In addition to helping the first lady keep track of engagements, field phone calls and interface with fashion designers, Paredes also helped Onassis practice her Spanish in advance of speeches in Latin American countries and before Hispanic communities. Paredes described his mother as 'a woman of immense will, passion, curiosity and a zest for life.' His Facebook profile includes a photo of him as a boy with the Kennedy family at Christmastime. Providencia Paredes told Fox News Latino in 2013 she couldn't make the trip to Dallas with the Kennedys in November 1963. However, she picked the first lady's pink ensemble after receiving a phone call from President Kennedy, in which he requested Paredes select a weather-appropriate outfit for his wife, Fox News Latino reported. Assistance: Paredes helped Onassis practice her Spanish in advance of speeches in Latin American countries and before Hispanic communities . After President Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963, Paredes told Fox News Latino the first lady called her with a request for a different ensemble. 'I got a blue outfit and sent it to her right away,' Paredes told the news outlet. 'I had just found out earlier about what happened to the President.' Upon seeing Onassis at the White House, Paredes told Fox News Latino 'We went into a room, just she and I, and she broke down. She said ""They could have killed me too."" She said she was very afraid.' Holiday: Paredes' son, Gustavo Paredes, is seen with the Kennedys at Christmastime in this undated photo . Paredes went on to work for Onassis in New York City before she became Sen. Robert Kennedy's employee, Fox News Latino reported. She told the news outlet regarding his 1968 assassination 'I was getting dressed [in my Ambassador Hotel room], ready to go down, when I got the news.' The New York Times reported that Paredes and son Gustavo attended Onassis' burial service. After she died, Onassis left $50,000 to Paredes, Fox News reported.","Providencia Paredes, the special assistant to former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, has died .

"Chief Constable Chris Sims said officers would 'not be as visible on the streets,' in the future . Crime victims face having to report offences online then track the progress of investigations ‘like a parcel’ under plans by Britain’s second biggest police force to marginalise bobbies on the beat. Theft, assault and criminal damage victims are among those who will be expected to upload their own evidence in the ‘self-service’ reporting system, instead of liaising with an officer face-to-face or by phone. As well as supplying pictures of stolen phones or cars, victims will be asked to file crime reports to the web-based portal in plans that will also see the loss of 2,500 staff. The ‘virtual policing’ plans, unveiled in a five-year blueprint by West Midlands Police, were condemned by crime victims. Tariq Jahan, whose son Haroon, 20, was one of three men killed protecting homes in the 2011 summer riots in Birmingham, said the plans ‘didn’t inspire confidence’. Mr Jahan, from West Bromwich, said: ‘For a victim of crime, one-to-one interaction with a human is important.’ He added that many elderly people would have difficulties with the new system. Birmingham lawyer Dean Parnell, who had to track down and recover his stolen iPad in 2013 because officers were too busy to attend, said ‘a faceless online service... could lead to important evidence being missed’. The force also wants to encourage witnesses to supply images or video footage of incidents such as street thefts or assaults. Its new operating model will see neighbourhood officers deployed into specific areas, instead of across the force patch, leaving middle class areas where crime is less of an issue without a significant uniform presence. The force said the changes were needed as part of cuts aimed at saving £130million over the next four years. Chief Constable Chris Sims admitted that officers would ‘not be as visible on the streets’ in future, as the force looked to achieve ‘greater efficiency’. West Midlands Police have unveiled a five year blueprint for 'virtual policing' plans. Pictured: West Midlands Police headquarters . Beat bobbies will be cut or reassigned, with the ten neighbourhood policing units replaced by smaller teams targeting areas where a police presence is most needed. The plans will see the Birmingham-based constabulary shrink to its smallest size since it was established in 1974. The force wants to encourage online reporting of all but the most serious offences. David Jamieson, West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ‘We hope that by the end of this year you will be able to log in and watch the progress of an investigation in the same way that you can track a parcel.’","West Midlands Police unveil 'virtual policing' plan for the next five years .

"Vladimir Putin is said to be in bed 'with a cold', according to sources close to the Kremlin responding to speculation over why the leader has not been seen in public for ten days. Too ill to take part in official engagements, the politician is apparently holed up in one of his country retreats during one of the most contentious times in his leadership. Speculation over why he has seldom been seen in public has been rife as accusations of  involvement in the death of Boris Nemtsov and rumours of fathering a lovechild reach fever pitch. There have even been claims of sudden death and a government coup with the leader's aides remaining tight-lipped over his absence. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Putin has not been seen in public for ten days because he is 'in bed with a cold', say sources close to the Russian politician . But sources close to the Kremlin now say the reason for Putin's disappearance is a nasty cold which has left him bed bound. Opposition television station Dozhd quoted sources close to the leader as saying this was why he had been hidden from view. Despite his apparent illness, the leader will tune in to state television tonight to watch a pre-recorded documentary on the battle for Crimea. In it he makes the startling admission that Russia was prepared to put its nuclear weapons on alert to secure the peninsula. Wearing a stony expression, he tells the camera: 'We were ready to do it,' when asked whether he would have put nuclear weapons on alert. 'I talked with colleagues and told them that this is our historic territory. 'Russian people live there, they are in danger and we cannot leave them,' he continued, claiming a bout of flu caused him to remain hidden from public view for almost two weeks. His vanishing act comes after the murder of opponent Boris Nemtsov . He also claims to have had intelligence which indicated anti-Russia militants planned to kill ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. 'His physical removal was being prepared,' said Putin who has previously blamed the West for orchestrating the toppling of the pro-Moscow leader. 'It was not us who carried out the coup,' he insisted. He also suggested that Yanukovych could have saved himself from a coup if he had used weapons on protesters. 'I do not want to evaluate his work.... (but) he said ""I could not sign an order on use of weaponry. I could not bring myself to do it."" 'Can we blame him for it? I cannot say. And I do not want to do it. I don't think I have a right to do so. 'Whether it is good or bad, the consequences of inactivity are grave. This is clear.' The interview comes amid rumours that the president has fathered a child with 'lover' Alina Kabayeva. The 31-year-old former mistress is said to have given birth in Switzerland in recent days. While sources said the leader was unwell, his official press secretary Dmirty Peskov refused to confirm the claims, saying: 'No comment, the topic is closed.' Putin is due in St Petersburg on Monday to meet Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev, although in one of many bizarre episodes in recent days footage of the supposed summit was aired last week by a TV channel. One former loyalist said yesterday that Putin could face the same fate as the last Tsar of Russia, shot by a Bolshevik firing squad, or ex-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died in The Hague awaiting trial. Igor Strelkov - a key military commander of rebel fighters in Crimea and eastern Ukraine - also noted that 15 March was the date of the abdication of monarch Nicholas II, 98 years ago. One report citing military historian Strelkov said 'that Vladimir Putin might follow the destiny of Emperor Nicholas II, who was shot in 1918. 'Another path for Putin, according to Strelkov is a repetition of final days of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died in 2006 in jail in The Hague.' Rumours the Russian President has fathered a child with gymnast Alina Kabayeva (above) are also rife .

"The rise in the number of foreign criminals in Britain comes despite a series of crackdowns by Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) The number of foreign criminals on Britain’s streets has risen by almost 20 per cent, despite repeated Government attempts to kick more of them out. Official figures show there are now close to 5,000 immigrants at large after being released from jail, a record high. Dozens are continuing to avoid deportation by claiming they have the human right to a family life in Britain. Recent cases uncovered by The Mail on Sunday include: . - A drunken Lithuanian thug who dragged his ex-girlfriend by her hair and beat her up, and who is now barred from seeing her – but who has been allowed to remain in the country because they have a child; . - A Sri Lankan illegal immigrant who has a string of convictions to his name, including indecent assault, theft and driving offences, who has avoided deportation despite a judge admitting it was a ‘somewhat generous’ decision; . - A Tanzanian fraudster who won his appeal against being sent back to his home country because he does the school run for his children and takes them to their piano lessons . The rise comes despite a series of crackdowns by Home Secretary Theresa May, who has ordered judges to take less notice of human rights sob stories and introduced a ‘deport now, appeal later’ rule. The figures will be another setback to the Home Secretary after the high-profile failure of her flagship pledge to reduce net migration – the growth of the UK population – to the ‘tens of thousands’. New figures released last month showed that the annual growth was instead closer to 300,000 – the highest level since 2005. Last night David Hanson, Labour’s immigration spokesman, said: ‘For all Theresa May’s bluster, the truth is that on her watch fewer foreign criminals are being detained or deported making it easier for them to carry on living here in the UK. Human rights lawyers claimed a staggering £280 an hour to represent a notorious terror suspect. The lawyers were acting for Egyptian hate preacher Yasser Al-Sirri, who has lived in Britain for 20 years after being convicted of a plot to assassinate Egypt’s prime minister. During that time he has been acquitted of conspiring to murder an Afghan leader. Yasser Al-Sirri, an associate of the notorious preacher Abu Qatada, took his case to the Supreme Court to get refugee status. The pair are pictured together in London . Al-Sirri, an associate of the notorious preacher Abu Qatada, took his case to the Supreme Court to get refugee status. The Home Office revealed that his solicitors Birnberg Peirceclaimed £280 an hour for costs after winning the case, and were paid a total of £62,000. It was the highest amount paid by the Home Office in legal costs to a law firm bringing an action against the Government in the year 2013-14. ...but bad news for the rest of us . As Al-Sirri won his case, the costs were picked up by the Home Office – which means you, the taxpayer, picked up the bill. ‘It’s unacceptable and is yet more evidence of how badly the Home Secretary has failed on crime. 'The Government’s long and ever growing record of incompetence and failure on crime and public safety shows why nobody trusts them on this issue.’ Home Office data shows that the number of foreign national offenders who are currently still in Britain, having served their time in jail, stood at 4,903 at the end of last year. Shock figures: Our report last month about foreign criminals . That represents an 18 per cent rise from the 4,153 recorded a year earlier. Of those 4,903, 1,634 have been at large for more than five years. In the last three months of 2014, 312 new foreign criminals who were eligible for deportation were ‘released into the community’. Only five were deported immediately, with a further 196 still being ‘caseworked’ and 62 suffering ‘legal issues’ while 32 had ‘removal issues’. The data shows that, overall, there were 570 foreign criminals fighting removal at the end of last year. Of these, 43 were claiming asylum, 201 were appealing against their deportation in courts and tribunals, and nine had children or family members living in the UK, meaning they could not be removed. Another six escaped being deported because of fears they would suffer torture or persecution back in their homeland. Five had medical conditions that kept them in the UK and – incredibly – nine could not be deported simply because officials do not know to which country they should be returned. CASE ONE - Thug has son with victim, so stays . Lithuanian Olegas Lvovas, 24, was jailed for 16 months for dragging his ex-partner into the street by her hair, hitting her and threatening her with a knife. There is a restraining order to stop him hurting her again. But he won an appeal against deportation as he has a son with his victim, who has visited him in prison. CASE TWO - Saved by his British wedding . Since Sri Lankan asylum seeker Vijayakaran Tissaweerasingam arrived illegally in Dover in 1999, he has been convicted of indecent assault, theft and driving offences. He married a UK citizen after release from jail and was given the right to remain. A judge said it was a ‘generous’ decision. CASE THREE - Freed 'to do the school run' Cryton Sijaona, from Tanzania, was sentenced to 18 months for getting permission to live in the UK on ‘fraudulent’ grounds. But immigration judges said that he had a ‘strong bond’ with his children – he took them to school and piano lessons – so it would be ‘unduly harsh’ to send him home. More than 200 were being held up because the offenders did not have a passport and needed an emergency travel document from their home country’s embassy before they could fly out. A staggering 151 foreign criminals have been waiting for more than a year for such a document, while 294 offenders were involved in ‘failed removals’ – often because they refused to board planes or went on the run. But 653 foreign criminals were sent home under controversial schemes that allow prisoners to leave before their sentence finishes. Some even received up to £1,500 for co-operating. The rise comes despite a series of crackdowns by Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured), who has ordered judges to take less notice of human rights sob stories and introduced a ‘deport now, appeal later’ rule . The average time to deport a foreign offender now stands at 152 days, according to the Home Office figures, up sharply from 111 days when the previous figures were published three months earlier. Although thousands of criminals roam the streets, another 1,387 remain in immigration detention after serving their sentences – at an average cost of £96 a day. Foreign criminals make up about one in eight – or 11,000 – of all those behind bars in England and Wales. The Home Office said it was getting to grips with the problem and had removed almost 5,100 foreign national offenders in the past year. Out of 570 active deportation cases in the last three months of 2014... 93 are waiting for passports . 140 are using lack of papers to hinder deportation . 9 refuse to say where they're from . 9 claim they have married partners and/or children in the UK . 43 claim they have refugee status . 6 claim their home country is too dangerous to return to . 23 face further legal action in the UK . 201 cases with unspecified grounds for appeal .","The number of foreign criminals on Britain's streets has risen 20 per cent .

"As if running on the treadmill wasn't already hard enough work, a man has performed a dance routine on one. Choreographer Carson Dean has posted a video of himself performing a high-speed, energetic routine to Bruno Mars' catchy hit song, Uptown Funk. And to add to the talented feat, he doesn't lose his balance once or even appear to break into a sweat. Choreographer Carson Dean, starts his Uptown Funk routine with a series of turns on the treadmill . Throughout the dance, Dean, who is based in Los Angeles, California, carries out a series of jumps, spins, high-kicks and even a flip - all while maintaining his balance. The professional dancer, choreographer, singer and actor posted the short clip, lasting a minute and a half, on YouTube. It was supposedly intended to be a short workout video, with the caption alluding to the lyrics from the Bruno Mars song: 'The best cardio workout! Don't believe me just watch.' But it's unlikely that many non-professional dancers will be able to imitate his acrobatic 'cardio workout'. The routine starts off slowly with a Dean strolling to the beat on the treadmill, alternating between going backwards and forwards. His movement gets progressively more high-energy, eventually introducing nifty footwork and turns. The professional dancer/choreographer, actor and singer starts to use the arms of the treadmill to conduct a series of tricks . Dean moves on to more high-energy moves and high-kicks, all while remaining sweat-free . By the end of the video, Dean uses the arms of the treadmill to lift himself up and employ high leg-kicks. But by far the most impressive moment, is when the choreographer once again uses the support arms of the treadmill to curl up and do a small flip. The viral video has already racked up 2,658,243 views, as well as 18,549 likes, with viewers amazed at Dean's slick moves and cool composure. YouTube user, Kandee Johnson posted: 'This is craazy!!!!! Some people can barely get off of a treadmill without falling!' The most impressive part of the video is when the dancer uses his upper-body strength to employ a small flip on the moving treadmill .","Choreographer Carson Dean dances to Bruno Mars' hit Uptown Funk .

"Love them or hate them, airline meals are a big part of every traveller's flight, and they have changed dramatically since their introduction in 1919. The mile-high meals have seen highs and lows, from the first hot meals being served on United Airlines in 1936 and tablecloths and silver service in the 1950s to low-cost carriers slicing food budgets in the 1970s. KLM, the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands, has offered an insight into their airline cuisine in 1965. Passengers are served beverages by a flight attendant - with plenty of legroom - on a KLM flight in 1965 . In 1965, food was prepared on the ground, like today, by chefs, including many who had won awards . How the food was served . The 1950s and '60s were considered the golden age of travel, with the glory days of Pan Am, and the Concorde breaking records in the skies. From their promotional video in 1958 Pan Am unveiled the new developments on board their new 707 jet service. Meals were described as being prepared in four simultaneously operating galleys, with dishes being cooked in five-minute ovens. In short - they aimed to take the 'travail out of travel.' The Civil Service for Aircraft Catering Provisioning was responsible for supplying food and beverage to KLM in 1965. By this time there were no chefs on board the flights, and thousands of meals were prepared on the ground every day. The provisioning came in the three categories. The fixed provisioning was the supplying of blankets, cutlery and glassware for guests. Meals and perishable goods were included in the variable provisioning, which depended on the number of passengers. Finally special provisioning was granted for specific dietary requirements and baby food. Passengers would specify their preferences before at the time of booking, and these would be relayed to the kitchen. The catering company for KLM and 20 other airlines cleaned 50,000 pieces of cutlery every day . What food was served? The Civil Service for Aircraft Catering Provisioning provided for around twenty other airlines, as well as KLM. In 1965, they would prepare tens of thousands of meals every day for flying passengers, which included pastries, roasted chicken and boiled eggs. There were kosher dishes served for those who required them, and a staggering 15,000 items of crockery to be cleaned daily. 3,000 cold dishes, fully composed . 250 chickens, roasted and deboned . 500 kilograms of meat, roasted or stewed . 3,000 eggs, boiled and shelled . 2,000 pastries . 250 kosher dishes . 10,000 trays, fully laid out . 15,000 cups, saucers and plates cleaned . 50,000 knives, forks and spoons cleaned . Concorde debuted in 1969, and flights on the British Airways and Air France dazzled guests with caviar, champagne, foie gras, lobster and truffles. Guided tours . Amsterdam Schiphol Airport has been KLM’s home base since the airline’s founding in 1919. The airport had kitchens for preparing flight meals, with many of the cooks having won international culinary awards. A highlight of the Schiphol tour would feature the cooking location, to see where the thousands of airborne meals were created. The big clean-up . According to old copies of KLM's staff magazine, Wolkenridder, the airline had 1.6million passengers during the fiscal year of 1964-65. Although this is not a lot compared to the 25.8million customers it carried in 2012, no disposable tableware existed in those early years, until 1969. Crews in 1965 would use a mechanised dishwashing system to clean all items, which had demineralised water, ensuring a no-streak finish. None of the plates, cups or cutlery were disposable on KLM's 1965 flights . What happened next? In the 1970s ticket prices fell dramatically with airline deregulation, and this had an impact on the budget for food and service. This sparked the creation of the world's first low-cost carrier, Southwest Airlines, in 1971. In 1973, French airline Union de Transports Aériens recruited professional advice from Raymond Oliver, in redesigning their menus. Airlines begin to favour salty, rich and spicy food which is better for reheating and retains its flavour at 30,000ft. In 2001, after the September 11 tragedy, plastic cutlery was preferred by airlines. Another bomb scare in 2006 led to even stricter regulations with all liquids greater than 100ml banned from flights. This led to passengers being forced to buy drinks from the airport or expensive ones on the plane, unless they were complimentary. A report from TravelSupermarket reveals that airlines charge up to 2,600 per cent more than supermarkets for in-flight food and drink. In 2011 more airlines began to seek the help of celebrity and Michelin star chefs to raise the standard of in-flight meals. These included Heston Blumenthal, of Fat Duck fame, for British Airways, and Singapore Airlines sign-up Carlo Cracco, a two-star Michelin chef in Milan.","Rare photos reveal in-flight meals in the 1960s before disposable dishes .

"An lawyer who allegedly likes to dress like as a TSA worker for cavity search sex tapes is accused of choking a girlfriend he met online when she tried to break up with him. Christina Leos, a former preschool teacher told a court that Ryan Hemphill, 33, allegedly choked her during an S&M session. Hemphill, who attended Hofstra University School of Law in New York before working as a legal advisor, has been charged with second-degree strangulation, menacing, criminal obstruction of breathing and weapon possession, the New York Post reports. Christina Leos, (pictured) a former preschool teacher told a court that Ryan Hemphill, 33, allegedly choked her during an S&M session . A document read by the paper says the victim who met Hemphill on dating website eHarmony was left with cuts on her mouth and bruises to her wrist and elbow. During pretrial hearings, prosecutors said the couple made a sex tape where he pretended to be a 'TSA agent, searching her body cavities,' papers state. Leos told the jury that when she tried to break up with Hemphill in February 2013 he became violent and he grabbed her and picked up a Bowie knife before telling her he would slit her throat. Hemphill denies the charges. A document read by the paper says the victim who met Hemphill on dating website eHarmony was left with cuts on her mouth and bruises to her wrist and elbow. She said they made up the next day but then had another row the following month. 'He grabbed me and started strangling me,' Leos said, weeping. 'He had one hand on my neck and one covering my mouth and pushing down on my nose. That's when I realized I can't breathe.' She said Hemphill finally released her and she fled and called the police the following day. Hemphill denies the charges. Hemphill also had over a dozen homemade porn videos - he is seen choking, water-boarding and torturing prostitutes, prosecutors said, . 'One of the objects we recovered is a baton, looks like a police baton, and inside, if you undo it, is a sword,' prosecutor Sara Weiss said. 'He is in multiple videos holding that sword to the neck of blindfolded women, women he, on some occasions, urinates on, while he makes them recite prayers.' The details of those videos were banned at trial, after his defense lawyer objected.","Christina Leos, a former preschool teacher told a court that Ryan Hemphill, allegedly choked her during an S&M session .

"An average smartphone contains 41 different elements - and last year alone 1.2 billion of the handsets were sold globally. This is causing an imbalance between the supply of  metals and metalloids and their demand from consumers - a concept referred to as 'criticality.' Researchers have now assessed the criticality of all 62 metallic-based elements on the Periodic Table to reveal which are most at risk and what that means for our gadgets in the long-term. Researchers from Yale University assessed the 'criticality' of 62 metals on the Periodic Table. They discovered at at least 33 of these (shown) are used for circuit boards. Criticality looks at which materials will become harder to find, which will have the highest environmental costs and which are irreplaceable . Metal criticality is analysed in three ways - supply risk, vulnerability to supply restriction (VSR) and environmental implications. Put simply, supply risk is the probability that a necessary raw material will run out. VSR is an index used to work out how likely a particular element will become restricted based on how much its used and how abundant it is. This index considers restrictions put upon supply from companies or countries, for example. Metal criticality is analysed in three ways - supply risk, vulnerability to supply restriction (VSR) and environmental implications. Put simply, supply risk is the probability that a necessary raw material becomes unavailable. VSR is an index used to work out how likely a particular element will become restricted based on how much its used and how abundant it is. This index considers restrictions put upon supply from companies or countries, for example. And in terms of the environment, researchers assess what costs mining certain materials, as well as the materials themselves, have on the environment and then the likelihood that this may also lead to restrictions. Lead, for example, was banned in many products after governments and companies learnt of its dangers to the environment and began prohibiting how much it was used. An overall score is awarded to each element within each category and the higher the score, the more at risk that element is. And in terms of the environment, researchers assess what costs mining certain materials, as well as the materials themselves, have on the environment and then the likelihood that this may also lead to restrictions. Lead, for example, was banned in many products after governments and companies learnt of its dangers to the environment and began prohibiting how much it was used. Using these three categories, researchers from Yale University led by Professor Thomas Graedel were able to see which metals and metalloids are most at risk within each group. Many of the metals traditionally used in manufacturing, including zinc, copper, and aluminum, are not at risk, explained Professor Graedel. However, the newer or less-common metals used in smartphones, infrared optics, and medical imaging, are vulnerable. The team's results show that the limitations for many important metals used in smartphones and other gadgets are largely those related to supply risk. These include gallium used in processor chips and selenium in transistors on these chips. Platinum group metals including gold and mercury have the highest environmental implications. While steel alloying elements, such as chromium and niobium, as well as elements used in high-temperature alloys including tungsten and molybdenum, scored higher in the vulnerability to supply restriction category. 'The metals we've been using for a long time probably won't present much of a challenge,' said Professor Graedel. This graphic reveals the 41 elements typically found in a smartphone's screen, electronics, battery and casing. Many metals traditionally used in manufacturing, including zinc, copper, and aluminum, are not at risk . The results  show that  many important metals used in gadgets are largely related to supply risk (A). These include gallium and selenium. Gold and mercury have some of the highest environmental implications (B). Chromium, niobium, tungsten and molybdenum scored higher for the vulnerability to supply restriction (C) 'We've been using them for a long time because they're pretty abundant and they are generally widespread geographically. 'But some metals that have become deployed for technology only in the last 10 or 20 years are available almost entirely as byproducts. 'You can't mine specifically for them; they often exist in small quantities and are used for specialty purposes. And they don't have any decent substitutes.' The researchers listed these as indium, arsenic, thallium, antimony, silver, and selenium. There is no substitute for indium, in particular, and this could impact our touchscreens. Factors affecting extreme criticality include 'concentration of primary production' and political instability. The study points to the fact that up to 95% of rare Earth metals come from China, and tantalum comes from areas of unrest such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year 1.2 billion smartphones were sold globally . Among the factors affecting extreme criticality include 'high geopolitical concentration of primary production' and political instability. The researchers point to the fact that up to 95 per cent of rare Earth metals come from China, while tantalum, used in phone micro-capacitors, comes from areas of unrest such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Professor Graedel also looked at the effect recycling can have on these elements and explained that lead is highly recyclable, but materials that are only used in trace amounts are harder to extract. 'I think these results should send a message to product designers to spend more time thinking about what happens after their products are no longer being used,' Professor Graedel added. 'So much of what makes the recycling of these materials difficult is their design. It seems as if it's time to think a little bit more about the end of these beautiful products.' The research is published in the journal PNAS.","Researchers assessed the  'criticality' of 62 metals on the Periodic Table .

"Police are searching for a Russian gun store owner after three people were found dead at an upscale New Hampshire home on Saturday. Police in Bedford have yet to confirm the causes of death and names of the victims, but neighbors have confirmed that the home belongs to Alexey Obukhov. He lives at the property with his wife Nina and their two young daughters, aged four and seven. Public records list people called Yulia and Anatoli as also living at the address. Scroll Down for Video . Three people were found dead in an upscale Bedford, New Hampshire, home on Saturday after police received a call at about 1pm about a dead woman . It is believed that Alexey Obukhov and his wife Nina lived in the home with their two daughters, aged four and seven . Police are searching for Russian gun store owner Alexey Obukhov after three people were found dead at an upscale New Hampshire home on Saturday . Cops received a call about a dead woman in the home at about 1pm and found two more people dead when they arrived. Although police have said they are not looking for suspects, a 'be-on-the-lookout alert' was issued by National Emergency Alerts - New England at about 11.40pm on Saturday on Facebook. The statement announced that they were looking for Obukhov and his maroon BMW coupe with New Hampshire plates. Obukhov is the owner of a guns and ammo shop in Merrimack, which made headlines in 2013 after hanging pictures of President Barack Obama with Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong calling Obama 'firearm salesman of the year'. He is also the owner of a company called New Vector Corporation, according to online records. He also is the president of Collectible Arms and Ammo II Corp. Obukhov was previously arrested in August 2013 for a domestic violence assault but the charges were dismissed after his wife declined to testify, according to the Bedford Patch. National Emergency Alerts - new England, however, issued a 'be-on-the-lookout alert Saturday evening looking for a man named Alexey Obukhov . State and Bedford Police, along with a SWAT Team arrived on scene on Saturday. Police continued to investigate at the house throughout the day on Sunday . Then last year he filed a civil lawsuit against Bedford Police Chief John Bryfonski, seeking that all of his firearms and ammunition be returned to him . The lawsuit was denied, but Obukhov sued and in November, the state's highest court ordered that Obukhov's application for a pistol revolver license be granted even though Bryfonski believed that he was unsuitable to possess a concealed weapon, according to court records. New Hampshire State Police and SWAT vehicles were on the scene in Beford, blocking off the street and access to the home. The Attorney's General Office is also part of the investigation. Additional counselors will be on hand at a local elementary school on Monday. 'This tragedy will affect all of us, and it will affect Riddle Brook School in particular,' Superintendent Chip McGee said in an email to parents of the Bedford School District on Sunday morning, reports Union Leader. Very few details about the case have been released, and causes of death and names of victims are being withheld pending the notification of family . Police blocked off the road in Bedford where the Obukhovs allegedly lived for the remainder of Saturday . While reassuring the public that there is no threat to the community, McGee said the school district is coordinating with the National Alliance of Mental Illness and the Attorney General's Office Crisis Response Team. 'Starting on Monday morning, we will have additional counselors at Riddle Brook School to work with those most affected. Counseling staff at all of our schools will be available to talk with students, parents and staff,' McGee said in his statement. '... This event will be known in our community, even among our children. Information travels fast. The event may trigger difficult memories and strong emotions in people.'

"A revolutionary drug, called ibrutinib, that ‘switches off’ cancer may soon be offered to patients with some forms of the disease. Stock photo . A revolutionary drug that ‘switches off’ cancer may soon be offered to patients with some forms of the disease. If prescribed, the once-a-day tablet, called ibrutinib, could spare blood cancer patients the sometimes agonising side effects of traditional chemotherapy. Ibrutinib is one of only a handful of new medicines to be made available via the Cancer Drugs Fund after two trials in 28 British hospitals showed it to be extremely effective in treating both mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Professor Stephen Devereux, consultant haematologist at King’s College Hospital in London, says it is a new class of targeted medications, known as a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It works by targeting and switching off a protein in the cancer cells. ‘Chemotherapy kills cancer cells but it also kills normal cells and therefore has lots of side effects,’ he says. ‘As this drug is targeted at the B-cells, the side effects are minor. In addition, patients don’t have to go into hospital to have it administered.’ About one in every 25 people will be diagnosed with blood cancer during their lifetime – that’s 25,000 people each year in the UK. Of these, 2,800 will have CLL, the most common type of leukaemia, and 500 will have MCL, a rare type of B-cell lymphoma. For the time being, a course of ibrutinib – which costs up to £74,000 a year – will be prescribed only to patients whose disease does not respond to chemotherapy, or those who have relapsed following chemotherapy. But trials using the drug as a first-line treatment are also taking place. Prof Devereux says: ‘We’re looking forward to a chemotherapy-free future, although we’re not there quite yet. ‘This drug takes on an aggressive disease and makes it benign. It’s not a cure – these diseases are incurable – but it turns them into chronic conditions. We already know that it can work for several years… the challenge to the NHS is cost.’ If prescribed, the once-a-day tablet could spare blood cancer patients the sometimes agonising side effects of traditional chemotherapy. Stock photo . Jonathan Pearce, chief executive of the Lymphoma Association, also backs the new drug. He says: ‘The new class of targeted drug therapies that pharmaceutical companies are currently developing, like ibrutinib, offer hope to many people with lymphoma – both in relation to the efficacy of the treatments and how well tolerated they are in terms of side effects.’","Ibrutinib to to be made available via Cancer Drugs Fund after two trials .

"A child victim who was beaten and sexually abused for years by their father has defended their mother and the man's second wife for their alleged roles in the sickening pedophile ring where incest and bestiality was discovered. Christopher Sena, 47, his wife Deborah Sena, 50, and ex-wife Terrie Sena have been accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years in their Las Vegas trailer-park home. The three allegedly took part in underage, incestuous video-taped sex attacks and were arrested last year. Terrie Sena, 43, agreed to a plea deal in January with Clark County prosecutors on one count of sexual assault that could put her behind bars for 10 years to life. Scroll down for video . Terrie Sena, 43, (pictured left) agreed to a plea deal for taking part in incestuous video-taped sex attacks with her ex-husband and his second wife, Deborah (right). A former child victim of the pedophile ring has defended the two women . Deborah Sena was offered the same deal, but her attorney said she was a victim and her husband made her take part. Her defense attorney, Kristina Wildeveld, told the Review-Journal: 'She was coerced, threatened, blackmailed, beaten, by Chris Sena. 'I'm very uncomfortable with a victim of domestic violence signing up for 10 to life in prison for something that she never was an active participant in.' The statement was seconded by a victim of the sickening sexual abuse, who is now an adult. In a letter to the Las Vegas Review-Journal this week, the victim said the mothers should not face jail because they were also subjected to years of torture and sexual abuse. The victim said the women, like the child victims, lived in constant fear and were monitored 24/7 by Sena, under threats of violence. Christopher Sena has been accused of sexually abusing his children and filming them in sickening acts for more than ten years . The letter read: 'Christopher would ask them if (Deborah or Terrie Sena) would like to take the punishment instead of us. 'And they would take those beatings for us.' The victim also added in the letter: 'Our father is in jail, where he belongs. 'And the absence of our mothers continues to victimize us kids.' Christopher Sena was arrested in September as part of a SWAT team operation and recording equipment seized from the home. Authorities allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband last August and reported the abuse, involved in sexual acts with the family dog. She claimed her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him. One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two  children having sex with the family dog,The Daily Beast reported. Sena faces 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison. The 47-year-old is due in court for a preliminary hearing in April. The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest. All three have been held without bail. Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997. But after they split, Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife, Deborah. Authorities allegedly found videos showing all three adults engaging in sex acts with children. At least eight minors were involved and some encounters were filmed as part of a child porn operation, police said. One  victim told authorities that when Sena started abusing her as a child, the two women were not aware of it, but when she was 17, she was forced to engage in sexual activity with them. That victim started to strike her stomach with a piece of wood, fearful that she would fall pregnant with Sena's child. Some of the victims say they were abused for years; one boy said the abuse started when he was three years old and continued until he was a teenager. Another woman said she was abused two or three times a week by Sena for more than a decade. Police described the abuse as 'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory'. According to investigators Terrie Sena, told police she was attracted to young male and female teens, and said it was 'really enjoyable' when one of the boys started to look like Christopher Sena. But she told authorities that she later felt 'ashamed' and 'dirty'. Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher Sena. The couple and Sena's ex-wife were arrested in December for sexual abuse of their children . Christopher Sena also encouraged his abused children to bring their friends over to the house. He allegedly told one girl and one male victim to 'bring female friends over' and to make sure they wore bathing suits, according to the police report. Another female victim, who is now an adult, said she saw Christopher Sena take 'a number of her friends' into his office, police said. Neighbors told the Review-Journal that he would seem 'excited' when his sons brought girlfriends over to the house. Others described the Sena property as the place many neighborhood kids would hang out. Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, they said. To stop his victims from speaking out about the abuse, he told at least two of them that he would kill them or break their legs if they spoke out, they told police.

"The Home Secretary set out a comprehensive overhaul aimed at curbing the power of the Police Federation . The scandal-hit police union will face sweeping reforms to end its ‘closed shop’ culture, it was announced yesterday. The Home Secretary set out a comprehensive overhaul aimed at curbing the power of the Police Federation, ending decades of mismanagement. Theresa May announced membership will no longer be compulsory for the 126,000 frontline officers who serve across England and Wales from next month. Its senior leadership will also not be paid from the public purse and they must demonstrate their ‘integrity and value’, she added. The move is a victory for the Daily Mail which has repeatedly exposed how the union was hijacked by a militant minority bent on attacking the Government. Their bullying tactics, lavish spending on corporate credit cards and drunken antics were laid bare by this newspaper in a series of devastating exposes. The union was also discovered to have invested vast sums in mysterious off-shore accounts amid questions over its £95million of cash and assets. The huge cash pile was reflected in the £26million lavished on the new luxury HQ in Leatherhead, Surrey, which includes a Freemasons’ lodge. And last year two of its most senior officials resigned just days after this newspaper revealed it had hired a PR firm to mastermind a ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government. The ‘guerilla tactics’ deal was designed to undermine a deeply unpopular programme of cuts and reform designed to drag policing into the 21st century. The union was also damaged by the Plebgate affair, sparked by a clash between the then chief whip Andrew Mitchell and Downing Street armed guards. Some senior figures seized on the scandal, printing T-shirts, posters and launching an online campaign in a bid to discredit the Tory command. But the series of politicised stunts backfired after officials were discovered to have misrepresented Mr Mitchell’s comments in a private meeting. The Federation’s new leadership, led by chairman Steve White, now hope to draw a line under the entire saga. They agree the union must be more transparent and open with both its members and the general public. Many of the changes announced yesterday are the result of a review they commissioned by former home office mandarin Sir David Normington.

The writing has been on the wall for the Police Federation since last spring when Mrs May demanded it must ‘change or die’. The Home Secretary said the frontline police ‘union’ must end its closed shop culture or she would legislate against it. In an astonishing speech, she accused it of complicity in an ‘attitude’ that leads to racism, neglect of vulnerable victims and the obstruction of official inquiries. ‘Every police officer, every single police leader, and everybody in the Police Federation should confront it and expunge it from the ranks,’ she added. Yesterday, in a ministerial statement, Mrs May confirmed the reforms, many of which have been requested by the Federation. Mrs May said the union has made ‘steady progress’ getting its house in order by implementing the recommendations. Many of the reforms focus on financial management and include a move to enable accounts to be ‘called in’ and examined by the Government. A further change puts the Federation on notice to prepare to be subject to Freedom of Information laws once new legislation can be agreed. Mrs May said the changes will bring ‘accountability and transparency’ to the way the union conducts its affairs. Mr White said: ‘We are pleased the Home Secretary has recognised the progress that we have made in implementing the reforms contained in the independent review we commissioned.","Home Secretary has set out a major overhaul aimed at Police Federation .

"True meaning of Easter: The eggs were backed by Archbishop of York John Sentamu, who is urging the supermarkets to rethink . Supermarkets have been accused of pursuing an ‘anti- Christian agenda’ after refusing to sell Easter eggs with a religious message. Some of Britain’s biggest stores are celebrating the most profound event in the Church calendar by offering treats featuring everything from Darth Vader to Postman Pat – but turned down products that mention Jesus. One chain even asked ‘what has Easter got to do with the Church?’, according to the makers of The Real Easter Egg, which features Christian crosses on the box and contain a leaflet telling the story of the Resurrection. Now Archbishop of York John Sentamu has stepped in – urging Sainsbury’s, Asda and the Co-op to stock the charity eggs – while former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey said he was ‘saddened’ by the three supermarket giants’ decision. Lord Carey said: ‘The rest are rubbish. These Easter eggs that have nothing to do with Easter, all they are trying to do is get more money out of people. They have no meaning. I think it shows ignorance on the part of these supermarkets. ‘By not offering an alternative to secular Easter eggs they are really undermining the real message of Easter. It saddens me because we are living in a land that is completely losing contact with its religious roots and is out of touch with the Christian message.’ David Marshall, the head of the Meaningful Chocolate Company, said the supermarkets appeared biased against its ‘proven seller’. He said: ‘We do wonder at times if there is an anti-Christian agenda from some of our supermarkets who just keep turning it down. It is as if some feel Christianity is politically incorrect or the Easter story, which mentions Jesus, might put people off. ‘One buyer asked us what Easter had got to do with the Church, while another simply said, “I don’t think this is a credible product” and asked us to leave.’ The Warrington-based firm has spent five years trying to persuade stores to sell its £4 Christian-themed eggs, which were launched in 2010 with the backing of Archbishop Sentamu. At first the supermarkets refused, but two years ago, Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and the Co-Op bowed to pressure and agreed. But this year Sainsbury’s and the Co-op have dropped the eggs, blaming poor sales, while Asda has never stocked them. However, the Meaningful Chocolate Company say a million eggs have been sold over the past five years. 'Poor sales': Sainsbury's and Co-op have cited poor sales as the reason they dropped the Eggs, while Asda said it has not be approached by the makers of the egg . Archbishop Sentamu, who has lamented ignorance about Easter after learning that a third of children thought it marked the birthday of the Easter bunny, said yesterday: ‘With a million Real Easter Eggs sold I am delighted that Morrisons, Tesco and Waitrose have met the challenge. I call on Sainsbury’s, Asda, and the Co-operative to give their customers the same choice.’ Sainsbury’s said their decision was based on ‘the popularity of ranges in previous years’, with the Co-op also citing ‘poor sales of the Real Easter Egg in previous years’. Asda said it had not been approached this year, a claim disputed by the Meaningful Chocolate Company.","Several major supermarkets refuse to stock charity's The Real Easter Egg .

"Distractions - especially talking with passengers and using cellphones - play a far greater role in car crashes involving teen drivers than has been previously understood, according to compelling new evidence cited by safety researchers. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety analyzed nearly 1,700 videos that capture the actions of teen drivers in the moments before a crash. It found that distractions were a factor in nearly 60per cent of moderate to severe crashes. That's four times the rate in many previous official estimates that were based on police reports. The study is unusual because researchers rarely have access to crash videos that clearly show what drivers were doing in the seconds before impact as well as what was happening on the road. AAA was able to examine more than 6,842 videos from cameras mounted in vehicles, showing both the driver and the simultaneous view out the windshield. The foundation got the videos from Lytx Inc., which offers programs that use video to coach drivers in improving their behavior and reducing collisions. Crashes or hard-braking events were captured in 1,691 of the videos. They show driver distraction was a factor in 58per cent of crashes, especially accidents in which vehicles ran off the road or had rear-end collisions. The most common forms of distraction were talking or otherwise engaging with passengers and using a cellphone, including talking, texting and reviewing messages. Caught on camera: A teen driver loses control of her vehicle after she was driving distracted . Finding the source of the problem: The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety analyzed nearly 1,700 videos that capture the actions of teen drivers in the moments before a crash . Other forms of distraction observed in the videos included drivers looking away from the road at something inside the vehicle, ten per cent; looking at something outside the vehicle other than the road ahead, nine per cent; singing or moving to music, eight percent; grooming, six percent; and reaching for an object, six per cent. In one video released by AAA, a teenage boy is seen trying to navigate a turn on a rain-slicked road with one hand on the wheel and a cellphone held to his ear in the other hand. The most common forms of distraction leading up to a crash by a teen driver included: . Interacting with other passengers: 15 percent of crashes . Cell phone use: 12 percent of crashes . Looking at something in the vehicle: 10 percent of crashes . Looking at something outside the vehicle: 9 percent of crashes . Singing/moving to music: 8 percent of crashes . Grooming: 6 percent of crashes . Reaching for an object: 6 percent of crashes . The car crosses a lane of traffic and runs off the road, stopping just short of railroad tracks that run parallel to the road. In another video, a driver on a lonely two-lane road at night is shown looking down at an electronic device, apparently texting. While his eyes are off the road, the car crosses the opposite lane, leaves the road and appears about to strike a mailbox. One teen driver is captured braking hard at the last moment to avoid slamming into the back of an SUV stopped or slowed in traffic ahead. Just a moment before, the girl had turned her attention to another girl in the front passenger seat in an animated conversation. The camera shows the shock on the girls' faces as they suddenly realize a crash is imminent. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has previously estimated that distraction of all kinds is a factor in only 14per cent of all teen driver crashes. The videos provide 'indisputable evidence that teen drivers are distracted in a much greater percentage of crashes than we previously realized,' said Peter Kissinger, the foundation's president and CEO. Past research has shown that teens with multiple passengers in the car are more likely to have accidents. Eyes down: The most common forms of distraction were talking or otherwise engaging with passengers and using a cellphone, including talking, texting and reviewing messages . New findings: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has previously estimated that distraction of all kinds is a factor in only 14per cent of all teen driver crashes . The opposite is the case for adults - for older drivers, having a passenger with an extra set of eyes on the road can make driving safer. Teen drivers using cellphones had their eyes off the road for an average of 4.1 seconds out of the final six seconds leading up to a crash, the AAA study found. Researchers also measured reaction times in rear-end crashes and found that teen drivers using cellphones failed to react more than half of the time before the impact, meaning they crashed without braking or steering away. AAA and other traffic safety groups who previewed the findings said the study shows states should review their licensing requirements to restrict the number of passengers in cars driven by teens and change their laws to prohibit cellphone use by teen drivers. Proof: The videos provide 'indisputable evidence that teen drivers are distracted in a much greater percentage of crashes than we previously realized,' said Peter Kissinger, the foundation's president and CEO . High numbers: About 963,000 drivers age 16 to 19 were involved in police-reported crashes in the U.S. in 2013, the most recent year for available data . 'The findings of the AAA Report confirm what safety groups have suspected for a long time - distraction is more severe and more common in teen driver crashes than previously found in government data,' said Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. AAA said it also recommends that parents teach teens about the dangers of cellphone use and restrict passengers during the learning-to-drive process. Teen drivers have the highest crash rate of any age group. About 963,000 drivers age 16 to 19 were involved in police-reported crashes in the U.S. in 2013, the most recent year for available data. These crashes resulted in 383,000 injuries and 2,865 deaths.","The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety analyzed nearly 1,700 videos that capture the actions of teen drivers in the moments before a crash .
