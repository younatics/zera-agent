"A 20-year-old mother accused of beating her two-year-old son to death last year and then burying his body in a shallow grave has given birth to another baby while in custody. Meagan Work, from Austin, Texas, gave birth to a son in February, Fox7 reported, but it is not known if she gave birth in jail or at the hospital, or if she was permitted to spend time with him. Child Protective Services took the child into state custody and on Monday, a hearing was held to determine if he will stay in foster care or live with a family member, KVUE reported. Officials told the channel that State District Judge Darlene Byrne will likely make a decision in upcoming days where to place the baby boy. In custody: Meagan Work, pictured left in a mug shot, gave birth to a baby boy while in custody last month, five months after she was arrested in the death of her two-year-old son Colton, pictured right . The baby's father is believed to be Michael Brandt Turner, who is also charged in the death of Work's two-year-old son, Colton Brandt Turner. Michael Turner was not Colton's biological father. Work was four months pregnant when she was arrested in her son's death last September after his remains were found hidden in a wooded area. A friend who was concerned about the boy's whereabouts had contacted authorities. Following the call, investigators interviewed Turner at San Saba County Jail, where he was being held on unrelated offenses. A day later, Turner took them to the site where he admitted burying the body  in July. A witness told police that he had seen Work slam her son's head against a truck before shaking and slapping him on July 7. Work, who had been living out of her car or with friends in the months before the death, told police different stories about her son's whereabouts, including that he had been kidnapped from their car and that she had given him to a couple she met in a restaurant. Killed: Colton's body was found in a shallow grave in a wooded area last September. His mother, pictured, had different accounts of what had happened to him but eventually admitted he had died in a motel room . Abuse: Relatives posted pictures of bruises and scratches across his body before he died. CPS had two open complaints against his mother when he died but because she was homeless, they could not find her . She eventually told investigators he died in motel room, according to an arrest affidavit. After his death, it emerged that relatives had shared photos of his injured body on Facebook, including deep scratches and bruises to his head and back. Texas Child Protective Services had received four total complaints beginning when Colton was about six months old, KVUE reported at the time. Accused: Work's boyfriend Michael Turner, 29, led authorities to the boy's buried body last year . Two of the complaints had been resolved and the other two were open and ongoing when investigators discovered Colton's body. CPS were unable to resolve them because they could not find the homeless mother. Work, who had previously pleaded guilty to animal cruelty and assault charges, is now charged with injury to a child in the death while Turner is charged with injury to a child by omission. Work remains in the Travis County Jail. A Travis County Sheriff's spokesman said deputies typically take mothers to a hospital to deliver babies, but would not provide any details on Work's case citing federal medical privacy laws. Work's aunt and a family friend issued a statement to Fox7 about her new child. 'In order to protect this child from undue duress surrounding this tragedy, we decline all requests for comment,' they wrote. 'Please understand that Colton's Law will save and protect thousands of children per year in Texas from suffering the same fate as Colton.' Colton's Law seeks to make it easier for law enforcement to find people who are running from CPS during investigations, as Work was before Colton's death. 'Colton’s Law would mandate state law enforcement to step in to search in cases where the child cannot be located and is in danger,' the family explains on their Facebook page. Both Work and Turner will next appear in court on April 13.","Meagan Work, from Austin, Texas, gave birth to a baby boy in February, five months after she was arrested in the death of her son Colton .

"Being made redundant makes people less willing to trust others for up to a decade afterwards, according to a study. Losing a job in this way dents trust so badly that even finding new work fails to overcome the problem, the researchers found. It suggests that, even in later life, people can struggle to get over a firing in their life. The study was carried out by the University of Manchester. They found being made redundant made people less willing to trust others (stock image shown). People still showed the effect years after losing their job. 'Trauma like redundancy can shift people’s outlook of the world,' said Dr James Laurence of the university . Study author Dr James Laurence, from the University of Manchester, said: ‘People’s willingness to trust others tends to remain largely stable over their lifetime. ‘However, this work shows that trauma like redundancy can shift people’s outlook of the world and this change persists long after the experience occurred. ‘Society is still recovering from one of the longest recessions this century and much has been discussed in counting the economic costs of that. ‘Even a single experience of redundancy can lead to depressed trust and what is particularly concerning is that people reported less willingness to trust others even after they got another job. No matter how good your CV, it's your voice that may actually help you land the job. Researchers found recruiters rated candidates as more competent, thoughtful and intelligent when they heard the pitch than when they read it - even when the words used were exactly the same. They also discovered evaluators who listened to trained actors reading job candidates' written pitches out loud believed those candidates were more intelligent and wanted to hire them more than the evaluators who read candidates' own written pitches. The new study by University of Chicago Booth School of Business Professor Nicholas Epley and PhD candidate Juliana Schroeder also found the addition of video did not influence evaluations beyond hearing the candidate's voice. ‘This has important implications not just for the person involved but for society as a whole as trust can have significant benefits, from health and happiness, to social cohesion, efficient democratic governance and economic development.’ The study, which was published in the journal Social Science Research, involved data from almost 7,000 British adults followed as part of the National Child Development Study of adults born in March 1958. Responses from 1991, when the individuals were 33, were compared with responses from 2008, when they were 50, noting whether they had experienced involuntary job loss from redundancy, downsizing or restructuring in the period in between. Their responses showed that at age 50, those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off. Among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work, the figure rose to seven per cent. To find out how long the effect of redundancy continues, the data was split into groups according to the age they were laid off: ages 33-41 (but not 41-50); 41-50 (but not 33-41) and both 33-41 and 41-50. Their responses showed that at age 50, those who had been made redundant were 4.5 per cent less likely to express trust in others than those who had not been laid off (stock image shown). Among those who said at the age of 33 that it was very important to be in work, the figure rose to seven per cent . ‘We observe that experiencing displacement within any age group has a significant negative effect on trust,’ said Dr Laurence. ‘Importantly, individuals who experienced displacement between the ages of 33-41 but not 41-50 are therefore also likely to report lower trust at age 50. ‘This is suggestive that the effect of displacement can persist at least nine years after the event occurred.’ He added: ‘The greater the attachment to employment, the stronger the negative effect of displacement. ‘A range of mediators, such as physical health, mental well-being, and personal efficacy, do not appear to account for the effect. ‘That the effect remains present at least nine years after the even occurred demonstrates the severity of displacement experiences.’","The study was carried out by the University of Manchester .

"Daniel Kirkwood was killed in a nightclub brawl in the early hours of this morning . An 18-year-old who was killed in a nightclub brawl in the early hours of this morning has been named as Daniel Kirkwood. Police launched a murder inquiry after the teenager was found fatally injured outside the Society nightclub in Tower Street, Coventry. Today, revellers at the scene were slammed for taking pictures as Mr Kirkwood lay dying and posting them on photo-sharing app Snapchat. Curtis Goodwin wrote on Twitter: 'Disgusting, someone was stabbed outside club in Coventry gasping for breath and all people cared about was snap-chatting'. Police and ambulance crews were called to the club in response to reports of a disturbance inside the venue at 2am. Mr Kirkwood was taken to hospital where he died soon after arrival. His family and friends took to social media to post tributes. His cousin Canice O'Neill posted a picture of Mr Kirkwood on Facebook and said: 'RIP to one of my favourite cousins, Daniel Kirkwood love you so much, missing you already, you are one of the most nicest people I have met, always caring for others, can't believe it.' She also blasted revellers who took pictures of Daniel as he lay dying. She wrote: 'This makes me sick. People have no respect.' Luke Strong, another of his cousins, tweeted: 'How someone can do something like that is beyond me. You will be missed by a lot of people, RIP to my cousin Daniel Kirkwood.' Alisha Docherty added: 'So disgusting what everything's coming to! Rest in peace Daniel Kirkwood.' Melissa Mulvey said: 'Really can't believe what has happened last night in town and what the world is coming to, R.I.P Daniel Kirkwood, you will be missed.' A witness, who says the nightclub regularly attracts trouble, said she saw the teenager collapse to the ground after being stabbed. Marie Smith, 52, was cleaning up after a party at the Royal Warwicks working men's club she manages over the road, when bar staff said there was a brawl outside. 'There was about ten of them and this lad suddenly just dropped to the ground,' she said. Scroll down for video . Police launched a murder enquiry after an 18-year-old was found fatally injured outside Society nightclub (pictured) in Coventry in the early hours of this morning . Revellers at the scene were slammed for taking pictures as Mr Kirkwood (pictured) lay dying in the street . 'There was another lad on the floor with him and it looked like they were fighting, but it quickly became apparent it was something serious and he was trying to help him.' After the victim had dropped to the ground, Ms Smith said she then saw a number of men jumped into cars and drive away as the crowd dispersed. Marie Smith, 52, who witnessed the brawl, said there is often trouble at the popular nightspot . 'There were two ambulances, two police vans and lots of police cars there straight away,' she said. 'The police have told us he was stabbed. 'There might have been scuffle inside and it spilled outside but we don't know. The brawl when he was stabbed was definitely outside the club.' Marie, who lives at the working men's club, said there is often trouble at the popular nightspot. She added: 'The place keeps changing its name and owners but there is always trouble there and the police are always going in and out. 'A few people were stabbed there two years ago. No-one died but I think someone was left disabled as a result of it.' The superclub had been hosting a rave night, promoted as #TekTimeCov, from 11pm until 4am, which featuring performances from several DJs. Revellers immediately took to Twitter to express their shock at the man's death, with some reporting a knife was used inside the club. Others questioned why clubbers were not thoroughly searched for weapons on arrival. One said: 'I can't even bear to imagine the pain of a mother losing her son, even so on Mother's Day. An awful memory.' Another added: 'I cant believe a boy died at a rave. My heart is aching for his mum. Finding out something like that on today of all days.' Tower Street is expected to remain closed for most of today while forensics experts scour the scene for evidence. The youngster, from Coventry, was found injured at 2am. He was taken to hospital but died soon after arrival . The superclub, which was hosting a rave from 11am until 4am, is located close to student accommodation . A West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Ambulance staff arrived to find a man in a critical condition. 'He subsequently suffered a cardiac arrest and ambulance staff began advanced life support which continued on the way to hospital. 'Unfortunately, shortly after the man's arrival at the hospital it became apparent nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed deceased.' A second man was treated for chest and back injuries whilst another suffered arm injuries. Two women were also injured in the incident, one suffering foot injuries and one suffering leg injuries. Four men have been arrested on suspicion of murder. A police spokesman said: 'The four men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are being held at separate police stations in Birmingham and Warwickshire.'

"A drinker from Idaho could be slapped with a $1,000 fine and a year in jail after allegedly calling 911 a dozen times about an overcharged bar tab that was actually correct. According to authorities, Phillip Poissonnier of Post Falls was given a ride home by police around 1am on Monday after being thrown out of Club Tequila when he was ten beers in. But instead of going to bed after getting dropped off, he reportedly made 12 emergency calls, the first wanting officers to come back to discuss his $30 bar tab. Scene of the incident: According to authorities, Phillip Poissonnier of Post Falls was given a ride home by police around 1am on Monday after being thrown out of Club Tequila when he was ten beers in . In the second call, at 1:47am, he asked when the officers would be at his home. And when he dialed 911 for a third and fourth time he merely let the phone ring before putting it down. Along with hanging up, Poissonnier put the phone  to the radio, with dispatchers listening to a total of three songs. The final time Poissonnier called police he apparently told responders that they were just like his ex-wife. The alleged prank-caller now faces fines that are likely to be much more.than the $30 check he was originally disputing. Recorded: But instead of going to bed after getting dropped off, he reportedly made 12 emergency calls, the first wanting officers to come back to discuss his $30 bar tab . And in fact, it appears he was kicking up a fuss for no reason. A Club Tequila bartender showed Possonnier's receipts to KXLY TV, which show he was correctly charged around $30 for the ten beers that he ordered. Commenting on the incident, Post Falls Police Captain, Pat Knight, said: '[He] really started to take away from other citizens in the city who really have an emergency. 'The consequences can be a $1,000 fine and year in jail, or both.' Police say Poissonnier faces a misdemeanor citation over misusing 911. The culprit couldn't be reached by The Associated Press on Tuesday.","Phillip Poissonnier of Post Falls, Idaho, was given a ride home by police around 1am on Monday after being thrown out of Club Tequila .

"Leaks by the US traitor Edward Snowden have ‘damaged’ intelligence agencies across the world and drained vital resources from MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, Theresa May warned last night. The Home Secretary made a scathing attack on the harm caused by the fugitive – who stole 1.7 million top-secret documents from America’s National Security Agency and GCHQ. The secret techniques revealed by the subsequent leaks to the Guardian newspaper have made it easier for terrorists, jihadis and organised criminals to avoid detection. Leaks by the US traitor Edward Snowden (pictured) have ‘damaged’ intelligence agencies across the world Theresa May has warned . Last night, it emerged vital safe houses had also been lost. Security officials have had to abandon buildings used to house top-secret sources for fear they have been compromised – at huge cost to the British taxpayer. In evidence to MPs, Home Secretary Mrs May said: ‘I assess and so does the director general of MI5 that the Snowden leaks did cause damage. ‘It has had an impact on the ability of our agencies to do the work they need to do. It would be fair to say it has had an impact not just on agencies in the UK. ‘If work has been done to try to mitigate the impact, that uses resources’. Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘It is clear to me the damage Snowden has done is monumental. ‘Not only has he jeopardised national security by his leaks, but he has also put people at risk and it is clear that he has also caused considerable financial loss.’ It came amid new revelations about the extent to which British extremists are attempting to travel to Syria to join Islamic State. Mrs May said that - in the few weeks since the law was changed – five suspected jihadis had been subjected to a new power allowing for the seizure of their passports. Police are now assessing whether the extremists can be charged with any criminal offences. Security officials say IS has seized on the Snowden leaks and has passed on information to its operatives – making it harder to track them down. The Home Secretary (pictured) made a scathing attack on the harm caused by the fugitive – who stole 1.7 million top-secret documents from America’s National Security Agency and GCHQ . Al Qaeda is also known to have pounced on the leaks. The terror group’s senior operatives have changed the way they communicate to avoid detection. They have also produced a video tape handed to extremists, passing on tips. The chilling seven-and-a-half minute video – which includes news footage of Snowden’s massive security breach – provides detailed graphics on how extremists can avoid being trapped by ‘FBI Secret Spying technology’ when communicating. It also claims to identify technology companies who are co-operating with the UK and other countries so they can be avoided. There is a list of software packages which can be used to try to thwart GCHQ and the intelligence agencies. At the same time, GCHQ has lost track of some of Britain’s most dangerous criminals because of the way the fugitive exposed its operations. Intelligence officials had to stop monitoring drug gangs, paedophiles, human traffickers and money launderers. Up to a quarter of crime gangs are believed to be going undetected, sources have said. In other cases, GCHQ has toned down or abandoned surveillance amid fears that the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to ‘go dark’ and fall off the radar completely. Among the gangs left able to operate unhindered was a drug-smuggling ring which had continued to bring Class A narcotics into Britain. Ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans said the Snowden revelations have left Britain less able to protect itself at a time when the terrorist threat from Islamist fanatics is surging. Former security minister Lord West said: ‘Since the revelations of the traitor Snowden, terrorist groups – in particular Isil (Islamic State) – have changed their methods of communications and shifted to other ways of talking to each other. ‘Consequently there are people dying who actually would now be alive.’ GCHQ has also warned that some companies had begun advertising internet products that were supposedly ‘Snowden compliant’. Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, tricked colleagues into giving him passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in US history. The defence contractor claims he had to act because the US and other Western government’s policies were a ‘threat to democracy’. He fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location . But last week, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee cleared GCHQ of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic. Devastatingly, it said the central claims made by the Guardian newspaper - that GCHQ had ‘blanket coverage’ of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages - were wrong. In reality, it said, GCHQ can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ‘tiny fraction’ of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process. The committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the ‘highest intelligence value’, and these amounted to several thousand a day.","Theresa May says Edward Snowden leaks have hit MI5 and MI6 resources .

"A volcano that erupted on the moon 3.5 billion years ago has been mapped in detail, showing it was much more explosive than thought. The research reveals that the eruption would have sent debris across an area the size of Scotland on the lunar surface. And the team are going to use their same technique to map the eruption of the largest known volcano in the solar system: Olympus Mons on Mars. Research led by Durham University studied a lunar volcanic eruption. The team found that the eruption was much bigger than was thought. It erupted 3.5 billion years ago (illustration of Earth from around this time with the moon shown) and covered a Scotland-sized area in debris. This was thanks to the low gravity of the moon . The findings were led by experts in the Institute for Computational Cosmology and Department of Earth Sciences at Durham University, UK. They found that the eruption threw rock five times further than the flow of rock and gas that buried the Roman city of Pompeii. Although the moon was already known to be volcanically active during this time, the size and scale of this particular eruption was surprising. Scientists believe there is a huge network of tunnels that exist beneath the lunar surface. The volcanic structures, known as 'lava tubes', have previously been proposed as sites for human colonies on the moon. Now a  study by Purdue University has claimed that tubes 0.6 miles (1km) in diameter could be stable enough to house permanent bases beneath the surface. Researchers believe that these lava tubes could help protect future astronauts against the challenges of the harsh lunar environment, which lacks a thick atmosphere. The volcano is located between two craters on the far side of the moon, Bel'kovich - which is 133 miles (214km) wide - and Compton - which is 101 miles (162km) wide. With the help of the moon's low gravity, debris from the eruption spread over an area of 27,000 square miles (70,000 square kilometres). Nasa's Lunar Prospector spacecraft first spotted the volcanic site in 1999 by detecting an isolated deposit of thorium - which is associated with volcanic activity. Since its discovery, the deposit had been hard to study because it is hidden beneath debris from meteorite impacts. But the Lunar Prospector was also able to detect gamma rays emitted by the thorium that can pass through up to 3.3 feet (one metre) of rock. Based on this information, the Durham-led team used a 'pixon' image enhancement technique, originally designed to peer into the distant universe, to sharpen the map and reveal the enormous size of the thorium deposit from the volcanic eruption. In this artist's impression, the red region is the volcanic complex, and measures 22 miles (35km) in diameter. The green area shows where debris from the eruption went, spreading 185 miles (300km) east . Nasa's Lunar Prospector spacecraft (illustrated) first spotted the volcanic site in 1999 by detecting an isolated deposit of thorium - which is associated with volcanic activity. The spacecraft was launched on 7 January 1998, and remained in operation until 31 July 1999 . This map of the Moon shows gamma-spectrometric data collected by Nasa's Lunar Prospector spacecraft, specifically thorium in surface rocks. On the left is the near side, and the right is the far side of the moon . Jack Wilson, a PhD student in Durham's Institute for Computational Cosmology, said he was surprised by the gigantic scale of the explosion. 'Volcanoes were common in the early life of the moon and in fact the dark ""seas"" you can observe on the lunar surface were created by runny, iron-rich, lava that flooded large areas, filling in impact craters and low-lying ground,' he said. 'Eruption of viscous, light-coloured, iron-poor, lava, which creates steep-sided volcanic cones, was rare and observed only at a handful of sites such as this one. 'The explosive eruption of such lava is unknown elsewhere on the moon, making this volcano unique. 'By mapping the radioactive content of the lava from this volcano we have been able to show that molten, radioactive rock was thrown far beyond the slopes of the volcano, reaching several hundred miles in one direction.' The research team is now planning to apply its mapping technique to the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars. Rather than the radioactive element thorium, the researchers will be looking for hydrogen and the possible remnants of water ice from glaciers on the high slopes of the red planet. The volcano (shown in red) is located between two craters on the far side of the moon, Bel'kovich - which is 133 miles (214km) wide - and Compton - which is 101 miles (162km) wide . Shown is a picture of the far side of the moon taken by the Apollo 16 astronauts in 1972, where the volcanic site of the huge eruption is located .","Research led by Durham University studied a lunar volcanic eruption .

"The Prime Minister led furious calls for any companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent to face the toughest consequences . Rogue data firms were warned by David Cameron last night that they could face serious penalties after the Mail exposed an astonishing trade in private information. The Prime Minister led furious calls for any companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent to face the toughest consequences. He suggested the law would be tightened if loopholes are being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers. His comments came as charities for the elderly, politicians and campaigners called for an urgent crackdown and said there should be lengthy jail sentences for the worst offenders. The Information Commissioner said data firms could face fines of £500,000 and warned that those breaking the law ‘are in deep trouble’. The Mail revealed yesterday how highly sensitive financial information about millions of pension holders is being sold for as little as 5p and ending up in the hands of criminals. The revelations come amid fears scammers are targeting the elderly and vulnerable ahead of George Osborne’s pension reforms, which come into force on Monday and will give savers the chance to access their full retirement pots. Data firms sold undercover reporters personal data for 15,000 people, including their salaries, the value of their investments and the size of their pensions. They did so without any attempt to verify that the reporters, who posed as a cold-calling firm, were a genuine company or to check how they planned to use the data. Last night, Mr Cameron said the revelations were ‘very worrying’. He told the Mail: ‘I’ve listened to the Information Commissioner who now has the powers and laws that he needs to chase after this stuff. But it’s extremely serious. 'We’ll always look at it and if more needs to be done we’ll do it, but my understanding from the briefing that I have had is that the legal position is pretty robust. Data theft, information theft, there are quite serious penalties.’ Nick Clegg said large scale data theft should carry a jail term. The Deputy Prime Minister said he had pushed for tougher sentences. ‘The average fine for data theft is about £100’, he said. ‘Even if it’s on an industrial scale.’ Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘It is nothing short of disgraceful that personal details of vulnerable and older people are being bought and sold in this way. This has got to stop and the Government needs to act.’ And Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: ‘Today’s revelations that personal data is being passed on to those looking to make a quick buck out of pensioners’ savings are shocking. How yesterday's Mail broke the story: Nick Sayer, a director of B2C Data, offered to sell details of 15,000 people to undercover reporters . 'Ministers have ignored warning after warning about the threats to savers from fraudsters, but they must now act quickly to protect savers.’ The Mail’s investigation into the sale of personal data prompted a wave of fury and concern from leading politicians, pensions experts, data experts and charities. Here is what they said: . David Cameron: ‘It’s extremely serious. We’ll always look at it and if more needs to be done we’ll do it, but.. data theft, information theft, there are quite serious penalties.’ Information Commissioner Christopher Graham: ‘What these companies appear to be failing to understand is that under the law you have rights over the use of your personal information. If they decide to treat it as their own product, to buy and sell without your permission, then there will be consequences.’ Andy Burnham, shadow health secretary: ‘It is nothing short of disgraceful that personal details of vulnerable and older people are being bought and sold in this way. This has got to stop.’ Ros Altmann, pensions expert: ‘It is utterly shocking and wrong. There now needs to be real change from the authorities. A zero tolerance policy for those who sell your private, personal or intimate details for their own profit and cause so much misery so carelessly and callously.’ Professor Sir Brian Jarman, NHS data expert: ‘People can get this confidential information and target those who are vulnerable. I’m very worried. The data is being used for one reason when it was given for another. There need to be harsh punishments.’ Lisa Harris, Saga spokeswoman: 'The findings of the Mail’s investigation are extremely worrying, and not just for the most vulnerable in society. Whilst many of us know not to give details over the phone, when the caller appears to have information about you that only you could have provided, it’s easy to see how people might think the call is genuine.’ Janet Morrison of charity Independent Age: ‘It is horrifying that older people are being deliberately targeted by those who have gained access to records on their pensions. They are clearly being seen as easy pickings.’ Nick Clegg: 'The average fine for data theft is about £100, even if it’s on an industrial scale. That’s why we wanted to introduce custodial sentences. Data theft is a big issue.’ The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has begun an inquiry as a result of the Mail investigation and is passing our evidence to police. Pensioners’ financial details appear to have been sold after being stolen, and as the result of firms keeping personal information when they should have deleted it. Information commissioner Christopher Graham said: ‘What these companies appear to be failing to understand is that under the law you have rights over the use of your personal information. If they decide to treat it as their own product, to buy and sell without your permission, then there will be consequences. 'This looks like a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act. If we establish it’s criminal activity by individuals, then they are in deep trouble.’ Pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann, an adviser to Mr Cameron, said: ‘It is utterly shocking and wrong. It seems this theft of our private and personal information is endemic in business today and needs to stop. ‘There now needs to be real change from the authorities. No more tolerance of such betrayals of trust –a zero tolerance policy for those who sell your private, personal or intimate details for their own profit and cause so much misery so carelessly and callously.’ Janet Morrison, chief executive of Independent Age, said: ‘It is horrifying that older people are being deliberately targeted by those who have gained access to records on their pensions. They are being targeted for their savings and pensions as well as by individuals specifically looking to exploit their vulnerabilities.’ Over-50s specialist firm Saga warned that the level of detail on sale about individuals made them more likely to fall victim to ‘despicable fraud’. Age UK said it was particularly troubled by the firm that offered the Mail’s team of ‘cold-callers’ undercover reporters £500 for every pensioner they could persuade to put £20,000 in high-risk investments. One of the firms named by the Mail, B2C Data Ltd, said it welcomes the ICO probe and will co-operate fully with any investigation. A spokesman accused the Mail of ‘numerous factual errors and exaggerations’. A statement added: ‘B2C Data Ltd is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office and is a member of the Direct Marketing Association. It operates an entirely legitimate and legally-compliant data business. ‘It complies with all its legal requirements. Importantly, it does not receive or process information other than in respect of those customers of its members who have opted in. Equally, it does not sell “highly sensitive details of... salaries, investments and pensions”. B2C Data takes its legal obligations very seriously and will continue to do so.’ By Katherine Faulkner Mail Investigations Editor . Controversial plans for a new NHS database face growing concerns following the Mail’s revelation that lists of people with medical problems are being touted for sale by unscrupulous data firms. Doctors have already expressed ‘grave doubts’ about the NHS plan – called care.data. Under the scheme, details from every patient’s GP medical file will be put on one huge database and shared with drug companies. Officials say the database will be kept secure and anonymous. But many doctors have expressed misgivings concerns about the project, with the NHS’s top data expert, Professor Sir Brian Jarman, saying last night he was still ‘very worried’ about it. Today the Mail reveals how lists of people with medical problems are being treated as potentially rich pickings for those looking to exploit the vulnerable. Those whose medical details had been sold on said that being on such a list meant they were constantly cold called – with some offered apparently unregulated treatments and medicines by unscrupulous firms. Critics are likely to feel that if such information was compiled on to one huge database, which was then shared with commercial companies such as drug manufacturers, the risk that it could be used by firms wanting to target the sick could be just too great. Sir Brian, a senior government health adviser, said: ‘This is the most confidential information you can have on patients. ‘Among these are very vulnerable people. That data should not be available.’ Many doctors already believe it would be impossible to ensure the detailed information on patients contained in their GP files – which often includes private and sensitive discussions between doctor and patient – would not identify them. Others have protested that the Government has a poor record on keeping peoples’ data secure and have criticised the move to opt all patients in to the scheme, without their explicit consent. Some analysts say they could identify individuals in under two hours from the information.","PM said companies selling personal data should face tough consequences .

"A transgender woman who believes she was unexpectedly the focus of a Planet Fitness policy controversy said that she has only used the gym’s female locker room on two occasions. Carlotta Sklodowska came forward today after Michigan mom Yvette Cormier made headlines for having her gym membership instantly revoked when she complained about a transgender woman using the female locker room. Sklodowska now claims that she believes she is the transgender woman Cormier saw and that she had only used the changing area on two separate visits to hang her purse and coat and to pick up her items after working out. Speaking out: Carlotta Sklodowska says she believes that she is the transgender woman Yvette Cormier saw in the Midland, Michigan, Planet Fitness . Working out: Sklodowska said she was only at the gym on two occasions when using a friend's guest pass. She said she only used the locker room to hang her purse and coat while working out . Cormier, 48, had complained to the Planet Fitness staff in Midland last Saturday when she noticed ‘there was a man’ in the changing room. The staff informed her that the person was transsexual and was allowed to be in the locker room, and when Cormier continued to complain, the gym canceled her membership for violating its ‘no judgement zone’ policy. Sklodowska told MLive that she’s not a member of the gym and was there using a friend’s guest pass. She added that she asked the gym staff about policy surrounding transgender individuals before she entered the locker room. ‘You can use the locker room that corresponds with how you are dressed,’ she said the staff member told her. Membership revoked: Yvette Cormier was kicked out of her gym in Midland, Michigan, after complaining about a transgender woman in the female locker room . 'I was stunned and shocked,' Cormier told WNEM about the incident. 'He looked like a man. He did not look like a woman.' Cormier maintains she wasn't complaining because the person was transsexual, but because she thought there was a man in the women's room. 'This is very unprofessional,' she said. 'This is very scary.' Sklodowska said she wore leggings and a baggy T-shirt on both gym trips. She added that she understood why Cormier would see her body structure as masculine, because many people tell her she looks like a man. She said she uses women’s public restrooms regularly but no one has had any issues previously, and that she’s the only transgender woman she knows of in Midland, a city with a population of about 40,000. Friends showed Sklodowska the news story about the locker room policy, and that's when she assumed the story was about her. Changing room: This is a photo from the locker room at the Planet Fitness in Midland, Michigan. Gym staff told Sklodowska to 'use the locker room that corresponds with how you are dressed'. She wore leggings and a baggy T-shirt on both gym trips . Kicked out: Yvette Cormier is no longer allowed to go to Planet Fitness Midland for violating their 'no judgement zone' policies . But she said she did not observe anyone in the locker room who looked distressed. Planet Fitness have not budged on the stance they took with Cormier. The gym says that Cormier has been talking about the incident with other people at the gym and she has been inappropriate. 'Planet Fitness is committed to creating a non-intimidating, welcoming environment for our members,' the gym said in a statement. 'Our gender identity non-discrimination policy states that members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity. Misconceptions: Sklodowska said she understands why  Cormier (pictured) believed see her body structure as masculine, because many people tell her she looks like a man . 'In expressing her concerns about the policy, the member in question exhibited behavior that club management deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members, which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was canceled.' Planet Fitness Director of Public Relations McCall Gosselin told ABC News that Cormier handled the situation poorly. 'As our statement outlines, her membership was not cancelled as a result of complaints about our policy, as we welcome all feedback from our members,' Gosselin told ABC. 'Rather, it was the manner in which her concerns were expressed that club management felt was inappropriate, which resulted in the cancellation.' Midland isn’t a very welcoming community for transgendered women, Sklodowska said, but she has found a supportive group of friends. ‘I have loads of friends around town,’ she told MLive. ‘They are all straight ladies. We have wonderful times together.’","Carlotta Sklodowska came forward after Yvette Cormier complained to staff at a Michigan gym when she noticed 'there was a man' in locker room .

"K9 Tragedy: Montville police say its K9 officer, Beny, died from injuries consistent with heat stroke, while in the back of a police vehicle in the parking lot of the police department on September 28 . An Ohio cop has been convicted of animal cruelty for letting his police dog roast to death in his patrol car last year. Sergeant Brett Harrison will not face any jail time. His only punishment: a $500 fine and court costs. The Montville Township officer outraged the community when he left his two-year-old German Shepard Beny in his squad car for four hours with the windows rolled up last September. The dog was found dead in his kennel in the car when Harrison returned. On Wednesday, Judge Dale M. Chase ruled that Harrison was guilty of one of two misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. Following Beny's death, Harrison publicly apologized and said he had left the car running with his air conditioning on. He said he didn't mean to leave the dog in a hot car. The temperature when the officer arrived on station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was found. An investigation concluded Harrison violated policy and procedures. The police department suspended him for two weeks without pay and docked him 40 hours of vacation. Montville Police welcomed K9 Officer Beny to the department in September 2013. Beny was trained in narcotics and patrol.  When Harrison returned to the cruiser after leaving him for four hours, he discovered the dog lying lifeless in the rear passenger compartment’s kennel . Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with him 40+ hours a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. He is said to be overwhelmed with grief . Harrison issued a statement expressing his 'deepest apology' to Montville Township and to his 'partner, friend and loving family member Beny.' 'This is a loss that words cannot describe, and it is very difficult for everyone involved,' said Chief Terry Grice. 'There is no doubt that this loss will have a lasting impact on Sgt. Harrison and our entire department.' A statement from the department also said that Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with the dog more than 40 hour a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. Sgt. Harrison was overwhelmed with grief and is taking this loss very hard, the chief added. Sgt. Harrison was found to have violated policy and procedures. He received a two-week unpaid suspension and a loss of 40 hours of vacation . Sgt. Brett Harrison didn’t leave the windows open and the cruiser was turned off; the temperature at the time Harrison arrived at the station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was discovered . Police say Sgt. Harrison has been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department in 2007 . Sgt. Harrison had been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department on Sept. 11, 2007. He came to the department after serving 10 years in the United States Air National Guard, where he was deployed to Qatar during Operation Enduring Freedom. Over the years, he has received awards and praise from law enforcement leaders for his dedication in getting weapons, drugs, and impaired drivers off the roads. The prosecutor for the SPCA of Medina County is reviewing the case to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against the officer. I want to start by expressing my deepest apology to Montville Township, the Trustees, the citizens, the police department, my fellow officers and to my partner, Beny. I'm sorry to bringing this upon everyone. I apologize to the trustees and police department for putting you all in this horrible position. I know that it is an unenviable position to have to deal with a situation as sad as this. I'm also sorry for the sadness and grief that you were put into. Most of all, I want to say I'm sorry to my partner, friend and loving family member Beny. I wish everyday that I could go back and change that day or that I could put myself in your place. You will always be in my heart and I will miss you every second of every day. I want you all to know that I will never forget any of this. Once again, I am sorry. Sincerely, .

"A police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife at their home in Northampton - just yards away from his force's headquarter. Police Constable Otis Goldsmith, 49, was taken into custody yesterday afternoon on suspicion of murdering his wife Jill, also 49. She and PC Goldsmith were married in May last year and lived together at his £140,000 semi-detached property, less than a mile from Northamptonshire Police's HQ at Wootton Hall. Otis Goldsmith, 49 (pictured left receiving a Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal), who has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife Jill, 49 (right) The father-of-three (left), a police constable with Northamptonshire Police, had only married Jill last year . Today, PC Goldsmith's elderly mother Sylvia and father Michael, both 81, who live in nearby Rushden, Northamptonshire, expressed their distress at their son's arrest. Mrs Goldsmith said: 'We don't know any details about what happened but Otis has been arrested. 'He and Jill only married last year. This is a very difficult time for us all.' PC Goldsmith has three sons from a previous marriage, twins aged 17 and another aged 20. His wife, a former domestic cleaner, is believed to have had a 22-year-old son from a previous marriage. The officer's ex-wife Catherine Goldsmith, 52, the mother to his children, also confirmed he had been arrested on suspicion of murder. When asked if she was aware her ex-husband had been arrested on suspicion of murder, Mrs Goldsmith, who lives in Northampton, said: 'Yes.' Police are expected to ask for more time to question PC Goldsmith over the alleged murder . She added: 'I've been told by the police to tell people who call me to please contact the police.' Detectives are expected to ask for more time to question PC Goldsmith, while they await the results of a post mortem examination, which was carried out this afternoon, to confirm the cause of Mrs Goldsmith’s death. Officers were called to the property in Wootton Hall Park shortly after 1pm yesterday where the arrest was made. The officer, who has served with the force for 28 years, was said to be off-duty at the time of the alleged offence. Northamptonshire Police said PC Goldsmith had served as a detective constable in CID for a number of years before moving back to being a PC. There is no difference in rank. Speaking outside the officer's house today, Superintendent Christopher Hillery said: 'I would like to offer mine and Northamptonshire Police's condolences to the family and friends of the victim of this incident. 'We were called to a private address at Wootton Hill Park just after 1pm yesterday and arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of murder. 'I can now confirm the man arrested is Police Constable Otis Goldsmith, an off-duty officer from Northamptonshire Police.' He added: 'Otis Goldsmith has served with Northamptonshire Police for more than 28 years. 'What has happened has understandably shocked and upset many people in the local community, and again I would like to offer our sincere condolences to all those affected.' The road of about 30 semi-detached houses is on the same site as Northamptonshire Police HQ Wootton Hall. They were formerly owned by Northamptonshire Police before being sold off privately and many were bought by serving and retired officers. The 49-year-old was taken into custody yesterday afternoon at his home (pictured) and is now being questioned by detectives . This aerial images shows the proximity of the detective's house (right) compared to the police headquarters (left) Today, the house was cordoned off, with a police officer on guard. A black Renault Espace people carrier was also cordoned off on the green outside the house, where the downstairs curtains were drawn. Neighbours of PC Goldsmith  described him as 'a really good guy' who had lived on the street for at least 15 years. PC Goldsmith was presented with the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal in May 2009. He was pictured with Sir John Robinson, Vice Lord Lieutenant for Northamptonshire, who presented him with the award at the police HQ in Northampton. Resident Gary McBain, 58, said: 'Otis is a good guy. I have been here since 1999 and they had been living here for a while then. 'We know him quite well, as do the whole street. All the children used to play outside on the green when they were growing up. So it is a close community. 'Otis has been in the police force for at least 20 years. I am not sure who has died or what has happened exactly. 'But Otis is a really good guy. Everyone on this street will tell you that.' He added: 'He has several children from several marriages. He has a few children. Today, a black people carrier was cordoned off outside the property where PC Goldsmith lives . Today, the house was cordoned off, with a police officer on guard. Curtains at the downstairs window were also drawn . 'This is a highly sensitive area. People here generally know each other. 'These houses were sold and most of the people living in them now are either retired or serving police officers.' A retired officer, who lives nearby, said: 'It happened at lunchtime. We have been advised not to talk about it.' They added: 'It must have been lunchtime when they cordoned it all off. 'I didn't hear anything but saw them out of the window. We are used to seeing police cars on this road so it isn't unusual but I knew it was serious when there was a cordon. 'The incident happened at number 11 and I understand the officer arrested was Mr Goldsmith.' Another neighbour added: 'He is known as Otis, but I think his first name is Adrian. 'He's been in the force a long time and is close to retirement. All I will say about him is that he is a good guy.' Meanwhile, shocked neighbours who lived next door to Jill for 12 years at her previous address in Northampton described her as a 'lovely and friendly' woman. The couple said Jill had one child from a previous relationship, a grown up son in his 20s, named Charlie. The Northamptonshire Police headquarters in Wootton Hall. The investigation will not involve officers from this force . The male neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'She was a cleaner but she had stopped working just before she sold the house. 'She moved about 18 months to the police house. I understand Otis had worked with the police a very long time. 'She had been seeing him for perhaps a year before she moved. He never lived there but would stop overnight once or twice a week. 'So they must have been living together in Wootton Hall Park for nearly two years now.' His wife added: 'Jill was a lovely woman. She was really lovely. She was very friendly as well. 'I am shocked. It is terrible news. She was so nice. She congratulated us when we got married. 'I think Otis had four or five children. I know she had a son called Charlie. It's an absolute tragedy. 'This should have been their honeymoon period. It's desperately sad news.' During his career with the force, PC Goldsmith has been vocal in his fight against street robberies. In June 2003 he led a campaign in Northampton urging people to keep an eye on their possessions during the summer months. Speaking at the time, he told the BBC: 'I would like to reassure people that we have taken a number of measures such as increasing patrols in a bid to deal with this, but I would ask people to think about their own personal safety and be streetwise. 'The fear of crime is often much greater than any risk of becoming a victim, but it is a good opportunity for us to remind people of the need to be sensible and take care of themselves and their property.' The force said the murder investigation will not include anyone from Northamptonshire Police and will instead be led by an East Midlands Special Operations Unit, headed by Detective Superintendent Kate Meynell. The case has already been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Detective Superintendent Kate Meynell, who is heading up the investigation, said: 'A full and proper investigation is taking place. Northamptonshire Police will not be making any further comment on this investigation at this stage.' Anyone with any information can call Northamptonshire Police on 101.

But the presenter, wearing a brown blazer and white shirt, said: 'I'm going for lunch with a friend' The presenter, wearing a brown blazer and white shirt, said: 'I'm going for lunch with a friend.' Ken MacQuarrie, the senior BBC executive tasked with sorting out what is becoming an increasing embarrassment for the corporation, is believed to be in London and starting work today. But sources close to the investigation say it is impossible to put a deadline on its work until it hears from the two men central to the inquiry - Clarkson and producer Oisin Tymon. As he prepares for a quizzing which could result in him being sacked, he is apparently being supported by a woman once rumoured to be his mistress. Blonde events organiser Phillipa Sage was photographed driving away from his flat in Holland Park, west London, yesterday afternoon, and returned a few hours later. Clarkson was accused of having an affair with her in 2011, and was pictured kissing her on holiday in Greece in 2013. He was suspended by the BBC last week after allegedly shouting at Top Gear producer Mr Tymon. One report claims he split his junior colleague's lip with a punch. Mr Tymon, 36, has received online threats from Top Gear fans, who blame him for Clarkson's suspension and the show's temporary cancellation. Sources close to the producer's legal team said he feared the incident could end his BBC career. 'He loves working on Top Gear and has never had an issue before this incident, which came out of the blue,' an insider told the Sunday Mirror. Top Gear viewers could learn the outcome of the Corporation's investigation as early as this week. A BBC source said yesterday: 'People will not have long to wait.' The internal review, headed by BBC Scotland boss MacQuarrie, will focus on the apparent bust-up at the Simonstone Hall hotel in North Yorkshire on March 4.

Clarkson was accused of having an affair with Ms Sage in 2011 and is apparently being supported by the woman once rumoured to be his mistress . 'Self-destructing': The Top Gear presenter was pictured kissing Ms Sage on holiday in Greece in 2013 . Clarkson is said to deny punching Mr Tymon but admits there was 'handbags and pushing' after he arrived late at night and was told no hot food was available. A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC's position is the one we set out in a statement last week. We have an investigation led by Ken MacQuarrie to establish the facts and people should wait for the outcome of that.' Clarkson is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected early this week. BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC, runs the annual global tours which pull in around £10million a year. Around 30,000 tickets ranging from between £38 to £104 have already been sold, and Clarkson fans have been desperate to know whether he will be appearing. The controversial presenter has appeared at every Top Gear Live event the BBC has run, while co presenters James May and Richard Hammond only appear at some shows. BBC worldwide said all forthcoming shows are set to run as scheduled - but would not be drawn on whether Clarkson would definitely appear. All three men's contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs, which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant. A source close to Clarkson told the Mail on Sunday he had not drunk anything because he had to work on a script that evening. But there are wider concerns among BBC management about his recent conduct. A senior TV source who has worked with Clarkson told the Daily Mail: 'The real story is his erratic behaviour – it features a lot with Clarkson. 'The production team has been aware of this but how much can they do about it?' Separately a senior BBC executive compared Clarkson's supporters – including David Cameron – to those who covered up for late paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile . 'The pressure this guy [Mr Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,' he told the Mail on Sunday. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC last week after allegedly shouting at Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) Referring to Clarkson's split from his wife last year, the unnamed executive added: 'It is common knowledge he has personal issues: we have all read about them. 'If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down – or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change.' Responding to the executive's comments, spokesman for the Corporation said: 'The BBC's position is the one we set out in a statement last week. 'We have an investigation led by Ken MacQuarrie to establish the facts and people should wait for the outcome.' Supporters of Clarkson pointed out that he has experienced a torrid 12 months. His marriage of 21 years ended, his mother died and he has suffered health problems. Journalist and close friend AA Gill yesterday said the Top Gear host felt he was 'working for the enemy' at the BBC. Mr Gill accused BBC director of television Danny Cohen of targeting Clarkson for not fitting into his 'inclusive, positive, left-of-centre perspective on the world'.","Clarkson's personal life unpredictable before his 'fracas', it was claimed .

"Nigel Farage has said he will stand down as Ukip leader if he fails to win the South Thanet seat from the Conservatives. The 50-year-old politician admitted it would be ‘curtains for me’ - despite only being elected as Ukip leader for a further four-year term in November. Polls suggest Mr Farage is on course for victory in the crucial Kent seat - but he will have to overturn a Conservative majority of nearly 17 per cent. Scroll down for video . 'Significant' consequences: Nigel Farage said it would be ‘curtains for me’ if he fails to win the South Thanet seat - despite only being elected as Ukip leader for a further four-year term in November . Failing to secure the seat would have ‘significant’ consequences for both him and his party, he wrote in The Purple Revolution, serialised in The Daily Telegraph. He said: ‘The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the Commons would be significant for both myself and the party. ‘It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat.’ Mr Farage stated he felt it would risk the party’s 'credibility' if it had other MPs elected but its leader did not have a seat in Parliament. He said: ‘What credibility would Ukip have in the Commons if others had to enunciate party policy in Parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest?

Separately last night, it emerged that Mr Farage had suggested that children of new immigrants coming to Britain should not immediately be allowed to attend state schools. He said Ukip policy was that immigrants and their dependents would need private education for five years after entering the UK. Mr Farage told The Guardian: ‘I wouldn’t foresee people coming into Britain immediately being allowed to bring children to go through the state system.’","Only elected as Ukip leader for further four-year term in November .

"At a quick glance they could pass for identical twins. So it is no wonder retired priest Neil Richardson was greeted with waves and 'hello John' greetings when he moved to Braintree, Essex, 18 months ago. For residents quickly mistook him to be 74-year-old John Jemison, a former head teacher who is well-known in the town. The pair had in fact never met up until a few days ago, leaving Mr Richardson, 69, confused as to why people constantly confused him with Mr Jemison. Neil Richardson, 69 (right), was constantly mistaken for John Jemison, 74 (left), when he moved to Braintree, Essex, 18 months ago and had no idea why - until the pair met recently and realised they are almost identical . Mr Richardson, a former priest (right), was greeted with waves and 'hello John' greetings as he went about his business in the Essex town. He had no idea why until realising people thought he was ex-teacher Mr Jemison . The pair (above) met by chance during a coach trip to London earlier this month and have now met up several times. They have even introduced their wives to one another and claim to have formed quite a friendship . However, upon meeting, the pair quickly realised why others had mistaken them for one another – since they look almost identical. The pair, who are both grandfathers-of-four, also realised that despite being doppelgangers, they also had an awful lot in common - having both attended the same college, both becoming RE teachers and enjoying singing in choirs. They also both enjoy singing, writing poetry and have a keen interest in amateur dramatics. And now they live just 150 yards from each other. Mr Richardson, who worked as an RE teacher before becoming the rector of Greenford Magna in Middlesex in 1982, said he was originally left stunned when he moved to the small town in September 2013 and everyone appeared to recgonise him. He said: 'Complete strangers were coming up to me and saying hello. 'On one occasion, in the Quadrant Cafe, someone actually came up to my table and said: ""You are John Jemison, aren't you?"" 'The manager was quite sure I was John. A couple of weeks ago, I asked if I could have a word with him after he greeted me with the words, ""Hello John"". He wouldn't believe that I wasn't John. I had to show him my driving licence. 'It made me very interested to meet this man, who I thought must be rather good-looking!' The pair finally came face-to-face last week when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a Friends of Braintree Museum visit to the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library. Mr Jemison said: 'I didn't instantly notice our resemblance but as I boarded the bus, Neil greeted me with ""Are you John Jemison?"" Neil Richardson married his wife in 1968 (left) while Mr Jemison also married wife Jenny in the sixties (right) Since meeting, Mr Richardson (left) and Mr Jemison (right) have realised they have an awful lot in common and have had a similar life. They both went to the same college in Chelsea and both trained to be RE teachers . 'I was distracted with the thought: ""Oh dear, it's someone else who wants me to do something."" 'My wife, however, did a double-take and we began to look forward to the opportunity to meet at the end of our journey. 'It was quite spooky the day we met.' Mr Jemison, who has two children - Elizabeth, 50, and John, 48 - as well as four grandchildren - Megan, 25, Joanna, 23, Sarah, 21, and Bethany, 21, said he just 'couldn't believe it' when Mr Richardson explained it all to him. He said: 'I've really been struck by all the coincidences as we do have so much in common - yet we have never met before. 'My only worry is the number of people who probably think I've been ignoring them when they've been saying 'Hello John' to Neil all this time.' Mr Richardson said they 'hit it off immediately'. He added, jokingly: 'We're thinking of a life of crime. 'If one of us stays at home and the other robs a bank then we will always have an alibi.' Asked if she could tell them apart, Mr Richardson’s wife Marion, 70, said: 'I certainly can - after 47 years together you don't make that mistake. 'People have asked if me and Jenny look alike - I don't think we do but I guess we must share a similar taste in men. 'I just think it is lovely that they have met like this.' As well as looking alike, the two men have lived very similar lives. They both studied at the College of St Mark and St John in Chelsea in the sixties, but never met. Mr Jemison (pictured with his wife Jenny and granddaughters) had no idea Mr Richardson was getting mistaken for him in their hometown until he bumped into his look-a-like during a coach trip to London . Mr Richardson (pictured left aged three, and right as a schoolboy) said the pair have become good friends. He said: 'We realised that we agreed on almost everything, from politics, to our theological views on the church' And they both went on to become RE teachers, with Mr Jemison teaching at Braintree's Alec Hunter and John Bunyan schools, before becoming head of Silver End Primary school, while Mr Richardson became a priest. The pair also both married their sweethearts in the sixties, soon after meeting them, and they both enjoy singing in choirs. When they met for lunch last week, they realised they even had accounts with the same bank. Mr Richardson said: 'There was an astounding moment when we put our cards on the desk to pay and we could almost have said ""snap""! 'When we finally met we immediately felt comfortable with each other and found we had so much in common. 'Other people say we're like twins. I can see the likenesses, but he's slightly taller, and I'm slightly fatter.' 'We had lunch together on Friday and realised that we agreed on almost everything, from politics, to our theological views on the church, education and what we think about Mr Gove, and the fact that we both write poetry.' The men are now firm friends and have enjoyed several lunches together, introducing their wives to one another.","Neil Richardson couldn't understand why people always recognised him .

"An American pilot who clearly had time on his hands may have produced the lewdest image ever using GPS flight data. The pilot was behind the controls of a single-engine plane when he ‘drew’ a naughty image on a flight path over central Florida last night. Screen grabs of the rude flight path have gone viral on the internet after they were shared by flight-tracking website Flightradar24. The pilot of a small plane 'drew' a lewd image in the air over central Florida using GPS flight data . It appeared to be a routine flight when the Van’s RV-12 plane departed Kissimmee, Florida shortly before 6:45pm local time. The two-seater flew south-west towards Lakeland when it suddenly made a sharp turn towards the north and began to ‘draw’ the lewd image. It continued on at an altitude of 1,800ft and then flew north-west towards the Gulf of Mexico before turning around and heading back to Kissimmee Gateway Airport, south of Orlando. The single-engine plane appeared to ‘draw’ another lewd image shortly before it flew over Walt Disney World and landed in Kissimmee at about 9pm local time, according to Flightradar24, which provides real-time positioning and information for thousands of aircraft around the world.

The plane which flew the 50-mile path is registered to B&M Aviation LLC in Orlando, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s online database. It’s certainly not the first time GPS data has been used to ‘draw’ a lewd image, with many runners using their smartphone apps to create childish outlines. But it has been put to better use. Last year, artist Yasushi Takahashi left his job and travelled across Japan for six months to create a romantic marriage proposal. He spelled out ‘Marry me’ and an image of a heart with an arrow through it while covering a distance of more than 4,300 miles, mostly on foot. His effort was well worth it, as his girlfriend said yes to his proposal.","Pilot created the naughty image while flying a single-engine plane .

"Former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez can be seen on surveillance video walking through his home with a gun less than 10 minutes after prosecutors say he killed a man, according to testimony Wednesday by an employee of firearms manufacturer Glock. It was the most conclusive testimony to date in the monthlong trial that puts a weapon in Hernandez's hand around the time of the slaying. Hernandez is charged with murder in the killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd was shot to death early on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleborough, sending his last text message at 3:23am, and two witnesses have testified they heard loud bangs around that time. The murder weapon has never been found. Scroll down for video . Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez sits in court during his trial . Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez is seen in footage from his home security system . A  handgun is shown during the murder trial for former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez . Kyle Aspinwall, a former New Hampshire police chief who now works for Glock, began his testimony Wednesday by showing jurors a Glock 21. The semiautomatic handgun uses .45-caliber bullets, and prosecutors have argued that based on ballistics evidence, a Glock 21 was the murder weapon. As Aspinwall testified, prosecutor Patrick Bomberg played clips of video recorded by Hernandez's extensive home surveillance system June 17, as well as still photos taken from the videos. At several points in the video, Hernandez can be seen carrying a black object in his hand, an object his defense team has said could have been a TV remote or another electronic device. But Aspinwall said his opinion was based on various characteristics of the weapon, including the curvature of back strap, the magazine well and trigger guard. 'In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol,' he said. The earliest clip played Wednesday was taken at around 12:45am before Hernandez leaves the house with co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace in a rental car. Prosecutors have said the three picked up Lloyd in Boston, then drove him back to North Attleborough. Ortiz and Wallace are also charged with murder and have pleaded not guilty. They will be tried at a later date.

Prosecutor Patrick Bomberg, left, questions Kyle Aspinwall, an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock . Aspinwall testified that in the 12:45am clip, Hernandez can be seen switching a pistol from his right hand to his left as he walks through the living room. Later, after Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace return to the home at around 3:30am, Hernandez can be seen outside the door to his basement as he faces the camera a few feet away while holding the object in front of him. 'This is a picture of the defendant holding what appears to be a handgun in his left hand in a reverse grip,' Aspinwall said. At various points in his testimony, Aspinwall stood and used his Glock to demonstrate how Hernandez was holding the weapon. At around 2:30pm, less than 12 hours after the killing, other video shows Hernandez and Wallace hanging out by the pool before Hernandez gets a black object out of the rental car. Aspinwall testified that the object appears to be the magazine of a gun.","Aaron Hernandez can be seen on surveillance video walking through his home with a gun less than 10 minutes after prosecutors say he killed a man .

"The BBC faced a deluge of complaints from listeners over its bizarre online coverage of a fictional flood disaster in The Archers. The Radio 4 drama's village of Ambridge, based in the fictional West Midlands county of Borsetshire, was flooded in the latest sensational storyline. Accompanying the show were live minute-by-minute updates of the floods on the BBC website, including weather forecasts and 'breaking news' headlines - but listeners said the graphics were 'insulting'. The BBC faced a deluge of complaints from listeners over its bizarre online coverage of a fictional flood disaster in The Archers, which included maps and graphics on the corporation's website . A fake BBC weather forecast showed rain falling on the fictional village of Ambridge, near Birmingham . This week's episodes of The Archers have followed events taking place over one day of severe rainfall in Ambridge, with the drama building throughout the day as the River Am burst its banks. The BBC put out fake tweets and warnings from the Environment Agency, as farmland around the fictional village became inundated with water - mirroring the flooding of the Somerset Levels this time last year. The rolling coverage included maps and graphics to help listeners understand what was happening, but some listeners said visual aids 'insulted their intelligence'. Some listeners added that they could not understand what was going on because of the loud background noise of rainfall and heavy winds. Echoing the floods in Somerset last year, the BBC live coverage reported farmers rapidly trying to protect their land and even linked to a real-life account of floods in Worcester. Under a 'breaking news' headline, the online update said a character on the programme was given CPR. A realistic weather forecast also appeared on the minute-by-minute internet coverage, but listeners said it insulted their intelligence . The BBC put out fake tweets and warnings from the Environment Agency, as farmland around Ambridge became inundated with water . In other developments on the Radio 4 drama, 16-year-old character Phoebe Aldridge went missing but was later found, and Rob Titchener was injured as he saved three people from flooded stables. The rolling updates on the BBC website included a video  forecast by Midlands Today weather presenter Rebecca Wood, who warned people to be wary of floodwater and severe winds. Many listeners were unimpressed by the programme's online coverage, with some taking to forums to brand it 'insulting' and confusing. One fan wrote: 'It would 'help' me to feel I was regarded as an adult who knows this is all fantasy, that the residents of Ambridge do not exist, that they are not actually glugging about in the Am's excess water, rather than be told at the end of the episode that tweets and blogs about the flood from Ambridge residents can be read/heard. 'Cannot stand this cross over between fiction and reality, the fiction should be strong enough to stand in its own right and not need these add-on insults to intelligence.' The programme's storyline mirrored the reality of the flooding of the Somerset Levels (pictured) last year . Echoing the floods in Somerset last year, the BBC live coverage reported farmers rapidly trying to protect their land and even linked to a real-life account of floods in Worcester . Another wrote: 'A friend of mine, a loyal and forgiving listener, told me that when she saw on the Archers Home Page a 'weather forecast' for Ambridge that looks exactly like the real ones that appear on the BBC news pages, she felt really cross, felt that her intelligence was being insulted. 'She loves the fictional programme but knows its not real life and is angry that the programme makers think she is stupid enough to want this sort of nonsense.' Other complaints focused on the storyline being too confusing and background noise being too loud. 'You can't do this on the radio. Just shouting into the mic does not make it a dramatic and gripping storyline. No idea where anyone was half the time, whether they were driving, wading or climbing up the wall,' one listener wrote. A spokesman for The Archers said: 'The flood storyline has been building for some time. 'The Archers has a long tradition of reflecting the agricultural world and the current storyline, which fans will know has been building for over a year, mirrors what farmers across the country experienced in recent floods. 'When developing the script, the writers spoke to real-life farmers and it is their experiences that inspired this week’s events in Ambridge. 'This is the first time we have done live blogging and it has been amazing to see audiences engage with us and experience this week’s events as if they too were residents of Ambridge.'","Listeners complain over BBC's online coverage of floods in The Archers .

"Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the party could delay HS2 going any further than Birmingham in favour of a new East-West line . Labour has been accused of delivering a 'slap in the face to the north' after suggesting it could abandon a new high speed rail line to Manchester and Leeds. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the party could delay HS2 going any further than Birmingham in favour of a new East-West line. David Cameron said Labour was 'letting down people in vital regions of our country'. But Mr Balls said prioritising the second phase of HS2 – which would connect Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds – made 'no business or economic sense at all'. Mr Balls said: 'Getting on and doing east-west now is the priority.' Labour had previously backed HS2, which could cost more than £50 billion, even though Mr Balls was known to have doubts about it. Mr Balls was speaking after a cross-party House of Lords inquiry warned that the Government had failed to 'make a convincing case' for the high speed rail line and concluded that improving east-west rail links might do more good for the economy. Labour will press ahead with plans to build a new line between London and Birmingham, with work due to begin in 2017. But it will reconsider the second phase of the project, which extends the line from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester and was due to begin construction in the mid 2020s. Instead, Mr Balls said Labour would bring bring forward plans similar to the so-called HS3, a proposed new line linking the North East and North West. He said: 'I will want to be discussing how we can improve east-west links with David Higgins from day one and I think that is something we get on with quickly while we ask big questions about the second phase of HS2.' He added: 'The idea that we wait to do east-west until after we have done the second phase of north-south is topsy turvy. It has no economic or business logic at all.' Labour had previously backed HS2, which could cost more than £50 billion, connecting London to Manchester and Leeds via Birmingham . Chancellor George Osborne also supports HS3 but construction is unlikely to begin until after HS2 is completed in 2033. Mr Balls said: 'I don't understand this proposal for HS3. Why would you decide to spend 20 years improving north-south links before, finally, in the third phase, coming to east-west? 'I think George Osborne has got this wrong. 'And our view is that it shouldn't be HS3 - it should be done before the second phase of HS2. 'I think getting on and doing east-west now is the priority.' The Shadow Chancellor said services would connect the north east and north west, but also suggested a line could also link Birmingham and Nottingham. 'There is actually a big economic need to link east-west, and I'm thinking about Nottingham, Birmingham, Newcastle as being part of that east-west network as well. 'The idea that improving links between Birmingham, Nottingham, Leeds and Newcastle, that that should wait until after we have done HS2, I don't think makes sense.' David Cameron, at a production line for London taxis in Coventry, said Labour was 'letting down people in vital regions of our country' Responding to Mr Balls's comment, the Prime Minister said: 'The economic argument is very simple which is we need another railway line between London and Birmingham and up to the North of the country. 'So do you build an old-fashioned Victorian line or do you build a high speed line, and our decision was to go with the modern technology and build a high speed line. 'And I would say to anyone who says there isn't a case for HS2, try getting on the train from Birmingham to London or London to Birmingham and see how many people are standing, see how much extra capacity we need. So the case is very strong and has been proven over and over again. 'But the very worrying news today is that Labour are calling into question the links between Birmingham and Manchester and Birmingham and Leeds, and this would be an immense slap in the face from Labour to the West Midlands, the East Midlands and the North of the country and I cannot believe they are contemplating letting down British people in vital regions of our country in this way.'","The PM said Labour is 'letting down people in vital regions of the country'

"Yemen's embattled president has fled the country by sea after Houthi rebels advanced on the southern port city where he was taking refuge, captured his defence minister and seized the airport. Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was initially smuggled out of Aden just hours after the Shiite rebels' own TV station declared the capture of nearby strategic airbase and arrested the country's defence minister. The air base is only 35 miles from Aden, where Hadi had established a temporary capital since fleeing Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa last month. U.S. and European troops were also based there while advising the government on how to tackle Al Qaeda militants in the country. Just hours after Hadi fled, the rebels who offered a $100,000 bounty for his capture carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting the presidential security forces guarding the palace. On the run: Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was smuggled out the southern port city Aden just hours after the Shiite rebels advanced and has since escaped from Yemen by sea . Coffins: Houthi Shiite mourners attend this morning's funeral procession of victims who were killed from a triple suicide bombing attack on mosques in Sanaa last week . Tribute: Yemeni mourners stand on a trailer loaded with coffins of the victims of last week's multiple suicide bombings that targeted Shiite Houthi mosques in Sanaa . The advance of the Shiite rebels, empowered by the backing of the ousted Yemeni autocrat Ali Abdullah Saleh and his loyalists, threatens to plunge the Arab world's poorest country into a civil war that could draw in its Gulf neighbors. Already, Hadi has asked the UN to authorize a foreign military intervention in the country. The takeover of Aden, the country's economic hub, would mark the collapse of what is left of Hadi's grip on power. It would also open a new chapter in the Houthi-Saleh alliance and possibly pave the way for more infighting. Aden was tense this morning, with schools, government offices, shops and restaurants largely closed. Inside the few remaining opened cafes, men watched news of the assault on television. Since the morning, there were conflicting reports on Hadi's whereabouts. Witnesses said they saw a convoy of presidential vehicles leaving Hadi's palace on top of a hill overlooking the Arabian Sea. A second convoy was seen heading to the Aden airport, where flights have been halted amid the Houthi advance. Military officials said militias and military units loyal to Hadi had 'fragmented,' speeding the rebel advance. They said the rebels were fighting Hadi's troops on five different fronts Wednesday. Support: A Yemeni mourner gives the thumbs up as he sits on a trailer loaded with coffins . Solumn: Yemeni mourners stand on a trailer loaded with coffins of the victims of last week's multiple suicide bombings that targeted Shiite Houthi mosques in Sanaa . Response: Gun-wielding Yemeni mourners stand on a trailer loaded with coffins earlier this morning . Presidential officials insist Hadi is in an operations room overseeing his forces' response. They declined to say where that facility was located. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Yemen's state TV, now controlled by the Houthis, this morning made an offer of nearly $100,000 for Hadi's capture. That announcement came after Defense Minister Major General Mahmoud al-Subaihi and his top aides were arrested in the southern city of Lahj - where fighting with Houthi forces is ongoing - and were subsequently transferred to Sanaa. Later, the rebels and Saleh's loyalists carried out three airstrikes targeting the Aden palace presidential compound and Hadi's forces positioned there, officials said. No casualties were reported in the strikes, similar to ones carried out last week. Speaking this morning, Yemen's Foreign Minister Riad Yassin told Dubai-based Al-Arabiya TV satellite news network that he officially made a request to the Arab League to send a military force to intervene against the Houthis. Yassin will be attending the Arab Summit due to take place in Egypt at the end of the week.

A Yemeni protester flashes the victory sign in front of burning tires during an anti-Houthi protest yesterday . The airstrikes were an attempt to 'assassinate' Hadi, Yassin said in another interview with the Doha-based Al-Jazeera TV network. Depicting the Houthis as a proxy of Shiite Iran, a rival to Sunni Gulf countries, Yassin warned of an Iranian 'takeover' of Yemen. The Houthis deny they are backed by Iran. Mohammed Abdel-Salam, a spokesman for the Houthis, said their forces were not aiming to 'occupy' the south. 'They will be in Aden in few hours,' Abdel-Salam told the rebels' satellite Al-Masirah news channel. Earlier, Al-Masirah reported that the Houthis and allied fighters had 'secured' the al-Annad air base, the country's largest. It claimed the base had been looted by both Al Qaeda fighters and troops loyal to Hadi. The reported Houthi takeover of the base came after hours-long clashes between rival forces around the base. The U.S. recently evacuated some 100 soldiers, including Special Forces commandos, from the base after Al Qaeda briefly seized a nearby city. Britain also evacuated soldiers. The base was crucial in the U.S. drone campaign against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which Washington considers to be the most dangerous offshoot of the terror group. And American and European military advisers there also assisted Hadi's government in its fight against Al Qaeda's branch, which holds territory in eastern Yemen and has claimed the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

Anti-Houthi protesters run as police officers open fire to disperse them in Taiz yesterday afternoon . U.S. operations against the militants have been scaled back dramatically amid Yemen's chaos. U.S. officials have said CIA drone strikes will continue in the country, though there will be fewer of them. The agency's ability to collect intelligence on the ground in Yemen, while not completely gone, is also much diminished. The Houthis, in the aftermath of massive suicide bombings in Sanaa last week that killed at least 137 people, ordered a general mobilization and their leader, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, vowed to send his forces to the south to fight al-Qaida and militant groups. The Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, in September and have since been advancing south alongside forces loyal to Saleh. Yesterday Houthis and their allies fired bullets and tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters in the city of Taiz, known as the gateway to southern Yemen. Six demonstrators were killed and scores more were wounded, officials said. The Houthis also battled militias loyal to Hadi in the city of al-Dhalea adjacent to Taiz. Al-Dhalea, Yemen's third-largest city, is also the birthplace of its 2011 Arab Spring-inspired uprising that forced Saleh to hand over power to Hadi in a deal brokered by the U.N. and Gulf countries. A suicide bomb attack on two mosques in Sanaa, Yemen, killed 137 people last week. Worshippers rushed to carry injured men covered in blood from the building . To make matters in Yemen even more complicated, militants loyal to the Islamic State announced the formation of a cell in the country after claiming responsibility for last week's massive multi-suicide bomber attack that left hundreds killed or injured in the capital Sanaa .

To make matters in Yemen even more complicated, militants loyal to the Islamic State announced the formation of a cell in the country after claiming responsibility for last week's massive multi-suicide bomber attack that left hundreds killed or injured in the capital Sanaa. Four bombers wearing explosive belts targeted the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in  Sanaa during midday prayers in what was one of the country's deadliest ever jihadist attacks. At least 137 are dead and a further 351 people are thought to have been wounded in the devastating blasts, described by eyewitnesses as being like earthquakes. A group claiming to be the Yemeni branch of ISIS immediately said they were responsible for the bombings and released images of their logo as a way of declaring the formation of the cell. Charred bodies and pools of blood were seen at the scene of the explosions while footage from the al-Hashoosh mosque, showed screaming volunteers using bloodied blankets to carry away victims. The mosques are mainly used by supporters of the Shi'ite Muslim Houthi group as well as Sunni worshippers.","Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi fled the country after rebels advanced on Aden .

"The washing machine-sized Philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67P on 12 November 2014. But after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface, the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power. Now, as the comet approaches the sun and solar rays recharge Philae's batteries, Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin tells MailOnline he is confident of finding the probe soon - but it will be a race against time to get it working again. He warned that once the comet begins heading away from the sun in August it will enter hibernation again - but this time for good. Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told MailOnline he is confident of making contact with Philae on comet 67P soon (approach of lander on 12 November shown). The probe has been silent since it ran out of power in November, and Esa scientists in Germany recently failed to make contact . Last week, experts at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) abandoned an eight-day attempt to find the probe - the first attempt at trying to restart communications since it went dark. Philae only had a limited battery supply when it landed, lasting just 60 hours before it ran out of energy. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. It managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power. Rosetta is continuing to orbit and study the comet. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. But it is covered in solar panels and, as the comet approaches the sun, it is expected to get enough power - 19 watts - from its panels to make contact with the orbiting Rosetta spacecraft. There will be several windows of opportunity as Rosetta makes its way around the comet for the two unmanned spacecraft to talk to each other. The next of these will be on 13 April. Making contact will enable scientists to get Philae to continue the groundbreaking science it managed to perform in its brief operational time on the surface - and it will also allow Rosetta to pinpoint its location. Speaking about the attempt to find the probe last week, Mr Martin told MailOnline: ‘We were trying to see if the lander would wake up and, at the same time, we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation. ‘We don’t yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander.’ The main issue at the moment is that, for the lander simply to wake up, it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45°C (-49°F). But to start communicating with Rosetta again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power. It may have already reached the former level, which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we won’t hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter. This image sent back from Philae revealed its precarious position on the comet. It appears the probe is partially wedged against a cliff, with some of its solar panels shrouded in darkness. But this did not stop it from completing more than 90 per cent of its science goals in 60 hours of operation on the surface . Philae, pictured left by Rosetta on its approach to comet 67P on 12 November, needs 19 watts of power in order to communicate with Earth through Rosetta. Mission manager Mr Martin, pictured right, said they had already sent commands to the lander, some of which it may have carried out . The landing of Philae on 67P was a groundbreaking moment not only for Esa, but for spaceflight as a whole. It marked the first time a probe had successfully landed on a comet. Shown are some of the team celebrating when news of the successful landing was received back at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany . ‘It’s a very complex configuration,’ explained Mr Martin. ‘The lander has to be able to communicate with the orbiter, and at the same time we are hoping to have enough energy and solar illumination for the lander to wake up.’ At the next attempt, Martin said there was a ’50:50 chance’ they would hear something from Philae, but even if that attempt is unsuccessful he is very confident that we will have heard something from Philae by the time 67P makes its closest approach to the sun - known as perihelion - in August. By this time, temperatures will almost certainly be sufficient for its solar panels to generate enough power for the probe to continue performing experiments on the surface. When it wakes up, Mr Martin said his team would ‘check the situation of the lander and all its units, try to understand what has happened since November, and then as quickly as possible start the long term science phase.’ The goal of this long term science phase is to ‘understand better the comet’s surface, the area where the lander has landed,' he added. ‘If the lander wakes up, I’m sure we would try to use all or most of the instruments.’ Shown here are Rosetta and the Philae lander, in the centre, before they took off from Earth in 2004. Philae’s power system included a non-rechargeable 1,000 watt-hour primary battery and a secondary 140 watt-hour battery, charged by the 24 square feet (2.2 square metres) of solar panels on its exterior . Scientists are desperate to study  the jets that are being emitted by the comet in more detail - one is seen in this Rosetta image - as it approaches the sun. And Philae will play a big part in increasing our understanding of how this process takes place, if Esa is able to wake it up in a reasonable amount of time . But while they are confident Philae will wake up, scientists will be hoping it happens sooner rather than later as it will not be able to operate indefinitely on the comet. After August, 67P will begin its journey away from the sun, and temperatures on the comet will begin to drop. ‘After the summer we start getting more away from the sun, so there will be a point where it will happen again, and then the lander will go into hibernation,’ Mr Martin said. Ultimately, once the influx of solar rays drops sufficiently, Philae will turn off for good. Even though the comet has a relatively short orbital period, 6.45 years, it's unlikely Rosetta and Philae will survive long enough to continue communicating with Earth on its return. Some comets' orbital periods lasts thousands of years. In addition, perhaps the most interesting time to study the comet will be as it approaches the sun, and ice on its surface begins to vapourise into gas. If Philae can study and observe the comet on the approach, it could provide some fascinating insight into what happens to a comet during this phase.","Rosetta mission manager Patrick Martin told MailOnline he is confident of making contact with Philae on comet 67P soon .
The probe has been silent since it ran out of power in November .
Esa scientists in Germany recently failed to make contact .
But Mr Martin said they have a '50:50' chance of making contact on 13 April .
However, they want to find it before the comet leaves the sun in August .
After this, the probe will eventually run out of power - this time forever .
The team wants to perform as much science as possible before then ."
"Michael Schumacher's 15-year-old son has crashed while test driving a Formula 4 car at 100mph in east Germany. Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported. The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - a racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers. Mick Schumacher (pictured), 15, crashed while testing a Formula 4 car on a race track in east Germany . Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season (pictured) but this year has begun practicing for his first year in the Formula 4 . However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who remains recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents, earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said. 'He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation. Record breaking Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher (pictured in 2000) remains recovering from a 2013 ski accident that left him with serious head injuries .","Mick Schumacher crashed while testing a car on a race track in Germany .

"Shane Walford killed father-of-two Paul Gibbons with a single punch outside a bar in Coventry . A convicted killer has been arrested in the Canary Islands just days after he appeared on a list of Britain's most wanted fugitives believed to be on the run in Spain. Shane Walford was tracked down to the Canary Islands by Spanish police on Saturday morning. The ex-soldier, 38, was jailed in 2010 for the manslaughter of an off-duty fireman while on leave from the Army. Walford, a former boxer, killed father-of-two Paul Gibbons with a single punch outside a bar in Coventry. He was jailed for four and a half years but was recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence. The National Crime Agency (NCA) released the most wanted list as part of Operation Captura, which targets wanted suspects who are thought to have fled to Spain. An NCA spokesman said: 'Shane Walford was arrested by Spanish national police yesterday morning in the Canary Islands.' The nine remaining men are wanted in connection with crimes including rape, indecent assault of a child and drug trafficking, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Another of the fugitives is Mohammed Jahangir Alam, 32, who was sentenced to 14 years in his absence in March 2010 for rape and sexual assault by penetration. Alam, who is originally from Bangladesh, arrived in the UK on a temporary visa in October 2007 and moved to Cheltenham the following year, when he physically and sexually abused his victim, the NCA said. Also on the wanted list is 52-year-old Carlo Dawson, from Croydon, south London, who is accused of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photographs of a child. On the run: (L-R) Carlo Dawson from south London, who is accused of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photos of a child. Jayson McDonald is a suspected drug trafficker . Also on list: (L-R) David McDermott, believed to be a member of a drug-dealing organised crime gang in Liverpool,  and youthful-looking Michael Roden, nicknamed 'Dodge' and suspected of importing cannabis . An operation was launched last week to arrest one of the fugitives, suspected drugs trafficker Jayson McDonald, who is believed to have been living in Spain. More than a dozen armed officers along with detectives from the Metropolitan Police carried out a dawn raid on a luxury villa in Coin near Malaga but McDonald was not found. It is the ninth appeal of its kind since Captura was launched by the NCA and Crimestoppers in 2006, and so far 65 out of 76 named suspects have been caught. One of the latest to be found in Tenerife was drugs lord Stephen Blundell, 36, from Merseyside, who fled the UK before being sentenced for a £1 million heroin plot, the NCA said. Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: 'Spain is not a safe haven for British fugitives. The NCA and its partners will continue to pursue these individuals relentlessly and return them to the UK to face justice. Wanted: (L-R) Paul Buchanan, wanted for attempted rape, and suspected drug tafficker Anthony Dennis are also National Crime Agency targets . 'The exceptional level of collaboration and intelligence sharing with the Spanish authorities has been vital to these arrests. However, we still need the support of the public. 'Be our eyes and ears and tell us if you have any information on the whereabouts of our targets.' Lord Ashcroft, founder of Crimestoppers, said: 'Operation Captura has proved a huge success since it was launched in 2006 and the majority of individuals on our most wanted list have been captured. 'However, there are still a number of criminals who are evading arrest. We must ensure these individuals are brought to justice. We are confident that we can successfully hunt them down with support from the Spanish authorities, as well as the Spanish and UK public.' Spanish authorities are heavily backing the operation and a leading policewoman has claimed the country is no longer a 'safe place' for British criminals to hide. Speaking at Malaga's police headquarters, Inspector Olga Lizana, head of the Spanish National Police Fugitives Unit, said British criminals living in Spain should 'leave the country' because they will be found. She added: 'This is not a good place (for them) to come any more. This is not a safe place for criminals any more. 'I think we are doing a great job with the British authorities. They have to be aware we are working together.' Mohammed Jahangir Alam was sentenced to 14 years in jail in his absence for rape . Spain's Costa del Sol - once dubbed 'Costa del Crime' - has been known as a hideaway for British criminals in the past, particularly in the late 1970s and 80s when there were no extradition agreements with the UK. Infamous British criminals to have fled to the region included Great Train robber Charlie Wilson, who was shot dead in Marbella in 1990, and Freddie Foreman, an associate of the Kray twins. Inspector Lizana said, like most British expatriates, criminals were attracted to Spain by the 'good weather and good food.' She added: 'There is a huge British community living here. For them, it is easy to hide. For us sometimes it is really difficult to find them. 'Also, it's a cheap country compared to the UK.' The launch of Operation Captura in 2006 has seen an increasing number of British fugitives being captured in Spain. The high-profile initiative between the NCA, Crimestoppers and the Spanish authorities has seen 65 out of 76 wanted British suspects detained. Last year alone, 54 fugitives were arrested in Spain and brought back to the UK, the NCA said. Commenting on the police's failure to apprehend suspected British drug trafficker Jayson McDonald, the inspector said she was 'disappointed' but added: 'He is not going to be back in the UK so we'll arrest him here.' Anyone with information on the whereabouts of the fugitives is asked to call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or go online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. As part of Operation Captura, the National Crime Agency today published a list of ten of Britain's most wanted fugitives thought to have fled to Spain. They are: . 1. Shane Walford: 38, was wanted by West Midlands Police for manslaughter. The former soldier and boxer was jailed for 54 months in July 2010 after he killed firefighter Paul Gibbons at a bar in Coventry. He was recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence. He has now been arrested in the Canary Islands. 2. Mohammed Jahangir Alam: 32, is wanted by Gloucestershire Police for rape and sexual assault. He was convicted in March 2010 and sentenced to 14 years in his absence. 3. Carlo Dawson: 52, is wanted by the Met Police on suspicion of indecent assault and making indecent photographs of a child. Dawson, from south London, is believed to have indecently assaulted a 12-year-old girl between October 1996 and October 1997. 4. Paul Buchanan: 29, is wanted by West Mercia Police on suspicion of attempted rape. Buchanan, originally from New York, is alleged to have attacked a woman near his flat in Worcestershire by pulling her down a driveway, pushing her over a car and attempting to rape her. 5. Paul Monk: 54, of Romford, Essex, is wanted by the Met Police on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis. 6. Anthony Dennis: 47, is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking offences outside the UK and conspiracy to import class A drugs. Dennis, originally of Hackney, is believed to be the leader of an organised crime group involved in high-level international drug trafficking. 7. David McDermott: 41, is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to blackmail. McDermott, from Ormskirk, is believed to be a member of a Liverpool-based organised crime group. 8. Scott Hughes: 34, is wanted by Merseyside Police on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs and conspiracy to launder money. 9. Michael Roden: 25, is wanted by West Midlands police on suspicion of conspiracy to import cannabis. Nicknamed 'Dodge', he was allegedly involved in 70 kilos of cannabis being imported into the UK from Spain between April 2013 and September 2013. 10. Jayson McDonald: 37, is wanted by the Met Police on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine. McDonald, originally from Bristol, is believed to be part of a Europe-wide organised crime network responsible for importing Class A drugs into the UK.

"Ben Cohen's mother-in-law is due in court after allegedly harassing the former rugby player following his split from her daughter. Felicity Bassouls, 67, was outspoken in her criticism of Cohen - labelling him a 'disrespectful bully' - after he broke up with Abby late last year amid rumours of an affair with his Strictly Come Dancing partner Kristina Rihanoff. The athlete and activist, who was part of England's 2003 World Cup winning squad, had been married to Abby for 11 years and the couple have twin daughters. Scroll down for video . Due in court: Felicity Bassouls (left), 67, labelled Cohen (right) a 'disrespectful bully' when he split with her daughter Abby late last year . Rumour: Rihanoff (pictured) and Cohen both vehemently deny that any sort of romantic relationship took place . Mrs Bassouls is due in court this month accused of bombarding Cohen with calls and emails, The Sun reports. A Northampton Police spokesperson told the paper: 'A 67-year-old woman has been summonsed to appear before Northampton Magistrates court on Wednesday, March 18, to face allegations of harassment.' It was in September that Mrs Bassouls branded Cohen a 'bully' and called his behaviour 'disrespectful'. At the time, The Daily Express reported she said: 'I cannot believe what Ben Cohen has written - I am afraid to say, when you are a celebrity and in the limelight, you have to treat people with the same respect that you expect from the public. Marriage ended: Ben Cohen and his Abby (pictured together in 2003) announced their split in September last year after 11 years of marriage . Cohen, pictured with his and Abby's twin daughters Harriette and Isabelle, on TV show Big Star's Little Star . 'I have experienced a great deal of bullying from you myself. Your behaviour has been so disrespectful and very intimidating not just to myself but my husband also.' News of the couple's split was linked to rumours between Cohen and his Strictly Come Dancing partner Kristina Rihanoff - fuelled by the pair's on-screen chemistry and steamy routines on the 2013 show. Both have vehemently denied that any sort of romantic relationship took place. Cohen met his wife in 1995, at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before having their daughters in 2008. The couple's public statement in September read: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children. 'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.' Partnership: Ben Cohen and Kristina Rihanoff perform the Rumba on Strictly Come Dancing in October 2013 . Their split is the latest in a long list of post-Strictly break-ups. Susanna Reid split from the father of her three children following her appearance on the hit show, and Rachel Riley - made her split from her husband known in November - when they called time on their relationship, post-dancing appearance. Cohen's on-screen chemistry with Kristina Rihanoff, sometimes known as ‘The Siberian siren', was widely noted in the 2013 show. She is extremely fond of the rugby star, calling him ‘the sweetest guy in the world’ soon after they met. Rihanoff became romantically involved with Joe Calzaghe after the pair were partnered together in 2009. The boxer dumped his model girlfriend for Rihanoff and the two entered a relationship, eventually splitting in 2013.

"Sean Sands, a former soldier and experienced kite surfer, got into difficulty in 20mph winds, losing control of his kite and died at Hunstanton Beach . A former soldier drowned after he got into difficulty in high winds while kitesurfing and was unable to control his kite. Sean Sands, a father-of-three, died after he was dragged through the water off Hunstanton beach in Norfolk in 20mph and lost control, leaving him unable to trigger his emergency quick release system. The 49-year-old BT engineer was eventually dragged onto the shore by fellow kite surfers who tried to revive him but they were unable to save him. Mr Sands was at the beach on Saturday, the warmest day of the year so far, when it was packed with families and watersports enthusiasts. The experienced kite surfer went out into the water but got into difficulty at about 3.30pm. The former soldier was dragged through the water and lost control, meaning he was unable to trigger his quick release system to de-power the sail  or detach himself completely from the kite. He was in the water about 45 minutes before fellow kite surfers were able to drag him to the shore. The East Anglian Air Ambulance dispatched a team to the beach and airlifted the patient to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, but he was pronounced dead. Mr Sands, from Heacham, Norfolk, was a long-standing member of Hunstanton Sailing Club. A flag flew at half-mast outside the sailing club over the weekend and few kite surfers returned to the water yesterday. A spokesman for Hunstanton sailing club said: 'Fellow club members and kite surfers were immediately on the scene to try to help Sean and the RNLI were called straight away. 'Tragically, despite the best efforts of everyone including the RNLI, Coastguard and the air ambulance, Sean did not make it.' The club paid tribute to Mr Sands, saying: 'Sean was a hugely popular character and someone who made everyone feel like they were a close friend. 'Hunstanton Sailing Club have lost a true brother, a friend to so many and one of life's genuinely effervescent characters. 'Our thoughts and condolences are with Sean's family at this terrible time.' Fellow kite surfers managed to pull Mr Sands to the shore and the air ambulance was called but efforts to revive him failed and the experienced kite surfer was pronounced dead on Saturday . Dozens of calls were made to the emergency services to help him, and Hunstanton RNLI Lifeboat was paged. Hunstanton lifeboat spokesman Geoff Needham said: 'He was very fit and an extremely experienced kite surfer who knew what he was doing. 'It is a possibility that there was an equipment failure, but that will have to be determined by an inquest. 'Everybody was working on him for quite a while, but their efforts were unsuccessful. 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the family and relatives. It is so tragic that a sporting activity should end so tragically.' Trevor Wright posted on Facebook: 'RIP Sean , condolences to all the family and friends. We have used the sailing club a few times now and everyone I have meet have always been so nice and welcoming. Stay strong everyone. All the best, Trevor from Cambridgeshire Search and Rescue.' Kite surfers are attached to a harness to balance their weight against the kite - but this is not attached to the board (stock image) Kite surfing has recently become recognised as a serious watersport. Kitesurfers are attached to a harness to balance their weight against the kite - but this is not attached to the board. Kite surfing rigs have a 'chicken loop' safety system with a quick release handle. This can be pulled by the user to de-power their sail if they get into difficulties but does not completely detach them. A secondary system allows the kite and its rigging to be detached completely from the user's harness. In April 2013 a kite surfer was critically injured after he was launched 100ft and slammed into a building after his equipment was caught by a freak gust of wind in Poole. And in 2010 a kite surfer in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in south west France died after he was dragged across a beach, hit at least three rooftops, and was then dropped 50ft to the ground. Mr Sands was also a member of the nearby King's Lynn Triathlon Club, which posted a statement on Facebook. It read: 'I am sad to report that a fellow triathlete and good friend to many of our members had a tragic accident whilst out kite surfing yesterday. 'I would say on behalf of all our members that our thoughts are with Sean's family and friends.' Kite surfer Greg Richardson said: 'He was a really happy chap, always smiling and a really nice bloke - we're all cut up and in shock. 'I've been kite surfing here for five years and they all look after one another, always. It's a close family and it's like one of ours is gone.' Richard Evans, 46, from Norwich, who was out windsurfing on Saturday said there had been about 40 people out on the water spread over a big area. He said: 'I was about two miles off shore when I saw the lifeboat come out. When I came back onto shore it was a bit subdued and I asked what had happened.' Peter Mallam, 69, who has run Wash View Café on the promenade for 16 years, said Hunstanton had been busy with windsurfers and kite surfers on Saturday. He said: 'It was absolutely manic. All the parking spaces along the promenade were taken by windsurfers and kite surfers. It was the busiest I've seen it for a long time.' It is understood Mr Sands was a keen runner and triathlete. A statement on the Kings Lynn Triathlon Club's Facebook page said: 'I am sad to report that a fellow triathlete and good friend to many of our members had a tragic accident whilst out kite surfing yesterday. 'I would say on behalf of all our members that our thoughts are with Sean's family and friends.' The incident is being investigated by the 4,000-strong British Kitesports Association. Spokesman Peter Shaw told the Wisbech Standard: 'We always advise our members to obtain fully-qualified instruction,' he said. 'All modern kites come with multiple safety systems and we'd advise any rider to practise using these systems repeatedly. 'There is an inherent element of risk to this sport. You're never going to remove that risk because that's why people do this sport. It's that edge which makes kite surfing so popular.'","Sean Sands was kitesurfing off Hunstanton beach in Norfolk on Saturday .

"This is the dramatic moment a brave cyclist chased down three thieves who had just stolen another rider's bike. Alex Sweeting, 25, was riding along the road in Leyton, east London, when he saw a 53-year-old man in cycling gear who had just been shoulder barged off his bike. Mr Sweeting's head camera shows him pedalling madly after the three men at 21mph - as the heart rate monitor he was also wearing reached 164 beats per minute. Scroll down for video . This is the dramatic moment brave cyclist Alex Sweeting chased down three thieves who had just stolen another rider's bike, as the heart rate monitor he was wearing showed his pulse was beating at 164bpm . Keen cyclist Mr Sweeting (pictured), 25, pedalled after the thieves and managed to retrieve the stolen bike . As he shouted at the men, they dropped the bike and sprinted away. Mr Sweeting, a technical production manager at Teradata, told MailOnline: 'It was 10.30pm at night and I had been at work and then at my cycling club (Lea Valley Cycling Club) social at a pub that we have once a month. 'I was cycling home with a mate when we went our separate ways. I was riding home to Barking and I was going quite quickly. 'I then saw a guy running along in cycling shoes, which I thought was a bit odd. 'He flagged me and a bus down and said what had happened and that someone had nicked his bike and I then saw them running off in the distance.' The helmet mounted camera belonging to rider Alex Sweeting, 25, shows the 53-year-old man in cycling gear running along the cycling lane after three thieves pushed him to the ground and stole his bike . With his helmet-mounted camera and heart monitor on, Mr Sweeting raced after the three thieves in Leyton . He added: 'I wasn't thinking much at the time. I just thought ""how can I get near them""? 'It was only when I stopped that I realised what I'd done. 'The cyclist then caught back up with me and he was already on the phone to the police. He was obviously really annoyed about what happened, but was glad he got his bike back. He said the bike only cost about £200. 'He was very grateful but said it wasn't the first time it has happened to him in the same area.' Mr Sweeting, a passionate cyclist who travels by bike to work every day, added: 'It angers me that people do this. It could have happened to anyone. You should be able to feel safe on a bike wherever you go, but this was a vicious attack. Pedalling at a top speed of 21mph and with his heart rate at 164 bpm, Mr Sweeting caught up with the thugs . As his speeds ticks over 20mph, Mr Sweeting frantically pedals after the three thieves in the distance . 'I actually got the helmet camera for Christmas because of an incident with a car, so I'm really glad I got it. Hopefully it'll lead to some sort of prosecution or charge.' A police spokesman said the victim - who was making his way towards Wanis Distribution Centre in Orient Way, Leyton - was slightly injured but declined medical attention. Police described how one of the men suddenly charged at the cyclist, causing him to fall off his bike into the road. Another man then punched the victim in the back of the head before a third grabbed the bike and all three ran off. The three men were described as being between 18 and 25 and about 5ft 8ins tall. Two were described as black, while the other appeared to be Asian. Mr Sweeting caught up with the three men on his bike and they dropped the stolen bike before running off . The three thieves discarded the stolen bike as Mr Sweeting caught up with them and then fled on foot . As Mr Sweeting retrieved the stolen bicycle, the three men continued to run away along the track in Leyton . Officers searched the area but the men had escaped. Last month, Alan Cartwright, 15, died after he was stabbed while riding his bike in Islington, North London. The two friends he was with had their bikes stolen during the attack.

"The name conjures up images of row upon row of dusty leather-bound books in some darkened corner of a stately home. But these days, it seems, you’re just as likely to find a ‘library’ in a three-bedroom suburban house. The quiet allure of a room filled with books, a cosy chair in the corner and a lamp or two has become a new status symbol, estate agents say. Status symbol: Many home owners are turning under-used rooms into quiet refuges from the modern world . And getting your own library isn’t too difficult. Many homeowners are simply redecorating their under-used dining rooms, which have become redundant as more families use a combined kitchen-diner for meals. Estate agents say a library is ‘aspirational’ and regarded as a retro retreat from the rest of our increasingly hi-tech homes. One in ten said there had been a rise in the number of homes being advertised with a library, the National Association of Estate Agents found. Yesterday, Mark Hayward, of the NAEA, said: ‘Having a library in your home can add a unique advantage when it comes to selling your property. It is a differentiator – a room by its very title that conveys peace, quiet and serenity that’s growing in popularity. ‘At the top-end property market, it adds a quintessential English touch, popular amongst overseas investors.’ It follows a trend for ‘shelfies’ – photographs of one’s bookshelves – which have become popular on social media websites. More than 160,000 images have been posted on the website Instagram using the hashtag ‘shelfie’, with thousands more on Twitter. Mr Hayward said many upmarket new-build homes now included library rooms as standard, while sellers were converting their spare rooms. He said: ‘The popularity of the kitchen-diner means many dining rooms are now dead space. Filling it with books and calling it a library elevates it again. ‘The books you put on the shelves are intended to reflect a lifestyle. It is filled with the books you want people to think you are reading.’ The name may evoke images of leather bound books and mahogany but libraries are increasingly common .","Libraries, a  quiet retreat from gadgets, found increasingly in homes .

"My daughters had told me the hotel was a favourite of Kim Kardashian so I thought it would be big, brash and boastful... and it was. But Atlantis the Palm - which sits at atop the world's largest artificial islands created in the shape of a palm tree - is also beautiful, and that is not what I had expected. The Dubai resort, which opened in 2008, was clearly designed by someone who loves the sea and tales of the lost city. Scroll down to watch the journalist's video . Atlantis the Palm was clearly designed by someone who loves the sea and tales of the lost city . Every column, ceiling, painting and even door handle has been carefully crafted to remind the visitor that sea-life is central to its operation. The complex is big, very big. Ever visited the London Aquarium? The Atlantis has its own version inside the hotel, but with 11 million litres and 65,000 marine animals it's more than five times as large. At Atlantis we stayed in an executive suite, but for visitors who can't get enough of watching marine life, the underwater suites feature floor to ceiling views of the aquarium. You can watch the sharks, piranhas and sea horses as you soak in your bath or even from the comfort of your bed. For visitors who can't get enough of watching marine life, the underwater suites feature floor to ceiling views of the aquarium. You can watch the fish as you recline in your bath or even from the comfort of your bed . The Dubai resort, which opened in 2008, is a favourite of Kim Kardashian and her mother Kris . Priced at £6,000 a night these are aimed at honeymooners, however, I suspect most honeymooners will be otherwise engaged to appreciate the view. But as a keen fisherman seeing all those wonderful creatures must have triggered some primeval and we dined on seafood all week. Deciding which restaurant to visit at Atlantis the Palm was never an easy decision, but with such a wide range of culinary delights it was a dilemma that we enjoyed - the only problem was remembering the location of a particular restaurant because the hotel was so vast. A favourite was the hotel's award-winning seafood restaurant, Ossiano and as expected, the food and service was superb. The restaurant has a floor to ceiling glass wall and the view of the aquarium was simply mesmerizing - conversation consisted of 'Wow, look at the colours on that one' or 'I have never seen a creature like that'. Stevie and his wife enjoy dinner at the hotel's award-winning seafood restaurant, Ossiano . The hotel is a 20-minute car ride from the city centre, but to ensure that you don't feel like straying, the hotel has 21 restaurants, bars and lounges to entertain its guests. During our exploration we managed to sneak a look at the 924 square-metre Royal Bridge Suite, where Kim Kardashian and her friends stayed in November. Pictured: A close-up view from the table at dinner . Located on top of the hotel, the three bedroom pad can be yours for around £28,000 per night - which by my rough reckoning equates to more than 30 pence per second - and a private lift takes you up the 22 floors. You can eat haute cuisine on a gold leaf dining table, cooked by your own personal chef, surrounded by expensive works of art while enjoying panoramic views of the Arabian Gulf. We spent the week living like children - we fed the stingrays, sped across the estate on a zipwire and embarked on a shark safari which saw us putting on suits and helmets and wandering around a tank with the beasts. But even if we hadn't booked up for all of that, we would have been quite content with the time we spent in Atlantis' own water-park, Aquaventure, which at 17 hectares, is Dubai's largest. One ride, The Leap of Faith, has a near-vertical 27 metres drop which propelled me through an acrylic tube with sharks just inches away - a truly thrilling experience. It was impressive to see the emphasis on safety - every few metres life-guards were on patrol and one-thousand staff are employed at the waterpark. The hotel also has several conventional swimming pools for guests. A minor gripe was that it didn't have one where I could simply swim lengths without knocking into less able swimmers. When I decided to venture into the sea surrounding the Atlantis it only took one shout of 'Watch out Sir, Jellyfish', before my question of why no-one was swimming in the sea was answered. With paparazzi following not far behind, Kim Kardashian arrives at Atlantis the Palm during her stay in 2011 . One ride, The Leap of Faith, has a near-vertical 27 metres drop which propels the user through an acrylic tube with sharks just inches away - a truly thrilling experience . The view from the Burj Khalifa - entry costs £16 and from the viewing platform on the 124th floor you can get an idea of the scale of Dubai's developing landscape . During our five-day stay we only ventured out once and that was to visit the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest skyscraper, a must-see for any visitor to Dubai. Entry costs £16 and from the viewing platform on the 124th floor you can get an idea of the scale of Dubai's developing landscape. It's located in the Dubai Mall, the world's largest shopping centre. After five days in the Atlantis I still felt there were parts we hadn't explored - it was tough to fit them in around the massages, eating, swimming and sunbathing. Hard life. But I think that is where the beauty of the hotel lies - you get so lost in exploring the mini city of luxury that is presented to you, that you take some time out from the real world - and that is what holidays are all about aren't they? A stay at the Atlantis Palm (www.atlantisthepalm.com) starts from £364 per night based on two adults and two children sharing a Palm Beach Deluxe Room. Includes unlimited access to Aquaventure Waterpark, with new record-breaking rides and slides and unlimited access to the underwater world of The Lost Chambers Aquarium, home to 65,000 marine animals.","Atlantis the Palm sits atop the world's largest artificial islands .

"The BBC was last night accused of suppressing an interview that called for corporation boss Rona Fairhead to resign over her £10,000-a-day second job at scandal-hit HSBC bank. It’s a new blow to Mrs Fairhead, chairman of the BBC Trust and a non-executive director of HSBC, who is facing growing calls to quit one of her high-profile jobs over claims of a conflict of interest. She is due to be questioned by MPs tomorrow after The Mail on Sunday revealed that she was paid £513,000 for just 50 days work at the troubled bank last year, vastly exceeding her £110,000 salary for what is supposed to be her main job overseeing the BBC. Last month HSBC came under fire over allegations that its Swiss banking arm helped wealthy clients dodge millions of pounds of British taxes, and that it sought to influence media coverage. Silenced: Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon (right) who said Rona Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust, will not be shown . Now an HSBC shareholder has claimed the BBC refused to broadcast an interview with him in which he declared that Mrs Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be heading the Trust. Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon says he was invited to Broadcasting House in Central London to discuss the turmoil at HSBC in an on-the-record interview with a BBC business reporter on February 23. His interview failed to feature in the broadcaster’s coverage of the HSBC story that evening. He believes it was shelved because of his remarks questioning Mrs Fairhead’s fitness to run the Trust. He said: ‘I said during the interview I disagreed with her appointment as BBC Trust chairwoman. ‘I couldn’t understand why a non-executive director who is there to protect the shareholders ignored us when we told her on numerous occasions in the past about illegal behaviour that was going on involving HSBC. ‘It’s my personal belief she’s not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust. The HSBC item was shown, but my interview was not in it. I believe it may have been suppressed.’ Mr Mason-Mahon has attempted to obtain a copy of the interview but has been told that this would be against BBC policy. Mr Mason-Mahon is well-known for his outbursts at the annual general meetings of big public companies. Last May he brought a lawsuit against HSBC’s North American arm after it was fined £1.2 billion having been found guilty in 2012 of allowing Mexican drug cartels to launder money. Last week former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland called on Mrs Fairhead either to give up her post at HSBC or to resign from the Trust. Tomorrow she is due to appear in her role as an HSBC Board member in front of the Commons public accounts committee, which has fiercely attacked tax-dodging corporations. Last night the BBC declined to say why the interview with Mr Mason-Mahon was not broadcast and whether or not Mrs Fairhead – who is not supposed to be involved in editorial decisions – was told about it. A spokesman pointed out that it was the BBC’s Panorama programme that originally broadcast the highly damaging allegations about HSBC’s Swiss banking arm and added: ‘Like every news organisation we don’t use every interview we conduct. 'It is simply wrong to suggest that we would not broadcast an interview due to it criticising someone associated with the BBC.’","Called for Rona Fairhead to resign over £10,000-a-day second job .

"Seafood caught by slave fishermen is ending up in supermarkets, restaurants and pet shops across America, an investigation has found. Burmese men are being kept in cages on a tiny Indonesian island and forced to fish - or risk being kicked, beaten and whipped with stingray tails. Seafood caught by the slaves is entering major supply networks in the US with tainted produce appearing in sushi, canned pet food and bags of frozen fish, it is claimed. Scroll down for video . Slaves are being locked up in cages on a tropical Indonesian island and forced to catch fish which ends up in US supply chains . Workers in Benjina, Indonesia, load fish onto a cargo ship bound for Thailand. Seafood caught by slaves mixes in with other fish at a number of sites in Thailand, including processing plants . The Associated Press says the men were brought to the village of Benjina through Thailand and the fish they are forced to catch is shipped back to Thailand before entering the global commerce stream. It claims tainted fish can wind up in the supply chains of some of America's major grocery stores, such as Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway; the nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart; and the biggest food distributor, Sysco. It can also find its way into the supply chains of some of the most popular brands of canned pet food, including Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. There are also suggestions it can turn up as calamari at fine dining restaurants, as imitation crab in a California sushi roll or as packages of frozen snapper relabeled with store brands that land on dinner tables. In a year-long investigation, the AP interviewed more than 40 current and former slaves in Benjina. It charted the journey of a single large shipment of slave-caught seafood from the Indonesian village, including squid, snapper, grouper and shrimp, and tracked it by satellite to a Thai harbor. Upon its arrival, journalists followed trucks that loaded and drove the seafood over four nights to dozens of factories, cold storage plants and the country's biggest fish market. Captive: A security guard talks to detainees inside a cell at the compound of a fishing company in Benjina, Indonesia . Locked up: The men are forced to work 22-hour shifts or risk being kicked, beaten and whipped with stingray tails . Some fishermen, risking their lives, begged reporters for help. 'I want to go home. We all do,' one Burmese slave called out over the side of his boat, a cry repeated by many men. 'Our parents haven't heard from us for a long time, I'm sure they think we are dead.' Their catch mixes in with other fish at numerous sites in Thailand, including processing plants. US Customs records show that several of those Thai factories ship to America. They also ship to Europe and Asia, but the Associated Press traced shipments to the US, where trade records are public. The major corporations identified by AP declined interviews but issued statements that strongly condemned labor abuses. Many described their work with human rights groups to hold subcontractors accountable. National Fisheries Institute spokesman Gavin Gibbons, speaking on behalf of 300 US seafood firms that make up 75 percent of the industry, said his members are troubled by the findings. 'It's not only disturbing, it's disheartening because our companies have zero tolerance for labor abuses,' he said. 'These type of things flourish in the shadows.' The slaves interviewed by the AP described 20 to 22-hour shifts and unclean drinking water. Almost all said they were kicked, beaten or whipped with toxic stingray tails if they complained or tried to rest. They were paid little or nothing. An investigation suggests seafood caught by the slaves is ending up in major supply networks in the US with tainted produce appearing in sushi, canned pet food and bags of frozen fish . A refrigerated cargo ship called the Silver Sea Line,  second from right, is docked at Thajeen Port in Thailand, 15 days after it set sail from Benjina, Indonesia with a load of wild-caught seafood . Runaway Hlaing Min said many died at sea. 'If Americans and Europeans are eating this fish, they should remember us. There must be a mountain of bones under the sea,' he said. 'The bones of the people could be an island, it's that many.' In the small harbor in the village is a five-story office compound which includes the cage with the slaves, AP reports. At the Benjina port, the AP interviewed slaves from a dozen fishing vessels offloading their catch into a large refrigerated cargo ship, the Silver Sea Line. The ship belonged to the Silver Sea Reefer Co., which is registered in Thailand and has at least nine refrigerated cargo boats. The company said it is not involved with the fishermen. 'We only carry the shipment and we are hired in general by clients,' said company owner Panya Luangsomboon. 'We're separated from the fishing boats.' AP followed that ship, using satellite tracking over 15 days to Samut Sakhon, Thailand, and journalists watched as workers packed the seafood over four nights onto more than 150 trucks, following deliveries to factories around the city. Slaves from Myanmar lean over the deck of their fishing trawler. Many of the men were brought to the village of Benjina through Thailand . Frozen seafood is off-loaded from a refrigerated 3,000-ton cargo ship in Thailand.  The ship belongs to the Silver Sea Reefer Co. but the company said it is not involved with the slave fishermen . Inside those plants, representatives said they sold seafood to other Thai processors and distributors. US Customs bills of lading identify specific shipments from those plants to American firms, including well-known brand names. For example, one truck bore the name and bird logo of Kingfisher Holdings Ltd., which supplies frozen and canned seafood around the world. Another truck went to Mahachai Marine Foods Co., a cold storage business that also supplies Kingfisher, according to Kawin Ngernanek, whose family runs it. 'Yes, yes, yes, yes,' said Kawin, who also serves as spokesman for the Thai Overseas Fisheries Association. 'Kingfisher buys several types of products.' When later asked about abusive labor practices, Kawin was not available. Instead, Mahachai Marine Foods manager Narongdet Prasertsri responded: 'I have no idea about it at all.' Kingfisher did not answer repeated requests for comment. Every month, Kingfisher and its subsidiary KF Foods Ltd. sends about 100 metric tons of seafood from Thailand to America, according to US Customs records. Slaves use this warehouse in Benjina as a makeshift dormitory after finishing shifts that last up to 22 hours . Workers from Myanmar load fish onto a Thai-flagged cargo ship in Benjina, Indonesia. An investigation has suggested seafood caught by the slaves is ending up on plates across America . Maung Soe of Myanmar holds up a copy of the seafarer's book given to him before he boarded a Thai fishing trawler, in Benjina, Indonesia . Tun Lin Maung sits with a group of slave fishermen from Myanmar behind a fishing company building. He says it has been two years since he escaped from the fishing trawler he was working on . These shipments have gone to Stavis Seafoods, a Boston-based Sysco supplier, and other distributors. 'The truth is, these are the kind of things that keep you up at night,' said CEO Richard Stavis, whose grandfather started the company. He said his business visits international processors, requires notarized certification of legal practices and uses third-party audits. 'There are companies like ours that care and are working as hard as they can,' he said. A similar pattern repeats itself with other companies and shipments. The AP followed another truck to Niwat Co., where part owner Prasert Luangsomboon said the company sells to Thai Union Manufacturing. Weeks later, when confronted about forced labor in their supply chain, Niwat referred several requests for comment to Luangsomboon, who could not be reached for further comment. Thai Union Manufacturing Co. is a subsidiary of Thai Union Frozen Products PCL., Thailand's largest seafood corporation, with $3.5billion in annual sales. This parent company, known simply as Thai Union, owns Chicken of the Sea and is buying Bumble Bee, although the AP did not observe any tuna fisheries. Thai Union says its direct clients include Wal-Mart, and ships thousands of cans of cat food to the U.S. every month, including household brands like Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. These end up on shelves of major grocery chains, such as Kroger, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as pet stores. Hla Phyo stands next to a grave marker of a man he helped bury - a Burmese fisherman slave who died on a fishing boat - at a cemetery in Benjina . A group of former slaves from Myanmar, who worked on fishing ships, walk in the densely forested interior of an island in the Arafura Sea after escaping from Benjina . Free: A former slave  from Myanmar, who goes by the name Mozet (centre) is one of those who escaped or ran away while trawlers were docked at the Benjina port . Again, however, it's impossible to tell if a particular can of cat food might have slave-caught seafood. Thai Union said it takes multiple stakeholders to eradicate labor abuses. 'We all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the Thai seafood industry's supply chain is 100 percent clean,' Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said in an emailed statement. The enslaved fishermen on Benjina had no idea where the fish went, only that it was too valuable for them to eat. Their desperation was palpable. A crude cemetery holds more than 60 graves strangled by tall grasses and jungle vines. The small wooden markers are neatly labeled, some with the falsified names of slaves and boats. Only their friends remember where they were laid to rest. In the past, former slave Hla Phyo said, supervisors on ships simply tossed bodies into the sea to be devoured by sharks. But after authorities and companies started demanding that every man be accounted for on the roster upon return, captains began stowing corpses alongside the fish in ship freezers until they arrived back in Benjina. 'I'm starting to feel like I will be in Indonesia forever,' said Phyo, wiping a tear away. 'I remember thinking when I was digging, the only thing that awaits us here is death.'","Men from Burma are being forced to fish in Indonesia, investigation reveals .

"Two members of One Direction are being forced to post bonds worth nearly £6,600 to be allowed into the Philippines following a video which allegedly saw them smoking marijuana. Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson are required to put down the money ahead of One Direction's concert in Manila this weekend, to be forfeited if they are caught using, or impliedly promoting, illegal drugs while in the Philippines. This comes in the wake of a video filmed last April, where the pair were seen joking about drugs as they appeared to share a roll-up 'joint' during the Latin America leg of their 2014 Stadium Tour. Scroll down for video . Bad boys: Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson, pictured at the American Music Awards in November last year, have been forced to post bond of £3,300 each in order to be allowed to enter the Philippines . The video, obtained by MailOnline last May, sees Louis, 23, narrate from behind the camera while seemingly filming his 22-year-old bandmate, on their way to a One Direction concert in Lima, Peru. During the 15-minute journey Louis, from Doncaster, and Zayn, from Bradford, joke with each other and the three members of their crew travelling with them. Filmed by Louis, it shows them in smoke-filled car, the other members of One Direction appearing to travel in a separate vehicle, with Zayn asking: 'Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?' Louis can be heard saying that he wants to 'light up' and his handed a lighter and a roll-up from a third person in the SUV. Both singers can be seen smoking the roll-up and and appear to be making fun of the band's police escort. Caught on camera: The video emerged last spring, allegedly showing Zayn and Louis sharing a marijuana joint during the Latin America leg of their 2014 Stadium Tour . Conditions: Zayn and Louis, seen with fellow bandmembers Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Liam Payne, need to put down the money to be forfeited if they are caught using, or promoting, drugs while in the Philippines . Louis appears to be confirming that the pair are smoking an illegal substance, handing his bandmate the cigarette while saying: 'One very very important factor of Zayn's warm up of course is Mary J, herself'. The band was criticised after the video leak and bandmember Liam Payne tweeted an apology saying 'I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways. I apologize for that.' Sorry: Zayn has publicly apologised after being pictured holding hands with fan, Lauren Rich . He said: 'We are only in our 20's and we all do stupid things at this age.' Ahead of the band's concert in Manila this weekend, the Philippine Bureau of Immigration is requiring Zayn and Louis to post 200,000 Philippine Peso (£2,996) bond and 20,000 PHP (£300) processing fee each through their concert producer for their special work permits. 'The condition is intended to protect the public interest should the band members commit any violation during their stay in the Philippines,' the bureau's spokeswoman Elaine Tan said Thursday. She said the band will be prevented from performing if the producer fails to post the bond before the concert. This is the latest controversy for Zayn this week, after he was caught holding hands with a mystery blonde in Thailand. Zayn, who is engaged to Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards, 21, posted an apology on his Twitter account on Wednesday night, writing: 'I'm 22 years old... 'I love a girl named Perrie Edwards. And there's a lot of jealous f**s in this world I'm sorry for what it looks like x. One Direction is set to perform in Manila on March 21 and 22, and a producer is said to have visited the Immigration Bureau Thursday afternoon to post the bonds.","Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson to post bonds to enter Philippines .

"Hospitals have been told to free up their beds in the next two weeks in an attempt to head off an Easter bank holiday crisis in the NHS. GP surgeries have also been ordered to open on Easter Saturday to help take the strain from over-stretched A&E departments. Health officials anticipate that services already under pressure will struggle to keep up with demand this Easter. Hospitals have been warned to free up their beds over the next two weeks in an attempt to avert an Easter crisis in the NHS (file image) NHS England has drawn up emergency plans amid fears casualty departments will be unable to cope with high demand over the four-day break, which starts on April 3, while staff numbers are low. As many patients as possible must be discharged from hospital in the next fortnight so casualty departments will not be over capacity before the start of the bank holiday. The warnings come after hospitals suffered one of the worst performances on record over the Christmas holidays. Waiting times in emergency departments are at a record high, partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their GP. A memo from Barbara Hawkin, the NHS deputy chief executive, was sent out to all NHS trusts and groups of GPs. The unprecedented 11-point plan for GPs, hospitals and social services departments said it is ‘critical’ organisations have ‘resilience plans’ in order to cope with the mounting pressure. It means patients who go to A&E in desperation, because they are unable to get an appointment with a family doctor, will no longer clog up waiting times for emergency care. Over Christmas, 13 hospitals declared 'major incidents' when A&E units shut their doors to seriously ill patients. Pictured are ambulances queuing up outside the Royal Blackburn Hospital in January . The NHS was plunged into crisis over Christmas when 13 hospitals declared ‘major incidents’ and A&E units shut their doors to paramedics trying to bring in seriously ill patients. ‘Major incidents’ mean the hospitals have put in place emergency measures usually reserved for mass casualties such as those seen after airline crashes or terrorist attacks. Figures showed waiting times in England were at their worst in a decade – and that in the last three months of 2014 almost 21,000 patients had languished on trolleys for up to 12 hours. In one shocking case, an 81-year-old grandmother who had fallen in her home had to wait 11 hours for an ambulance and then had another 60-minute wait on a trolley in a hospital corridor. Some patients reported having to ‘fight’ their way into casualty units packed like ‘nightclubs’. It is feared that, with hospitals and GPs already struggling to meet targets, there could be another disastrous waiting time crisis this Easter. An NHS England spokesman said last night: ‘While we are pleased to have come through a difficult period, now is a good time to reinforce our message that we are resolved to driving up performance in the coming weeks and throughout the year.’","Hospitals have been told to free up their beds over the next two weeks .

"An undercover investigation in China has revealed the disgusting conditions in which a wildly popular snack known as 'Spicy Sticks' are made. The food - made from flour, spicy oil and food additives - is especially popular among young adults and children due to their cheap cost, but reports in the media of them causing extreme sickness have prompted concern. The snacks are popular among Chinese people living abroad, with thousands of people ordering them via online marketplaces such as Amazon - and there was even an online campaign recently to promote the red sticks among Westerners. Scroll down for video . Unhygienic: One worker had blistered fingers due to the chemicals, the undercover investigation found . Hands on: Very few workers wore protective gloves in making the Spicy Sticks . In China they sell for just 10p a pack and are a common sight in primary school tuck shops. The most popular brands sell more than 400,000 packets a month, solely online. But many consumers have reported suffering from severe sickness and diarrhoea after eating them, and one three-year-old girl was reportedly left with festering sores around her mouth after gorging on the snack. People's Daily Online reported that, during secret, filming at one of the many firms which produce the snack, investigators found one worker handling food with a finger that had blistered through exposure to the chemicals used in the process - without wearing protective gloves. At the factory in Tongxu County, Henan Province, an undercover reporter saw workers visit dirty lavatories and return to work without washing their hands - again without wearing gloves or face masks when handling food. This three-year-old girl allegedly developed sores and ulcers after eating too many of the snacks . Roaring trade: They are popular on online sites such as Amazon. (There is no suggestion the product pictured here was manufactured at the plant in the undercover filming) The finished product was also packed with bare hands, with workers' hands stained by the red oil that coats the food - leading at least one woman to suffer sores on her finger. When challenged as to why they weren't wearing gloves, staff said they slowed down their work. Boxes used to store the snacks were also seen covered in an oil-like substance, while a choking smell filled the entire site. Close to the production line were various boilers, pipes and a large metal drum filled with a reddish liquid that emitted a strange smell as well as a small bucket that was full of black sludge. The manufacturer, Kaifeng Jinsong Food Co, shared the premises with other businesses and there was evidence of paint particles spreading into the Spicy Stick workshop from a toymakers next door. It comes after a toddler in the city of Jiujiang was hospitalised with severe sores and ulcers which were caused by eating too many of the sticks, reports People's Daily Online. And one blogger claimed he suffered five hours of diarrhoea after eating 10 of the sticks in quick succession to test their effect. Stomach-turning: Many consumers have reported suffering from diarrhoea after eating Spicy Sticks . Stench: The undercover reporter said a vile smell came from vats holding chemicals like the one above . Campiagn: Chinese fans of the snack have been encouraging Westerners to try it and posting their comments online . Many consumers who have bought the snack online have also left comments reporting similar symptoms. Chinese fans of the snack had recently started an online campaign to make it popular with Westerners. A site showing pictures of Western workers in China eating the sticks - known in Mandarin as 'Latiao' - alongside their thoughts on them, gained a large following. Among the comments on the site were 'latiao is taking over the world' and 'We've found the weapon that will defeat America'. But the campaign that included plans to formally export the spicy snack abroad ended this week as quickly as it started, after the images of the manufacturing process emerged. Chinese media have reported several scares in the past in which the snack had been accused of being unhealthy and even causing cancer. The authorities claim they are working to crack down on breaches of hygiene and safety regulations among food producers. According to the latest report by China Food and Drug Administration, there were 15 brands of Spicy Stick on the banned foods list because they exceeded acceptable levels of acid, bacteria or other chemicals. In 2011, 53 manufacturers of the snack were ordered to shut down by the Beijing Food Safety Committee, but critics claim many firms continued to operate illegally under new aliases.

"Kate Moss has strutted her stuff on every catwalk going, but now it looks like she's passing the baton to her half-sister Lottie. Lottie Moss, 17, proved her worth as a fledgling model as she made her runway debut at Paris fashion week on Monday in the Sonia Rykiel autumn/winter 15 show. The young starlet showcased a velvet playsuit and ankle boots as she stomped down the runway behind fellow fashion royalty, Georgia May and Lizzy Jagger. Scroll down for video . Lottie Moss follows in her sister's  footsteps as she makes her Paris fashion week debut on Sonia Rykiel's catwalk in Paris on Monday . The show, which took place in the brand's Saint-Germain-des-Prés store, was the brainchild of artistic director, Julie de Libran, who joined the brand just under a year ago from Louis Vuitton. While this was Lottie's first runway show, she hasn't been short of high fashion campaigns since launching her modelling career. Lottie's first assignment was for a high-fashion editorial spread in the February issue of Dazed and Confused, the magazine co-founded by Jefferson Hack, Kate's ex-boyfriend and father of her daughter Lila Grace. She's starred on the glossy pages of i-D and Teen Vogue magazines, bagged a Red Valentino campaign and modelled in a Beats by Dr. Dre advert.

Lottie, pictured at December's Victoria's Secret show, has starred on the glossy pages of i-D and Teen Vogue . In July, she posed for Calvin Klein Jeans, 21 years after Kate did her first campaign with the brand. Lottie, based in London, is the daughter of Kate's father and his second wife Inger, and - like her sister - is signed to Storm Model Management. Standing at only 5ft 5in, Lottie is by far the shortest model on Storm's books and is a full two inches shorter even than Kate, who is also uncharacteristically diminutive for a model. The porcelain-featured teen signed with Storm when she was only 13 - a year younger than Kate was when she was discovered at New York's JFK airport in 1988 aged 14.

"Australian airlines will be required to have two crew in the cockpit of their planes at all times after the Germanwings tragedy that killed 150 passengers and crew. Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the rules will apply to any regular aircraft carrying 50 passengers or more and will 'take effect immediately'. French prosecutors allege Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of downed flight 4U9525, plunged his plane into an Alpine ravine on March 24 after locking his captain out of the cockpit. Qantas has announced that it is discussions with regulators over it's cockpit policies . ''Today's decision is a sensible, measured response that combines safeguarding the travelling public with the practical capabilities of the aviation sector,' Mr Truss said in a statement. A spokesman for Qantas, the nation's biggest airline, said the new arrangement would apply to Qantas, QantasLink, Network Aviation and Jetstar flights. 'When one pilot needs to leave the cockpit for any reason, another authorised person will occupy the jump seat,' the spokesman said. The spokesman said the airline has 'numerous layers of screening and support for pilots'. That includes medical checks, stress management training, confidential counselling and psychometric testing during recruitment. In the UK, a few airlines have announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines . Qantas have said that they are still considering whether or not their policies need to be tightened . In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia last week, Virgin Australia said their pilots also undergo medical exams. The airline said they are constantly in contact with regulatory bodies and have comprehensive measures in place on all flights to ensure the safety of guests and crew. However they said that those details were to remain confidential for security purposes . 'The Virgin Australia Group continuously undertakes detailed risk reviews, including consultation with the relevant regulatory and industry bodies. Any updates regarding changes to our processes will be provided where appropriate,' a Virgin spokesperson said. 'All Virgin Australia Group Pilots undertake regular aeromedical exams, which include mental health assessments.' Airlines and aviation regulators around the world last week began taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit. Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . In the UK, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic announced plans to change their aviation policy on staff numbers in the cockpit. Monarch and Thomas Cook also confirmed they had changed their policies, while Ryanair, Jet2 and Flybe said they already required two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times. Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons. A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures. Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet . 'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence. As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually. 'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards. 'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.' Doomed: The captain of the ill-fated flight - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter (file photo) 'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually . Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in Le Vernet near the French Alps today, as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives . Rescue: Helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered . Raid: German police have investigated Andreas Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf . Killer's home: A French prosecutor in Marseille said Mr Lubitz's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the French Alps .","Australian airlines will be required to have two crew in the cockpit at all times .

"A pastor and high school dean who is accused of shooting one of his students in the head was living a 'double life' as a gangster, prosecutors claim. Shaun Harrison, 55, preached non-violence at Boston English High School before he allegedly fired a bullet into the face of a 17-year-old who was said to be selling marijuana for him. It was the moment, prosecutors said, that his two lives - one as a teacher and one as a drug-pedaling gang member - merged. Harrison, a father of eight, appeared in court on Thursday to deny assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery, and unlawful possession of a firearm. 'Double life': Shaun Harrison, 55, allegedly has gang tattoos below his collar bone and is accused of using his students to sell drugs. He has pleaded not guilty to shooting one of his students in the face . The court heard that he allegedly shot one of his students in the face 'execution-style' and hid his 'gangster life' - including gang tattoos below his collar bone. The unnamed Boston English High School student survived and told police he had been selling marijuana for Shaun Harrison for the past several months, according to Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Michael Bradley. Bradley said the student had been told by Harrison, 55,  that they were on their way to a house where the student could pick up marijuana and girls on the night of the shooting. After Harrison's home was searched on Thursday police found an illegally-owned rifle and shotgun in his bedroom, which Bradley said the minister had told police were weapons he had inherited from his father. The father-of-eight is an ordained Baptist minister and was the 'dean of students' at Boston English High School. The student allegedly told police he was selling marijuana for Harrison for the past several months . Harrison only began working at Boston English High School at the beginning of January and served as a 'community or family outreach coordinator,' school spokeswoman Denise Snyder told the Boston Globe. She said he was unofficially recognized as the 'Dean of Students'. Harrison's defense attorney Kernahan Buck said he also ran anger management and substance abuse programs at the high school. He has since been fired from the high school, according to interim school superintendent John McDonough. The Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Harrison was an ordained Baptist minister who left the church, of which he was a member, in 2012 to form his own non-denominational church. Harrison ran anger management and substance abuse programs at theschool, where he has since been fired . Rev. Opal Adams, an associate pastor at the church, told the Boston Globe that Harrison did anti-violence work with young people in the community. Harrison's sister Susan believes he was 'setup'. 'My brother is a good man and I don't know how this happened,' she told the Boston Globe. Harrison's son Jeremy, an anti-violence activist who worked to keep kids off the street, was arrested after shooting his girlfriend in the head while cleaning his illegally-owned firearm in 2013. She was critically wounded, according to the Boston Herald. Harrison was charged on Thursday with assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery and unlawful possession of a firearm. His bail was set at $250,000 cash.","Shaun Harrison, 55, allegedly told student they were heading to a house where the teen could pick up weed and girls .

"He has acted opposite Mae West, tripped the light fantastic on The Great White Way and even partied with Rita Hayworth - and now Ryan is sharing his stories about life during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The only problem is that Ryan is a 10-year-old boy from Muskogee, Oklahoma who was born to Baptist parents. The amazing life he describes belongs to actor and Hollywood agent Marty Martin. Ryan says it was his past life. His vast knowledge, vivid recollections and stunningly accurate descriptions of the era have convinced even experts that the young man may have in fact been reincarnated. Scroll down for video . Ryan (above with his mother) a 10-year-old boy from Muskogee, Oklahoma with Baptist parents claims he has been reincarnated and was an actor and agent in a past life . He believes he was Marty Martin (left), who was in the Mae West (right) film Night After Night and performed on Broadway . It all began when Ryan was just 4 years old, his mother Cyndi told Today. She says he began having nightmares that neither she or her husband, a local police officer, could find a way to stop. He would talk about his heart exploding and, more than anything, Hollywood, a place that was thousands of miles away from Oklahoma. What's more, the reserved youngster would always speak in a matter-of-fact manner during these times. Then, after a year of this, he finally sat down his mom. 'He said ""Mom, I have something I need to tell you,""' said Cyndi. 'I used to be somebody else.' Having been raised Baptist, Cyndi did not believe in reincarnation or past lives, and decided to hide her son's admission from his father. But she slowly became curious and then somewhat convinced the more her son spoke of Hollywood, his five marriages, lavish trips to Europe, his old homes and how all his acting clients kept changing their last names, so she decided to start doing some research on Hollywood during the studio era and shared some of the books she found at the local library with her son. Then, one day, Ryan had a breakthrough when he saw a still from the from the 1932 movie Night After Night starring Mae West. 'That's me,' Ryan told his mother. Ryan began seeing Dr. Jim Tucker (above) soon after he revealed his past life, a highly respected child psychiatrist who works with children who remember past lives, and does not think Ryan is lying . Ryan also recalls parting with Rita Hayworth (above) when he was Martin . Ryan's father (center) is a local police officer and neither her nor his wife knew anything about old Hollywood . Ryan was pointing to an extra in the film, a man with no lines that they later learned was bit-actor-turned-agent Marty Martin. That is when Cyndi decided Ryan should talk to someone, and the family found Dr. Jim Tucker, a highly respected child psychiatrist from the University of Virginia who has spent time talking with and studying children who claim to remember past lives. And even he noted there was something very special, and different, about Ryan. Most remarkable to Dr. Tucker, besides Ryan's incredible detail, was how accurate his claims matched up with the life of Martin, a virtual unknown who neither Ryan's family nor Dr. Tucker knew anything about, even his name, until they reached out to a film archivist. The film archivist gave them the name, and they then contacted one of Martin's daughters to ask about his life. That is when they discovered that 55 of Ryan's statements matched up perfectly with Martin's life - including the street he lived on, how many children he had, how many siblings he had and those aforementioned five marriages. The most shocking claim however came when Ryan told Dr. Tucker during a session one day that he wondered why God had him die at 61-years-old only to be reincarnated as a baby. This seemed to clash with Martin's death report, that stated he was 59 at the time he died. That is until Dr. Tucker looked through old census reports and discovered that the certificate, and not Ryan, was incorrect. The certificate claimed Martin was born in 1905 when in fact he had been born in 1903 according to the census. And so, Martin was likely 61 years old at the time of his death. Ryan now says his memories of Martin are starting to fade, and as for Dr. Tucker, he has compiled Ryan's story and other like it in his book Return To Life.","Ryan, 10, a boy from Muskogee, Oklahoma, with Baptist parents claims he has been reincarnated and was an actor and agent in a past life .

Even Dr. Tucker was amazed by Ryan's story, and found that 55 of his details match perfectly with Martin's life .

Ryan also knew the year Martin was born, even though it was listed incorrectly on his public death certificate ."
"Jamie Oliver has re-ignited his feud with fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay by accusing him of being 'deeply jealous' of his success. The 39-year-old hit out at his Scottish rival after Ramsay criticised him for not attending the opening of his new restaurant - Jamie's Italian - in Hong Kong. Ramsay, 48, who previously opened his own Bread Street Kitchen in the Asian city, said Oliver could have 'at least turned up' to unveil his new eatery. Scroll down for video . Jamie Oliver (left) has hit out at fellow celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, claiming he is 'deeply jealous' of his success. It comes after Ramsay criticised Oliver for not attending the Hong Kong opening of his restaurant . Oliver responded to the comments during a visit to open a new restaurant in Sydney, Australia, this week by claiming Ramsay was simply jealous. He said: 'Gordon will do anything to try and take the p**s out of me because he is deeply jealous and can't quite work out why I do what I do and why he can't do that. 'He is too busy shouting and screaming and making our industry look like a bunch of shouters and screamers.' Oliver and his wife Jules have seen their fortune leap £90million to in excess of £240million with their restaurant chains, TV appearances and her childrenswear range. Meanwhile Ramsay's fortune is said to be valued at more than £100million with his worldwide chain of restaurants. The pair have often made snide comments at each other, and it didn't stop this week when Oliver continued to criticise his rival over their books. Oliver's 15th book, Save With Jamie, shot to the top of the UK bestsellers list upon its release, bringing his total number of book sales to just over 37million. In contrast, Ramsay has released 21 titles which have sold an estimate three million copies in total. Oliver said: 'I think that really, really annoys him. Ramsay is currently in the U.S. with his wife Tana and four daughters (pictured at the Kids' Choice Awards) Jamie and Jools Oliver have an estimated combined fortune of more than £240million from their ventures . 'Book sales are about having a deep trusted relationship with the public. I really write my books. I don't just turn up for the front cover. I write every word, every letter and I oversee every bit of design. 'You can sell a few books by luck or a moment ... but not 15 years and 37million books. That's not luck.' The two celebrity chefs - who both have four children - have previously clashed over their differing styles. In 2010, while on a promotional tour of Canada, Ramsay said Oliver was 'just a cook' while he proclaimed himself to be 'a chef'. A year earlier, he admitted he was not a fan of Oliver, describing him as a 'one-pot wonder.' He said: 'Everything kind of gets mixed in - hands in. It's a very different style to me. He sticks it in the oven, comes back three hours later and it's done. Chefs Oliver and Ramsay (pictured together in 2006) have often exchanged fraught words over the years . Oliver made the comments during an appearance in Sydney, Australia, to open a new restaurant this week . 'We cook differently. I use basic ingredients taken up with a lot more excitement. 'But competition is healthy. It's good to have that kind of rivalry.' He also asked when he had last complained about a meal and answered: 'Last time I had dinner at Jamie Oliver's restaurant.' But Oliver has continued to stand his ground, and even praised the wife of Ramsay's wife Tana. He said: 'If I was to choose between buying Gordon Ramsay's cookbook or Tana Ramsay's, it would be Tana's every time. 'In my opinion, her books are a damn sight better than his.'","Jamie Oliver claims rival Gordon Ramsay is 'deeply jealous' of his success .

"Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog . A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct. A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board. The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress. Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints. Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home. A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again. Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously. She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances. 'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job. 'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again. 'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom. 'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare. 'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right. 'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.' The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'. After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later. During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute. Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'. Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice. 'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings. 'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.' Ms Davies had raised issues at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators £3,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'. In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years. 'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said. NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'. He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating. 'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue. 'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.' Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'. Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order. It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress. Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'","Teacher Kim Davies made more than 20 complaints against a colleague .

Wright had left his three children with a babysitter on Sunday while he went to work. They were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house. 'I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,' Wright told KXLY-TV. Sheriff's deputies said the man talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. Surveillance video from a grocery store showed the kidnapper running, child in arms, with Delicia chasing and Brenden not far behind.

The designer's say the technology used in their dresses helps minimise clamminess with breathable fibres and wicks away moisture much quicker than wool or cotton. The larger surface area of the fibres in their dresses apparently allows for faster evaporation by speeding moisture away from the skin to the surface of the fabric where it can evaporate quickly. Dresses from the 'warm collection' are made with fabrics that claim to keep you twice as warm as wool or cotton using material inspired by polar bear fur .

"An African-American woman who accused Bill Cosby of rape dating back to the 1980s in November has revealed that her race weighed heavily on her decision to come forward with allegations. In an op-ed published on Friday, former model Jewel Allison claimed Cosby forced himself upon her after inviting her to dinner and slipping something into her wine, which made her ill. She wrote that after other accusers came forward, she was not relieved, but instead terrified. Jewel Allison (right, next to Cosby) was a young model when she met Bill Cosby in the late 1980s. She claims that the TV star (left) sexually assaulted her at his home during a dinner . 'As an African-American woman, I felt the stakes were even higher. Historic images of black men being vilified en masse as sexually violent sent chills through my body,' she wrote in the Washington Post. Allison claimed that the night of the dinner party Cosby grabbed her hand and placed it on his genitals. 'That was my sexual assault by this comedian,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He turned me around and said, ""Let's get you home"". At the door, he gave me a very hard embrace and a hard kiss.' She remembers vomiting in the back seat of a cab on the way home. Cosby invited her over again but she declined. Allison in her modeling days (pictured left) and right, more recently. In a recent op-ed with the Washington Post, the former model said that her race weight heavily on her decision to come forward with allegations against Cosby . Speaking about the alleged assault to the Daily News in November, Allison said: 'We may be looking at America's greatest serial rapist that ever got away with this for the longest amount of time. 'He got away with it because he was hiding behind the image of Cliff Huxtable.' But in her op-ed with the Post she said that coming forward with her story would help bring down the entertainer, but she 'feared it would undermine the entire African-American community'. Allison wrote that she didn't come out with her accusations earlier because she didn't want to see 'yet another African-American man vilified in the media'. She said she didn't know if her loyalty should lie with 'women who were sexually victimized or with black America, which has been systematically victimized'. About three dozen women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1960s. The comedian has denied all claims . Like many in America, she watched The Cosby Show, and saw the Dr Huxtable character as a 'much-needed wholesome model of success'. The image of who she saw playing the man swiftly changed on the night she claims he raped her. She concludes her essay by explaining that though Cosby was a source of hope for many, 'fictional icons like him should not wield so much power over our collective spirit'. She adds that though she feared coming forward, 'The only legacy at stake is of one entertainer, not of black manhood, as I once feared'. Attorneys for Cosby asked a federal court judge on Friday to dismiss a defamation suit filed against the comedian in Massachusetts by three women who said he called them liars when they accused him of sexual assault. About three dozen women have accused Cosby, 77, of sexual misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1960s. The comedian has denied all the claims, most of which have seen the statute of limitations run out.","Jewel Allison claimed in November that Cosby forced himself on her in 1980s .

"George Osborne today refused to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT as a row erupted over how to balance the books after the election. The Chancellor declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT over the five years of the next Parliament. It came after Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls that Conservatives had a history of raising VAT after elections despite saying they had no plans to do so during the campaign. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne declined to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' to match Labour's pledge not to increase VAT from 20 per cent over the five years of the next Parliament . Appearing before the Commons Treasury Committee, Mr Osborne was repeatedly challenged to match Labour's promise but refused to do so . Labour today unveiled a new poster warning of Tory VAT hikes after the election. The headline rate of VAT stands at 20 per cent after Mr Osborne increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency Budget in 2010. Mr Balls claimed that another rise after the election on May was 'the only way the Tories can make their sums add up'. Launching a new Labour poster, Mr Balls said: 'We will make our tax commitments in full in our manifesto. But I am clear that while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, working people are paying more in tax after the last five years of the Tories. 'So, today, I can announce a clear pledge to the British people. The next Labour government will not raise VAT. And we will not extend it to food, children's clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares. 'We will not raise VAT because it's the tax that hits everyone. It's the tax that hits you every day. And it hits pensioners and the poorest hardest.' In the Houses of Parliament today, Mr Osborne was repeatedly challenged to match the promise but refused to do so. Labour MP John Mann asked the Chancellor four times to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' that he would not hike the tax. A second Labour MP, Andy Love, also twice pressed the Chancellor over whether VAT would have to rise. Labour's shadow chancellor unveiled a new poster warning 'the Tories will raise VAT' to help balance the books . In his responses, Mr Osborne said he did not intend to increase the tax but stopped short of an actual pledge to rule it out. He told Mr Love: 'I have identified where the £30 billion of savings I believe need to come from and they don't involve a VAT rise. 'The question for those who say they are going to try to balance the books but say it mainly has to be done through tax, as the official Opposition does, has to spell out what those big tax rises are. 'And it's pretty clear today that they have opened to door to a big increase in National Insurance and the `jobs tax' and I think it would be very, very damaging for this country.' To Mr Mann, the Chancellor said: 'We don't need to increase VAT. I couldn't be clearer. We do not need to increase VAT because our plans involve saving money on the welfare budget and Government departments.' In a jibe at Mr Osborne's former membership of an Oxford University dining club, the Labour MP retorted: 'Your answers are more Bullingdon than Bassetlaw. In Bassetlaw, we like straight John Bull.' And reviving memories of Mr Osborne's 'omnishambles budget' of 2012, he offered the Chancellor a Gregg's pasty to give him the strength to respond more fully. Mr Balls claimed the Tories 'have a secret plan to raise VAT again' But Mr Osborne stuck to his position: 'The policies we have do not involve a VAT rise ... Our proposals, our spending plans, our policies, do not involve tax rises. They don't therefore involve a VAT rise. However, your proposals do involve tax increases. You have been quite open about that. That means it is either VAT or jobs tax or income tax. 'That's what people will get if they vote Labour. But of course they won't vote Labour because they remember what you did last time.' Mr Mann retorted: 'The pasty-eaters will beware again.' Mr Balls, who believes Gordon Brown's refusal to accept his calls for a pledge not to raise VAT contributed to Labour's defeat in 2010, said he would 'resign rather than break this promise'. Speaking in Birmingham - in front of a new poster featuring the letters VAT as concrete blocks with the slogan 'Don't let the Tories hit you with this' - Mr Balls said the unannounced rise from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent after the 2010 election had cost families an average £1,800 over four years. It was put up 'despite David Cameron telling the British people a few days before the election that he had 'no plans' to do so and despite the promises of Nick Clegg', he said - and had been raised by every Conservative administration for 40 years. 'Now history is repeating itself all over again. It's the same Tory lie about VAT: 1979, 1992, 2010 and now 2015. 'Everybody in the country knows what it means: the Tories have a secret plan to raise VAT again.' Treasury figures suggested a rise to 22.5% would cost a family with children an average of GBP450 a year and a pensioner couple GBP275 a year, he said - something a Labour administration would not allow. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have repeatedly said they will raise taxes. It is time that they came clean with the British public about which taxes they will raise - income tax or national insurance? 'The choice at this election is becoming clearer by the day: sticking with the competence of the Conservatives' long-term economic plan that's securing a better future for Britain or abandoning that plan with hard-working taxpayers paying the price for the economic chaos that would result from Ed Miliband in Downing Street.' Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'Labour have no credibility on the economy. Ed Balls might be ruling out a rise in VAT but he can't rule out a rise in National Insurance and already plans to hike corporation tax. 'Because the Liberal Democrats have taken the difficult decisions to stick to a balanced recovery, under our future plans there is no need to raise income tax, National Insurance, VAT or corporation tax.'","Labour's Ed Balls unveils poster warning Tories will hike VAT again .

"The FBI has found an underground bunker east of Seattle believed to have been used by a bank robber who spent nearly five years on the run before he was arrested last summer. Bradley Robinett, 46, is one of America's most notorious criminals, and featured in an episode of the TV program America's Most Wanted in 2011. In addition to robbery and car theft, he was convicted of the unlawful possession of a machine gun, and served seven years in prison before escaping in 2009. A former Marine, expert survivalist and woodsman, he is known for hiding in makeshift shelters and bunkers in the forest and burying large stashes of weapons. Scroll down for video . Uncovered: The bunker, used by armed robber Bradley Robinett, 46, was discovered by the FBI. The former Marine, one of America's most notorious criminals who featured in an episode of the TV program America's Most Wanted in 2011, was arrested last year after five years on the run . Bunker: The US attorney and the FBI hold a joint tour of the underground survivalist bunker east of Lake Sammamish that was used by Robinette, among with others, to store supplies and weaposn while he was on the run . Forensic: An officer inspects the underground hideout used by the fugitive Bradley Robinett before his arrest in 2014 . While on the run, he avoided capture by ramming a police patrol car and escaping in a stolen kayak. FBI spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-Williams confirmed that investigators hauled 'between 15 and 20' large, sealed bins, which officers are meticulously investigating in the search for further clues. Caught: Former US Marine Bradley Robinett, 46, is one of America's most notorious criminals . The cramped bunker, which is accessed by a concealed hatch and is eight feet wide and ten feet long, was equipped with a rudimentary bed, plastic bags, and a storage area filled with soda. It also contained a pair of sneakers, and there were unconfirmed reports that jewelry and weapons were found. Local reporters expressed shock at the discovery, as the hideout is located just five minutes' hike from the busy Monterre residential complex, on the shores of Lake Sammamish. The bunker is scheduled for demolition once the forensic team has concluded its investigations. Court documents reveal that Robinett led FBI agents  to the bunker as part of a plea agreement, the Seattle Times reported. The FBI has said that Robinett identified a further two bunkers that have not yet been investigated. Agents also appealed to the public for help in finding Robinett's other bunkers and hidden caches of weapons. Robinett's life of crime began after he was dishonourably discharged from the Marines for alleged theft. In 1998, he robbed a branch of Bank of America in Tigard, Ohio, escaping with about $50,000 in cash. He went to ground, and in 2003 managed to steal a firearm and bulletproof vest from a police patrol car in Seattle. Later that year, he was arrested while driving a stolen car, and it was discovered that he was the main suspect in the bank robbery. He was convicted of multiple counts, including the unlawful use of firearms and possession of stolen property. He was released from prison in 2009, and told to serve his probation at a halfway house in Seattle, Washington. However, he absconded and went on the run again. Going underground: The bunker was in a dilapidated state, and could have been unused for up to 10 years . On the run: A pair of Bradley Robinett's sneakers were recovered at the scene . According to the America's Most Wanted program, Robinett stole multiple car keys, copied them and replaced them, meaning that he had constant access to a number of vehicles at very short notice. Later that year he was stopped driving a stolen car but fled on foot, eventually making his escape by paddling 10 miles across the Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, in a stolen kayak. A police-issue firearm and body armour were found in the car, and matched with the items that Robinett had stolen years before. In November 2009, Robinett was once again apprehended driving a stolen vehicle by Washington State Patrol detectives at a park-and-ride facility in Bellevue, King County, Washington. This time, he attempted to ram the patrol car. Although the trooper driving the vehicle managed to avoid the collision, Robinett was able to escape on foot, the Sammamish Review reported. Robinett was finally captured in June 2014 by police tracking stolen vehicles in Hillsboro, Oregon. According to the Seattle Times, he pleaded guilty in January to multiple federal charges, including interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, being a felon in possession of a firearm and escape. It is understood that Robinett led the FBI to the bunker as part of a plea bargain. His attorneys have agreed with prosecutors that he should serve a sentence of between 12 and 14 years. Robinett is due to be sentenced on 4 May by US District Judge James Robart. Suplplies: Cans of soda were stashed in the hideout, and 'between 15 and 20' large bins were removed for examination .

"A Texas convenience store clerk who was kidnapped and beaten unconscious Tuesday passed away this afternoon after his family asked his doctors to have him taken off life support. Kevin Garcia, 55, was assaulted and kidnapped from Drew’s Exxon in College Station before dawn Tuesday. Police were dispatched after a customer found the gas station convenience store empty. Scroll down for video . Tragic end: Kevin Garcia (left), 55, a clerk at a Texas gas station, was taken off life support Thursday, three days after police say Nathaniel Tillery (right), 36, assaulted and kidnapped him . Brazen abduction: After beating the store clerk unconscious, the  suspect allegedly threw him into the bed of his own pickup truck . Getaway: After beating the store clerk unconscious, the 36-year-old suspect threw him into the bed of his truck . Bumpy ride: A bleeding Garcia spent 10 hours being bounced around the back of his truck before he was rescued 200 miles away . Hours later, Garcia was rescued by police in Fort Worth, 200 miles away from his store. The man was found unconscious and bloodied in the bed of his truck and rushed to John Peter Smith Hospital. The suspect, Nathaniel Tillery, 36, was arrested nearby and later charged with robbery, kidnapping and assault. Garcia's older sister, Denise Etherton, and her husband, Bill, had been by the victim’s side since Tuesday afternoon, praying for a miracle against overwhelming odds. 'He hasn’t been conscious since they found him,' Mrs Etherton said earlier Thursday. 'He’s completely out.' According to Etherton, her baby brother, who was adopted by their parents at age nine, suffered severe head trauma after being deprived of oxygen for more than 10 hours. Grisly crime scene: A pool of blood was found in the parking lot of Drew's Exxon in College Station . Cornered: Tillery's stepbrother called 911 and led police to a location along the Tijuana Trail in suburban Fort Worth, where officers apprehended the alleged attacker . Yesterday afternoon, the comatose patient's family met with his doctors to discuss his prospects. Upon learning that Kevin Garcia will most likely never recover, Denise Etherton made the difficult decision to take her brother off the ventilator. 'Kevin would want quality of life,' she later said. Officials at the hospital stated to Fort Worth Star-Telegram that Garcia was pronounced dead at 1.36pm. His sister said her sibling was an organ donor, and she hopes in his death Kevin will be able to help others. The 55-year-old had worked at the Exxon station off Highway 6 in College Station for 15 years and was recently divorced. His sister tearfully recalled that not long before his abduction, Garcia was doing some dental work to improve his appearance because, he told her, he was hoping to meet someone. 'He didn't want to be alone,' Denise Etherton told KBTX. 'He didn't want to die alone.' At around 3am Tuesday, Garcia was cleaning the parking lot outside his store when police say Nathaniel Tillery attacked him. After beating the store clerk unconscious, the 36-year-old suspect threw him into the bed of his truck and entered the gas station store hoping to steal money from the cash register, but he failed to open it. Toughest decision: Denise Etherton (left), Garcia's baby sister, decided to pull the plug Thursday night after learning from her comatose brother's doctors that he will not recover . Targeted: The deadly assault was the second time that Garcia has been attacked on the job in as many years . He then got behind the wheel of the truck, with a battered Garcia still in the back, and drove him 190 miles to suburban Fort Worth, where his family live. At around 1pm Tuesday, Tillery's stepbrother called 911 and led police to a location along Tijuana Trail, where shortly after they located the truck and the alleged assailant, reportedCBS DFW. Past offenses: Tillery has a lengthy criminal record dating back to the 1990s, including a conviction on an intoxicated assault charge . Denise Etherton believes that Kevin would have had a better chance of survival had Tillery left him in the parking lot in College Station instead of having him bouncing around the bed of the truck for 10 hours. ‘If he had been left on the ground, take the truck, he would have been found an hour later, instead of being found 11 or 12 hours later,’ the heartbroken sister told NBC DFW. The deadly assault was the second time that Garcia has been attacked on the job in as many years. In 2013, two robbers beat up the store clerk with brass knuckles, leaving him with head injuries. One of the assailants was later sentenced to 17 years in prison after entering a guilty plea, while the other is still awaiting trial. Investigators believe Garcia and Tillery did not know one another. However, an employee at Drew's Exxon told police that Tillery, who has been seen around the area, once confided in him that a truck and $2,000 would 'make his life better.' On Thursday, Tillery was transferred from Tarrant County to the Brazos County Jail, where he is being held on $520,000 bail. The 36-year-old has a lengthy criminal record dating back to the 1990s, according to The Eagle, including a conviction on an intoxicated assault charge in 2001 that landed him behind bars for eight years. Bill Etherton, Garcia's brother-in-law, had some harsh words about the suspected assailant in an interview with the local CBS affiliate. ‘As far as I’m concerned, they can tie him to the back of the pickup truck and drag him back to Bryan. I don’t care,’ he stated.","Kevin Garcia's family asked doctors Thursday night to take him off life support, three days after he was attacked in College Station, Texas .

"A woman who described herself as a 'good girl' and had been married to the same man for 17 years has spoken about her 'year off' trying an open marriage. Writer Robin Rinaldi, now 50, slept with ten men and two women during her year of promiscuity in 2008, but  is now divorced from her husband. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Robin opened up about her unorthodox decision, which she says was triggered by her husband's vasectomy. Scroll down for video . Appearing on ITV's This Morning Robin Rinaldi, now 50, opened up about her unorthodox lifestyle . Robin was content in marriage for years - but she wanted kids and he didn't she decided to try an open marriage' The arrangement which she described as '5:2 marriage' involved spending weekdays sleeping with strangers and weekends with her husband. 'I would say before the year I was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied, normal loving relationship,' she said of her 17 year marriage to Scott Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker. 'But when I got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and I knew the discussion of having a baby was over, which kick-started this experience,' she explained. 'I looked forward to my death bed and thought. ""What will I have?"" I won’t have children and grandchildren. Will I at least have lived fully?""' 'If I couldn’t have one I wanted the other,' she explained. 'Like a lot of women at that age I was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that I wasn’t going to have children. It was the perfect storm. Robino said having 'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city' 'WIld oats': Robin, 50, negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years, which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship . 'I have had lots of people telling me I should have travelled the world, tried painting classes or cooking – but I already know how to cook!' She also said having 'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city'. 'I was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation, ' she said. 'So I thought OK whilst we do that I need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same.' Under the terms of her new deal, Rinaldi took out an apartment, where she lived from Monday to Friday and would bed her conquests. But over the weekend she would go back to Mansfield, and the two would live as a married couple, without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart. 'The ground rules were safe sex, not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances,' she explained. 'But at the end of the year, we each broke two rules.' To find willing participants in her project Robin decided not to pick up men at bars, but to be more strategic in her search. 'I was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had I picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand,' she explains. 'So I felt like going about it in a more clear-headed, conscious way.' Robin posted an online ad, entitled Good Girl Seeks Experience. In the post, she wrote: 'I'm a 44-year-old professional, educated, attractive woman in an open marriage, seeking single men age 35-50 to help me explore my sexuality.' 'I said I wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks. I explained that if it led to sex then great, but that I couldn’t get seriously involved or see them more than a few times.' The next day, Robin had 23 offers and over the course of the year had 12 sexual partners, including two women. Struggle: Robin said her husband, Scott Mansfield, right, was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children, driving her to want lovers instead . So would she advise it? ‘Not if you want to stay married,' she told This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden. 'Read my book instead and have an armchair adventure.' 'I was well aware it would be very risky – but I didn’t think we had that much to lose. 'This 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle. 'That happened at first,' she said, but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart. Account: Rinaldi describes every step of the 'project' in intimate detail in her newly-released book, The Wild Oats Project . 'It was hard to put it all back in the box,' she exlained. Robin, who made the life-changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008, has written a book about her exploits called The Wild Oats Project. In the book she describes her relationship with Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker, as 'stuck in a rut', adding that 'our once-a-week sex life was loving, but lacked spontaneity and passion'. Recounting her exploits in her book, Robin described her first encounter with a 40-year-old lawyer, whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date: 'We stumbled to the bed, where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind. 'We had intercourse twice and, after he left, I felt satiated.' She later moved on to much younger men, and described texting her husband goodnight from a Las Vegas hotel room moments after a 23-year-old paramour left the room. Two of her 12 encounters were with women, one of which was a threesome. Describing another encounter, she writes explicitly about taking a new-found pleasure in fellatio. However, after the raucous year, Rinaldi admitted, she could not turn back. Attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and Rinaldi began sleeping with one of the men from the past year, whom she refers to by a pseudonym. She wrote: 'The turning point was hearing from Alden. He sent me an e-mail, out of the blue, several months after the project had come to an end. 'Before long, we were having sex again. Being with him was exquisite. After reconnecting with Alden and falling deeply in love with him, there was no going back.' Irretrievable: After Rinaldi's year of uninhibited encounters, she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with Mansfield, and the two now have different partners . Rinaldi has now lived with 'Alden' for five years in a monogamous relationship, while Mansfield has also moved on. The former couple now consider themselves at peace - and Mansfield was even happy with her writing the book, detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her previously secret exploits with other men. Speaking to the Daily Beast about how he responded to the book, she said: 'His response was, ""You have to write it. If you write it well, it won’t really be about us, it will be about lots of marriages.""'","'Good girl' writer Robin Rinaldi, 50, was with Scott Mansfield since 1990s .

"A father of a 12-year-old girl who he married off in an Islamic ceremony told his daughter told his daughter not to take the contractive pill because it 'causes breast cancer'.

'He was upset because we might be in trouble,' the girl said. '(My father) knows no marriage under the age of 16. 'Because he says to me the law here is stupid, girls your age should be allowed to get married and have intercourse. 'He said we didn't do anything wrong, we were just following religion.' Her father said her husband, now 27, 'shouldn't be put away', and that they were 'just following religion'. The girl, now 14, said in her father's religion, marriage was allowed once the girl got her period and having sex before marriage was punishable by stoning or death in Islamic countries. '(Premarital sex) is actually one of the worst things you can do,' she said. The court also heard the girl and her husband had sex 'once or twice' a day after they were married. They also spent five nights staying at her father's house. The girl also detailed the motivation for the marriage being organised, which was her reaching puberty. In the video interview shown to the court, she said she understood puberty to be 'blood...when I got my period'. She also said her father told her not to take birth control pills, and that her father reminded her not to let her husband wear a condom. 'Don't use pills or condoms - don't let him use anything,' she said. 'He always said that - I think the first time was just after we got married.' The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney, she strongly disagreed with the marriage to a 26-year-old man (pictured) The court also heard her 'husband' approached her father about the marriage after he had been refused by leaders at her usual mosque. 'They said no because of my age and because I was Aussie,' she said. 'After he went to sheiks, after a while he came back and asked my Dad.' Her comments come after her mother said she had pleaded with the father to stop the wedding. The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney she strongly opposed the marriage. She said her former husband - with whom she had split before the incident - called her on what she believed to be the night of her daughter's wedding. 'He said (my daughter) is going to get married; they wanted to bring the man to meet me,' the mother told the court. 'I said no. I did not want anything to do with (my daughter) getting married.' The woman said she then spoke to her daughter and told her not to get married and the girl said she wouldn't. 'He wanted her to be married or he wouldn't have married her,' she said. 'I didn't agree with it, I had nothing to do with it.' The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct . The woman's former partner, a 63-year-old man, allegedly married his teen daughter off to a 26-year-old man so she did not commit the sin of extramarital sex. The father allegedly gave his daughter's mobile phone number to the 26-year-old man who wanted to marry her and then hosted an Islamic ceremony at his home in the Hunter region. The court heard the mother received a second call from her former partner that night, during which he used his 'angry voice'. 'He said she was going to get married no matter what, that next time I saw her she would be married,' the woman said. 'I just didn't agree with them getting married. 'I know it was him on the other end of the phone; I know his voice because I had to put up with it for 20 years.' The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct. 'I don't have any trouble remembering the conversations,' she said. 'They did not have my consent. I was not at the wedding. I did not allow it. '(He's) a liar; he is not going to admit to anything. 'What he said is what he said - I didn't add anything or forget anything.' She said she found out they couple had been married under Sharia law when the Department of Community Services got involved after the girl's husband tried to enrol her in a Sydney High school. The mother also told the court she briefly converted to Islam during their relationship, the religion of her husband, because she 'was interested in learning about God, and that was the only one he would let me learn about'. She also lashed out at the father's barrister after it was suggested her memory issues caused by her learning difficulty may have led to her remembering a conversation that never took place. 'Who's going to forget that,' the mother said. 'I'm not happy about my daughter being married in the first place so don't have a go at me.' When Judge Deborah Sweeney attempted to calm her and said the barrister was just doing his job asking questions, the woman asked if the barrister was a Muslim. 'Because if he's Muslim then you got to do what the man says, because the woman is always a liar.' Crown prosecutor ­Siobhan Herbert earlier told the court the father hosted the couple at his home, where they allegedly had sex on a specially set up mattress. The father's trial comes after the husband, now 27, was jailed for seven and a half years earlier this month for persistent sexual abuse against the young girl. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013 after he approached her father and asked to meet her. The girl was pregnant when her 27-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse . 'By her getting married he was stopping the sin of extramarital sex,' Ms Herbert said. 'His actions brought about or caused the unlawful sexual activity.' On the wedding day, he allegedly instructed the girl that neither she nor her partner were allowed to use contraception. On the first weekend after the wedding, the court heard the father hosted the couple at his home where he allegedly arranged a marital bed. The following morning, he asked his daughter if she needed to shower before prayers, in line with Islamic practice after sexual intercourse, the court was told . The father allegedly consented to the wedding, in January 2014, after discovering his daughter had begun menstruating and becoming interested in boys. Judge Deborah Sweeney said  the 27-year-old Lebanese man, who cannot be named, had persisted in pursuing his Australian victim despite her initial reluctance. The  girl was pregnant when her 27-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. However, she miscarried in February after complaining of abdominal pain . The pair held their 'wedding', which was allegedly arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW, in January last year. It is alleged the man gave the child $500 as a wedding gift. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, court papers stated. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013  after he approached her father and asked to meet her. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The Imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states.

"All charges against Debra Jean Milke were dismissed today -  25 years after she was convicted and sentenced to die for the brutal murder of her four-year-old son. Milke was released from jail in 2013 after 22 years on Arizona's death row, but still faced the possibility of a retrial and remained free on bail with an electronic monitoring bracelet. On Monday, Maricopa County Superior Court before Judge Rosa Mroz found that there was not enough evidence to take the case against Milke to trial. She ordered the charges dismissed with prejudice - meaning she cannot be re-tried. Scroll down for video . Debra Milke, pictured Monday in court, had murder charges against her dismissed - 25 years after she was convicted and sentenced to die . Milke leaned in for a hug with her attorney Lori Voepel (right) on Monday after she was finally cleared of all charges in the murder of her son . Milke sobbed and hugged her attorney and supporters as she left the courtroom on Monday - ending a 25-year legal ordeal . Milke was convicted of plotting with two friends to kill her son Christopher, who was led into the desert and shot three times in the back of the head . The judge also ordered probation officers to remove her electronic monitoring bracelet and close out Milke's case. The hearing took just two minutes, according to KSAZ-TV. Milke, 51, hugged her lawyer and her supporters and sobbed as she left the courtroom today. Milke's conviction was based almost entirely on Phoenix police Detective Armando Saldate's claims that she had confessed to him that she plotted to killed her son Christopher. The confession was never recorded and it was later revealed that Saldate had a history of lying under oath and violating the rights of suspects. In December 1989, Milke dressed her son in his favorite outfit and sent him off to the mall to see Santa Claus in the care of her roommate, James Styers. Styers later picked up Roger Scott and the two men drove Christopher into the desert and shot him three times in the back of the head. James Styers and Roger Scott are on death row for the horrific murder of Christopher. They have both denied that Milke had anything to do with the killing . Debra Milke (pictured in a prison mug shot) denied that she ever confessed and fought for her innocence. Christopher was wearing his favorite outfit when he was murdered . Detective Armando Saldate claimed that Milke confessed to him - but never recorded the confession. His testimony sent her to death row. It was later discredited . Prosecutors argued that Milke no longer wanted Christopher, but hated his father so much that she didn't want to give up custody of the boy. At the time of his arrest, Scott claimed that Milke had discussed splitting the boy's $50,000 life insurance policy with him - but later recanted that statement. Styers and Scott were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder. The refused to testify against Milke and now maintain she had nothing to do with the little boy's death. Both men are awaiting execution. In 2013, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction and sentence of death, finding that the . Judge Mroz, when she ordered Milke's release, said allegations of Saldate's past misconduct 'cast serious doubts on the validity of the Defendant’s alleged confession.' Saldate, who has since retired from the police force, said previously that he would not testify at a retrial of Milke. Prosecutors had tried to force Saldate to testify at the re-trial and set a new trial date for her, but the Arizona Supreme Court rejected the request. Milke has filed a lawsuit against Phoenix, Maricopa County and several officials and investigators involved in her conviction. She says she was the victim of malicious prosecution.","Debra Jean Milke had been free on bail since her conviction was overturned in 2013 .

"Doctors say a 45-minute epileptic seizure may have caused a transgender woman to revert back to being a man. A new psychiatric study has described how an unnamed Australian man, aged in his mid 30s, had believed he was really a woman since he was four-years-old. The patient received breast augmentations, hormonal treatment and facial surgery to appear more feminine in her mid-30s. But after suffering the seizure, the transgender woman radically changed her mind about her gender - and her psychiatrist said it may be because the fit triggered biological changes. Scroll down for video . The unnamed man received facial surgery so he could appear more feminine (file photo). He did not have facial surgery . In a medical journal, psychiatrist Dr John Parkinson wrote: 'It may be that the prolonged seizure affected whatever biological structures serve to confer gender identity and personality structure' 'A firm decision was soon made to revert to male identity,' retired Wollongong psychiatrist Dr John Parkinson wrote in the latest edition of the medical journal Australasian Psychiatry. Dr Parkinson said the seizure may have changed the 'biological structures' that gave the man his sense of gender. Do you know more? daniel.piotrowski@mailonline.com . The man had not had surgery to his genitals. However, he was out of money after spending so much money on breast enhancement surgery. 'A delighted mother came to the rescue and within six months the augmentation had been reversed,' Dr Parkinson wrote in the journal. The epileptic fit caused further profound changes in the man's personality. He stopped abusing drugs and alcohol and no longer showed signs of suffering Borderline personality disorder, the study said. The man had suffered a brain injury when he was younger but Dr Parkinson said that had 'affected neither personality nor gender identity.'

"Dramatic footage has emerged showing the killer Germanwings pilot learning to fly as a teenager years before the fatal crash in the French Alps. Andreas Lubitz, 27, who deliberately crashed his passenger jet into a mountain killing all 150 on board, is seen laughing and joking as he takes off and flies a glider in Germany. On the in-flight video, made around a decade ago, he can be heard saying 'right, here we go then' as he is towed aloft. As he scans the horizon, he says: 'Why is it so quiet today? It is unbelievable.' He then jokes with his companion: 'We're going until we have no more fuel, okay?' Scroll down for video . Clip: Andreas Lubitz is seen in the footage laughing and smiling as he takes off and flies a glider in Germany . Up in the air: Dramatic footage emerged of the Germanwings killer co-pilot training around a decade ago . The 30-second video - obtained by ITV News and taken in Lubitz's home town of Montabaur near Frankfurt - was discovered as Germany continued to search for answers over the tragedy. Lubitz went on to begin his training as a commercial airline pilot in 2007. But he was forced to take a six-month medical break for depression and 'burnout' before finally qualifying as a first officer at Lufthansa two years ago. German investigators also found torn-up sicknotes and a 'small mountain of pills' in Lubitz's Dusseldorf flat which showed he had hidden the extent of his illness from his employers. At least one of the medical certificates covered the day of the crash last Tuesday. The 27-year-old was also said to be 'living on the edge' because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot's licence. Calls are now intensifying for doctor-patient confidences to be suspended for people responsible for the lives of others. Yesterday a British air safety expert said Lubitz was able to hide his medical problems because of a 'gaping hole' in the system for monitoring pilot health. Under confidentiality laws rules, which also operate in the UK, patients do not have to tell GPs where they work and doctors are not able to tell employers about any health issues because of patient confidentiality. Taking to the skies: Lubitz is heard saying 'right, here we go then' as he is towed aloft in his home town of Montabaur near Frankfurt . Lubitz - pictured competing at the Airportrun in Hamburg in September 2009 - was treated by several neurologists and psychiatrists and various medications were found at his home, it has been reported . Devastation: Debris from the Germanwings Airbus A320 is seen at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes in France . The onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on employees. Tony Newton, a British pilot and Civil Aviation Authority examiner, said: 'It's a gaping hole. It would happen in the UK as well.' German prosecutors are expected to release fresh details today of their investigation  based on a weekend spent sifting through paperwork and computers seized from his home in Dusseldorf. A special police commission of 100 officers codenamed 'Alpine Squad' is now working to try to establish the exact motive why Lubitz, 27, committed suicide and mass murder. Prosecutors have confirmed he suffered massive depression, hid his treatment from his bosses and was having trouble in his relationship with live-in lover Kathrin Goldbach, 26, a schoolteacher who some reports in Germany claim is carrying his child. Police spokesman Andreas Czogalla said; 'This is certainly one of our biggest investigations for decades. All police colleagues are extremely motivated.' It came as chilling transcript from the aircraft's black box voice recorder revealed Lubitz responding 'hopefully' and 'we'll see' when he ran through in-flight landing checks with the captain of his doomed aircraft. His responses came just a few moments before he encouraged Patrick Sondenheimer to go the toilet and took control of the flight. Taking photos: Forensic experts from the French gendarmerie disaster victim identification unit working under a tent near the site of the crash . Respectful: A man stands in front of a headstone in Seyne-les-Alpes, the closest accessible site to where the Germanwings plane crashed . Later Mr Sondenheimer is heard shouting 'open the god damn door!' as he desperately tried to break back into the cockpit. Passengers screamed as Mr Sondenheimer attempted to smash his way in with a crowbar after Lubitz locked him out and put the plane into a descent. But the only sound from the cockpit was Lubitz breathing as the aircraft plummeted at 3,500 feet per minute before smashing into the French Alps. After Mr Sondenheimer left him at the controls, he switched the autopilot from the cruising altitude of 38,000ft to 96ft – a move that was certain to crash the plane over the Alps. The exchange was revealed yesterday as pictures of Lubitz as a child and a teenager emerged, and it was claimed his girlfriend may be pregnant. 10.01am: Plane takes off from Barcelona 26 minutes late. 10.27: Reaches cruising altitude of 38,000ft.

"Jailed: Nicole Richess, 20, of Bournemouth, Dorset, had sex with the two servicemen  after a night out . A young woman was today jailed for more than two years after falsely accusing two soldiers of trying to rape her because she was ashamed about a drunken cocaine-fuelled threesome. Nicole Richess, 20, of Bournemouth, Dorset, had sex with the two servicemen at a friend’s house and then her own home after a night out. The following day her boyfriend heard rumours that she had been unfaithful and confronted her. Richess ‘panicked’ and made up the false claim that the two innocent men, aged 23 and 24, had forced themselves on her - because she was too ashamed to tell her boyfriend of three years, Alex Ganter, she had cheated on him. Mr Ganter made her go to the police to report the ‘attack’, and Richess even gave a ‘tearful’ account of the apparent crime to officers and ‘illicitly gained their empathy’. Her ‘deceitful web of lies’ saw the two soldiers arrested, leaving them ‘distraught and petrified’. However, officers began to realise Richess was lying when they gathered the accounts of the soldiers and her friends - and she was charged with perverting the course of justice. Richess was today jailed for two and a half years by a judge who said that her lies had an ‘insidious and corrosive’ effect on public confidence and the justice system. Judge Jonathan Fuller QC said: ‘You made a determined and prolonged attempt to weave a picture of deceit to further your ends and you were prepared to make wholly false allegations of attempted rape against these innocent young men. Victims: Richess made up the false claim that the two innocent men (above, left and right) had forced themselves on her - because she was too ashamed to tell her boyfriend  she had cheated on him . ‘You told a web of lies and even cried to evoke sympathy. The impact on these victims cannot be understated and false allegations of rape and attempted rape can have dreadful consequences. ‘Every occasion of a proved false allegation has an insidious effect on public confidence, sometimes allowing doubts to creep into when one shouldn’t exist. Your offence has a corrosive effect on criminal justice.’ Fern Russell, prosecuting, told Bournemouth Crown Court how Richess and her friend Laura Hillwood met a group of four soldiers at Taboo nightclub in the town on November 9, 2012. The women went back to Ms Hillwood’s home in Bournemouth with the men where two of them had sex with Richess in a bedroom. Ms Hillwood walked in on them to find Richess wearing just a bra and the two soldiers in a ‘state of undress’. Ms Hillwood ordered the trio to leave and they went to Richess’s home in Bournemouth where they continued to have sex. The following morning Richess drove the soldiers to their barracks at Blandford Army Camp in Dorset. Ms Russell said: ‘Ms Hillwood then told her mutual friends she had walked in on a threesome. That was fed to Nicole’s boyfriend and he became angry about the situation and wanted to know what was going on.’ Night out: Richess and her friend Laura Hillwood met a group of four soldiers at Taboo nightclub (pictured) in Bournemouth on November 9, 2012 . Richess denied to her friends and her Mr Ganter that the sex was consensual and claimed she was raped. She alleged that the soldiers walked into the bedroom while she was changing her clothes where they attempted to rape her. She said: ‘The males had asked me for a threesome and they tried grabbing me. They started stripping off and I was shouting and trying to move but one of them kept bending me over trying to get me. ‘I was getting angry and I couldn’t get out but eventually my friend came in and I managed to get out, get in my car and go home.’ She recalled to officers her false story in ‘great detail’ in a 65-minute recorded interview, the court heard. Ms Russell said: ‘She was tearful and illicitly gained the empathy of the police as she was struggling to give out what she said was her truthful account.’ The soldiers, who were absent from today’s hearing, were told they would face no charges two weeks after the incident. In total, Richess’s claims wasted 296 hours of police time. She had denied a charge of perverting the course of justice but changed her plea to guilty on the eve of a trial more than two years later. In a victim impact statement the 23-year-old serviceman said he was worried about his future as a soldier, adding he was proud of representing the country. Lift: The following morning Richess drove the soldiers to their barracks at Blandford Army Camp (pictured) He said: ‘I was extremely worried about what would due to not know what would happen next. This incident has had a profound effect on my job. ‘Because I had been arrested I was seen to be bringing the Army into disrepute. It’s had a long lasting effect which has changed the way I have interacted with females. ‘The lasting effect of this case will follow me for many years and perhaps the rest of my life.’ The 24-year-old said: ‘I was petrified and couldn’t believe this was happening to me. It changed me as a person and I have become a lot quieter and less confident. My family were distraught about the allegations and the worry has been the biggest thing for me.’ Tony Ventham, defending, said Richess - who is seven and a half months pregnant by her current partner - said she felt pressured in to reporting the false claims because her former boyfriend was ‘violent’ and ‘controlling’. Richess had also taken cocaine for the first time that night. Mr Ventham said: ‘She called the police because she was in a panic and because she’s stupid and immature.’ He added: ‘In December the following month she tried to commit suicide and had been struggling with depression ever since.’  Richess will start her sentence in a young offenders’ institution.","Nicole Richess had sex with two men at friend’s house and then her own .

"Tory efforts to rein in spending and curb welfare payments have won a resounding vote of public approval, according to nation- wide research. There has been no public backlash against five years of austerity and even Labour voters support reforms to the benefits system, the British Social Attitudes Survey found. The report also said that voters have broadly accepted student tuition fees, while the majority of the population is satisfied with the NHS. David Cameron's efforts to rein in spending and curb welfare payments have won a resounding vote of public approval, according to nation-wide research . This support for what are effectively Coalition policies is not reflected in the polls, however, even though the General Election is in six weeks’ time. Over the past few months, Labour has mostly had a lead of between one and three points, on 31 to 33, with the Conservatives on 30. A Daily Mail/ComRes poll this week had both parties on 35 points. In a major vote of confidence for the Government, almost three in four people backed the benefits cap – one of David Cameron’s reforms which has been most severely criticised by the Left. Among Labour supporters two in three back the cap, which restricts handouts to the level of an average wage – currently £500 a week for a family. Despite the support for the Tory policies, Ed Miliband's Labour is still ahead in the polls . Half of voters are unsympathetic to the idea of increasing welfare handouts, with 52 per cent believing unemployment benefits are too high. And a similar percentage think that unemployed people could find a job if they wanted to. The annual report, which is based on 2,878 interviews with people across Britain in autumn last year, also revealed concerns about how welfare claimants spend their money. Six out of ten said that claimants should be able to spend benefits only on specific goods and services, as with food stamps in the US. Fewer than one in ten people think that immigrants – from the EU or elsewhere – should be able to claim welfare payments indefinitely, while even half of Labour voters would set a six-month limit on giving EU arrivals access to the full range of benefits. The findings suggest that voters have not responded to Left-wing outcries against Government cuts. However, there are warnings for the leading parties. More than nine out of ten people think the NHS is facing a funding crisis, and while a majority want to see the health service free to users and paid for out of taxes, fewer than half think it will still be so in ten years’ time. Rachel Ormston of NatCen, which carried out the research, said: ‘The public... has seemingly accepted many of the Coalition’s big reforms. In spite of the narrative of austerity... NHS satisfaction is back up, there is acceptance of tuition fees, and at least some benefits cuts are popular.’ Researchers said they had expected to find a public reaction against spending and benefit cuts. But the report said: ‘The most common position remains that taxes and spending should stay at the same level.’ In 2002 nearly two out of three people said they wanted higher taxes and more spending on health, education and benefits. That fell to just 32 per cent by 2010, and is now up slightly to 37 per cent. The new report added that Labour supporters were more sympathetic to welfare spending than other respondents, but ‘even so they can hardly be regarded as enthusiasts for more, and would prefer that people of working age were in work.’","Tory efforts to rein in public spending have won public approval .

"Three British teenage jihadists were in custody last night after a dramatic security operation stopped them joining Islamic State fighters in Syria. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Turkey after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. Three British teenagers who were stopped in Turkey while allegedly on their way to Syria to join the Islamic State are now back in the UK, police say . The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. But last night they were released on bail. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.’ Investigators hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so. The case highlights the difficult balancing act the security services face in dealing with would-be jihadists desperate to sign up to the militant Islamist cause. Security chiefs are increasingly desperate to get into often closed communities and understand what is attracting our young people to such a barbaric organisation. Yet criminal suspects are unlikely to talk freely about their motivation or reveal the identities of other potential militants. Last week Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the three schoolgirls who fled to Syria from East London would not face prosecution if they came home. This is despite the fact they successfully reached IS and at least two of them are known to have communicated with wanted terrorists. Two 17-year-old boys from north-west London were detained in Istanbul along with a third male aged 19, the Met Police have said. They are believed to have been travelling to join Isis (stock picture) The latest three teenagers were seized at Istanbul airport on Friday evening towards the end of their journey to the Syrian border. They arrived after travelling via Barcelona, possibly in a bid to evade detection. The two 17-year-olds, both from North-West London, were caught after a tip-off from their families. But the security services discovered they were travelling with a third man, aged 19, and he too was arrested. The three travellers, whose initials are said to be GH, MA and MNG, were arrested on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts after police returned them to London on Saturday morning. The offence carries a potential life sentence. Sources in Turkey said there is some evidence the three communicated with terrorists about how best to evade the authorities. None of them are believed to be connected to any high-profile IS terrorists. More than 600 Britons have fled the country for Syria and Iraq since the appalling explosion of violence in the region began. They include 22 women and girls who have travelled in the past 12 months, many of whom wanted to become ‘jihadi brides’. IS controls huge areas of the two countries and has attracted thousands of foreign fighters to its cause. Turkey has faced criticism for not controlling its border with Syria, but has accused European states of failing to prevent would-be jihadists from leaving in the first place. It comes just weeks after an international police hunt was launched to find three London schoolgirls who travelled to Istanbul on their journey to Syria . On the run: (l to r) Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. They are understood to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . Friday’s dramatic operation came only weeks after the three runaway British schoolgirls flew to Turkey before travelling overland to Syria. The families of Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, have lashed out at police and others for failing to stop them. But their plight has raised questions about why the families themselves did not spot their conversion to radical Islam. On Saturday the Daily Mail revealed the identity of another girl, a close friend of the trio, who left Britain before them in December. Sharmeena Begum, 15, disappeared from Bethnal Green Academy and flew to Istanbul from Gatwick. Those closest to all four girls suspect they were groomed by Islamists using social networking sites and secretive internet messaging software. There are also suspicions the trio kept in touch with Sharmeena who passed on information about how to follow in her footsteps. The schoolgirls are understood to be in the terror group’s de facto capital Raqqa. The authorities in Turkey said the quick deportation of the latest travellers showed how their efforts to combat the flood of extremists is working. One source said: ‘The Turkish are willing to act quickly and arrest people but they do not see this as their problem. That is why the suspects were sent back to the UK so quickly. No one here wants to deal with them any longer than they have to.’ Sharmeena Begum ran away from home in December to join Islamic State . The father of a 15-year-old British girl who fled to Syria questioned yesterday why police kept her disappearance secret. Sharmeena Begum ran away from home in December to join Islamic State – followed last month by her three best friends. But the GCSE student from East London was not named until the Daily Mail revealed she was the first of the four schoolgirls to abandon her family to become a jihadi bride. Sharmeena’s father, Mohammad Uddin, 38, said a high-profile appeal for information might have helped find his daughter before she reached Syria. Mr Uddin said: ‘Maybe a police appeal could have helped. The police just told me, “Interpol are doing their best to find her”. Then after three days they told me they maybe couldn’t do any more.’ The Bethnal Green Academy pupil was apparently radicalised via her iPhone without her family’s knowledge by internet jihadists. Her distraught father last heard from her in a tearful conversation a fortnight after she went missing, when she told him she was never coming home. Mr Uddin said: ‘Many times I told the police, “do whatever you need to – I want my daughter back”. I will do anything to get her back.’ Last night the families of Sharmeena’s friends who followed her to Syria – Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase – appealed to their children to come home, saying they felt their loss ‘more acutely’ on Mother’s Day, but again blamed the authorities for their daughters’ disappearances.

"A seaside town  and a London borough are bucking a nationwide trend of ageing which will see the average age of the population hit its forties by 2037. Towns and cities across the country are getting older, thanks to people living longer, with half of those born after 2007 expected to live to over 100. While the average age of the population will be 43 in 2037, up from 36 in 1992, the the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, and the seaside town of Bournemouth in Dorset, populations are getting younger. In Barking, the average age is set to drop from 34 to 33.4 during the 45 year period- thanks to rising birth rates and the influx of young Londoners with families looking to get on the housing ladder. By 2037, a quarter of all residents in the borough will be under 16 years old. The county of Dorset has one of the oldest populations in the UK - Christchurch where almost 31 per cent of the population are pensioners- and one of the few places where the population is getting younger - Bournemouth where the age is due to drop from 41.3 to 41. Bournemouth (pictured) is one of only two places in the UK where the age of the population is due to drop by 2037 . The fastest ageing areas were in rural Scotland where Eilean Siar (pictured) in the Western Isles's average age of 38.5 is set to increase to 55.7 - a 31 per cent increase . The past decade has seen an influx of young professionals and migrants to the seaside town. Britain's towns and cities are getting older as a national trend of ageing is set to put the UK's average age at 43 . The fastest ageing areas were in rural Scotland where Eilean Siar in the Western Isles's average age of 38.5 is set to increase to 55.7 -  a 31 per cent increase. It will mean there will be fewer than one in seven will be under 16 by 2037. Inverclyde's population will age by 5.3 years while Clackmannanshire, the third fastest ageing location, will increase from a median of 35.4 to 49.5. Experts are now warning that the rapidly ageing populations in rural Scotland could mean services such as doctors and schools come under threat. Professor Robert Wright, a population expert at Strathclyde University, told The Independent: . 'The issue is that depopulation and rapid population ageing of more-remote regions means that it will become too expensive to provide services needed by an ageing population. Basically, people will need to move to receive them.' The oldest parts towns and cities in Britain will be Rother in Sussex, and north Norfolk, where the median age will exceed 57 by 2037. In contrast, the areas of the UK which are slowest to age include Southampton, Bristol, Nottingham and Norwich. Location                                1992            2037 .

"The 21-year-old son of a Utah doctor found guilty of murder in the 2011 death of his cancer researcher ex-wife has spoken out about how he fought for three years for his father to be convicted. Salt Lake City pediatrician John Brickman Wall, 51, was convicted of killing Uta von Schwedler in September 2011 amid a bitter custody dispute. He faces up to life in prison. The case was highly contentious, with prosecutors alleging Wall had murdered his wife while defense attorneys claimed von Schwedler killed herself. Their son, Pelle Wall, said that though his father told him and his three siblings that their mother had killed herself, he didn't believe it. Scroll down for video . Pelle Wall, 21, publicly believed his Salt Lake City pediatrician father, John Wall, was guilty of murdering his mother, Uta von Schwedler in 2011 . After spending his entire inheritance from his mother on a campaign to convict his father, Pelle wants a confession. 'As I thought about... my dad's behavior before and after her death, it became more and more apparent to me that - that he was responsible for killing her,' Pelle told CBS's 48 Hours. Prosecutors alleged Wall attacked 49-year-old Uta von Schwedler with a knife, dosed her with an anti-anxiety drug Xanax and drowned her in her bathtub. Defense attorneys countered that the theory was unbelievable, and it was more likely von Schwedler killed herself. Her death initially was treated as a suicide. But family and friends pushed for more investigation, saying the researcher showed no signs of wanting to end her life. Pelle told CBS that he feared for his and his sibling's lives, worrying that they might be living with a murder. 'Part of the reason I was concerned for my safety as well as my sibling's safety - was that I saw this anger that he had towards my mother,' Pelle said. 'It didn't die with her. It jumped and it expanded.' The couple's oldest son, Pelle Wall (left) had testified at the trial claiming that his father was acting bizarre after the family learned von Schwedler had died. John Wall (right) was found guilty of murdering his ex-wife in March . Uta Von Schwedler's body was found in an overflowing bathtub in September 2011 and her death was initially ruled a suicide but further investigation led to the conviction of her ex-husband John Brickman Wall . Salt Lake City officials made no effort to remove the children from Wall's home and the investigation was put on hold. On the day before his 18th birthday in January 2012, Pelle moved out of his father's house into the home of his best friend, Jessica Oglesby, and was welcomed by her parents with open arms. But he had left his siblings behind. 'I realized that my presence there was not protecting my siblings,' he told CBS, adding that his father was upset that he had moved out. 'And once I had that realization and I moved out, then I could take active steps to protect them.' Pelle then fought for custody of his siblings and eventually won. The children were all moved into homes of family friends. His father sued him for a number of family scrapbooks that had been treasured items within the family. One of the books had been found next to von Schwedler's body. Pelle countered his father's lawsuit with a wrongful death suit, holding his father responsible in the death of his mother. Wall was eventually arrested and put on trial for the murder of von Schwedler. The evidence in the case was unusual: A medical examiner thought the shallow cuts on von Schwedler's wrists and leg looked like she was defending herself from an attack, but he couldn't explain the fatal level of Xanax in her system. Forensic experts had very different interpretations of the scene. Pelle Wall (left) spent his entire inheritance from his mother (right) campaigning for his father's conviction. He said now he wants a confession from his father . For the prosecution, spilled antihistamine pills on the floor, a house in disarray and bloodstains in von Schwedler's bed showed she was attacked. The defense said the home revealed signs of a troubled woman who died trying to calm herself with medication. 'The state just can't throw up a whole bunch of theories,' John Wall's lawyer Fred Metos said during closing arguments Thursday. He added self-injury is a rare side effect of Xanax. Prosecutors said von Schwedler studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease. She had no prescription for Xanax, but John Wall filled a large one for his mother months before his ex-wife's death. 'He resented her efforts to see the children, to talk with the children, to text the children, to email the children,' prosecutor Nick D'Alesandro said during closings. 'He just couldn't stop talking about how much he hated her.' The night of their mother's death, the former couple's four children were staying at John Wall's house. The next morning, he wasn't at home when they woke up. Instead, he went to a car wash and had the interior of his car cleaned, including a pinkish stain, according to prosecutors. Von Schwedler was a Cancer researcher who studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease . He came to work with a scratch on his face and injury to his eye; he said the family dog scratched him while he slept. Police knocked on John Wall's door that night, hours after von Schwedler's boyfriend found her body. During an intense interrogation, John Wall denied having anything to do with her death. The couple's oldest daughter, 19-year-old Malkie Wall, testified that her father returned home deeply troubled and asking his children if he was a monster. His lawyers said he broke down after police made him question his sanity, but there's no proof he was in von Schwedler's house. The jury of three women and five men deliberated for about seven hours before reaching a guilty verdict. After the verdict was read, the Pelle thanked police for years of investigation and 'uncommon persistence. He spoke at the courthouse in Salt Lake City surrounded by more than two dozen supporters. 'We have spent the last three and half years seeking justice for my mother, and today that quest is finally at an end,' he said. The victim's sister, Almut von Schwedler, said the Wall children will never be the same, but the verdict is the first step toward closure. 'Johnny never succeeded to destroy Uta's joy for life, but he ended up taking her life,' she said. John Wall, pictured last year awaiting his trial, faces up to life in prison for the murder of his ex-wife. A sentencing hearing will take place in July . John Brickman Wall, center, listens to blood pattern expert Rod Englert testify for the prosecution with his defense team Jeremy Delicino, left, and Fred Metos in February . 'Revenge was certainly not what drove us in those dark days, and dark and desperate days we had many of,' she added. Prosecutor Matthew Janzen said Pelle Wall played an important part in the case, one of many pieces that formed the largely circumstantial case. As the verdict was read, John Wall sat with his hands folded and shoulders bent, staring down and blinking rapidly as his frown deepened. The defendant's sister, Wendy Wall, maintained her brother's innocence. 'This verdict will not bring Uta back,' she said in a statement. 'Now, to that tragedy has been added the conviction of an innocent man.' Though Pelle has no regrets in fighting for his father's conviction, Wendy Wall is disappointed with what Pelle has done to his father. 'I think that Johnny felt devastated when, you know, when Pelle - in some ways you could say turned on him, I suppose,' she said. 'Everybody in our family Johnny included still very much loves Pelle, and I think that we're all trying to remember that… he's gone through incredible trauma.' Wall will be sentenced on July 8. Pelle said that he expects he will speak to his father 'once he's in prison'. 'I mean, I think I can ask him the questions. But, I don't expect that he'll answer. He'll just, you know, shake his head... and, basically, maintain the victim stance that he's always maintained,' he said.","Pelle Wall spent his inheritance from his mother on a campaign to get his father, John Brickman Wall, convicted .

"Lord Michael Bates (pictured) said too many babies are born to immigrant mothers in the UK . Too many babies are being born to immigrant mothers in the UK, a Government minister said last night. In controversial remarks, Lord Bates said that a quarter of children born in the UK each year now had a mother who was herself from overseas. He added: 'That is why we need to reduce immigration'. In 2001, prior to Labour presiding over a decade of wide-scale immigration, only 16 per cent of UK births were to foreign mothers. Home Office Minister Lord Bates reeled off a series of statistics to demonstrate the significant impact mass immigration is having. They included the fact that, at the end of December 2013, there were an estimated 7.8million people born overseas living in the UK. It is understood to be the first time a Government minister has directly suggested a need to reduce the number of babies being born to immigrants. However, ministers and campaign groups have in the past stressed the pressure which is being put on maternity services and schools. Lord Bates, who was previously MP for Langbaurgh in the north east, was responding to a House of Lords question from Migrationwatch chairman Lord Green of Deddington. In lively exchanges, Lord Green said that – based on current levels of net migration – Britain would have to build a new city the size of Birmingham every two years to cope. Currently, there are 300,000 more people arriving in the UK every year than leaving – demolishing David Cameron's pledge to cut the figure to the 'tens of thousands'. Lord Bates said: 'We are absolutely at one on needing a firm but fair immigration policy to protect the public services of this country and provide opportunities for those who want to come here to work.' However, he was criticised by members of the Labour and Liberal Democrat benches for his comments. Labour's Lord Soley said the children of migrants 'have made an immensely valuable contribution to the United Kingdom'. He added: 'We ought to be proud of that and say so. A quarter of children born in the UK each year now had a mother who was herself from overseas . Baroness Hussein-Ece, a Lib Dem, said political leaders 'need to make a case for the positive impact that immigration has had on this country'. She added: 'The care system would collapse without immigrant labour. Does the Minister think that the constant negative narrative of immigration, without the positive, is detrimental to British society—a society that has always been one of tolerance which values and upholds democracy in building better institutions? Do the Government not really need to take the lead on this?' There has been controversy over the most accurate way of measuring the impact immigration is having on the size of the UK population. Last year, a report by Migrationwatch said immigration could be responsible for as much as 84 per cent of the surge in Britain's population this century. The study claimed the true impact of immigration has been 'substantially understated' because the Office for National Statistics did not count 1.3million children born to foreign parents as part of the impact of immigration on population growth. It concluded that of the 4.6million population rise between 2001 and 2012, 3.8million is due to the biggest wave of immigration the country has faced. Not including children born in the UK meant net migration was recorded at a much lower 2.5million. In separate exchanges with the Labour benches, Lord Bates defended the Prime Minister's failure to hit his 'tens of thousands' target. He said: 'It could well be that when the Prime Minister was making those remarks we were in the depths of despair as a country in 2010. 'Since then we have had a jobs miracle. We have created more jobs than the rest of Europe put together. 'As a result of that, not surprisingly, people want to come and find work.' Lord Bates, an Oxford graduate, was made a Deputy Speaker of the Lords in 2013. He served as a Government whip before being appointed to the Home Office last year. He speaks for the Government in the Upper Chamber on all matters dealt with by Theresa May's department.","Lord Bates said too many babies are  born to immigrant mothers in the UK .

"Millions of working class families will be given the chance to buy their own homes under radical Tory plans to extend Margaret Thatcher's flagship housing policy. Under proposals being considered by Downing Street, the right-to-buy scheme - currently restricted to families in council owned properties - will be extended to up to 2.5million housing association tenants. David Cameron hopes the 'big door step offer' will sway enough working class voters to earn him a second term as Prime Minister. Since right-to-buy was set up in 1980 by the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, more than two million council houses have been sold . Under a plan being championed by the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, housing association tenants will be given the right to buy their homes at a knockdown price. Since right-to-buy was set up in 1980, more than two million council houses have been sold, but current rules make it difficult for those in housing associations to buy their homes. Housing associations are non-profit making private bodies that provide low-cost social housing. Regulated by the state, they receive public funding. Right-to-buy rules allow most council tenants to buy their homes at a discount, but the rules do not apply to housing associations. They only qualify for limited discounts and can only buy a property that has been acquired by an association since 1997. Discounts vary between areas, but range from £9,000 to £16,000. Council house tenants, by contrast, can get discounts of up to £77,000 across England and £102,700 in London. David Cameron hopes a 'big door step offer' on housing will sway enough working class voters to earn him a second term as Prime Minister . Under the new plans, housing associations will be able to use the funds from the sale of the houses to build more homes, the Sunday Times has reported. Taxpayers' money will be used to fund the discounts, which are expected to be 30% off the market value of the home. A more radical plan advanced by Duncan Smith, to simply give away housing association properties to those who have worked for a year, has been ditched. Number 10 believe it would cost votes among those who have worked for much longer to save for their own home. A senior Downing Street source said: 'You are safe to say that broadening right-to-buy is on the cards.' But the source added: 'Giving away homes is off the table. If your message is that you want to reward people who work hard and get on, it wouldn't be seen as fair to give homes to people in social housing while others have been saving for years to buy their own place.'","Right-to-buy could be extended to up to 2.5m housing association tenants .

"Anyone who has ever tried to bathe an animal, especially a big one, will probably tell you that it can be a real struggle. But this little elephant in Thailand proves that it’s not always as hard as you would think. In fact, it’s actually quite fun. Captured on video by a visiting tourist who dubbed the elephant Double Trouble, the excitable animal is filmed diving straight towards the bath, snagging its leg on the side of it, tripping up and falling straight into the water. After balancing on its head for a while looking as if it is struggling, the elephant manages to turn itself back onto its side and begins splashing about - seemingly unbothered by its less-than-graceful entry into the water. Returning to its feet, the elephant heads towards the man bathing it, who is believed to be Claus Jorgensen, the Danish tourist who later uploaded the footage from the Royal Elephant Kraal and Village, in Thailand. But the excitement isn't over for the young elephant. It proceeds to jumping back out of the bath and attempt to steal the hose, causing the surrounding visitors to laugh hysterically. The excited elephant charges straight towards the bath and snags its leg off of it on the way in causing it to fall over . The calf slip-slided its way in eventually as grown elephants stood in the back watching . Head over heels! The elephant looks like it is about to drown before it turns itself onto its side and begins splashing . The video concludes with Double Trouble jumping back into the bath even more enthusiastically, before a woman and little girl spray it with a hose. After an enjoyable roll around in the water, apparently delighting in its added shower, the elephant grabs the hose from the girl and her mother and runs away with it in its trunk.

"Super midwife Kathleen McSherry has retired after delivering a record 7,000 babies. Colleagues believe Kathleen, 66, from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has notched up more births than any other British midwife in a career spanning six decades. She said: 'It's been a labour of love. Every delivery has been a very special moment for me. Bringing a new life into the world is the best job in the world.' Kathleen McSherry from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has delivered more than 7,000 babies since 1966 . Kathleen with one of her many deliveries, left, and hard at work for Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS . She continued: 'The sheer joy of being at a family's happiest moment is truly wonderful. I'll miss it so much.' Kathleen, who is a fan of the hit TV show Call the Midwife, has spent her career in the bustling maternity wards of three busy Glasgow hospitals - Stobhill, The Queen Mother's and the Southern General. The father of a child she delivered worked out she must have delivered more than 7,000 babies - based on the fact she's delivered three babies per shift on average. Fellow midwives agree they are unaware of anyone who has helped deliver so many babies. Kathleen's daughter Ashley, who set up a Facebook page in her honour, said: 'She has enjoyed every one of her days working to deliver babies and we are all very proud of her service to the NHS. I think she will miss it so much now she's retired.' The mother-of-four and grandmother-of-five has enjoyed a career which mirrors her favourite TV programme, Call The Midwife. Kathleen, second from right, has been delivering babies at three Glasgow hospitals for six decades . Kathleen started training in the 60s and her career mirrors that of her favourite TV programme Call the Midwife . She began her training in 1966 aged just 17, after working as a sales assistant in the former Glen's department store in Glasgow. During her career there has never been a dull moment. She has assisted at the births of two babies born in hospital car parks and has even had two children named after her. 'It's a lovely compliment and one that midwives love,' Kathleen said. She's delivered too many twins to mention and has also delivered countless children and grandchildren of the children she's brought into the world. 'You can plan to have your baby in hospital but they often have minds of their own and arrive at the least expected time,' she said. 'They set the agenda and there is little you can do when a determined baby decides it's time to be born.' The most magical moment in Kathleen's career was being at the birth of two of her grandchildren . She also had a surprise delivery of her own when she was forced to advise husband Jim, 67, a retired firefighter, what to do when she went into labour with their fourth child Katey. 'It was five in the morning when I woke up in labour and Jim ushered our older kids, Pauline, then nine, Paul, seven, and Ashley two, into the kitchen with breakfast cereal and told them to stay there,' she remembers. 'I knew this baby wasn't waiting, so we called an ambulance hoping I would make it to the Queen Mother's Hospital about four miles away. 'It was a blizzard outside and I hoped it would arrive in time. 'The midwife flying squad was also called - but our wee girl arrived before they got here - and Jim had to do the honours. 'I was at one end issuing instructions to Jim, hoping all was going well down at his end. 'Being a midwife helped, as did having three babies previously!' The most magical moment of her career was being at the delivery of two grandchildren. Her daughters Pauline, now 44, and Ashley, 35, wanted their mum by their sides as they gave birth. 'Pauline had a wee boy, Dale, in 1994, and it was magic supporting her throughout the labour,' Kathleen remembers. 'I was thrilled being allowed to assist my second daughter, Ashley's wee boy, Matthew, into the world in 2009. The saddest moments in Kathleen's career has been when couples have lost babies after years of trying . 'I put my hands on her baby when he came out and broke the news to my daughters both times that they'd had boys. 'You worry so much more when your daughter is pregnant and in labour. That's mainly because you know what mums have to endure. 'People say it's just childbirth but they don't call it labour for nothing.. It's exhausting and takes women to the limit of endurance.' But being a midwife has brought heartache too. 'The saddest have been couples who lost babies after years of trying,' she adds. 'Your heart goes out to them. It is the hardest challenge for any midwife.' It's been a family career for Kathleen as her mum, Mary, was a nurse during the Second World War and her sister Moira, 68, took the same path. 'I grew up with mum being a nurse and she worked through some really hard times during the War. 'She never complained once about the long hours on old Nightingale wards. 'In fact, she was a great role model for us.' None of Kathleen's children have followed her into midwifery, though. 'There are so many other career options open to women,' she says. Daughter Katey, 33, an ASDA section leader, said: 'It's very impressive how long she's been a midwife. 'She is one of the longest serving in Scotland.' Kathleen's bosses, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are sad to see her leave. Evelyn Frame, Head of Midwifery at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: 'Kathleen has dedicated her life to delivering babies and supporting new mums and we wish her all the very best on her retirement.'","Kathleen McSherry, 66, started training as a midwife in 1966, aged just 17 .

"Millions of patients are struggling to see their GP as surgeries are not open at a convenient time. Nearly one in five said they cannot easily make the appointments offered – despite promises that family doctors would extend their hours to evenings and weekends. The number of patients who are 'fairly or very dissatisfied' with the opening hours at their surgery has risen by two million, or some 43 per cent, in the past three years alone, jumping from 3.7million in 2012 to 5.3million, the latest GP Patient Survey found. The number of patients who are 'fairly or very dissatisfied' with the opening hours at their surgery has risen by two million in the past three years alone, jumping from 3.7million in 2012 to 5.3million (file picture, posed) And a quarter of patients are now waiting more than a week to see their GP. Labour, which obtained the data, said it shows the failure of the Conservatives to deliver on their promise to introduce a seven-day-a-week service. They said that this is piling pressure on emergency departments as patients who cannot get a GP appointment decide to go to A&E instead. David Cameron promised in his party's manifesto at the last election in 2010: 'We will ensure that every patient can access a GP in their area between 8am and 8pm, seven days a week'. But a survey by the Daily Mail last year revealed millions of patients wait three weeks to see their GP, and only one in three now manages to secure a same-day appointment. GPs have spoken out about their struggle to meet demand. Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of GPs, said last week: 'GPs are facing unprecedented pressures in trying to care for increasing numbers of patients with increasingly limited resources. 'We believe that the way to best improve patient care and keep the NHS sustainable is to invest properly in general practice and to ensure that we have enough GPs to cope with the demand of our growing and ageing population.' She has previously warned that 'we do worry on patient safety grounds that access is becoming more of a problem', as the delays to seeing patients can lead to late diagnoses of deadly illnesses such as cancer. Labour said the figures show the failure of the Conservatives to deliver on their promise to introduce a seven-day-a-week service. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (pictured) said it is 'on David Cameron's watch' The Labour party says it will open 8,000 more GP surgeries and extend surgeries' opening hours if it wins office. But critics accused Labour of botching negotiations of the GP contract in 2004, causing a drop in out-of-hours cover from GPs and forcing patients to attend crowded A&Es instead. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will say today: 'One of Cameron's first acts as Prime Minister was to scrap Labour's guarantee of an appointment within 48 hours and our extended opening scheme. 'On his watch, millions more patients are unhappy with their surgery opening hours.' A Conservative health spokesman said: 'The vast majority of patients can get an appointment and are satisfied with their GP – and the next Conservative Government would go further and give everyone 7-day access to a GP from 8am-8pm. We've already made it easier for millions of busy people to see their GP at a time that best suits them, with more evening and weekend appointments.'","Nearly one in five patients cannot make appointments offered by surgeries .

"This is the dramatic moment a mother antelope clashed horns with a three-tonne rhino which strayed a little too close to her calf at a safari park. The stand-off in Wiltshire saw the antelope refuse to back down when the beast approached her calf - and at one point even clashed horns with it. The antelope, Ramina, kept her baby Phoenix behind her at all times as she charged at the massive rhino, Njanu, despite it being 15 times heavier. Dramatic: The stand-off saw the antelope refuse to back down when the beast approached her calf - and at one point even clashed horns with it . Coming together: The antelope, Ramina, kept her baby Phoenix behind her at all times as she charged at the massive rhino, Njanu . Keepers say Ramina, a scimitar oryx antelope, was being overly defensive of her baby on her first outing in the park following a difficult birth. This saw the calf, who lives at Longleat Safari Park near Frome,  brought back to life by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Dan Gray, a keeper at the park, said: ‘Phoenix is Ramina's seventh calf but her birth was not an easy one. ‘In fact I had to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation soon after she was born as she had stopped breathing.’ Taking him on: Keepers say Ramina, a scimitar oryx antelope, was being overly defensive of her baby in the park following a difficult birth . Coming together: The calf, who lives at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire, was brought back to life by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after birth . But he added: ‘Happily Phoenix made a full recovery and that was why she was allowed out in to the park properly. ‘However, it may be that Ramina was even more protective than usual as a result and decided to stand her ground. Njanu was almost certainly just being inquisitive and meant no harm at all. 'But I guess Ramina didn't know that and she displayed real maternal courage to stand up to him so bravely.’ The scimitar oryx - oryx dammah in Latin - gets its name from its scimitar-shaped horn which can measure up to 5ft (1.5m) in length. Some experts believe the oryx may be the basis for the unicorn legend  because when seen side-on it can appear as if they only have one horn. Come on then: The scimitar oryx - oryx dammah in Latin - gets its name from its scimitar-shaped horn which can measure up to 5ft in length . It's back: Originally from North Africa, the oryx antelope is thought to have gone extinct in the wild in 1999 - due to hunting and loss of habitat . The horns are made from hollow bone, so can break off quite easily and do not grow back - making one horned oryx a relatively common occurrence. The oryx antelope, originally from North Africa, is thought to have gone extinct in the wild in 1999 - due to hunting and loss of habitat. Longleat is part of an international captive breeding programme for the species, with there now said to be more than 1,500 of them worldwide. Re-introduction programmes are taking place in Morocco, Tunisia and Senegal - with captive-bred animals being released into fenced reserves.","Stand-off at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire saw antelope refuse to back down when beast approached her calf .

"A controversial Spanish dolphin trainer who was coming to the US to work at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta has gone missing. Jose Luis Barbero, 59, can allegedly be seen hitting and kicking dolphins in videos that caught the attention of animal protection groups, but he was still hired as a vice president at the aquarium. The aquarium's newest hire, who was working on the resort island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain, has vanished. Scroll down for video . Dolphin trainer Jose Luis Barbero, who was just hired by the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has gone missing . Before he vanished, videos of Barbero, 59, (rear) allegedly hitting and kicking dolphins surfaced on the internet . After the videos (pictured above) started popping up on the web, Barbero began receiving death threats . Barbero went missing before another video  accusing him of abusing dolphins was released yesterday, according to 11 Alive. He was last seen on Tuesday leaving his home, WSB TV reported. Balearic Islands emergency services are continuing to search for him. Georgia Aquarium CEO Mike Leven said, 'We are very concerned. 'We hope he turns up soon and that everything is all right. Our thoughts are with him and his family.' According to Leven, Barbero received death threats after the videos surfaced. The embattled trainer did respond to the videos on Facebook. In a translated post he said: 'I believe a response is needed to this brutal and cowardly campaign against my profession. 'I can only say from my lawyers' recommendations that this video is a montage created to provoke a campaign challenging my professionalism over 35 years.' A former FBI agent was also hired by the Georgia Aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation . Barbero of Spain went missing before another video accusing him of abusing dolphins was released yesterday . The most recent video allegedly shows Barbero being aggressive towards dolphins during a training session at a theme park in Spain. Animal advocacy group SOSdelfines said the videos are 'meant to show how captive dolphins are treated', according to the Dodo. The aquarium has questioned whether the videos of Barbero are authentic and used the terms 'extremely questionable' and 'crudely edited' to describe them. Aquarium leaders claimed to have 'thoroughly reviewed and vetted' Barbero as a candidate and also cited that he has 35 years of professional experience. Experts were brought in to analyze the content of the videos. A former FBI agent was also hired by the aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation. It is unclear what Barbero's job status is at the  moment, but he it appears he is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium. The Georgia Aquarium maintains that it has a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals . Animal advocacy group SOSdelfines said the videos are 'meant to show how captive dolphins are treated' The aquarium released a statement about the Barbero investigation on Friday afternoon. It said: 'Our search for truth into the allegations against Jose Luis Barbero continues. 'Until our investigation is complete, we will not make any decisions regarding his employment, so at this time, Mr. Barbero remains in Spain. 'We are committed to making decisions based on factual information and very thorough analysis. 'We have a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals and continue to investigate every aspect of this matter. 'We appreciate your patience and support as we sort through this difficult situation.'

"The fate of Flight FU 9525 that was deliberately crashed into the Alps has chilling similarities to a number of other aircraft  believed to have been downed by flight crew. Germanwings pilot Andreas Günter Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the Airbus A320 into the mountain at more than 400mph, killing all 150 on board. The  final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said Lubitz's sole aim was to 'destroy the plane'. It echoes a number of recent aviation tragedies and could explain what happened to flight MH370 - which vanished last March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Scroll down for video . First picture: Germanwings pilot Andreas Günter Lubitz (above) locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the Airbus A320 into the mountain at more than 400mph, killing all 150 on board . Germanwings pilot Andreas Günter Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the Airbus A320 into the mountain at more than 400mph, killing all 150 on board. Above, workers at the crash site today . Lubitz's actions could explain what happened to flight MH370 - which vanished last March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. Above, file image of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft . Recent analysis of satellite data taken from the lost Malaysian Airlines flight indicates the aircraft may have been deliberately flown off course - suggesting the pilot took actions similar to Lubitz's. Other pilots believed to be responsible for fatal air crashes include Herminio dos Santos Fernandes, who was captain of Moza LAM flight 470 that crashed in Namibia in November 2013. Air crash investigators think the Embraer 190 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet, killing all 27 passengers and six crew. Fernandes was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death. When his co-pilot went to the toilet, flight data information recovered from the scene found that Fernandes manually changed the aircraft's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level. He also pushed the aircraft's throttles back to idle and selected the jet's maximum operating speed. Other pilots believed to be responsible for fatal air crashes include Herminio dos Santos Fernandes, who was captain of Moza LAM flight 470 that crashed in Namibia in November 2013. Above, the wreckage of the plane . Chillingly, the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of the co-pilot pounding on the door, similar to Captain Patrick Sondenheimer's attempts to regain access to the flight deck. It emerged today that co-pilot Lubitz made similar changes to his autopilot system - entering a new target altitude of just 96ft moments before the crash. The first relief officer of an EgyptAir flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the Atlantic approximately 30 minutes after leaving John F Kennedy Airport in New York on October 31, 1999. The Boeing 767-366 had 14 crew and 203 passengers on board. The National Transport Safety Board who investigated the disaster blamed the crash on the flight's relief first officer. The first relief officer of an EgyptAir flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the Atlantic some 30 minutes after leaving John F Kennedy Airport in New York in 1999. Above, debris from the downed plane . Captain Gamil al-Batouti said he would relieve the current pilot - even though he wasn't due on the flight deck for a further three hours. The co-pilot remained with al-Batouti, but when the co-pilot went for a toilet break, the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into the sea, killing everyone on board. The cockpit flight recorder heard al-Batouti claim in Arabic 'I place my fate in the hands of God' before the aircraft hit the ocean. El-Batouty even shut down the aircraft's engines, which prevented his co-pilot from saving the aircraft. According to the NTSB 'the probable cause of the crash of EgyptAir flight 990 was the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean as a result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs. 'The reason for the relief first officer's actions was not determined.' In December 1997, a Boeing 737 with 97 passengers and seven crew crashed into the Musi River in southern Sumatra, Indonesia. The NTSB investigated this crash as it involved a US-built aircraft and determined that the jet crashed due the 'direct flight control inputs' of the pilot, probably the captain. However, in both cases, Egyptian and Indonesian authorities do not accept that either of their pilots would have deliberately crashed their own aircraft.","Andreas Günter Lubitz deliberately crashed Germanwings plane into Alps .

"That feeling of elation when handing over money at the till as the shop assistant puts your new dress into a bag, followed by that sinking feeling when you next look at your bank balance - millions of us have been there. But new research has shown the situation may be worse than previously thought - one in four women have admitted to being addicted to shopping and say they lie about how much they spend. But is it any surprise when it gives ladies such a rush? The new study into 2,000 ladies found a third were at their happiest when spending money on new clothes. A new study shows a quarter of British women are addicted to shopping (picture posed by model) The addiction isn't purely about the clothes though, it's also down to the effect it has on the body. 45 per cent of those questioned get a genuine rush of excitement when they purchase new clothes, shoes and accessories. And while many credit having children, a rewarding career or being in love as making them truly happy, a third of women claim that nothing beats the buzz of strutting out of a shop swinging a bag full of new purchases. It seems we can't switch off from thinking about items we want in our wardrobe either once catching sight of something online or in a store. The longest the average woman avoids buying new clothes is two and a half months (picture posed by model) Over half of British women said when they see something they like either on a website or in a shop they can’t stop thinking about it and 17 per cent revealed they even dream about clothes they are coveting. The poll by LoveSales.com - a shopping site that monitors items on all the top retailer websites in the UK and alerts you when they drop in price - found the typical female ‘watches’ an item of clothing for at least seven days before buying. More than one in twenty even print out a picture of the must have item and pin it up at home or at work. 1. If it’s replacing something that I have worn to death I should replace it . 2. If I can buy it outright and not go in to debt to buy it - I should have it . 3. If it goes down in price I must have it . 4. I will only purchase a luxury item if it was on offer . 5. If the price is less than I thought it would be I should get it . 6. If I still want it after a week I should have it . 7. If I have been thinking of it constantly I should have it . 8. If I still want it after a month I should have it . 9. If I have been good in other areas of my life (like dieting) then I should have it . 10. If I have had a bad week or bad news I should buy it as a pick me up . Keir McConomy, founder of LoveSales.com, said: 'Most women will be able to relate to this research to some degree and there is obviously some truth in the phrase ‘retail therapy’. 'When you see something you like and are still thinking about it a good while after, it’s probably a sign you should buy it.' The study also found that the longest amount of time the average woman has gone without buying a new item of clothing is only two and half months. And then 40 per cent said they celebrate their abstinence with a big, spending blow-out. Four in ten also like to treat themselves to something new if they have had a bad day at work.","New study shows that a quarter of British women are addicted to shopping .

"Bethany Farrell (pictured) was on her first scuba dive when she drowned after becoming separated from her instructor at the Great Barrier Reef . A British graduate drowned on her first ever scuba dive – just days into a dream trip to Australia. Bethany Farrell, 23, died after she became separated from her instructor while swimming on the Great Barrier Reef, a week after beginning her gap year. She was found 35ft down on the seabed in Blue Pearl Bay, a beauty spot popular with divers. Her devastated parents have demanded to know why she wasn’t properly supervised. An investigation by the Office of Fair and Safe Work and Australian police has begun and may lead to criminal proceedings. Statements have been taken and equipment seized. Miss Farrell’s father Patrick, 47, said: ‘She was on a supervised activity – she should have been safe. It has just been devastating. From what we can gather, Bethany had boarded a bus to get the boat at 1pm. She was dead by 5pm. ‘We have photos of her looking like she was having fun. There are times when I have just been hoping I had gone insane and got it wrong. Bethany was a pure and gentle soul.’ The former soldier, who lives in Colchester, Essex, last spoke to his daughter on Skype two days before her death. Mr Farrell, who is divorced from Miss Farrell’s mother Caron, said: ‘The instructor had three students, one of them was Bethany. One of the students decided she did not want to dive but we have not got the exact reasons why, so she remained on the boat which left the instructor, Bethany and one of her friends. ‘At some point, the diving instructor lost sight of Bethany, then realised he could not locate her, returned the other student to the surface, sought help and went back down, presumably with some other people to help. ‘They found Bethany dead 11 metres down. They were meant to be diving to a depth of 5 metres.’ The family has been told it could be months before the events leading up to Miss Farrell’s death are fully understood. Miss Farrell, who studied English literature and media at Southampton Solent University, had been in Australia for a week and met up with some friends who were already there. She had been planning to work in the country for a year and posted a series of images to her account on photosharing website Instagram in the days before her death on February 17. Police and safety inspectors are still investigating her death on February 17 at Blue Harbour Bay (pictured) Her father said his daughter was a competent swimmer who had signed up for introductory diving after snorkelling lessons, before she then progressed to scuba diving. He said: ‘A lot of her friends said they had never seen her so happy.’ Graduate Ms Farrell (pictured)  was found drowned following her first ever scuba diving trip at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia in February . Her mother, 50, said: ‘For the first few days it was like a bad dream. We have got pictures of them all with the snorkelling equipment. They are all smiling.’ Miss Farrell worked during her university course as a shop assistant in a stationery store and a bartender. After graduating she was employed at Laura Ashley in Colchester and, in the days and weeks leading up to her trip to Australia, she excitedly tweeted about the adventure. On January 14 she wrote: ‘This year is already off to an exciting start – one month to go!’ Three weeks later, shortly before leaving, she joked: ‘Packing light really isn’t in my vocabulary.’ She took a number of photos through the plane’s window on the flight to Australia and wrote to one of her friends on Instagram: ‘I am very excited – it’s been a long journey…I just want to get there now.’ Miss Farrell, who was staying in a youth hostel, had a younger brother, Jake, 20. The Professional Association of Diving Instructors said the instructor would have been allowed to take four students to a maximum depth of 12 metres. But a spokesman added that discretion should be exercised, saying: ‘This is in ideal conditions with really good students.’ Blue Pearl Bay is on the north-western side of Hayman Island, part of the Cumberland Islands off the coast of Central Queensland. Underwater visibility of 50 metres means that it is a popular destination for snorkelling and scuba diving.

The beautiful young 20-year-old woman is believed to have either have been on her hands and knees or lying on the road when she was struck by a car and left to die. Ms Humphrys decided to walk from Toowong to her Seventeen Mile Rocks home in Brisbane at 4am on Sunday after having an argument with a friend while they were out celebrating her 20th birthday. Police said people tried to put Ms Humphrys, who was understood to be intoxicated at the time, into a cab at a Caltex service station but she walked away.

"In these fantastic images you can see Mars and its moons, an amazing nebula and even the surface of a mysterious world covered in water. Or can you? These might look like pictures of space at first, but they’re actually just shots of glasses of water and food in a photocopier. The amazing photography trick was performed by 34-year-old freelance photographer Navid Baraty from New York. New York photographer Navid Baraty has created fictional images of space using ingredients found in the kitchen. Shown is a 'spiral galaxy', made with baking soda, curry powder, chalk, salt, sugar and cinnamon . The project follows an imaginary spacecraft called Wander - Wormhole-Accelerated Nomad Delivering Reconnaissance - which you can follow on Instagram, Facebook or his website. In the images he used common kitchen ingredients to make the cosmic images. - Glass containing water and food colouring . - Salt, cinnamon, baking powder . - Cat fur, cumin, tumeric . - Coffee, corn starch, butter . He told MailOnline that the images were made by placing objects on an Epson photo scanner and then doing a scan with the lid open. He then partially filled glasses with liquids and put food colouring in them in order to create shapes and swirls. The stars and other points of light, meanwhile, are made by sprinkling spices such as cinnamon on the scanner glass. ‘I've had a fascination with space ever since I was a kid camping in the backyard and looking at the stars through my childhood telescope,’ he said. ‘When I see the cosmos through photographs taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and other spacecraft, I’m often left without words. ‘When I look at the night sky, I’m captivated by its mystery and its unknowns. I think the awe and wonder of space ignites our innate curiosity as humans.’ This Mars-lke planet consists of the bottom of a glass containing half and half, water and food colouring. Moons at the bottom of a glass contain coconut milk, wate and food colouring. The stars are salt, cinnamon, baking powder and tums . All the images were taken in a photocopier. Here we see a nebula with gas streams - but it is actually cat fur, garlic powder, salt, flour, cumin and turmeric, according to Mr Baraty . This planet consists of the bottom of a glass with half and half milk, water and food colouring. The starts are salt, cinnamon and baking powder . A distant galaxy? No, thi is olive oil, sesame oil, water, cumin, cinnamon and flour in a photocopier . Some of the glasses use just water, and others use a mixture of coconut milky as well. One of the nebulas was created using cat fur, garlic powder, salt, flour, cumin and turmeric. And Mr Baraty says he intends to continue take the photos, so people can keep following the fictional progress of the Wander probe . ‘I thought it would be fun and exciting to frame the project around the idea of this imaginary spacecraft roaming around the universe taking photos of its encounters,’ he said. Baking soda, salt, sugar, curry powder and cinnamon were used to make this 'globular cluster' This nebula is a mixture of makeup, olive oil, chalk, baby powder, salt and water . This icy planet consists of the bottom of a glass containing half and half, water and food colouring. The moons are silica gel and food colouring, while the stars are made of sugar, cinnamon and cumin . This supercluster is made of flour, sugar, salt, olive oil, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, curry, garlic powder and water . ‘I had a whole story going for a while of how I was selected to be the lead image processor for the Wander mission since I'm a photographer but have a degree in engineering and that this was a real spacecraft out there taking images. ‘A lot of people actually thought it was reall! Eventually I decided to tell people how I really make the images and that Wander is entirely fictional.’ He added: ‘I'd like people to look at these images and think could my fictional creation of a planet or moon or galaxy actually exist somewhere in our universe or possibly even beyond? ‘I'd like for the imaginary explorations of Wander to inspire others about the cosmos and actual space exploration.’ This ghostly anomaly is made of butter, food colouring and salt . The bottom of a glass of coffee here looks a bit like a black hole, together with salt, sugar, corn starch and cinnamon .

"Work at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Norfolk country mansion is so behind schedule that the couple might have to postpone moving in until after the birth of their second child next month. The Mail on Sunday understands that William, Kate and Prince George have been living at one of the Queen’s private shooting lodges instead and that Kate may even move back in with her parents after the new baby is born. Local sources said decorators were still painting as recently as ten days ago at Anmer Hall, and that the Duchess, who has suffered from extreme morning sickness, has been unable to stay there. Work at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Norfolk country mansion (pictured) is reported to be far behind schedule . Instead the Cambridges have been residing at Wood Farm, a shooting lodge five miles down the road in the small village of Wolferton. A source in the village of Anmer said: ‘All the locals had expected it to be finished months ago and that they would be in by now. But things have just run on and on for two years. They’ve been living at Wood Farm and popping in to Anmer every few days to check on the progress.’ The shooting lodge is set in remote marshland on the north Norfolk coast down a long private road. If Anmer is not finished in time, Kate is said to be keen to move into her parents’ Berkshire manor house after the birth, just as she did when Prince George was born. A source said: ‘Kate just wants to be looked after at her mum’s house and for the work on Anmer to be completed in her absence.’ A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment. The couple (pictured during a public engagement in London on Friday) are understood to have been living at one of the Queen's shooting lodges while they wait for renovations on their home to be completed .","Work is so far behind they may postpone moving in until after baby's birth .

"A 54-year-old divorcee who admits she was 'stupid' for falling for a Turkish toyboy who left her broken-hearted and down £16,000, says she's 'taking a risk' on a new young lover. Tracy Lockett, from Manchester, fell for Bulent Dohan, 31, after meeting him online but their relationship turned sour after she said he kept asking her for money. The final straw came when she lent him £2,000 which she never got back. Scroll down for video . Tracy fell for Bulent after meeting him online but when they met up, she ended up footing the bill. She says she spent £16,000 during the course of their relationship . But despite her bad experience, she is now in a new relationship with another Turkish man - Aziz - who is also years younger than she is. But she insists she won't be conned again. 'I've met someone new, he's totally different to Bulent,' she told Channel 5 show Love Rats Abroad. 'He can't do enough for me, he's besotted with me, he has never asked for money. 'I am taking a risk but I'm going in with my eyes open this time.' Tracy's willingness to put her heart on the line again is surprising given her previous ordeal. She reveals on the documentary how she met Bulent, from south east Turkey, online in 2009, ten years after she'd divorced. 'I was happy being single so I wasn't looking for love. Within weeks he was telling me he loved me, I had strong feelings for him too, it felt right so I went out to meet him,' she said. The pair arranged to go on holiday together in Istanbul and Tracy said at first it was a dream come true. Tracy said she lent her toyboy £2,000 which she wants back - but he thought it was a gift . 'He made me feel good, he made me feel alive again. The fact he was younger, at the back of my mind I thought ""yeah I can still pull"".' But she said that despite Bulent having a job as a dialysis technician, she was having to pay for everything. She explained: 'He didn't have that much money to spend so I ended up paying for most things. It came to the crunch one night when he said ""I need your help, I don't have the money to get home."" 'So I had to buy his plane tickets home for him and I never got that money back.' Tracy returned to the UK and as their long distance relationship continued, she said Bulent kept asking her to send him money. 'Over three years I went to see him, I spent more than £16,000 and it could have been more if it went on longer,' she said. The relationship ended when Tracy suspected he was seeing another woman. But before that day came, she'd also sent him £2,000 which she said he wanted for a kebab shop licence. Tracy thought it was a loan but Bulent viewed it as a gift - and so has not paid her back. He said he tried to break off the relationship with Tracy numerous times but she wouldn't let him. He is now married and says he wants Tracy to leave him alone once and for all. But Tracy is insistent on fighting to get the £2,000 loan back. The divorcee admitted on Channel 5 show Love Rats Abroad that she was 'stupid' She said: 'I trusted this guy, I gave him a chance and now I believe he was stringing me along getting what he could. It's not about the money, it's the principle.' Tracy has met with the deputy head of City of London Police's Action Fraud and Turkish authorities to try and get Bulent to pay her back. Her efforts so far have proved fruitless and she has been advised her next step would be to launch criminal proceedings - but this would involve expensive legal costs. Tracy believes she is not alone in being duped out of money by a so called love rat. 'My story is the same as many more, I run a Facebook group and so many tell the same story of a man they met at the beach or in a bar and they fell into same trap. 'I thought I was astute and intelligent but for some reason they take over. It made me irrational. I was stupid, everyone thinks their guy is different.' Despite saying this, Tracy herself says her new man, Aziz is 'different' and they have already talked of marriage. Tracy is now in a new relationship with Turkish toyboy Aziz and insists 'he's different' It's a situation Elaine, 48, from Yorkshire, also found herself him when she married Turkish husband Adam Gula, 27, in 2007. 'I thought this is my Mr Right who I have been waiting for all my life,' Elaine told Love Rats Abroad. 'He was like Prince Charming, he treated me like a lady.' The pair met on a night out in the UK in 2003. Elaine recalls: 'I was on a girls' night out and saw him across dance floor. We had a drink and he said he was looking for an older woman, that was it, the start of our relationship. 'I was attracted to his dark hair, dark eyes and he had a nice body, I was happy, over the moon.' Elaine, 48, from Yorkshire, had her heart broken by her Turkish ex-husband . Elaine said husband Adam was like Prince Charming when they first met but their relationship deteriorated after they married . Elaine discovered Adam was in the country because he had a visa obtained by marrying an English woman he had met while she was on holiday in Turkey. Elaine said she wasn't suspicious as to why the relationship hadn't lasted long after they had married and Adam had moved to the UK. 'He said they didn't stay together because as soon as he came into the country, she changed,' Elaine said. Following Adam's divorce, he asked Elaine to marry him. She was delighted and they tied the knot in Turkey where she spent their honeymoon meeting his family and friends. According to his wife, Adam walked out days after his new passport arrived . But on returning to the UK, Elaine said the fairy tale was over and they 'lived like strangers'. After three years, Adam then left her - days after his new passport arrived. 'I was headbutting walls, I was hysterical and in shock,' Elaine said of the day Adam left. 'I really loved him, it was terrible.' She said she has struggled to put what happened behind her and has felt depressed ever since. She said: 'He caught me with my guard down, I was too trusting. He came across as such a lovely person but it was a big mistake.' Love Rats Abroad is in Channel 5 Thursdays at 9pm .","Tracy, from Manchester, fell for Turkish Bulent, 31, after meeting him online .

"Since their son, Aiden, was born prematurely with a rare condition that baffled doctors, Karl Smith and Vikki Jackowiak have battled tirelessly to help him. Aiden, now four, was born with a growth on his face, back and leg and has brain damage that means he can't walk and talk. He had test after test to find out what was causing his problems and as a result, he was recently diagnosed with Clove Syndrome. Scroll down for video . Karl Smith and Vikki Jackowiak appeared on This Morning with their son, Aiden, who has Clove Syndrome . The condition was only discovered in 2011 and just 150 people have been diagnosed with it so far. Aiden's mother, Vikki, 40, from Alnwick, Northumberland, said the diagnosis was both a blessing and a curse - as it has dashed her hopes of one day finding a cure for her son. 'Once we got the diagnosis we looked it up on the internet and saw there was no cure which was disheartening. I always hoped diagnosis would lead to cure, an operation he could have,' she said on today's This Morning. Clove stands for Congenital, Lipomatous, Overgrowth, Vascular Malformations, Epidermal Nevi and Spinal/Skeletal Anomalies and/or Scoliosis. Aiden's condition causes facial deformity due to the accumulation of fatty masses . Symptoms include skin, limb, torso and spinal abnormalities such as like fatty masses or scoliosis (spinal deformity). There can also be vascular (blood vessel) abnormalities such as a birthmark. Aiden's father explained how it doesn't always affect people in the same way and Aiden is a particularly bad case. He said: 'There's no two children the same with Cloves. He's higher end of spectrum, he can't walk and talk like some others with it can.' The parents admitted that the diagnosis has brought them some comfort as they have been able to meet other families going through the same thing they are. The little boy has a great relationship with his older brother, Daniel, pictured right . Vikki and Karl had to see numerous doctors before Aiden was finally diagnosed . Karl, 35, said: 'It's an emotional journey, even though you have your family, meeting others is nice to have that rapport and discuss how you're feeling and how they are going through the same emotions as we are.' The couple, who also have a son, Daniel, 13, will share what life is like for the family in a Channel 5 documentary that airs tomorrow evening called Aidan: The Rarest Boy in the World. Vikki admitted there is always a new issue to deal with as so much is unknown about Cloves but now they have a diagnosis, they can try and give Aiden the best life they can and manage his symptoms. The family share their story in a Channel 5 documentary this week . The parents are striving to give Aiden the best life they can . For example, he's had operations to remove excess fat from his face and neck and could have back surgery in the future. He could also become a test subject for a study being carried out at Cambridge University for a drug trial that could reduce some of the lumps he has and slow down the swelling. In the meantime, the parents said Aiden has started at school four mornings a week - which he loves. 'He has come on leaps and bounds,' Vikki said. She added that he has a great relationship with his older brother who is understanding about how much attention his sibling receives. She said: 'Aiden takes a lot of our time and we're often at hospitals. It's tough on Daniel but we have to make the best of it.'

"'Ancient' statues filmed being destroyed by depraved  Islamic State militants in a Mosul museum last month were nothing more than worthless fakes, the director of an Iraqi museum has claimed. The terrorist organisation  released shocking footage at the end of February purportedly showing jihadis destroying 3,000-year-old artworks with sledgehammers in their northern Iraqi stronghold. But now Baghdad museum director Fawzye al-Mahdi has ridiculed ISIS' propaganda exercise, claiming the genuine priceless Assyrian and Akkadian statues and sculptures are still safely in his possession in the Iraqi capital, adding that those in Mosul were plaster cast replicas. Sick: The terrorist organisation released shocking footage at the end of February purportedly showing jihadis destroying 3,000-year-old artworks with sledgehammers in their northern Iraqi stronghold . Speaking to German news programme Deutsche Welle, Al-Mahdi said: 'None of the artifacts are originals... They were copies. The originals are all here.' The museum director's claims appear to back-up those made by experts on the Iraqi statues. Within hours of the original ISIS propaganda video being released, analysts questioned why the statues appeared to crumble so easily. Others stated that they couldn't possibly be 3,000 years old as some of the are clearly held together by iron poles - a considerably more modern practice. Mark Altaweel, an expert at the Institute of Archaeology at University College, London, told Channel 4 News at the time: 'You can see iron bars inside... The originals don't have iron bars.' Propaganda: Baghdad museum director Fawzye al-Mahdi ridiculed ISIS' video, claiming the genuine Assyrian and Akkadian statues are safely in Baghdad and that those in Mosul were plaster cast replicas . Following the February video release, Mosul's exiled governor Atheel Nuafi also stated that the vast majority of the statues were fakes, but added that at least two of those destroyed were originals. 'There were two items that were real and which the militants destroyed. One is a Winged Bull and the other was the God of Rozhan,' the Saudi-based Al Arabiya news organisation quoted him as saying. The Winged Bull, which is seen being smashed with sledgehammers in the video, is probably one which stood at the gates of Nineveh in the 7th century BC, claimed the International Business Times. 'I think the Winged Bull is very important locally, because it's one of the few objects that hasn't left the country or gone to Baghdad,' Eleanor Robson, chair of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq, told the news organisation. Real: An ISIS militant uses a power tool to destroy a 7th century winged-bull Assyrian protective deity. The statue is thought to have been one of only two genuine artifacts destroyed by ISIS in the video . Until 2003, Mosul museum had the second biggest collection of ancient relics in Iraq, including thousands of items from Nineveh and other ancient centers of Northern Mesopotamia. Amid the Western military operation  against Saddam Hussein that year, looters ransacked the building. Employees managed to save the majority of the items, and then moved most to Baghdad. ISIS militants began destroying ancient statues and monuments shortly after they first seized control of Mosul last summer, describing them as 'worthless idols'. A man shown in the video said the items were being destroyed because they promoted idolatry. 'The Prophet ordered us to get rid of statues and relics, and his companions did the same when they conquered countries after him,' the unidentified man said. Historic loss: Large segments of the priceless winged-bull Assyrian protective deity are hurled to the ground as militants smash it to pieces . Mosul, the biggest city in the Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate, boasts a relatively educated, diverse population that seeks to preserve its heritage sites and libraries. In the chaos that followed the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein, residents near the Central Library hid some of its centuries-old manuscripts in their own homes to prevent their theft or destruction by looters. But this time, the Islamic State group has made the penalty for such actions death. A University of Mosul history professor, who spoke on condition he not be named because of his fear of the Islamic State group, said the extremists started wrecking the collections of other public libraries in December. He reported particularly heavy damage to the archives of a Sunni Muslim library, the library of the 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers and the Mosul Museum Library with works dating back to 5000 BC.","ISIS jihadis released video showing the destruction of 'ancient' sculptures .

"They were the Kardashians of the 70's - attractive, wealthy and dysfunctional. They were the Louds: Pat and Bill and their five children, ranging from age 14 to 20 - Lance, Delilah, Grant, Kevin and Michele. The Louds were the subjects of the first ever television reality show, An American Family, broadcast on PBS in twelve hour-long episodes beginning on January 11, 1973. The show took viewers up close and personal in the home of the Loud family of Santa Barbara, California. Parents Pat and Bill and their kids became household names living in front of the camera for seven months taped the year prior to the broadcast. A record ten million weekly viewers were riveted watching the Loud family's lives falling apart. On camera, Pat asked her husband, Bill to move out, and Lance, the oldest son, was the first gay to come out on television. Pat Loud, with the editorial help of Christopher Makos, is about to reissue reissued a collection of photographs, writings and personal papers of her son Lance for the book, Lance Out Loud, published by Glitterati Incorporated in conjunction with the acquisition of the private memorabilia by Yale University. The Originals: Pat and Bill Loud and their five children ranging from age 14 to 20 -- Lance, Delilah, Grant, Kevin and Michele - were the subjects of the first ever television reality show, An American Family, broadcast on PBS in 1973 . Keeping Up: The Kardashians have had their own share of scandals over the years. Keeping Up with the Kardashians was first broadcast in 2007. They are top row, from left: Brandon Jenner and Burton Jenner; middle row from left: Brody Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Bruce Jenner, Kris Jenner, Cassandra Jenner, Kim Kardashian; and front row from left: Rob Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian . Coming out: Oldest son Lance was the first person to reveal he was gay on television. Affectionate letters from friends honoring the memory of Lance describe him as loving Warhol, wind chimes, thrift shops, yard sales, Latin men, talking on the phone, cats, riding on his motorcycle and every taco stand in LA. Special contempt was directed at Lance for his 'flamboyant, leechlike, homosexuality'. The New York Times described him as 'camping and queening about like a pathetic court jester, a Goya-esque emotional dwarf'. Voyeuristic eyes were mesmerized by the watershed cinema verité event - viewing unscripted moments in the family's life that the press described as exhibitionist and as 'affluent zombies'. Special contempt was directed at Lance for his 'flamboyant, leechlike, homosexuality'. The New York Times described him as 'camping and queening about like a pathetic court jester, a Goya-esque emotional dwarf'. Lance Loud, who died of complications from AIDS in 2001, stated: 'Television ate my family.' He believed the documentary series fulfilled 'the middle-class dream that you can become famous for being just who you are'. He didn't shy away from coming out on television but reveled in the positive feedback he received from the gay community. He became a penpal of Andy Warhol and flamboyantly embraced his own role as a gay icon. He moved to New York to be close to Warhol's Factory, the artist's studio that became a magnet for artists, socialites and hipsters. Lance needed a new landscape that gave him the freedom to be gay --- and to escape northern Californian hippies. Lance was 'pursued by his own demons and turned to drugs to keep them at bay', his mother Pat writes . Affectionate letters from friends honoring the memory of Lance describe him as loving Warhol, wind chimes, thrift shops, yard sales, Latin men, talking on the phone, cats, riding on his motorcycle and every taco stand in LA. It was the time of Free Love when sexuality was celebrated. 'If it feels good, do it' trend swept the country and Lance right along with it. He wanted to live art, live music, be in the music. 'Lance loved movies, food, music, fashion and anything with a horizontal stripe', his sister Delilah writes. 'Never seduced by fame, he wore it as a loose garment. 'Many considered him an icon for coming out on TV. Those who believe that have it backwards; Lance was too impatient to wait for the rest of us, so he ran ahead and scouted the rapids to tell us that the water was fine.' But Lance was 'pursued by his own demons and turned to drugs to keep them at bay', his adoring mother Pat recalls. Author and book editor Ellis Amburn, a friend of Lance wrote, 'In a world that could be cruel and catty, I never heard Lance say an unkind word about anyone, and I always found his blithe spirit contagious.' American Family wasn't anything like the family thought it would be. Pat Loud, now 89, discussed the show and revealed that there wasn't anything negative brewing in their family until the camera and the producer arrived . She told the New York Times in 2013 that the Public Broadcasting Network and the New York affiliate, WNET, viewed the family as California airheads and coerced her into asking her husband for a divorce on camera. She is now happily living again with her ex-husband, Bill, who is 94. The couple has their own Facebook account under the Loud Family. Lance holding a photo of himself in drag. 'Television ate my family,' said Lance. American Family wasn't anything like the Louds thought it would be . An American Family was a premonition of reality TV, an unrehearsed voyeuristic eye, unlike the reality shows of today. Craig Gilbert, the creator of An American Family, never worked again after the documentary aired in 1973. He spent subsequent years avoiding the notoriety that came with the show and charges that he had exploited the Louds and betrayed their trust. 'It was pretty damn tumultuous, and I don't want to go over it again', he told the New Yorker in 2011 when he was 85 and recovering from an accidental overdose of the cough suppressant Mucinex. Rumors swirled at the time of filming that Gilbert had an affair with Pat Loud that both parties denied. The married couple, Alan and Susan Raymond who were hired to record sound, 'balked at capturing several of the series's rawest moments', according to Dennis Lim's story in the New Yorker. Pat Loud is now happily living with ex-husband Bill again . Susan Raymond told Lim that 'Gilbert had a 'Svengali hold' on Pat Loud' and 'Craig destroyed that family'. Gilbert got a late-night phone call from Pat after the show began broadcasting ranting about the negative stories in the press about her family. 'What have I done? What do I do? He asked himself. 'I never resolved it. I don't know what I had wrought. I still don't'.

"A leading linguist has claimed abbreviating words in text messages is making youngsters' spelling better rather than worse (file image) It was condemned as a 'digital virus' with many fearing standards of literacy would plummet. But text speak has not been the disaster for language many feared and one leading linguist has claimed it actually improves people's writing and spelling. Professor David Crystal, an honorary professor at Bangor University, said those who text regularly were found to be 'concentrating their minds' on the relationship between sounds and  written words. The linguist, who has written more than 100 books on the English language, pointed out a new generation is 'constantly' reading and writing online. 'People say text messaging will harm your spelling. No...It helps you to spell better,' he said at the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature in Dubai according to the Daily Telegraph. 'This is because it focuses your mind on the connection between sound and letters. 'The best texters are the best spellers. 'People say young people don't read and write any more.'They may not necessarily read... Shakespeare or Charles Dickens, but have you ever seen a teenager not reading? 'Young people read probably more than I did when I was that age.' He said the digital age had not necessarily heralded a 'linguistic revolution' in the way critics had predicted and said the 'moral panic' of the potential change has not been justified. Professor Crystal's studies have found around 2,000 new words developed as a result of the digital age, including terms such as blog and twittersphere. He said  additions have so far not had a major, or negative, impact on the English language, which has more than one million  words. The linguist said many abbreviations such as 'c u l8r' are not commonly used by modern teenagers. Professor Crystal also claimed that hashtags, used on Twitter, are simply a new method of managing and classifying information and were likely to stay. Professor David Crystal dismissed claims youngsters were not reading as much today as they had done in the past . His comments dispel previous claims abbreviated language was worsening teenagers' grasp of the English language. In 2012 a study claimed the grammar standards of school pupils aged 10-12 had slipped as a result of constantly using shortened phrases. Researchers urged parents not to communicate with their children in text speak to avoid their abilities suffering more. Last year it was claimed Britons spent more time using mobile phones, computers and handheld tablets than they did sleeping. Information gathered by Ofcom, the television watchdog, found the average adult slept for eight hours 21 minutes but spent 20 minutes longer connected to technology.","Professor David Crystal said texting improves people's writing and spelling .

"A top chef shot dead by police after robbing a bank wearing drag and cartoonish makeup reportedly had a secret heroin addiction. Cody Spafford, 26, held up a Wells Fargo branch in Seattle, Washington, last year while wearing a fake nose, a wig, skirt and thick white makeup. Using a fake gun, he threatened tellers and made off with $90,000 stuffed in a suitcase before crashing his car about a mile away. Scroll down for video . Hold-up: Cody Spafford, a 26-year-old sous chef in a prestigious Seattle restaurant, held up a Wells Fargo branch in women's clothes and thick makeup last year . Spafford, who abandoned his realistic-looking BB gun, but kept hold of an 8-inch knife, was shot seven times in a stand-off with police and died at the scene. His family in Utah, and co-workers at The Walrus and The Carpenter, an upscale oyster bar where he was sous chef, were stunned to learn that the man they knew was behind the April 2014 hold-up. Spafford was also set to take a job at high profile New York restaurant Buvette. But, according to a long profile of Spafford published in the Seattle Metropolitan magazine, the high-adrenaline bank robbery was not the only thing those close to him would never have suspected. Promising: Spafford was due to take up a head chef's job in New York City - but had relapsed into heroin use, according to a new profile of him. He is pictured right with an oyster-shucking trophy . In the wake of the robbery, police investigators found syringes and a pipe inside his crashed Hyundai, which he flipped over in an affluent Seattle street before climbing on to a roof of a nearby garage, where police caught up with him. An earlier profile in The Stranger, an alternative weekly newspaper in Seattle, said his housemate Monica found evidence of drug use in his room - though she wouldn't expand on what 'drug paraphernalia' was there. The Metropolitan also reported Spafford had been increasingly erratic in the weeks leading up to the robbery. The profile said he had started coming to work late, forget to place orders for new oysters, and would wear long-sleeved clothes, which would have hidden any signs of drug use. Crash scene: Spafford fled the bank in a Hyundai but crashed it after driving around a mile. Officers found a pipe and syringes in the vehicle . Shot dead: Spafford was shot seven times by a police officer. He was carrying a knife at the time, which is pictured above . An inquest also revealed that he had burned through almost $10,000 of savings in the weeks before he died - and was awaiting a prison sentence for a DUI charge from when he visited home in Utah. Even his parents reportedly had no idea he had relapsed into heroin use, which had plagued his youth. Spafford had reportedly spiraled into addiction as a high school senior back in Salt Lake City, but kicked the habit before moving to Seattle in 2010 for a new start. In Utah, the drug use led to seven arrests and months in jail - while he even robbed his own mother and forged checks in her name so he could get high, according to the Metropolitan. But after a rehabilitation program, and a promising career change in Seattle's burgeoning oyster bar culture, the addictions of the past was seemingly behind him. The magazine hinted that 'the occasional joint' of marijuana was part of the lifestyle at The Walrus and The Carpenter - but never a hint of hard drugs. Co-owner Jeremy Price told the Metropolitan: 'None of us had experience with someone who was addicted to heroin'. Spafford was due to leave Seattle to take up a head chef's post at a French restaurant in Salt Lake City - but never made the trip after his fatal run-in with police less than a month before his start date.","Cody Spafford, 26, held up a Wells Fargo in Seattle, Washington, last April .

"Everyone from Kim Kardashian and Margot Robbie to Rosamund Pike and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini have chopped off their long locks recently, making shorter hair a bona fide trend. But the rise in these shorter haircuts isn't just down to their flattering face-framing effects. According to the Sunday Times, the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is also sign of economic recovery, since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are therefore more pricey to maintain. Shorter haircuts, like Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's new bob (right), are an indication that the economy is in recovery . Rosamund Pike wore a longer style in Gone Girl (left) but recently she went for the chop (right, in February) Celebrity hairdresser Stuart Phillips, whose clients have included Serena Williams and Jamie Oliver, told the newspaper that he believes shorter hairdos are a sure sign that the economy is bouncing back. He said: 'Products are flying off the shelf, more than they used to even a few months ago.' And it's not just the fact that shorter styles require more sprays and gels. The upkeep of a lob (long bob) or pixie crop is also time-consuming, with some women having to visit the salon every four to six weeks to maintain the look. Margot Robbie went from one dramatic hairstyle (left, in March 2014) to another (right, in February 2015) Jourdan Dunn (left, in July 2014) made waves when she got her chin-length lob (right, in February 2015) Kristen Stewart transformed her long auburn locks (left, in May 2014) to an equally daring short style (right, in February 2015) By contrast, women with longer hair can leave it a few months before going in to top up their trims. 'With short hair you need to keep it in shape,' explained Mr Phillips. 'With long hair, a lot of women tend to leave it months on end.' Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who is the face of L'Oreal, debuted her new layered bob just last week on the Graham Norton Show. And Aussie actress Margot Robbie chose the Oscars to show off her new shorter blonde look. A-list trends may not be the best indication of a pattern in the real world, but according to hairdresser Drew Foster, who owns Foster Hair & Beauty in London's Shoreditch neighbourhood, non-famous women are also following suit. Sienna Miller traded in her hippie-chic long waves (left, in March 2014) for a side-swept lob (right, in January) Scarlett Johansson had longer locks in March 2014 (left). But now, she has a very edgy pixie cut (right, February) 'Girls are going shorter,' he told the MailOnline, adding that his salon charges about £48 for a bob, with women tending to come in every six weeks to maintain the style. But Mr Foster feels that the trend is more a sign of modernity than of economic change, since women  visit salons even during a recession because they see it as a way of treating themselves. In any case, he says he's definitely a fan of the new It-style. He said: 'It used to be that girls had long hair and men had short. 'Finally it's 2015 and things have shifted - and I think that's very exciting.' It's not just hair that gets shorter during a recovery - rising hemlines are also an indication that the economy is on the up. And judging by this year's London Fashion Week shows, where labels including Topshop, Julien Macdonald and Giles showcased leg-baring A-line minis, it's a trend that is here to stay.","Shorter cuts require more frequent upkeep at the salon, which costs money .

"In October 2012, Elisa Lopez was sexually assaulted while napping on a subway train in New York City, and the entire incident was caught on video and spread online like wildfire. Late last week, more than two years after the shocking attack, Ms Lopez was finally vindicated when police apprehended her alleged molester, identified as 43-year-old Carlos Chuva. The Queens resident was arrested last Thursday and charged with first-degree felony aggravated sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Vile attack: On October 20, 2012, Elisa Lopez (right) was sleeping aboard a downtown 4 train when a middle-aged man sat next to her and stuck his hand up her skirt (left). The entire incident was caught on video . Groper: The denim-clad stranger got off the train and vanished after Lopez punched him in the face and fled . According to a criminal complaint cited by Gothamist, the suspect admitted that he was the attacker when officers showed a screen grab from the infamous subway video. The vile attack took place at around 4am October 20, 2012, aboard a downtown 4 train near Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan. Elisa Lopez, then a 21-year-old member of the Air National Guard, was on her way downtown to meet her boyfriend after attending a party in The Bronx when she briefly dozed off on the train, instinctively clutching her purse. She woke up moments later to discover a stranger caressing her thigh and face and trying to kiss her. The terrified straphanger punched the pervert in the face and fled the subway. She did not realize the extent of the sexual assault she had endured until a work friend sent her the graphic video shot by a fellow passenger aboard the 4 train. Justice for Elisa: more than two years later, police arrested 43-year-old Carlos Chuvo (left), charging him with aggravated sexual assault of Elisa Lopez . The grainy cell phone footage recorded by Brooklyn man Jasheem Smiley depicts a middle-aged man dressed in a faded denim jacket and jeans shoving his hand under the sleeping woman's skirt and groping her. The 18-second clip of the attack quickly went viral, earning Smiley public censure for capturing the assault on his iPhone instead of trying to stop it. Smiley released another video on his YouTube channel just days later defending his actions that night. Bystander: Jasheem Smiley faced backlash for capturing the video on his cell phone instead of trying to help Lopez . ‘There were 10 other people on the train that didn't do anything,’ he explained. ‘I was the one that did the most.’ Smiley pointed out that after the groper got off the train, he notified the conductor about what happened and went to the police with the video. But according to the man, officers became interested in the case only after he uploaded the footage online and it attracted media attention. The assault witness explained that had he physically intervened, the suspect could have accused him of attacking him without any provocation. Smiley also claimed he was concerned for his own safety because he did not known if the middle-aged pervert had a gun or a knife or him. ‘God knows I did the best I can,’ he said in the video. He did mention that he repeatedly tried waking Lopez, but the woman continued sleeping after a night out drinking with friends. On her part, Elisa Lopez broke her silence about the attack this past December, telling Cosmopolitan that she was in disbelief when she first saw Smiley's footage. ‘I felt sick to my stomach. I was yelling, screaming. I was hysterical,’ she recalled. Determined to see her abuser behind bars, Lopez released a video of her own explaining the circumstances of the attack and launched a Facebook campaign appealing to fellow users for help in bringing the subway groper to justice. Silent no more: After seeing that her case was going nowhere, Lopez, a college student and member of the Air National Guard, went public with her story in December . Survivor: The 23-year-old woman has spent the past two years getting treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, night terrors and depression caused by the shocking assault . Lopez said she has been grappling with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and night terrors for the past two years. She also cannot bear using the subway. Initially, she was hesitant to seek psychological treatment for fear of being ejected from the Air National Guard, but after realizing she was having suicidal thoughts, Lopez decided to go and find herself a therapist. She also turned to art to help her cope with the trauma and adopted a puppy and a calico kitten. She is currently enrolled in the City College of New York. In an interview with Pix11 about Carlos Chuva’s long-awaited arrest, Lopez suggested she now has come full circle, more than two years after the night that changed her life. ‘I'm at a point where i can say that i am ready to move forward with this,’ she said with a smile.","Carlos Chuva, 43, of Queens, charged with first-degree felony aggravated sexual assault .

"The Georgia State coach whose son led the 14-seed to an upset over Baylor in the NCAA men's basketball tournament on Thursday is teasing President Barack Obama for picking his team to lose in the first round. 'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Ron Hunter said after the game in a Vine video. The White House wouldn't apologize on Friday for Obama's incorrect assumption that the Baylor Bears, a 3-seed in the tournament, would prevail against the Georgia State Panthers. The president's spokesman did say, however that the young man who scored the winning basket 'certainly rose to the occasion.' Scroll down for video . RJ Hunter (left, with basketball) made a last-minute three-pointer to send his Georgia State Panthers to the next round of the NCAA Tournament . RJ's father Ron (center) , Georgia State's coach, fell off of his rolling chair, which he was forced to sit on after tearing his Achilles tendon on Sunday . The elder hunter was helped up from the floor by assistants after the stunning shot sank in, leading the 14-seed to upset 3-seed Baylor . Coach Hunter drew nationwide attention after he toppled off of the stool from which he had been cheering on his team after son RJ hit a deep three-pointer, putting the Panthers up 57-56 with 2.7 seconds remaining. Baylor had been favorited in the game by 9. With the younger Hunter on fire, scoring 16 points, Georgia State claimed victory in the final seconds of the game. The Panthers had been down by 12 with less than three minutes left before surging back for a stunning comeback and winning on the junior guard, according to ESPN. Remarking on the surprising come-from-behind win on Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, ''That was a great shot there at the end of the game.' 'I think there’s no question that...that kind of high- level performance when the chips are down is certainly the kind of...spirit that the president would hope to summon in the context of his job, too,' he added. Georgia State, in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001, was picked by few to advance to the second round. President Barack Obama had Baylor winning the game in his bracket. 'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Hunter said after the game, teassing the president . Coach Hunter's assistants had to help him get back into his chair after he was literally floored by his son's last minute heroics. He had been perched on the rolling chair to reduce the strain of a Achilles tendon injury he incurred while celebrating the team's Sun Belt victory over Georgia Southern. The proud father, 50, was wearing a cast and often tried to stand up before being restrained by other coaches during the game. Georgia State will play No. 6 team Xavier in the next round of the NCAA tournament's West division of this year's bracket. Their victory was the second 3-seed upset of the day, coming after UAB's one-point win over Iowa State, favored by 14 points. The Georgia State squad is making its first appearance in the NCAA's big dance since 2001. Team members include former Louisville player Kevin Ware, who broke his leg at the tournament in 2013 in gruesome fashion.

"Trevor Smith, 42, known as Trevor Hancock, who appeared in Coronation Street and Emmerdale, was found drowned in a disused quarry in Derbyshire . A former Coronation Street actor who struggled with his career and sexuality killed himself just hours after learning that his father had died, an inquest has heard. Trevor Smith, known by his stage name Trevor Hancock, was found drowned in a lagoon at a disused quarry near his home in Derbyshire on January 6 this year. One day earlier, the 42-year-old had been discharged from a week-long stay in hospital, after undergoing surgery for self-inflicted injuries. As he was being discharged, a nurse at the hospital also gave him the devastating news about his father's death. Just one hour later, a concerned friend had reported Mr Smith missing, a call which triggered a day-long manhunt for the actor. Officers found his mobile in his home, which contained pictures of the quarry where his body was discovered the following day. It later emerged that Mr Smith, who had also appeared in Emmerdale and Hollyoaks, had been overwhelmed by his career, stress and his sexuality in the months before his death and suffered from 'dark moods'. Mr Smith, who was born in Middleton, Greater Manchester, had been admitted to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital on December 30 after his friend phoned 999 over concerns for his welfare. The inquest heard how he had sent a text to a young student actor whom he 'had taken under his wing' saying: 'Sorry I have to go now. You're the only one who can do this.' The message to Tom Lewin also asked him to phone police, as well as the people he wanted to contact about his death. After Mr Lewin phoned the emergency services for help, police smashed down Mr Smith's door and found him unconscious in the bathroom. When they revived him, Mr Smith told officers he did not want to be saved. In hospital, the actor underwent surgery for his injury, before both of wrists were put in casts. He was also assessed by psychiatrists, who were happy for him to leave hospital, under the proviso he was monitored by the community mental health team. But later that morning, Mr Smith told his close friend Darren Langford, with whom he was staying, that he needed to take a  jacket back to a friend. When he did not return for an hour, Mr Langford called the police. Mr Smith, who had been a professional actor since 1991, appeared in Coronation Street (pictured) in 1999 as Kevin Dolan, a valuer from estate agents Adam Wade & C, who were selling the soap's shop, The Kabin . The inquest heard that, while in hospital, Mr Smith had disclosed 'problems with his career, stress and his sexuality'. The actor had been a professional actor since 1991, training at Manchester's Arden School of Theatre from 1996 to 1999. That year, he went on to appear in Coronation Street as Kevin Dolan, a valuer from estate agents Adam Wade & C, who were selling the soap's shop, The Kabin. Rita (left), played by actress Barbara Knox, spots the For Sale sign on the Kabin - while Mr Smith sold as part of his role on the show - while talking to Betty Turpin (right), played by the late Betty Driver . He later appeared in two episodes of Emmerdale playing a character called Tom. He also took on roles in Hollyoaks, ITV's The Memoirs of Sherlock Homes, and Channel 4 medical drama No Angels. Along with a number of short film credits, including Gate Crash, Behind Closed Doors he appeared in a feature film Salvage and various TV commercials. But his career had stalled in recent years and his sister Julie Smith said he had been depressed about his life. 'He loved acting and had small roles on TV and in the theatre,' she said in a statement. 'He believed he would become a great actor.' She said he had mentioned suicide in the past, but to her knowledge had never harmed himself. During the hearing in Chesterfield, Derbyshire's assistant coroner James Newman read a statement from Katherine Wells, a mental health nurse at the hospital, who had told Mr Smith his father had died. Summing up Mr Newman said: 'Whilst in hospital it would appear that Trevor Smith, to some extent, disclosed the reason why he had cut his wrists, it was, mainly related to his career, stress and his sexuality.' Returning a conclusion of suicide the coroner said: 'I'm satisfied with the evidence before me that Trevor Smith intended to take his own life, but furthermore he took steps to carry that out.' After his death, Coronation Street stars led the tributes to the late actor. Antony Cotton tweeted: 'Love life and live life because you just never know…With great sadness, @Ecclestonshire and I have just raised a glass to our friend and colleague who died today. Rest in peace my friend.' While Kym Marsh said: 'Very sad news today. Still in shock. A huge loss for us all RIP to an amazing guy #so young.' Samia Ghadie also posted a quote which read: 'Be grateful for every second of every day that you get to spend with the people you love. Life is so precious.' Catherine Tyldesley, who plays Eva, retweeted her co-star's posts and also shared: 'Just awful. A true gentleman. So thoughtful, kind and gentle. RIP. Gods new angel [sic].'

"Facebook has removed the ‘feeling fat’ emoticon from its status menu after an online campaign from activists who complained that it was insensitive to people who struggle with eating disorders . Facebook has removed the ‘feeling fat’ emoticon from its status menu after an online campaign from activists who complained that it was insensitive to people who struggle with eating disorders. More than 16,000 people signed an online petition at change.org set up by Catherine Weingarten and the group Endangered Bodies, which seeks to combat ‘merchants of body hatred who turn girls and women against their own bodies’. Activists associated with the group launched multiple Change.org petitions last month as part of a campaign linked to National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. ‘We’ve heard from our community that listing “feeling fat” as an option for status updates could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders,’ a Facebook spokeswoman said on Tuesday. ‘So we’re going to remove “feeling fat” from the list of options. We’ll continue to listen to feedback as we think about ways to help people express themselves on Facebook.’ Catherine Weingarten, a Catherine Weingarten, a 24-year-old Ohio student who launched the U.S. version of the petition, had written on the petition's page that ‘fat is not a feeling.’ Campaign: More than 16,000 people signed Catherine Weingarten's online petition which called for the 'feeling fat' emoji to be eliminated from Facebook's list of emojis that can be used as status updates . 'Scrolling through Facebook the other day, I saw a friend’s status set to ""feeling fat,"" accompanied by an emoji with chubby cheeks and a double chin.

I have spent years of my life consumed with negative thoughts about my body, and far too many days starving myself in an effort to lose weight. 'But even worse than the skipped meals and the hours spent obsessing in front of the mirror was the fear of what others thought about me and my body. 'When Facebook users set their status to ""feeling fat,"" they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be overweight, which can include many people with eating disorders. 'That is not ok. Join me in asking Facebook to remove the ""fat"" emoji from their status options.' Apology: Facebook released a statement on Tuesday saying that it was ditching the 'feeling fat' emoji for status updates because it could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders . Following Facebook’s announcement, Weingarten told Change.org in a statement: “As someone who struggled with body image, I feel so happy that I am eliminating one form of body shaming hatred on the internet.” Facebook had previously issued a statement to ABC News that said: 'People use Facebook to share their feelings with friends and support each other. 'One option we give people to express themselves is to add a feeling to their posts. You can choose from over 100 feelings we offer based on people’s input or create your own.'

"From an unspeakable tragedy, a new beginning has come for Rachel and Heidi McFarland. The Iowa couple lost their adopted son Gabriel last year in a horrific turn of events, just weeks after his birth mother decided she wanted him back. But this week, as Gabriel's father, Drew Weehler-Smith, 18, received a 50-year prison sentence for murdering the little boy, the pair have revealed they are the proud parents to a baby daughter - and are expecting a second child any day now. New beginnings: Rachel (left) and Heidi (right) McFarland lost their adopted son last year, after the boy was killed by his biological father.

The women were able to adopt their baby, London, after being contacted by a mom-to-be who was touched by their story and had been searching for adoptive parents. Before the adoption process started however, the two decided to try and have a baby on their own. Heidi McFarland is now eight months pregnant. The two are expecting another little girl, who they intend to call Vienna, The Des Moines Register reported. The news follows an emotional week for the two, following the sentencing of Drew Weehler-Smith. Four-month-old Gabriel King McFarland was found unresponsive on April 22, 2014, by his mother after she left the baby in the care of his father at their Des Moines home. The boy later passed away, with an autopsy showing Gabriel of an abusive head trauma, which authorities say he suffered at the hands of his dad, who was 17 at the time. They believe Weehler-Smith shook the boy. The . tragedy came just a month after the teen mother, Markeya Atkins, changed . her mind about giving him up for adoption and took him back from the . women who had brought him up as their own.

She . notified the mother, who rushed home and found Gabriel limp and not . breathing in a glider chair. 'Someone left my . friend's baby that they were baby-sitting by themselves, and the baby's . blue,' the friend can be heard saying on the 911 calls, with Atkins crying in the background: 'He just left him here.'

School, was initially charged with neglect of a dependent person but the charge was upgraded to murder. He was tried as a adult, and plead guilty to second-degree murder. On Wednesday morning, he was sentenced to 50 years prison, the maximum sentence. Rachel McFarland told The Des Moines Register after the sentencing that she will probably never be able to forgive Weehler-Smith, but she believes his adoptive parents, who are also lesbians, have not been given enough credit for being amazing people.

"The main cathedral in San Francisco has been ordered to take down a sprinkler system used to deter homeless from sleeping in its 30ft-high porchways. The hoses outside the front  of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission. News of their existence emerged via CBS News this week, triggering outcry from the wider community. Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night - 'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources'. Against building regulations: The main cathedral in San Francisco has been ordered to take down a sprinkler system used to deter homeless from sleeping in its porchways . Discreet: The hoses outside the front of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission . Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless, added that the time-triggered mechanisms were 'certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings.' However, the church defended the sprinkler idea stating that it wasn't safe having homeless people and drug addicts lurking when families were visiting. Chris Lyford, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, told CBS that staff tried to find other forms of accommodation for those without shelter. 'We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,' Lyford said. 'To Saint Anthony's soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes.' Wrong move: Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night - 'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources' Roughing it: A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas . Lyford claimed he did not know about the sprinkler system until it was brought to his attention but another church staff member said the spouts were installed over a year ago. According to CBS, the rain showers ran for 75 seconds every 30 to 60 minutes. A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas. 'You've got some pretty hardcore homeless people who actually don’t care... so they’ll go in there and sleep.' Robert, another homeless San Francisco inhabitant, said that as well as the water systems there were signs pasted up stating 'No Trespassing.' Time-triggered mechanism: According to CBS, the rain showers ran for 75 seconds every 30 to 60 minutes. However, now the sprinklers will be taken down as they reportedly violate the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection code. The church has 15 days to comply and remove the system. Bishop William Justice, the rector of Saint Mary's Cathedral, issued a statement apologizing for any upset the church's homeless deterrent had caused. He said the sprinklers were modeled on similar systems used in the city’s Financial District 'as a safety, security and cleanliness measure to avoid the situation where needles, feces and other dangerous items were regularly being left in these hidden doorways. 'The problem was particularly dangerous because students and elderly people regularly pass these locations on their way to school and mass every day,' he added. Justice said since the archdiocese has learned the system may violate the city’s water-use laws, work to remove it would be 'completed by the end of the day'.","The hoses outside the front of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently  in violation of building regulations .

"A Florida mom is accused of leaving her three children alone in her bedroom so she could go drinking at a bar on Saturday afternoon.

"Independent economists such as Soumaya Keynes (pictured) have urged both the Tories and Labour to be more straightforward about spending plans . Independent economists have urged both the Tories and Labour to be more straightforward with voters about their post-election tax and spending plans. Researchers from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that George Osborne should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by £12billion. They also said that Labour’s ideas to deal with Britain’s deficit were ‘less explicit’ than the other main parties, and could see Ed Miliband rack up tens of billions a year in borrowing. Yesterday IFS director Paul Johnson criticised both the major parties over their lack of clarity ahead of May’s general election. Referring to the Chancellor’s planned £12billion in welfare cuts, he said: ‘It is now almost two years since he announced his intention of cutting welfare spending by £12billion. It’s time we knew more about what that might actually involve.’ The Chancellor signalled yesterday that a future Conservative government would freeze benefits paid to people of working age for two years from 2016. The freeze, which would not include pensions, disability benefits and maternity pay, would save £3billion. Last week the Daily Mail also revealed that other measures likely to be included in the Tory manifesto include restricting child benefit to three children for new claimants, cutting the cap on welfare claims from £26,000 to £23,000 per household and removing the right of under-25s to housing benefit and jobless payouts if they refuse offers of work, training or education. Researchers from the IFS said that George Osborne should spell out exactly how he plans to cut welfare spending by £12billion . Multi-billion pound plans to ‘revolutionise’ travel in the North of England will be unveiled today. Part of George Osborne’s ‘Northern Powerhouse’ strategy, they include new rail routes that could see 140mph trains reduce Liverpool to Manchester journey times to around 20 minutes. A so-called ‘TransNorth’ rail network would link Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle and Hull. The Liverpool-Manchester route could cost as much as £13billion, while a plan to reduce journey times between Sheffield and Manchester from the 48 to 27 minutes could cost up to £19billion. Other plans include new east-west road connections and introducing Oyster-style travel cards across the North. However even those measures would fall well short of the £12billion Mr Osborne needs to find. Yesterday IFS economist Soumaya Keynes also warned that Labour’s rules were so loose that the party could end austerity next year and open the public spending tap again. She claimed that Labour could increase real-term spending by more than £9billion a year by 2020, compared to Tory plans to lower it by £14billion by that point. Labour has promised that it will balance day-to-day spending at some point during the next Parliament, but has not yet specified when that will be. And unlike the Conservatives, the party has not committed to balancing all government spending – leaving it free to borrow tens of billions for ‘investment’. This means that under Labour, Britain’s £1.5trillion national debt could continue to grow indefinitely, while the Tories would begin to pay it off by the end of the next parliament – meeting David Cameron’s pledge to ‘fix the roof while the sun shines’. Yesterday the Prime Minister said it was clear that Labour would borrow, spend and tax more than the Conservatives. He added: ‘I am determined not to go backwards.’ Inheritance tax takings will double in the next four years at the current threshold, as middle-income families are dragged into paying the levy. Forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility revealed the taxman will rake in £6.4billion in 2019 – up from £3.4billion in 2013. Once targeted at the wealthy, tens of thousands of ordinary families now pay the death tax following years of rapid house price growth. Unchanged since 2009, it is charged at 40 per cent of the value of any estate above £325,000, or £650,000 for a couple with a joint estate. The figures come after it emerged the Conservatives are considering raising the threshold in its election manifesto. George Osborne’s tax boost for orchestras fell flat yesterday when MPs claimed brass bands could be excluded. A consultation paper published in January suggested that to qualify, ensembles would have to include string, woodwind, brass and percussion sections. But Labour said it would leave out brass bands popular in the North of England and swiftly branded the policy a ‘trumpet tax’. Labour said George Osborne's tax boost for orchestras would exclude brass bands (file picture) Shadow culture minister Chris Bryant said it would exclude string orchestras like the London Sinfonia and accused George Osborne of being ‘out of tune’. The Treasury later insisted brass bands would be included, insisting the decision had been agreed weeks ago. It said the 25 per cent tax relief from next year will apply to any group of 12 or more musicians playing instruments in any of the four orchestral sections. Interest rates could be slashed even closer to zero to keep Britain’s economic recovery on track, a senior Bank of England official suggested yesterday. Chief economist Andy Haldane said rates may need to be cut again – having been frozen at 0.5 per cent for more than six years – if inflation threatened to stay too low for too long after it tumbled to 0.3 per cent – its lowest level since 1960. His intervention sent sterling tumbling on global currency markets and came days after Bank Governor Mark Carney said a cut would be ‘extremely foolish’. Mr Haldane said: ‘The chances of a rate rise or cut are broadly evenly balanced.’","Osborne urged to explain how he will cut welfare spending by £12billion .

"A group of friends and their children who are living together in a nine-bedroom home in Connecticut could be forced out because they aren't all related. The three couples, their three children and two single friends face being separated because the city of Hartford says the living arrangement violates its historic district's zoning code, which says that no more than two unrelated people can live in one of its homes, CBS reported. But the group, who moved into the spacious home in the West End neighborhood last August, said they believe they are promoting great values. Scroll down for video . 'Family': Three couples, three of their children and two single friends  bought a home together in Hartford, Connecticut last year but now face having to sell because the arrangement violates zoning laws . Spacious: They moved into this nine-bedroom home together last August and they said the arrangment is allowing them to live within their means while also making them cooperate like a family should . 'I think there's a real extension of our values as people,'  one of the group's members, English teacher Kevin Lamkins, told CBS. 'The values I'm speaking of are sustainability, cooperation, living more, living well but within your means. Being connected to other people and not being in a silo, so to speak.' The group, which contains three teachers and a mental health therapist, laughed as they explained there are no religious undertones to the arrangement or 'intermingling' of couples. Instead, they share duties in the home and they share a bank account to pay expenses. But last year, a neighbor complained to the city, which determined they were violating the zoning code, which was historically set up to avoid people turning their homes in the beautiful district into boarding houses. All together: The residents, who laughed as they said they were not a cult, share responsibility for chores . Working as one: The group members showed CBS This Morning how they list projects needed to be carried out at the house; everyone chips into the cost of repairs on the home, they said . The group appealed but lost and now have to decide on if they should go to court or go their different ways. They said the thought of having to separate is financially and emotionally stressful. 'It's preposterous. Whomever is in your home, who you love, is who your family is,' Josh Blanchfield told CBS. 'And the notion that the city is going to discount that is unacceptable to us.' City officials would not comment, citing possible litigation. The beautiful, historic neighborhood is home to high-profile residents including Mayor Pedro Segarra and his husband and Connecticut Governor Daniel Malloy.

"Aid has begun arriving in Vanuatu as the tiny Pacific nation struggles to uncover the devastation of what could be the worst natural disaster to ever hit the region. The official death toll in the capital Port Vila stood at six, although experts said this was likely a fraction of the fatalities nationwide after reports entire villages were 'blown away' when the cyclone swept through. Communications are still down across most of the archipelago's 80 islands, although the airport in Port Vila reopened with limited facilities to allow in much-needed aid.

'At this stage thankfully I can report that no Australians have been amongst the casualties and we haven't had any reports of Australians in distress or needing support,' Ms Bishop told the Nine Network on Monday. The government said it was still trying to assess the scale of the disaster unleashed when Super Cyclone Pam, a maximum category five system, vented its fury on Friday night, with winds reaching 320 kilometres (200 miles) an hour. The UN had unconfirmed reports that the cyclone had killed 44 people in one province alone and Oxfam said the destruction in Port Vila was massive, with 90 percent of houses damaged.

Mr Skarbek, who spent years dragging his wife Jenny to pub trivia nights, got into debt when he had to pay sky-high medical bills to treat his cancer . His six-month treatment cost $50,000, putting further strain on the couple who said they were trapped in the renting cycle. 'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow-out on medical bills with my six-month cancer treatment. Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said. Things started to turn around when Mr Skarbek was given a clean bill of health and was told he had got on to the the show in the same week. 'Sometimes you get in a rut. You know things will improve eventually but it's hard to see how. Then I got the great medical news and found out I was going to make the show,' he said. 'A whole series of things just started coming my way.' With a 'life-changing' amount of money now sitting in his bank account Mr Skarbek said, after years of renting, he can't wait to become a home owner. 'When we were younger and had the chance to buy a house we could never find the perfect property. Then the market went berserk and although we were saving like crazy, we were shut out.’ ‘This will be the house that trivia built,’ he joked. After buying a home Mr Skarbek says he'll use some of the prize money to take his wife around the world . Having a good understanding what it's like to struggle financially Mr Skarbek said his wife was adamant they share their good fortune by making a generous donation to the Smith Family. 'Jenny was thinking about how tough some people do it and what a magical thing it would be to win that money and help someone else that's in need,' he said. Not only will they satisfy their own wanderlust with a trip around the word, Mr Skarbek said his mother hasn’t been back to her native Poland in 15 years and said he cant wait to send the 78-year-old home in style, on a business class flight. Mr Skarbek says his 78-year-old mother Sophie has always supported him and now it's his turn to repay the favour by sending her back to her native Poland for a holiday after 15 years . Mr Skarbek, pictured as a child with family members, said travelling the world was the 'greatest gift' he was given . A young Mr Skarbek was nicknamed 'The Professor' Surprisingly, Mr Skarbek said he wasn't a particularly good student at school, instead saying he inherited his thirst for knowledge from his father. 'Ever since I was a little kid a lot of my family used to nickname me 'The Professor'. I was always reading,' he said. He spent his younger years travelling the world with his family which he said was the 'greatest gift' he was ever given. Mr Skarbek said he has been an avid trivia player at his local pub for as long as he can remember and was elated to find his years of training could be put to good use. 'This is the only chance I've had to actually do something with my trivia skills,' he said. After spending 15 years in the energy industry Mr Skarbek said he can't wait to leave his job and spend some time relaxing with his family. ‘I have moments where I know it’s happened and I have moments where sometimes it feels like a dream.’ Mr Skarbek is the first Million Dollar Minute contestant to win the million dollar jackpot with his jackpot including $16,000 in ‘safe money’ he accumulated during the games.

"Rather than burning her bra, an entrepreneur fed up with 'sexualised' underwear in stores was inspired to design her own range that suited her feminist ideals. Hayat Rachi used her life's savings to found British lingerie brand Neon Moon to provide stylish underwear for women of all shapes and sizes. The first collection, called Mon Dieu offers simple, sporty-looking sets which are free from cleavage-boosting padding or wiring. Designer Hayat Rachi raised money on a fundraising website to start her own feminist lingerie line (modelled here by two real women) In her images, Rachi was determined to use real women, posing naturally and not catering to the male gaze . The lingerie - which comes in  chartreuse, orange and black - is made from sustainable bamboo fabric rather than lace and satin because it moulds to the wearer’s body, and has antibacterial properties. On her fundraising Kickstarter page Rachi wrote: ‘Not everything is about being sexy or being objectified for the male gaze.' Explaining why she felt driven to design the line, she said: ‘I found it difficult to find a lingerie brand that shared the same ethos as myself: empowerment, body confidence and the non-objectification of women.’ ‘So instead of succumbing to the body-shaming, sexualised and objectifying lingerie on the market, I used my frustration to start my own brand, Neon Moon, with the support of The Prince’s Trust.’ After being accepted on to the charity's year-long enterprise program, Rachi received mentorship and professional advice for free to develop her product. In the brand's promotional imagery, the two models certainly seem empowered lounging around the house in Neon Moon underwear. The underwear sets aren't underwired or padded and are made with anti-bacterial, soft bamboo fibre . The women look smiling and healthy and sport natural bodies, rather than catwalk models' ultra-slimline shape. Rachi named each of the underwear styles with 'Francophile sounding words, calling them: Coucou, Bof, Tac-Tac and Non!. She said: 'They are really vibrant and fun words to pronounce, which works well with the vibrant colours of the bras and knickers.' The entrepreneur  launched a Kickstarter campaign for Neon Moon, which ends on 10 April, and has already exceeded the original £5,000 target, with 165 backers. Rachi explains the brand's story in the accompanying video with lingering detail shots panning over her creations, a behind-the-scenes look at the promotional shoot, and girls pledging their support to her  campaign. She said: ‘I am absolutely elated with the result. I genuinely couldn’t fathom reaching the £5,000 goal with 18 days left!’ Rachi wanted to design lingerie that wasn't about objectifying women . ‘I have been so blessed by the support received from women, men, transgender and non-binary people’s generosity!’ ‘The amount of press created, and also Zooey Deschanel sharing an article on Neon Moon on her facebook (to close to six million followers) added to such a viral buzz about Neon Moon’s Kickstarter. ‘All extra money funded beyond £5,000 will go into producing more lingerie for the “Mon Dieu” collection in order to sell directly online.' She added that there's a deeper significance to raising money so quickly for her concept. ‘[It] just goes to show that people do not agree with the sexualisation and objectification of girls within the lingerie industry.' Neon Moon is 'revolutionising' the underwear world by being 'a body-positive, feminist lingerie brand,’ she added. Neon Moon underwear is available in size small (UK eight to ten), medium (UK ten to 12) and large (12 to 14) through the Kickstarter campaign . Images for Neon Moon included real women who even showed off their armpit hair in pictures .","Hayat Rachi, 25, founded ‘unapologetic feminist’ lingerie brand Neon Moon .

Updates: A message about Mitchell's condition was posted to her official Twitter on Tuesday night . Earlier her website urged fans to: 'Light a candle and sing a song, let's all send good wishes her way.' Sources earlier told TMZ that a 911 call was received from Joni's Los Angeles home at 2.30pm, with the caller stating she was unconscious. Paramedics who responded reported that the Big Yellow Taxi singer was 'alert' during the journey. It is not yet known what prompted the medical emergency. Mitchell has been known to retreat inside her Spanish-style villa and not venture out for extended periods of time. She has lived in the Bel-Air home alone since 1974 and has previously spoken about how she enjoys her autonomy. 'Yes, you can call me a recluse,' she told The Star in 2013. 'But I like living alone.' The Canadian-born singer has won eight Grammys in her career and was one of the most iconic stars of her generation. Scene: The folk icon was reportedly found by paramedics around 2.30pm on Tuesday after an emergency call from her house in Bel-Air, where she has lived since 1974 . Last year, Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, admitted she endured years of turmoil after being diagnosed with the rare condition Morgellons disease, which made her believe parasites were living under her skin. The condition is not acknowledged by Western medicine, which considers it psychological. Iconic:  The Canadian-born singer won eight Grammys in her career and was one of the most iconic stars of her generation . In the memoir, Joni Mitchell: In Her Own Words, she revealed: 'At the height of my illness I could not even wear clothing. 'All the time it felt like I was being eaten alive by parasites living under my skin. I couldn't leave my house for several years. 'Sometimes it got so bad I couldn't walk and I'd have to crawl across the floor. My legs would cramp up, just like I was having a polio spasm.'

"A mother who witnessed a paediatrician hog-tying her seven-year-old son during a consultation has called for the doctor to be deregistered. One of Australia's leading experts in child behaviour, Dr Neville Goodwin Davis, pleaded guilty to assault after allegedly sitting on the young boy's back at a Gold Coast clinic in October 2012. The  mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, took photos of the incident on her camera phone which show Mr Davis tying her son's hands behind his back and ankles together. Scroll down for video . A mother wants to sue Dr Neville Goodwin Davis for compensation after he allegedly hog-tied her son . The unnamed mother claimed she screamed and broke down as she told Dr Davis to get off her son . Speaking to A Current Affair, the outraged mother claimed she screamed and broke down as she told Dr Davis to get off her son, who was being treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Fearing her son may have had Aspergers Syndrome, the mother raised concerns with Mr Davis but she never expected he would use a rope as a technique to control her son's behaviour. 'He just told me that he was going to prove to me that he didn't have Aspergers and that's when he [son] was tied up,' the distraught mother said. 'He told me an Aspergers child would be screaming their lungs out by now. That was his way of telling me he doesn't have Aspergers.' Aspergers syndrome is a condition that falls within the autism spectrum. People with the condition often have difficulty forming friendships and communicating with others, as well as having difficulty understanding social rules and interpreting the body language of others, according to the Victorian state health department. Despite her photo evidence, Dr Davis was hit with just a 12-month, $1000 good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded for the alleged assault. 'I am absolutely furious. I'll never have that closure that I needed to see him standing there getting the guilty verdict I knew he'd deserved,' the mother said. Dr  Davis (centre) has pleaded guilty of assault and allegedly sitting on the young boy's back  in October 2012 . The mother claims her son was seizure-free but after the consultation, he suffered a major seizure that night . The mother claimed that Dr Davis also threatened to flush her son's head down the toilet but he later denied the allegations in court. She claimed her son was seizure-free for two and a half years but following the consultation, the seven-year-old suffered a major seizure that night. 'He now has got severe anxiety. Everything is bitten, he bites holes in his shirt, he bites Wii controls, he bites them right through to the metal,' his mother said. She added that her son has been suffering high anxiety, triggering seizures causing calcium deposits on his brain with doctors fearing he may not survive for another five years. She said her son has been suffering seizures with doctors fearing he may not survive for another five years . Michelle Ridgen (pictured) also claims Dr Davis allegedly assaulted her five-year-old son 10 years ago . Another mother, Michelle Ridgen also claims Dr Davis carried out 'barbaric' acts when he treated her five-year-old son 10 years ago for behavioural problems. 'It's just unspeakable - it makes you feel sick in the stomach,' Ms Ridgen told A Current Affair. 'He told us this is the way to discipline your child - you just grab him by the hair, pull him to his feet,' she said. The Australian Medical Board has ruled Dr Davis 'must not treat, consult or assess a patient under the age of 18 years without the presence of a Committee approved chaperone'. He will face the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal on March 27 to determine whether he will result in a suspension or deregistration.

"Most meat-eaters would physically cringe at the phrase 'plant-based' diet, but one woman has made it her aim to educate the world about the benefits of going vegan. Cookbook author Dreena Burton, 44, stopped eating meat, fish and animal products 20 years and during that time, has written five best-selling cookbooks. The Vancouver-based author's most recent, Plant-Powered Families, includes more than 100 whole-food, vegan recipes  to help families that want to transition to a meat-free diet. Scroll down for video . Cookbook author, Dreena Burton stopped eating meat, fish and animal products 20 years ago and in that period has written five best-selling cookbooks . Dreena's recipe for Cinnamon French Toast omits eggs and instead uses white chia seeds, cashews and unsweetened dairy-free milk . Dreena, who writes a blog as well, has raised her three young children (ages 6, 14 and 10) as vegans, and the recipes supposedly cater to everyone from fussy eaters to packing school launches. The 'delicious, creative, fun and nutritious' book also includes guides to healthy and balanced meal plans for all ages, including a morning snack, an afternoon snack and even a dessert after dinner. Burton highlights key superfoods such as quinoa and kale, and flags easy ways to incorporate them into an everyday diet. She also underlines more unconventional food alternatives, such as using vegetables like artichoke in place of meat in a burger patty and use sunflower seeds to change up the texture. Instead of meat-based burger patties, Dreena uses artichokes for the body of the 'meat' Dreena then uses sunflower seeds to change up the texture of the artichoke burger . The mother-of-three also recreates iconic American meals with vegan alternatives, such as the 'sloppy joe', which is usually comprised of beef. onions and ketchup in a bun. Burton instead, utilises oats, green lentils and red bell peppers. When it comes to desserts, the recipes become truly inventive, with brownies that omit eggs and instead use kidney beans, dates and a potato. Dreena became a vegan in her twenties and at first made subtle dietary changes. 'I wanted to improve my health. I began learning about the health benefits of a plant-based diet (and the health risks associated with consumption of animal products). Scroll down for recipe . Dreena's recipe for her 'Crazy Brownie' excludes the use of eggs and instead opts for slightly unconventional ingredients such as kidney beans, pitted dates and cooked yellow or red potato . Dreena's three daughters (pictured left to right - ages 6, 14 and 10) are also vegans. Dreena has said: 'I didn't want to give our children foods that I didn't want to eat myself!' 'After making some changes over a period of weeks, I first became vegetarian, and then vegan a few months after. 'I felt so much better, and all beneficial aspects of the diet (health, environment, animal welfare) connected for me.' Her cookbook also includes healthy drinks options such as the pumpkin pie smoothie. As well as a variety of seasonings, she also incorporates pumpkin purée, mango chunks, pitted dates and banana slices - all blended up.

Dreena believes that all the beneficial aspects of being a vegan, including health, environment and animal welfare added up for her . As for her three children, raising them as vegan was ever the only option. Dreena says: 'It was very natural for me. I didn't want to give our children foods that I didn't want to eat myself! 'As a new parent, I was of course cautious and did my research. 'But ultimately, I wanted to give our children abundantly nutritious foods, and protect them from the health risks of meat and dairy consumption.' Dreena only uses simple and natural ingredients such as pumpkin to create her whole-food, vegan recipes . Dreena cooks delicious vegan dishes with her 6-year-old daughter. She says: 'Ultimately, I wanted to give our children abundantly nutritious foods.' It turns out Dreena's strong belief and extensive list of recipes have attracted attention from high-reaching places. Dreena says: 'Several years ago an article was written in the Chicago-Sun Times about Barack Obama's fitness trainer (Cornell McClellan). 'He was interviewed and referenced my third title, Eat, Drink & Be Began, as ""delicious way to learn how to become a responsible, and healthful, vegan."" Almost a White House shout-out!' Dreena's biggest reason for going vegan? 'It's just a beautiful way to eat. The foods are full of vibrant colors, textures, flavours, and nutrients, there is no animal suffering, and it's gentler to our planet as a whole.' Makes 16 brownies . Ingredients . Preheat oven to 350°F. Line an 8"" × 8"" brownie pan with parchment paper. Using a small or mini food processor, puree the beans, dates, potato, tahini, and coconut butter until smooth, and then add the maple syrup and milk and puree again. Add the cocoa powder, sugar, arrowroot, vanilla bean powder, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt to the processor and puree until combined. (If your processor is too small, transfer the date mixture to a bowl, and use a spatula to incorporate the dry ingredients.) Stir in the chocolate chips. Transfer the mixture to the brownie pan, and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake for 22–24 minutes (brownies will firm with cooling and are more fudgy with less baking, so don’t overbake). Remove, let cool completely, frost if desired, and cut into squares. Makes 5 patties . Ingredients . In a food processor, add and the artichoke hearts, rice, nutritional yeast, sunflower seeds, parsley, miso, Dijon mustard, sea salt, garlic, black pepper, and vinegar and puree. Once the mixture is coming together and a little sticky, add the oats and pulse through several times. Refrigerate for an hour if possible (it will make it easier to shape the patties). After chilling, take out scoops of the mixture and form burgers in your hands. I scoop generously with an ice cream scoop, roughly 1/3-½ cup for each. To cook, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties for 5–7 minutes on the first side, and then another 3–5 minutes on the second side until a little golden.

"Scientists are virtually certain that California will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years. Now they say the risk of a mega-quake is more likely than previously thought. The chance of a magnitude-8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 per cent from 4.7 per cent, mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once, releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction. While the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates, it's more likely - greater than 99 per cent chance - that California will be rattled by a magnitude-6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 Northridge disaster. Brace: A new U.S. Geological Survey report has increased the likelihood of a magnitude-8 earthquake hitting California over the next 30 years. Above, a photo of an overpass that collapsed in the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake . The chance of a Northridge-size quake was slightly higher in Northern California than Southern California - 95 per cent versus 93 per cent, according to a report released Tuesday by the U.S. Geological Survey. 'California is earthquake country, and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one,' USGS geophysicist and lead author Ned Field said. The latest seismic calculations largely mirror previous findings issued by the USGS in 2008. Back then, scientists also determined that California faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a Northridge-size quake. The new report included newly discovered fault zones and the possibility that a quake can jump from fault to fault. Because of this knowledge, the odds of a catastrophic quake - magnitude 8 or larger - in the next 30 years increased. There is a 93 per cent chance of a magnitude 7 or larger occurring over the same period and a 48 per cent chance of a magnitude 7.5 - similar to previous estimates. Thousands of quakes every year hit California, sandwiched between two of Earth's major tectonic plates, the Pacific and North American plates. Most are too small to be felt. Of the more than 300 faults that crisscross the state, the southern segment of the San Andreas Fault - which runs from central California to the Salton Sea near the U.S.-Mexico border - remains the greatest threat because it hasn't ruptured in more than three centuries. The report found there is a 19 per cent chance in the next 30 years that a Northridge-size quake will unzip the southern section compared to a 6.4 per cent chance for the northern section, partly because it last broke in 1906. The southern San Andreas is 'ready to have an earthquake because it's really locked and loaded,' Field said. The report is a forecast, but it is not a prediction. Experts still cannot predict exactly where or when a quake will hit anywhere in the world. In recent years, the USGS and several universities have been testing an early warning system designed to detect the first waves of a jolt and send out an alert before the slower-moving damaging waves. Proponents have said a few seconds of notice can allow trains to slow down, utilities to shut off gas lines and people to duck for cover. The public alert system - still in pilot phrase - needs more funding before it can be rolled out statewide.","New U.S. Geological Survey report increases chances of magnitude-8 earthquake in next three decades to 7 per cent, up from 4.7 per cent ."
"A poet who fled from the Nazis was stabbed to death by her own 'bully' stepson during a furious family row at her picturesque country cottage. Writer Anne Cluysenaar, 78, who fled to Britain just before the outbreak of Second World War, was murdered with a kitchen knife by Timothy Jackson at her home in Usk, South Wales after he developed an 'irrational hatred' against his father's wife. Following the murderous attack, the 49-year-old, who 'drank like a fish and became a wild animal', told police he had killed the elderly woman because she 'tormented and taunted' him. Writer Anne Cluysenaar, 78, (right) who fled to Britain just before the outbreak of Second World War, was murdered by her stepson Timothy Jackson (left) at her home in Usk, South Wales during a family row . Just hours before her death, she had e-mailed a friend saying Jackson had made 'an appalling verbal attack and was threatening to become physical'. When police arrived at the property, they found the university lecturer  with fatal knife wounds to her neck, shoulder and back. Jackson, 49, has now been jailed for life at Cardiff Crown Court, with a minimum tariff of 19 years, after pleading guilty to murder. Her death came just one day after she celebrated her 39th wedding anniversary with her 77-year-old husband Walter. The court heard how Mrs Cluysenaar, a university lecturer, moved from Belgium when Hitler's armies were closing in. She started a life in the UK and eventually became secretary of the Usk Valley Association, editor and poetry editor of Scintilla and a visiting teacher of creative writing at Cardiff University. But the court heard the peace of the idyllic home she shared with her husband was shattered when her stepson visited from his home in Sheffield. The court heard how Jackson had felt like 'a disappointment and a failure' because his highly-educated stepmother was so well known in academic circles. The murder took place at Mrs Cluysenaar's idyllic country cottage in Usk, South Wales . But, sentencing him, the judge he had been supported 'materially and emotionally' by the couple. Judge Neil Bidder told Jackson, a skilled carpenter: 'Your father and stepmother supported you both materially and emotionally. 'But you appear to have developed an irrational hatred of her and the murder was particularly brutal.' Prosecutor Roger Thomas QC had told the court how Jackson picked up the kitchen knife from a sideboard 'five feet away' during an argument with his stepmother. He said: 'The knife was clearly a household knife and was in the room and when the murder took place. 'It was obviously picked up in the course of the incident that took place.' Cardiff Crown Court heard that in the days before the murder, Jackson had been shouting and yelling at his stepmother and was 'choking with anger'. His father described his son as a strange character and a bully who 'drank like a fish and became a wild animal'. The Belgium-born writer was just three when she arrived Britain after her family fled the Nazis during World War Two. She started writing poetry as an eight-year-old - and went on to write hundreds of poems in her life which were printed in literary journals and magazines. She had also lectured in literature and linguistics at universities across the country including Manchester, Dublin and Aberdeen. Mrs Cluysenaar moved to the smallholding with her husband Walt and had lived there for more than 25 years before her brutal murder in November last year. Detective Chief Inspector Roger Fortey, of Gwent Police, welcomed the sentence passed by the court. He added: 'Although today's sentencing concludes formal legal process it will not ease their sense of loss, however I hope it will provide a little comfort to them as they move on with their lives.' Following her death, Professor Martin Coyle - of the university's School of English, Communication and Philosophy - said Mrs Jackson was highly regarded both as an academic and as a writer. He said: 'A hugely experienced teacher, she brought talent and understanding to her creative writing classes at Cardiff and was enormously supportive of students. 'In recent years she was part of the Usk Valley Vaughan Association and worked with Dr Peter Thomas on the Vaughan magazine Scintilla. 'Anne loved Wales and all will miss her wisdom and fine writing.'","Anne Cluysenaar, 78, fled to Britain just before Second World War outbreak .

"An Arizona father of quadruplets whose wife died the same day his children were born says he's doing his best thanks to the help from supporters across the globe. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona had two of the babies home with him on January 16, and the other two were cleared to leave the hospital on March 11. This after the babies were born premature and, in a tragic twist, his wife Erica, 36, passed away just one day after giving birth of hypovolemic shock which is caused by blood loss. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Recent widower and father of quadruplets, Carlos Morales, along with his late wife Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, say they are doing well thanks to help from generous supporters across the globe . Miracle: Even though Erica passed away, Carlos Morales considers the successful birth of his quadruplets a miracle and he is happy to have all four of them at his home . 'We’re just doing our best. I’m feeling really, really grateful for everybody that just came together and helped us,' Carlos told Today,referring to the nearly $350,000 raised on a  GoFundMe page set up for the family. Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, now lives with Morales to help take care of the babies: Tracy, Paisley, Erica and Carlos, Jr. Bridges also gave thanks for the tremendous outpouring of support that the family received. 'It’s funny how things turn out. Bittersweet, but at the same time, thanks to God, and the outpouring support of the public, it’s been phenomenal,' she said. 'And I’d like to say thank you to each and every one of you. All the support we’ve gotten from you, we appreciate it.' Morales is sill mourning the  loss of Erica, however, with whom he dreamed of having a big family. The pair had gone through IVF fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family. But the last time Mr Morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, finally has his newborn quadruplets home with him . Tragic: Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 16. Their mother would never get to meet them . 'Look at these beautiful blessings,' Morales told People. 'Even when they scream their heads off I want to give them the biggest kiss.' He then added; 'I already know their quirky little habits or the next time they're going to cry. They're starting to form their own personalities.' And while he says dealing with four is a lot more difficult than dealing with two, he does have help thanks to his wife's mother-in-law, who moved down to help with the children. The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition where one experiences a severe amount of blood loss. Just an hour later she died, and never got to hold them in her arms. Since then Mr Morales has been caring for the youngsters and has described the ordeal he has been through. 'We were so excited to start our family,' he told People magazine, 'And then it all came crashing down.' In the heartbreaking interview, he also described the moment the pair first met. 'I didn't speak any English and she didn't speak any Spanish,', laughing. 'But I asked her to dance and she said yes.' He then gave her his phone number, only to discover she had thrown the piece of paper out. Big dreams: Erica and Carlos dreamed of having a big family but sadly after giving birth to four children, Erica passed away at the hospital due to blood loss . Loving father: The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock. She died an hour later . However they met each other through friends again and sparked a relationship. After marrying in Las Vegas in 2007, Mr Morales said they started trying for a baby right away. They went through a miscarriage, but were ecstatic when they found out the had a baby (before they realized it was mutiple) on the way. He told the magazine: 'Her doctor told her she had to just relax. So that's exactly what she did.' In a bid to prevent her from any undue stress, Mr Morales cooked, cleaned and made sure his wife stayed off her feet. She had been healthy throughout the pregnancy, but was admitted into hospital on January 12 because her blood pressure was high. Three days later, she texted her husband at his construction job and said doctors wanted to deliver right away. Bond: The pair got married in 2007 and tried for a baby straight away. After a miscarriage they opted for IVF. Mr Morales said 'We were so excited to start our family. And then it all came crashing down.' 'The doctor said she was having too many contractions so it was time to deliver the babies,' he said: 'We took pictures before she went into the delivery room, made some videos, and she was surrounded by family and friends. I said to her, 'Let's get these babies out'.' They began discussing names, but Mrs Morales said the pair could decide after they were born. After the birth the babies were laid down in a nursery, Mr Morales went in and squeezed his wife hand as she woke up. A short time later alarms from the equipment surrounding her bed started going off. The next thing Mr Morales was told is that his wife was dead. Describing what happened to People, he said: 'How could this have happened? She was fine, and then she wasn't. She was alive and then she was just gone. 'I went from having the best day of my life to the next morning experiencing the worst day of my life.' The nurse then brought the babies into the room and he held them on his lap. The nurse asked for their names and he gave her three they had agreed on and one he decided himself - Erica. Heartbreaking: Mr Morales and his wife (pictured during pregnancy) started discussing names before she went into labor. She then told they would decide after they were born . During his visits he is taking classes to make sure he gives his children the best care possible. He told the magazine 'I'm learning everything from how to give them a bath, CPR, feeding, and how to manage their sleep schedule. I need to be prepared.' When he was looking on his wife's iPad, Mr Morales found a note she had written. It described how she wanted her children to go to college, speak both Spanish and English, and get good jobs. Mrs Morales went into hospital with a swollen foot and tests showed her blood pressure to be 190/90. On that day she wrote on Facebook: 'He said I have to get admitted until delivery. It's been down lower today but it's too late. 'He will keep me and he ordered some labs. 'He will push deliver up or stall it to to 34 weeks. I'm 31 tomorrow. He said I did phenomenal. A poster child for quads. 'He wish they could all go this way but this last part we have to do it carefully because u can stroke out with bad blood pressure. I'm sure I won't but he looking at how to finish things.' After explaining that it would definitely be a premature birth, Mrs Morales added: 'I always want more but sometimes you just have to sit back and thank God for blessing up to this point and put it fully in his hands. Thanks for the prayers and everything else.' To donate to the Morales family click here .

"Two thugs who brutally assaulted a commuter on a St. Louis light rail car when he refused to give his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown have been arrested. David Autry, 43, was travelling home on the MetroLink train at 10pm last Monday when he was punched and kicked in the head by the men. The two suspects, a 15-year-old juvenile and a 21-year-old man, will be formally charged tomorrow, police said. Scroll down for video . David Autry, left, was travelling home on the MetroLink train at 10pm on Monday when he was approached by a young man in a red T-shirt and baseball cap who then attacked him . The video shows the suspect unleash a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who tries to block them with his hand and forearms, then the attacker kicks Autry in the head, right . The shocking incident was captured on the train's surveillance camera and also recorded by a passenger who posted his cell phone footage online. The video shows a man in a red T-shirt and baseball cap approach Autry who was sitting at the front of the train. According to Autry, the attacker first asked to use his cell phone. When he refused, the man asked for his opinion on the death of Michael Brown. 'I responded I was too tired to think about it right now,' Autry told KMOV. 'The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face.' Two other men then join in, with one swinging a left hand punch at the victim's head. As the train pulled into a station, the man in the red T-shirt kicks his victim in the head before escaping. The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, but declined medical treatment. Autry told KMOV he was more upset that no one stepped in to help and worse he could hear people laugh. 'I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,' he said. 'And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911.' Autry has said he would prefer not to use public transportation in future and he has set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $5,000 to buy a motorcycle. The page was setup on Saturday and he has already raised more $4,500. Autry also plans to donate some of the proceeds to neighborhood victims of violent crimes. David Autry said he was most upset that no one stepped in to help him and worse he could hear people laugh . Writing on his GoFundMe page about why he did not fight back, he said: 'First, I was dazed from the sucker punch in the face. 'Second, c'mon 3 against one? I was trying to protect my glasses. I didn't know they were on the floor all bent up and the lens popped out. 'Third, if I had stood up and fought, only white guy on that train car, how do I know I wouldn't be attacked from behind as well? It's easy to say what YOU would have done until you find yourself in that situation.' Authorities in St. Louis have yet to release the names or images of the two suspects apprehended with what they are calling a misdemeanor third-degree assault. A third man pictured in the surveillance video was identified but not arrested following an investigation. Unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson in nearby Ferguson last August following an altercation. The incident sparked days of violent protests, as did the decision by a grand jury not to indict Wilson last November. Police have said they arrested two of the three men recorded on the surveillance video of the incident, although they have yet to be identified .","David Autry, 43, brutally assaulted last Monday night on St Louis rail car .

"Starbucks baristas will no longer be encouraged to write 'Race Together' on customers' cups, the coffee chain's CEO Howard Schultz has said today. The last day workers will write the messages is on March 22 as the initiative, which was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line, will continue more broadly without the handwritten notes. Starbucks spokesman Jim Olson said the phase out is not a reaction to the push back the chain has received over its campaign. 'Nothing is changing,' he said. 'It's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned.' The campaign, announced on Tuesday, received much criticism including that it was opportunistic and inappropriate, as it came in the wake of racially charged events such as national protests over police killings of black males. Others questioned whether Starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks. Scroll down for video . Standing firm: Schultz addressed the massive social media backlash during the company's annual shareholder's meeting in Seattle on Wednesday (pictured), saying: 'Our intentions are pure' In his statement on Sunday, Schultz acknowledged the naysayers and skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach. 'While there has been criticism of the initiative - and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise,' his statement said. 'The heart of Race Together has always been about humanity: the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few. The six-time NBA champion wrote that Starbucks' 'Race Together' campaign left him in 'shock and awe' 'We leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most. We are learning a lot. And will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most.' The initiative previously encouraged workers to write 'Race Together' on cups and to also strike up conversations with customers about race. Schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was 'just the catalyst' for a larger conversation. He also said this part of the campaign was always scheduled to end on Sunday. Starbucks will still hold forum discussions, co-produce special sections in USA TODAY and put more stores in minority communities as part of the Race Together initiative, wrote Schultz. Six-time NBA champion Kareem Abdul-Jabbar spoke out in defence of Schultz and the company's campaign, saying the concept left him in 'shock and awe.' 'Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's bold decision to encourage his baristas to discuss race relations with willing customers has filled me with shock and awe,' he wrote in his TIME magazine column. 'I'm in awe of his courageous and good-hearted attempt to do something to bring about better awareness of racism. 'I'm in awe that he's willing to put morality above profits. I'm in awe that he's willing to endure the snarky ridicule and lame coffee jokes from pundits as well as the inevitable death threats from clueless trolls. All with nothing personally or corporately to gain — and a lot to lose. 'But while in awe of his chutzpah, I'm also in shock that he thinks this will actually work.' Abdul-Jabbar, who at 67 has expanded his talents beyond basketball to become a celebrated writer, actor and filmmaker quoted George Bernard Shaw as he praised Starbucks' 'noble goal.' 'Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything,' he quoted. However, Abdul-Jabbar admitted he has serious concerns with how Starbucks are attempting to bring about change. Defense: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Good Morning America on Thursday that he is simply trying to use the company's reach for good with its new 'Race Together' campaign . 'The problem with Howard Schultz's Race Together program is that he's picked the wrong venue with the wrong audience using the wrong spokespersons. 'Most of the customers at Starbucks probably don't want to have their political awareness challenged by the person foaming their coffee. Minds are more likely to be changed by someone with some form of expertise in the subject, which baristas generally don't have.' The former NBA All-Star also wrote that he admired Schultz's courage and applauded his initiative but worried that such conversations 'could quickly escalate to violence.' Abdul-Jabbar even likened Schultz to the highly moral character of Starbuck in Moby Dick trying to stop the blasphemous actions of Ahab. 'As another character warns, 'You're in dangerous waters, Mr. Starbuck! Come on over; come about.' Support: Schultz was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper Common, who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign . Ridiculed: After the campaign was announced, Twitter users slammed the idea as naive . 'Don't stop trying, Mr. Starbuck,' wrote Abdul-Jabbar. Schultz has defended the ridiculed  campaign as 'very genuine'. During Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, Schultz  said the company is simply trying to use its massive reach for good. 'Some in the media will criticize Starbucks for having a political agenda,' he said. 'Our intentions are pure.' Speaking on CBS This Morning on Thursday, he added: 'This is a highly charged, highly emotional issue, we understand that. A letter from Howard Schultz to Starbucks Partners regarding Race Together: . Dear partners, . I want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the Race Together initiative. Our objective from the very start of this effort -- dating back to our first open forum in Seattle last December -- was to stimulate conversation, empathy and compassion toward one another, and then to broaden that dialogue beyond just our Starbucks family to the greater American public by using our scale for good. After a historic Annual Shareholders Meeting that focused on diversity and inequality, and an initial push for much-needed national discussion around these difficult topics, it is time for us to take stock of where we are, what we have learned from our efforts so far, and what is next. This phase of the effort -- writing 'Race Together' (or placing stickers) on cups, which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today, March 22. But this initiative is far from over. We have a number of planned Race Together activities in the weeks and months to come: more partner open forums, three more special sections co-produced with USA TODAY over the course of the next year, more open dialogue with police and community leaders in cities across our country, a continued focus on jobs and education for our nation's young people plus our commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years, expanding our store footprint in urban communities across the country, and new partnerships to foster dialogue and empathy and help bridge the racial and ethnic divides within our society that have existed for so many years. While there has been criticism of the initiative -- and I know this hasn't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we didn't expect universal praise. The heart of Race Together has always been about humanity: the promise of the American Dream should be available to every person in this country, not just a select few. We leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most. We are learning a lot. And will always aim high in our efforts to make a difference on the issues that matter most. I want to thank those of you who took time this week to share what you were seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking as we rolled out Race Together across the country. An issue as tough as racial and ethnic inequality requires risk-taking and tough-minded action. And let me reassure you that our conviction and commitment to the notion of equality and opportunity for all has never been stronger. Take care of yourselves and each other. I am proud to be your partner. With great respect, . Howard . Source: Starbucks . 'We've tried to be very thoughtful, very genuine, very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores, potentially, we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference.' He said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company's workers can 'elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day', he will be satisfied. After the campaign was announced, Twitter ruthlessly mocked Starbucks. One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.' Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life 'white man's burden' crisis.' Controversial: The new campaign encourages workers to write 'Race Together' on customer's cups and to strike up conversations about race. Pictured, customer Matt Ullman shows off one of the new stickers . An executive on Starbucks' communications team, Corey duBrowa, even blocked people on Twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign. DuBrowa later said in a post on Medium that he felt he was being 'personally attacked in a cascade of negativity' and that he had gotten overwhelmed, but later reactivated the account. When Good Morning America asked Schultz about some of the scathing criticism on Thursday, Schultz responded: 'Well, you know what I say to that - no good deed goes unpunished.' He has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign, and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they don't like the message. Inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for Starbucks Corp. In late 2012, the chain asked workers to write 'Come together' on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations. And in 2013, the chain placed newspaper ads saying that firearms were not welcome in its cafes after they became the site of gun rallies. But the company stopped short of an outright ban. Schultz said at the time that Starbucks was neither for nor against guns, underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations has to be careful about alienating customers.

"Hundreds gathered in the capital of Afghanistan today to attend the burial of a 27-year-old woman who was murdered by an angry mob for allegedly burning a copy of the Koran. Farkhunda was beaten to death and her body set on fire by a large group of men outside a mosque in central Kabul on Thursday, in full view of several policemen. As her coffin was carried through the crowd by family members and women's rights activists, Afghanistan's top criminal investigator claimed Farkhunda had been wrongly accused. Afghan women's rights activists carry the coffin of 27-year-old Farkhunda, who was beaten to death by an angry all-male mob in broad daylight in central Kabul on Thursday . A picture of Farkhunda, who was brutally murdered for allegedly burning a copy of the Koran, is seen during her funeral ceremony . A leading investigator has today said that there is no evidence to support the claims that the 27-year-old Islamic studies teacher had burned the Koran . Mobile phone footage from the incident this week shows the all-male mob attacking Farkhunda in broad daylight, beating her to death with sticks and bricks before being set on fire. 'Last night I went through all documents and evidence once again, but I couldn't find any evidence to say Farkhunda burnt the Holy Koran,' General Mohammad Zahir told reporters at her funeral. 'Farkhunda was totally innocent.' General Zahir promised to 'punish all those involved', adding that 13 people, including eight police officers, had already been arrested. Members of Farkhunda's family has today denied reports that she was mentally ill, claiming this was a made-up defence to protect her reputation. Her father said the 27-year-old worked as an Islamic studies teacher studies and could recite the Koran by heart. He insisted she was not involved in burning the Muslim holy book.

Farkhunda's funeral was attended by dozens of women's rights activists, several of whom also helped carry her coffin, demanding justice for the young teacher. 'This is a crime against this family, a crime against a sister and a crime against humanity,' said Bari Salam, a human rights activist. 'All those involved and all those who supported her killing should be brought to justice,' he said. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing as 'heinous' and ordered a commission to investigate the incident. He said police, who play a crucial part in the war against Taliban insurgents, were not well-trained to contain such incidents. The mob could be seen stamping on the woman while some stamped on her repeatedly and battered her body with pieces of wood and bricks . Brutal: Mobile phone footage of the attack on Thursday began circulatin on social media this weekend . One of the attackers can be seen repeatedly striking the woman with a piece of wood while another was filmed hurling a brick at her as she lay on the ground . 'Almost 90 per cent of the duties of the police today are focused on fighting, which is not their constitutional role, it is not their legal role,' Ghani told reporters on Saturday. 'Focusing on civilian capabilities, on enforcement of the rule of law, is key to us.' In a statement on Sunday, the interior ministry said 13 police officers were suspended, including the police chief responsible for the area. Police separately said they arrested 21 people, including eight policemen.

"A city in southern China has banned any new restaurants from making one of the region's most popular dishes in a bid to control its rising air pollution problem. Firewood chicken has become a popular delicacy in Kunming, regional capital of Yunnan Province, with dozens of restaurants springing up in the last few months to offer the dish. Local officials have decided to stop licensing new firewood chicken restaurants and ordered existing premises to burn a more environmentally friendly fuel, according to the People's Daily Online. Officials in China have banned restaurants from making firewood chicken because they believe burning lots of firewood to create the popular dish releases too many pollutants into the already smog-filled air in cities . To create the dish, large quantities of firewood are burned every day to cook chicken for around 40 minutes. A 2.5kg chicken takes between 1.5 to 2.5kg of firewood to cook. It is estimated that for a restaurant with a capacity of around 30 diners around 550kg of firewood would be burned during busy periods, and this would have a huge impact on air quality. A spokesman for Xishan District Environmental Protection Bureau said 'No new applications for firewood chicken restaurants are being accepted and this has been the case for almost a year already. 'Many entrepreneurs have recently tried to open firewood chicken restaurants but we have rejected them all.' He added that restaurants which had opened in the last year and were awaiting approval were operating illegally. Air pollution has long been a problem in China, where cities are often overcome with thick smog . Existing restaurants will now be required to use more environmentally friendly fuels, such as charcoal. China's 'Air Pollution Prevention Law' stipulates that: coal, pulverized coal, combustible waste, direct burning of biomass fuels (trees, straw, sawdust, rice husk etc) are all high-polluting fuels. The cooking process of firewood chicken comes under the new restrictions. Some restaurants in Kunming have already opted for more environmentally friendly options, with one restaurant in Guannan Road using the greener charcoal option. SouthAsia Garden Firewood Chicken Restaurant simply uses gas and serves the dish in earth pots to give it an authentic taste. China has for years been hit by heavy air pollution, caused by enormous use of coal to generate electricity to power a booming economy - the world's second largest - and more vehicles on the roads. Air pollution is increasingly acute in Chinese cities, including in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province . It has become a major source of popular discontent among Chinese citizens, leading the government to declare a 'war on pollution' and vow to reduce the proportion of energy derived from fossil fuels. Earlier this month Under the Dome, a film about the country's notorious smog, went viral with more than 155 million views in just one day.","The city of Kunming has stopped granting licenses to new restaurants serving ‘firewood chicken’

"The skull of missing Little Rock businessman John Glasgow was found on Wednesday in a rugged area of Petit Jean Mountain . Bone fragments and skeletal remains have been found in a rugged area of Petit Jean Mountain where the skull of missing Little Rock businessman John Glasgow was found earlier this week. The skull, found on Wednesday by hikers, was identified through dental records as being Glasgow, who was 45 when he disappeared in 2008. A search crew of 20, aided by dogs, had been dispatched on Thursday to the area where the remains were found, but the search was suspended due to poor weather on Sunday. The more remains that are found, the better the chance of determining the cause of death, state Crime Laboratory Director Kermit Channel told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. 'We will rely on law enforcement to continue their investigation and search. As they discover additional human remains, they will be submitted to us to examine,' Channel said. The remains were found within a mile of where Glasgow's vehicle was last seen parked at the time of his disappearance. That mile, however, is 'as the crow flies' and includes lengthy, boulder-laden, steep trails, Butts said. When the recovery efforts resume on Monday, officials will begin more intensive searching that will include cadaver dogs and metal detectors. 'We even have an archaeologist that will be coming with the Arkansas State Police,' Butts said. Melinda Glasgow, the wife of contracting executive John Glasgow, pictured in 2008 just after her husband went missing . 'They will work to determine how far the remains have been distributed and what to look for after so many years have passed.' Glasgow, the chief financial officer of CDI Contractors LLC, was last seen leaving his Little Rock home on the morning of January 28, 2008. The firm, owned by Dillard's and the estate of co-founder Bill Clark, built or remodeled many of Dillard's 300-plus department stores and put up some of Arkansas' signature projects, including former President Bill Clinton's library and the headquarters of Heifer International. A cellphone trace had led investigators to the Petit Jean State Park, a mountaintop resort an hour from his home, but weeks of searching revealed no clues. Glasgow was legally declared dead in 2011. Judge H. Vann Smith wrote at the time that 'The circumstantial evidence of John's death is substantial. John has been missing for three years without any credible information surfacing in that period that would suggest he might be alive somewhere.' In that same year, a twice-convicted felon named Jonathan Brawner told his lawyer and the Little Rock Police Department that he knew where Glasgow's body was buried. Brawner said that he had been recruited by 'thugs from Malvern' to whom he owed money to help bury Glasgow in a bean field near England in Lonoke County. The bean field was searched, but no remains were found.","The skull of missing businessman John Glasgow was found on Wednesday .

"Today show host Matt Lauer and his NBC co-star Kathie Lee shared a Lady and the Tramp-style kiss on Tuesday morning - using a piece of red licorice instead of spaghetti – as a part of the new Twizzler Challenge, the latest charitable dare, which is aimed at raising awareness about autism. The duo’s fellow Today correspondent Meredith Vieira appeared on the show to nominate Matt and Kathie Lee for the challenge, which required the pair to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and eat the licorice until their lips met in the middle for a kiss. 'Just like Lady and the Tramp,' said Al Roker of the charitable Disney-inspired act. Close co-stars: Kathie Lee and Matt Lauer took the Twizzler Challenge on the Today show Tuesday morning . Meredith explained that she first took the challenge, which has quickly gained momentum with the country’s top TV hosts, with Today co-anchor Willie Geist last week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide. 'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show. Like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism. Following the rules: Kathie Lee wanted to know if she could use her hands when they placed the Twizzler in their mouths for the challenge . People in charge: Meredith Vieira and Willie Geist, who previously took the challenge on her talk show, told them that they were able to use their hands . Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said. Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. Loving gaze: Kathie Lee stared deeply into Matt's eyes throughout the Twizzler Challenge . Fun times: Matt couldn't help but crack a smile at Kathie Lee's wide-eyed facial expression . 'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.' Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.' 'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. One more time: After pulling away from their initial kiss, Matt moved back in to give Kathie Lee another peck on the lips . Perfect pair: Matt told Kathie Lee that he loves her and would have done the challenge with her for free . As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause. 'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained. Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner. 'Really aggressive,' Willie commented from the sidelines. Fun moment: Willie and Meredith took the Twizzler Challenge on her talk show . Charitble act: After sharing a Lady and the Tramp style kiss with Willie, Meredith donated $5,000 to New York Collaborates for Autism . Matt pulled away as Kathie Lee's lips brushed his, only to move back into to give her another kiss. 'I love you anyway,' he said. 'I would have done that for nothing.' Someone else joked: 'Whose the Lady and whose the Tramp?' After their epic kiss, Kathie Lee nominated her former co-host Regis Philbin and her current co-star Hoda Kotb for the Twizzler Challenge. Mismatched pair: Access Hollywood's Billy Bush and Kit Hoover struggled to stay together when they took the Twizzler challenge last Friday . Silly dare: The two barely brushed lips before quickly pulling apart . But Matt had a different pairing in mind, noting that the cast of Mad Men would be on the show on Monday. 'I'm available,' Savannah said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned. Matt ultimately chose actors Jon Hamm and John Slattery to take on the challenge. 'If John Slattery needs an understudy for that Twizzler Challenge with Jon Hamm, I am available,' Savannah reminded Matt again. New nominees: Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and Nina Parker also took the challenge on Access Hollywood Live . Look of love: Piers leaned in for a kiss during the challenge and later said it was 'really enjoyable' The Twizzler Challenge started earlier this month at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism, which was hosted by Jon Stewart. When someone on Twitter dared Willie and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation, the Twizzler Challenge was born. Access Hollywood co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover also took up the same candy-based encounter on their show last Friday before nominating Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and his fellow guest Nina Parker to do the same. 'I got to say that was really enjoyable,' Piers said after they completed the challenge. Major moment: After Willie and Uzo Aduba were dared to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism , the challenge started to become popular . Big dare: Twitter user Fred Katz started the Twizzler Challenge by tweeting that Willie and Uzo should do it at the benefit earlier this month .","The Twizzler Challenge is a new charitable dare aimed at raising awareness about autism .

"A Queensland father accused of killing his toddler son has been excused from appearing in court. Shane Purssell Akehurst, 33, had a grievous bodily harm charge upgraded to murder on Saturday after his son Corby died in hospital. It's alleged Akehurst assaulted Corby repeatedly over the past four months. The toddler, who had not yet turned two, was airlifted to hospital with critical injuries from Kin Kin, near Gympie, on Wednesday, but died on Friday night. It's alleged that Corby Akehurst was assaulted repeatedly over the past four months by his father . Akehurst was originally charged with grievous bodily harm and four counts of assault occasioning bodily harm. He's now charged with murder, torture and five counts of assault occasioning bodily harm. Akehurst, who is in custody, was excused from appearing in the Brisbane Magistrates Court when his case was mentioned on Monday. His lawyer requested the matter be adjourned until May 4. It's been reported that Corby was just a few months shy of his second birthday when his father allegedly threw him repeatedly against a timber bed at their home after he would not stop crying on Wednesday. The little boy died late Friday evening after succumbing to critical injuries. Corby's father Shane Purssell Akehurst is charged with murder, torture and five counts of assault occasioning bodily harm . The toddler, who had not yet turned two, was airlifted to hospital with critical injuries from Kin Kin, near Gympie, on Wednesday, but died on Friday night . Prosecutor Wayne Kelly told Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday that Corby began convulsing after his dad threw him against the bed numerous times and was left on the bedroom floor. He said the toddler's mother Kylie Woodford arrived home a short time later and called emergency services before the toddler was airlifted to Brisbane's Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. Since then police have worked around the clock investigating the circumstances surrounding the boy's critical injuries and subsequent death. Police will allege through medical history inquiries that the child sustained injuries over an extended period of time which ended in his death on Friday night.

"An ancient tomb belonging to Amenhotep, guard of the temple of Egyptian deity Amun, has been discovered in the southern city of Luxor by an American research team, the Egypt's antiquities ministry said on Tuesday. The ministry says the tomb, found near the southern city of Luxor, dates back to the New Kingdom of the 18th Dynasty (1543-1292 BC) — the most famous of ancient Egypt dynasties. The tombs were found earlier this month near the Sheikh Abd el-Qurna dig site, situated at the feet of the Theban mountains, between the famed valleys of the Kings and Queens over the town of al-Qurna. Scroll down for video . A team working near the historic city of Luxor has found not one, but two ancient tombs . Both tombs feature astonishing murals which are believed to date back to the 18th Dynasty of the Egyptian New Kingdom . This means the tombs were likely created sometime between 1543-1292BC . The tombs were found earlier this month near the Sheikh Abd el-Qurna dig site, situated at the feet of the Theban mountains . Incredible photographs distributed by the ministry show a tomb with bright green and brown paintings with hieroglyphics with murals that depict both celebrations and everyday activity, and despite their age are still remarkably vibrant and colorful. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damaty said in a statement that the tombs do sadly appear to have been looted at some point and the sarcophogi containing the bejeweled mummies were missing. 'The tomb contains many stunning scenes with bright colours painted on plaster,' Antiquities Minister Mamdouh Eldamaty said in a statement. 'Many of scenes represent the tomb owner and his wife in front of an offering table and a view of a goddess nursing a royal child as well as scenes of the daily life,' he added. The tomb was discovered by a team of American archaeologists alongside an Egyptian inspectors' team in the city of Luxor, 700 kilometres (435 miles) south of Cairo. However, the temple guard's final resting place had been vandalised for unknown reasons. The T-shaped tomb 'was deliberately damaged in ancient times,' said Sultan Eid, the ministry's general director for the Upper Egypt region. 'The name and titles of the tomb owner, some hieroglyphic texts and scenes in addition to the names of the god Amun were deliberately erased,' Eid added. The first tomb was discovered on March 2, and the second was discovered on March 10. The second tomb is believed to be that of Sa-mut and his wife, Ta-Khaeet. The first tomb meanwhile is believed to be that of Sa-Mut's father, Amenhotep. Luxor, a city of some 500,000 people on the banks of the Nile in southern Egypt, is an open-air museum of intricate temples and pharaonic tombs. Eldamaty said in a separate statement that a royal rest house belonging to King Thutmosis II, also from the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom period, had been discovered in the Suez Canal province of Ismailia. The murals depict both celebrations and everyday activity, and despite their age are still remarkably vibrant and colorful .

"A paleo diet guru who wrote a controversial cookbook with My Kitchen Rules judge Pete Evans has hit back at critics after it was revealed she performed voice-overs for junk food commercials. In a statement released on Tuesday, food blogger Charlotte Carr argued she never 'personally' endorsed the products she spruiked in advertisements for Cadbury, Coca Cola and KFC. The revelations came just weeks after publisher Pan MacMillan dumped her controversial cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, after public health experts expressed alarm over a DIY baby formula recipe in the book. 'I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured,' Ms Carr said today about her decision to do voice-overs for the junk food brands. 'If I'm telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car, or catch a certain airline, or use a certain toothbrush, I may not drive that certain car, or use that airline or use that toothbrush.' Charlotte Carr (pictured) has worked as a voice artist for a number of leading brands. She has written a paleo diet book with My Kitchen Rules judge Pete Evans . Food blogger Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of 2008 Australian Idol winner Wes Carr (right with son Willow), has co-authored a controversial recipe book with MKR judge Pete Evans . In a statement, Ms Carr (pictured on stage) said it was difficult to select individual voice-over roles because she worked as a freelancer and often received offers as a package deal . Ms Carr said it was difficult to select individual voice-over roles because she worked as a freelancer and often received offers as a package deal. She said she was talking to her agent about choosing 'roles that align more closely to my values'. Ms Carr, Mr Evans and nutritionist Helen Padarin are forging ahead with plans to independently publish their controversial cookbook in a digital format next month. The book has copped heavy criticism from dietitians and health authorities, with the president of the Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA), Heather Yeatman, quoted saying 'a baby may die if this book goes ahead'. The PHAA said its DIY baby milk formula, which is based on liver and bone broth formula, contained excessive amounts of Vitamin A. In an interview about the book with the That Paleo Show podcast, Ms Carr said there had been a 'censorship issue' with the recipe. 'I think we need to look at possibly where the comments have come from and who sponsors those organisations,' she said. 'It's a very, very big issue here. 'It's also a censorship issue, you know? This has been promoted and printed I know it's well over 500,000 times because the (inaudible) manual has been printed that many times already. 'And it's in many, many other books across the world.' 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers' will be published independently online. Pan MacMillan Australia will not publish the book after concerns were raised by health experts . 'As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be', Ms Carr said in a statement . 'Paleo Pete' Evans has become one of Australia's leading spruikers of the paleo diet . A spokesman for Pan Macmillan Australia would not comment on censorship claims. 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum – The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' he said in a statement. Public Health Association CEO Michael Moore told Daily Mail Australia the real issue was that specific diets discourage parents from breastfeeding. 'If adults want to use a paleo diet, even though it's rated amongst the worst diets of the world, then so be it,' he said. 'When you start talking about specific diets for infants... It discourages from breastfeeding and there's huge amounts of research around the world that breastfeeding's best.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said authorities recommend that parents use commercial infant formulas if an infant is not breastfed. She said the paleo formula is also concerning because it contains one-tenth of the calcium of breast milk, 879 per cent the sodium of breast milk, and 168 per cent the selenium of breast milk. 'These are important nutrients to get right in the diets of babies,' the spokeswoman said. As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be. I often have little control over the jobs that are contracted to me as a voice over artist, like so many freelancers in my field. I am frequently presented with a package rather than specific clients that I can pick and choose from. Over the years as I have become devoted to eating and living a specific way, due to the health concerns of my family, I have been working with my agent to choose roles that align more closely to my values. I have never ""personally ""endorsed any of these products since becoming a holistic health coach and baby food blogger. I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured. If Im telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car, or catch a certain airline, or use a certain toothbrush, I may not drive that certain car, or use that airline or use that toothbrush. I originally created this page out of love and kindness and to share my story so that any Mum in a similar position who has been told to put their child on a gluten free and dairy free diet would have a place to come to for inspiration and ideas. When you are told your child can not have these foods, sometimes its overwhelming and scary and you are unsure where to start. Its a lonely place. This is why I created Bubba Yum Yum. A place of fun beautiful, delicious yummy food. With love, X .

"An artistic dad from Maryland has come up with a way to inspire his son each day during his lunchtime break at school by drawing a different cartoon character on Post-It Note alongside some words of wisdom. Brent Almond, a graphic designer who also runs a blog called Designer Daddy, packs his son Jon's lunchbox full of an endearingly-designed note each and every day - along with his sandwiches and snacks. The doting father has been posting his efforts on his Instagram account, which is titled @SuperLunchNotes and his artistic endeavors have quickly garnered  thousands of devoted followers. It's got crunch! Brent Almond sends his son Jon to school with a hand-drawn Post-It note in his lunchbox every day . My hero: Every school morning for the past year and a half, the Maryland blogger and graphic designer has created a special cartoon for the five-year-old . Brent's creations, although detailed, require nothing more than a Sharpie and a Post-It - and an inspiring message. The characters range from the Hulk, Thor and Darth Vader to Princess Elsa, The Count and even Super Mario, all of whom Brent has relied upon to help him to deliver his humorous and meaningful messages. 'My son, Jon, started preschool last year and for the first day of school I drew a Batman on a Post-It Note and wrote ""Go get 'em, Jon"",' Brent told ABC News. 'And then I kept putting in notes for the first week. He really liked it and I had a lot of fun with it, so I just kept doing it after that.' He added to Today.com: 'It was a big day for us to send him off to school for the first time. I wanted to be there with him. On the web: This is how to send your child to school in style - with their own personal cartoon . No whining! Brent uses his artistic skills to inspire his son with a series of meaningful messages . Flipping out: His drawings are now becoming famous worldwide after he started posting them to Instagram . 'I say it was to give him comfort but it was just as much for me, as anything, just to know I was with him in a way. 'We watch a lot of cartoons and movies together. There are so many different ways to introduce kids to characters, but one of my rules is that I never use one that he isn't already familiar with.' Brent also tries to keep up-to-date with new characters and does his own research to ensure he will be in the know when it comes to poplar culture and what characters his son might like to see. He insists that Power Ranger and Transformers are the hardest to draw. Brent had initially intended to stick with superheroes but as Jon became interested in other cartoons he decided to broaden his repertoire and began to include Ninja Turtles, Transformers, Godzilla, Star Wars figures and Disney characters into the mix. Each drawing takes about half an hour to complete. Popular characters: Brent tries to keep up to date with what cartoons are currently most popular with kids, such as Elsa from Frozen (pictured) Popular: Brent says he never creates a new cartoon using a character his son Jon isn't already familiar with . Turtle power! When Jon started looking up to characters that Brent hadn't grown up with himself, he had to do some research . Brent likes to keep the drawings topical and often marks milestones, including birthdays and holidays, which a special artistic creation. He will also adjust the characters depending on the time of year. 'A lot of it is just what he's watching on TV or what he's playing on the iPad. He's really into Power Rangers right now because he takes taekwondo, so he loves anything martial arts-related,' he said. When he is not drawing on Post-it notes for his adopted son, Brent, who also lives with his husband, is a full-time graphic designer. 'I've been working for myself since 2002, and it's been pretty successful,' he said. 'Then, when we started a family, my husband is an attorney, so it was a lot easier for me to be flexible and handle all of the childcare.' Brent says he knows Jon loves to receive the notes and revealed that the youngster often shares them with teachers and classmates at school. But despite the attention his creative notes are receiving, he says he never loses sight of who they are for. Spreading his wings: Brent grew up drawing different superheroes and is incredibly excited to be able to share his passion with his son . Freeze! Brent says intends to keep up the lunch notes until his son asks him to stop. But so far, it seems to be keeping them both entertained . Super dad! Often Jon's father or his teacher will read the notes to him. In some cases, the project has also encouraged a widened vocabulary .","Brent Almond draws a different design for his son, Jon .

"A former student is suing his Utah school district for hiring and failing to fire a 'flirtatious' English teacher before he allegedly went on to have a sexual relationship with her. The student is suing the Davis County School District for $674,000 for emotional damage he says he suffered as a result of the affair, which happened when he was 17, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. His former teacher, 35-year-old Brianne Altice, has been charged with 14 felonies - including rape, sodomy and sex abuse - for allegedly having sexual relationships with three different students. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on  bail for charges relating to the first two students. Her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars. Not happy: A student who says he had sex with his teacher, Brianne Altice, is now suing the school district. Altice is pictured in court last month after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied . The student who has brought the lawsuit accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claims they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He claims that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. School district spokesman Chris Williams said he was unaware of the lawsuit. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. Locked up: Altice, pictured in court in January, had her bond revoked earlier this year after it emerged she allegedly had sex with a third student while out on bail for having sex with two other students . In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 . He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail. In August 2014, a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former Davis High English teacher, whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal. Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.' But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions. The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 . Brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in October 2013 to interview her. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her. 'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.' Last month, she requested to drop one of the charges, claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys. But a judge denied the motion. No trial dates have yet been set but she faces up to life in prison if convicted.","Former English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, 'had sex with three students'

"A little-known southern pizza chain is edging in on big name brands to take a big slice of the market. Hunt Brothers Pizza provides gas stations and convenience stores with ingredients and start up equipment but doesn't charge franchise fees. As a result it now boasts more U.S. sites than either Domino's or Pizza Hut, with 7,300 locations in 28 states. As well as the convenience factor, customers apparently love the taste. Scroll down for video . Loyal fan: Roy Bruce, owner of the Rightway Foodmart poses for a photo in front of a Hunt Brothers Pizza display in Andersonville, Tennessee . 'It beats Pizza Hut and Domino's,' said 23-year-old Brittany Bunch, who buys Hunt Brothers about once a week during breaks from her job at a water damage company. 'It's just got more flavor. It seems like, with the others, you're getting cardboard.' While Hunt Brothers may be unknown in many households, it runs television ads during NASCAR races and cable outdoors shows. For several years, it has sponsored Kevin Harvick, who won the 2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup. On a recent morning at 10:40am, Roy Bruce, who owns Rightway Foodmart in Andersonville, Tennessee, started sliding Hunt Brothers pizzas for the lunch rush into a conveyor-belt oven. Easy-to-make: Each pie starts out frozen, a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese . Build your own: Employees can add fresh pepperoni, extra cheese and other toppings . Tasty treat: The result after about five minutes in the 525-degree oven is a bubbling-hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains' pizzas . Each pie starts out frozen, a crust with sauce and a layer of cheese. Employees can add fresh pepperoni, extra cheese and other toppings. The result after about five minutes in the 525-degree oven is a bubbling-hot pizza with browned toppings that tastes comparable to the big delivery chains' pizzas. In about an hour, Bruce sold that first pizza and another one in two-slice $2.99 'hunks' from a countertop warming display near his cash register. Pizza customers included a UPS delivery driver, a woman on her way to lunch with her daughter and a guy in camouflage who confessed he was just coming from the liquor store. In a typical Hunt Brothers arrangement, Bruce said he paid about $10,000 for his oven, freezer, display case and other equipment and now just pays the Nashville, Tennessee-based company for the pizza ingredients. Hunt Brothers, which is privately owned, fine-tuned this approach starting in the early 1990s when four brothers who'd worked separately in the restaurant industry joined forces to sell pizzas to convenience stores. Hunt Brothers had 750 locations by 1994, said Keith Solsvig, its vice president for marketing. 'Convenience stores in rural areas were the hub,' Solsvig said in a phone interview. 'A lot of people coming and going. And a lot of these smaller towns, they didn't really have a lot of other restaurants or other places to eat.' Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas each have more than 700 locations, Solsvig said. Not all locations are isolated, with Hunt Brothers also found at busy highway interchanges. And it's moved into some urban areas, such as Memphis. The convenience store model is different from a free-standing restaurant, and a Hunt Brothers outlet is likely to bring in far less than the more than $700,000 an average Domino's makes a year, said Darren Tristano, a restaurant industry analyst with Technomic. Speedy delivery: Maria Witkowski hands a Hunt Brothers Pizza from the drive-thru window to a customer at the Rightway Foodmart in Andersonville . Pit stop: In a typical Hunt Brothers arrangement, outlets pay about $10,000 for an oven, freezer, display case and other equipment - they then just pay the Nashville, Tennessee-based company for the pizza ingredients . Tristano noted that 7-Eleven offers pizza in some of its 7,800 U.S. locations and that Little Caesars has also had success in rural areas. While Hunt Brothers declined to discuss company finances, Bruce says he sells about 500 pizzas a month, much of it by the hunk. Combined with drinks and other convenience items, he estimates pizza customers spend more than $10,000 each month in his store. Tristano says the simplicity of the setup has helped the company grow. Bruce agreed. 'In a convenience store, you're doing the register, you're doing gas. You're doing so many different things,' Bruce said. 'It's hard to be able to do pizza from the ground up, making the dough and the whole thing.' Fred England, a food vendor at a furniture factory about 30 miles east of Andersonville, added a Hunt Brothers to his lunch counter about a year ago to keep his customers from looking elsewhere for their pizza fix. 'The problem I had was all these other places were delivering pizza, so I had to come up with something,' he said while stopping at Rightway to chat with Bruce. Angela Moles came in to get three hunks of pepperoni pizza and drinks to take to lunch with her daughter. The 35-year-old Andersonville resident said she buys Hunt Brothers about twice a week. 'I love it,' she said. 'I usually don't get other pizza.'","Hunt Brothers Pizza provides gas stations and convenience stores with ingredients and start up equipment but doesn't charge franchise fees .

"A Canadian mother has sparked a backlash against United Airlines after she claimed a flight attendant tried to force her to cover up while she breastfed her five-month-old son. Kristen Hilderman, from Vancouver, said a male employee tossed a blanket at her husband as the plane taxied to a runway at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. Mrs Hilderman said the incident occurred in front of other travellers and left her feeling embarrassed and furious. A breastfeeding mum said a United Airlines flight attendant tried to get her to cover up (file photo) The journalist has received plenty of support online after a tweet about her experience last Sunday sparked an angry response from fellow Twitter users. She said a United Airlines employee who contacted her by telephone yesterday apologised for the ‘frustrating experience’ and promised to follow up within 48 hours. The Hildermans were flying back to Vancouver after a holiday in Costa Rica and were on the final leg of their journey when the incident occurred. Mrs Hilderman said she was wearing a breastfeeding tank top when the flight attendant approached and asked her husband, Luc, if they were travelling together. Kristen Hilderman posted a letter along with this tweet, sparking a backlash against United Airlines . She wrote in a letter posted on Twitter: ‘My husband replied “Yes” and then the flight attendant tossed a blanket at him (didn’t even hand it TO him, but tossed it AT him) and said tersely, “Then HERE, help her out.” ‘I had a blanket under my baby and a blanket draped across my knees and the plane was hot and stuffy… he wanted me to cover myself. ‘I went beet red and the passengers around us stared with their mouths agape. I whipped around as the flight attendant walked down the aisle behind us and I said, “Help me out with what?”’ United Airlines contacted Kristen Hilderman on Twitter after she tweeted about her experience . The Vancouver mum said United Airlines has promised to respond to her complaint . Mrs Hilderman said she repeated herself in a louder tone, but the flight attendant continued to walk down the aisle and did not respond. She said other passengers were stunned, adding: ‘A man a couple of rows back called out, “Because you’re breastfeeding… he wants you to cover up. That is so offensive. I have a seven-month-old baby and if that happened… I would be so offended.”’ Mrs Hilderman said she didn’t want to make a further scene or get into trouble, but didn’t bother to use the blanket. She folded it and put it on the floor, and continued to breastfeed her son, Caleb. ‘I felt so completely embarrassed, uncomfortable and self-conscious for the rest of the flight. A few passengers approached me to let me know that the flight attendant’s behaviour was completely out of line, and that they didn’t even know that I was breastfeeding my baby until he tried to make an example out of me.’ Kristen Hilderman has received an outpouring of support after sharing her story online . One Twitter user accused United Airlines staff of displaying 'a complete lack of humanity' Making matters worse, the flight was diverted to Seattle because of dense fog in Vancouver. When passengers reboarded to continue their journey, the same flight attendants were on board and a folded blanket had been placed on Mrs Hilderman’s seat. She said: ‘Not a single other seat. Just mine. ‘I am so furious about this entire incident. I’ve been breastfeeding my son [in public] since he was born, and never has anyone made me feel so uncomfortable and ashamed for feeding my baby without pulling a cover over his head.' A United Airlines spokesman told MailOnline Travel that the Chicago-based carrier has reached out to Mrs Hilderman and will follow up with her to discuss her concerns. The spokesman said: ‘United welcomes nursing mothers on board and we ask that crew members do their best to ensure their comfort and safety as they do with all customers.","Kristen Hilderman was flying from Houston to Vancouver with her family .

"A brilliant scientist killed herself under a train because she was worried she was a bad mother to her two young children, an inquest has heard. Sarah Bradley had a successful career as a chemist at a pharmaceutical firm, but she struggled with bi-polar disorder. The 43-year-old mother told one of her son's friends that she was a 'bad person', and claimed that the boys - both aged under 12 - would be 'better off without her'. In September last year, she failed to show up for dinner with her estranged husband Adrian, and her body was later found next to the railway tracks near her home in Boxford, Berkshire. Mr Bradley told the inquest in Newbury that he had often tried to reassure his wife about her parenting skills, but she refused to accept it. He said: 'Sarah would constantly say she was a terrible mother, people like her shouldn't have children and the children would be better off without her. She had constant feelings of inadequacy as a mother. 'When she wasn't in a low mood she was the life and soul, she was a wonderful person.' The inquest heard that Mr Bradley had raised concerns about his wife's mental state, but she was discharged early from a mental health unit and doctors failed to record her husband's warnings. The couple, who both had doctorates first got together in 1995, and were married in 2001. They moved to Boxford after Mrs Bradley completed her chemistry PhD at Bristol University and started working for Bayer, a multi-national pharmaceutical company. However, they separated in February last year after Mrs Bradley's bouts of depression became more and more severe. The inquest was told that the pair had been due to meet up for dinner with their children on the day that she died, and that she may have chosen this moment to kill herself because she knew her sons were safe with their father. When she did not turn up Mr Bradley rushed around to the family home where he found her keys in the front door, her car missing and 14 letters arranged on the dining room table addressed to friends and family. Her body was found by police two miles away. The afternoon before, she had tearfully told a schoolgirl who was friends with her sons: 'You are good people and I'm a bad person. Make sure you look after [the boys] for me.' Mrs Bradley's family claimed that her husband had driven her to her death by subjecting her to 'emotional abuse', the inquest heard. In a statement her sister Rosie Mclauchlan, said she believed that Mr Bradley's behaviour 'contributed significantly' to his wife's depression, adding: 'Adrian told Sarah constantly that she was mentally ill.' But coroner Peter Bedford said that this was 'at best an over-simplification of the situation', adding: 'Sarah herself conceded in conversation that some of her expressed views had been delusional.' Work: Mrs Bradley was a chemist at pharmaceutical firm Bayer, whose headquarters in Newbury are pictured . Asked about the allegations, Mr Bradley said: 'From my point I loved Sarah very much and I did all I could to care for her for over 20 years. 'Possibly I did the wrong things, but I did my best and I certainly could not have done any more.' The coroner took the rare step of criticising hospital authorities for the failings in Mrs Bradley's care after they ignored Mr Bradley's warnings. An independent investigator said that it had been 'unwise and potentially dangerous' for doctors at Prospect Park hospital in Reading to fail to record her husband's comments. Mr Bradley tried to tell the hospital that they were wrong to discharge her, adding: 'I think Sarah may have felt completely on her own at that stage.' Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Bedford ruled that Sarah 'took her own life whilst suffering from depression and bi-polar disorder.' He added that she had been 'discharged prematurely from the community support programme in September 2014 and without psychiatric review while expressing suicidal ideas.' Speaking after the hearing, Sarah's lifelong friend Helen King said: 'She was incredibly talented, she was very musical and her singing voice was beautiful.

"A billboard advertising a kitchen along with the words, 'your wife wants me,' has New York college students urging the building and renovation company who posted the message to throw in the towel. Infuriated students from Siena College claim that the Teakwood Builders billboard is 'sexist' and protested the sign last Tuesday afternoon. 'So it could say, 'You know you want me,' and that could include men and women. Because in today's world, men and women are the ones in the kitchen doing the cooking - not just women,' a protester standing in front of the Billboard told News 10. Scroll down for video . Grilling the company: Students at Siena College protested this billboard for Teakwood Builders last week and claimed that the ad was sexist against women . New phrases: Some Siena students found the billboard to be sexist and offensive, so they gathered under the billboard in protest on last  Tuesday afternoon will signs saying things like, 'I can buy my own kitchen' Both male and female students held signs with phrases that said things like, 'men can make their own sandwiches.' 'Women left the kitchen decades ago,' and 'I can buy my own kitchen,' were also written on decorated signs. Siena student Delaney Rivers wrote an email that said,' [The billboard] implies that men are the primary financial supporters of women and that women are materialistic and portrayed as having no other value outside of the kitchen. This is especially egregious towards students at our institution as many of us are working towards financial independence in hopes to have successful careers and equality in our relationships.' Teakwood Builders did their best to assure students at the school that their advertisement was just a joke that was never meant to offend anyone. Protesters: Students from Siena College claiming the sign was 'sexist,'  protested the billboard last Tuesday . Just a joke?: Teakwood Builders claimed that the sign was a joke aimed 'at women with a sense of humor' but these Students who stood outside the sign to protest last Tuesday were not laughing . 'Thank you for the message regarding the report on our billboard in Newtonville. A vast majority of Teakwood’s clients are women. Frequently they are the decision makers about major expenditures. This billboard – and the entire “Your wife wants me” campaign is good-natured, tongue in cheek fun meant to appeal to women who have a sense of humor, a sense of history and healthy self-esteem,' said a response from the company sent to News 10. Teakwood Builders went as far as thanking the students for their 'excitement about their cause' and also for 'drawing attention to the gorgeous Teakwood kitchen' on the Billboard. Some supporters of the kitchen renovation and construction company took to Twitter to express their positive opinion about the sign's humor. 'Cancelled my wife's new kitchen and showed her this article. Thank you, IOU1 #GoingFishing,' joked Byte_Stryke. 'Anyone protesting this needs to get a life. Personally I as a wife would love to have my hubby buy this,' wrote Dawn Appelberg.

"Theresa May has shelved a decision on whether water cannon can be used on the streets of Britain until after the election, in a major snub to Boris Johnson. Mrs May has refused to sign off the controversial riot control machines despite pressure from the London mayor, who last year spent £220,000 buying three cannon for use in public order emergencies. Home Office sources confirmed last night no ruling on permission would be made this side of the election. That means the machines will lay idle, in a potential embarrassment for the mayor. Boris Johnson spent £220,000 last year buying three water cannon to use in public emergencies, such as the London riots, but Theresa May has today refused to approve their use (file image) Soon after buying the three German machines last year, Mr Johnson said it was ‘highly likely’ the Home Secretary would sign them off, adding: ‘My view is we need to get on and equip the police with the water cannon they need, or might need.’ But in the past she has expressed concerns about whether they fit with the British model of policing and is thought to have concerns about their safety. The standoff over the issue cast light on the ongoing rivalry between the two, both of whom are seen as potential Tory leadership candidates should David Cameron lose the election and step down. Mrs May's Home Office has been locked in a row with the London Mayor over the decision to buy the machines and whether they fit with UK policing . Last night City Hall sources insisted Mr Johnson had known about the timetable for some time and was ‘very relaxed’ about the delay. A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime defended the decision to purchase the cannon, pointing towards support for them among Londoners. He said: ‘Independent polling shows that the majority of Londoners support the police having water cannon at their disposal for use in exceptional circumstances. 'The Mayor has made his position clear and awaits the Home Secretary’s licensing decision.’ But critics of cannon warn that in incidents on the continent they have led to serious injury and even death. In one case in Germany a man was blinded and in another a protester was stunned and then killed after being run over. Water cannon have been used in Northern Ireland to quell public order incidents, but never on the UK mainland. Calls for their introduction came during the 2011 riots and later student protests in the capital. Last summer The Prime Minister’s spokesman also endorsed their use, saying the prime minister ‘supports’ the police’s application for water cannon. Mrs May and Mr Johnson two regularly appear at or near the top of polls on who Tories would like as a future leader. She is known to regard the Mayor as a 'faintly ridiculous' figure. At the time the mayor purchased the machines, he was warned it could be a waste of taxpayers’ money. When Mr Johnson purchased the machines he said it was 'highly likely' the Home Secretary would sign off on their use, a political gamble that seems to have backfired . Mr Johnson has previously urged police to get 'medieval' on rioters, and said officers must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming violence like that seen during the riots. But he stressed the chances of the machines being used in the capital, or other mainland cities, remained 'vanishingly rare'. Police argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds. They said it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops were set ablaze as rioting spread to Croydon in 2011.","Boris Johnson spent £220,000 on buying three used water cannon last year .

"These are the absolutely shocking scenes where a young woman is left unconscious during a vicious fight inside a Dublin pizza restaurant. The woman, who is from England, was visiting Dublin with a group of friends in fancy dress when they went into the Apache Pizza restaurant in the popular tourist destination of Temple Bar. One customer of the restaurant becomes involved in a heated discussion with a member of staff behind the counter, when a man from Dublin intervenes and the pair start grappling. One of the customers, second right, starts arguing with a member of staff behind the counter . A fellow customer steps in and tells the man that he would be willing to 'see him outside' Within seconds, both men start fighting while several customers begin filming the incident . Several customers try to split up both men, including the woman's boyfriend, as they start exchanging blows in the middle of the restaurant. The woman gets carried along on the outside of the group of men and slams the back of her head on the tiles after she falls over. For several seconds, nobody notices that the girl is unconscious as the two men continue trying to hit each other. The English guy is knocked to the floor and the Dublin man appears to try and stamp on him as the fight continues. Several of the customers film the drama on their mobile phones. Eventually, several people notice that the girl is in trouble and one woman tries to lift her from the ground, only to lose grip and leave her head crash against the tiles for a second time. As the chaos continues, one person calls out for an ambulance, while a man, dressed like a zombie, leans over the girl claiming that 'that's my woman'.

"Paranoid: Benjamin Pettitt attacked Dr Robert Davis so viciously in May 2012 that paramedics were initially unable to tell if he was still alive - because there was so much blood . A patient turned into 'little less than an animal' by a cocktail of drugs beat a doctor with a baseball bat before trying to gauge out his eyes after his worried grandmother called for medical help. Benjamin Pettitt beat Dr Robert Davis so badly after he attended his home in Tewkesbury, Gloucester, that police called to the scene were unable to see if the doctor was still alive, because he was covered in so much blood. The 33-year-old began attacking the doctor with a baseball bat, before the frenzied assault escalated and Pettitt began trying to 'bite chunks' out of his victim's face. Pettittt then grabbed a knife to inflict numerous lacerations, as his horrified relatives called paramedics and police - who were forced to taser Pettitt. Dr Davis survived, but the vicious attack has forced him to quit the medical profession because he was left unable to trust patients. Gloucester Crown Court heard how, in the days leading up to the May 2012 attack, Pettitt had taken heroin and cocaine. Pettitt became paranoid, convinced a number of French men wanted to kill him. On the morning of the attack, he is understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants. His grandmother had grown concerned with his paranoia as Pettitt was convinced that a number of French men wanted to kill him. The morning of the attack he is also understood to have taken an heavy cocktail of prescribed anti-depressants. His grandmother had become so concerned  she had called for a doctor - and it was Dr Davis who attended. Prosecuting, Anna Vigars said: 'After about 15 minutes of rational conversation it suddenly turned. 'Pettitt shouted, ""bastards like you are only in it for yourselves"". 'He took a baseball bat and started to swing it at Dr Davis, he hit his arms, his shoulders and his nose. He hit him a number of times, including one very painful blow to his head. 'Then Mr Pettitt was on top of him, trying to gouge his eyes out. Mr Davis was trying to take hold of his arms. Call for help: The medic had been called to the house in Cotteswold Road, Tewkesbury, Gloucester, after Pettitt's grandmother became concerned about his increasing parnoia. Pictured: Cotteswold Road . 'As his hands were moved away, (Pettitt) leaned forward and tried to bite Mr Davis' face - he tried to bite a chunk from his nose. 'He then began shouting, he shouted: 'I really want to kill you, it would be a huge adrenaline rush'. In terror Mr Davis was crying which he was mocked for by Mr Pettitt. 'Mr Pettitt then managed to get hold of knife. That caused the top part of his thumb to be sliced. 'Thereafter he described how he was punched a number of times, but when ambulance staff arrived it became clear they were actually stab wounds to his left shoulder and the left side of his head. 'At that stage they didn't know whether or not Mr Davis was alive simply because of the amount of blood. 'In a police interview he told officers it had felt like a dream and he had woken up remorseful for what had happened.' The doctor, who had been practising for 27 years, was left with a number of lacerations to his head, thumb and shoulder, as well as a fractured nose and bruising. The damage to his thumb was so bad, he required plastic surgery. But it was the mental scars Dr Davis was left with which have refused to heal. Mental scars: Dr Davis has since quit medicine, saying his is unable to trust patients anymore . In a victim impact statement read in court, Dr Davis revealed: 'By July this year (2013) I have very little left in the was of physical injuries - I do consider myself very lucky. 'But mentally the affect this has had on me has been far harder to come to terms with. 'In the first four weeks I was bursting into tears very often and my emotions were up and down. 'I found myself waking in the middle of the night thinking about what had happened - I struggled to sleep. 'It seemed incomprehensible that this could happened to me. 'I feel no malice towards him. I feel more anger to the NHS for putting me in the situation where my safety was at risk. 'Due to this attack I feel no desire towards returning to work. I'm not sure I could sit there and try to help patients again in case I am in a similar situation. 'Overall this has had a huge impact on my life. This is probably a career ending event for me. 'The memory of this ordeal will stay with me for a very long time.' Psychiatric expert Dr Tim Amos told the court that Pettitt suffered from a number of drug induced mental health problems. Brendan Moorhouse, defending, said his client had 'expressed genuine remorse' for the attack. He added: 'He understands the consequences to the doctor and he lives with the results of his actions every day.' Judge Jamie Tabor QC ordered that he was hospitalised under Section 45 of the mental health act. He also imposed a minimum prison sentence of nine years, meaning if Pettitt is released from hospital within that time frame he must serve the remainder of the nine years in prison. On sentence the judge told him: 'This cocktail of drugs turned you into quite frankly little less than an animal - causing you to shout out you wanted to kill that man and that you would get an adrenaline rush from it. 'You wouldn't recognise that man if you saw him.'","Benjamin Pettitt attacked Dr Robert Davis at Tewkesbury home in May 2012 .

"Dreaming of a holiday fit for royalty? Look no further than impressive Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. The former imperial residence is offering history buffs the chance to spend the night in a former suite of an emperor from just €1,400 a night (£1,000). The opportunity for a unique overnight stay in the 1,441-room palace will undoubtedly prove popular, as the museum is one of the nation's most-visited tourist attractions. Scroll down for video . The historical Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria, has just opened its doors for overnight guests in the former emperor's suite . The suite that will be available for guests to rent offers two opulent bedrooms, a salon, kitchen and two bathrooms, and was once home to Emperor Franz Joseph's private chambers, according to GoUnusual.com, which has listed the property. Guests in the top-floor suite will also have access to their own private cook, limousine service and butler during their stay. 'At the end of the 17th century Emperor Leopold I commissioned the gifted Baroque architect Bernhard Fischer von Erlach to built a palatial hunting lodge for the heir to the throne,' a spokesperson for the palace said. 'On the site of the old imperial château de plaisance a splendid edifice was to arise. 'Half a century later under Maria Theresa, Schonbrunn Palace was to become the magnificent focus of court life. 'From that time onwards it played host to the leading statesmen of Europe.' The stunning estate boasts 1,441 rooms and is currently one of the nation's most-visited tourist attractions . Those booking in for an overnight stay will have access to a suite with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a salon and a kitchen . Guests staying on the property will also have access to their own private cook, limousine service and butler during their stay . The property has long hosted top international statesmen, including US President John F Kennedy in 1961 . A great deal has changed in Austria today, with the country now a republic, but Schonbrunn Palace has remained a place where high-level political meetings still occur. 'The magnificent architecture and the exquisite decor of its state rooms marks Schonbrunn out as a cultural treasure and tourist attraction of the first order,' the spokesperson said. 'In an imperial setting, guests can wine and dine like an emperor and bed down like a princess.' The property was first purchased in 1569 by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II to serve as a recreational hunting ground. The palace got the name Schonbrunn, which means 'beautiful spring', thanks to an artesian well on the grounds. Schonbrunn Palace was first built and remodelled between 1740 and 1750, during the reign of Maria Theresa, who had received it as a wedding gift. Franz I redecorated the estate in its now-signature neoclassical style. Franz Joseph, a former Austrian emperor, spent a great deal of time at Schonbrunn until his death in 1916. When the Habsburg Monarchy fell in 1918, the newly-founded Austrian Republic took control of the property and turned it into a museum. After World War II, the palace served as offices for British military officers, before being turned into a museum once again in 1955. Since the mid-1950s, it's been a major tourist attraction and the location of some important historical events, such as a meeting between US President John F Kennedy and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1961. In 1996, UNESCO inducted the Schonbrunn Palace onto the World Heritage List. Although the Baroque decor is remarkable in its own right, these sweeping panoramic views might be the palace's best feature . A spokesperson for the palace said: 'In an imperial setting, guests can wine and dine like an emperor and bed down like a princess' During a guest's stay in the palace, all services will be provided by the nearby Austria Trend Parkhotel Schonbrunn . Since the 1950s, the property has been a museum, and in 1996, UNESCO inducted the Schonbrunn Palace onto the World Heritage List . From the suite, the Gloriette, Neptune Fountain, the Kronprinzengarten and the palace park are visible, sprawled across 400 acres . The project is unique for Europe and can be booked in partnership with Austria Trend Hotels. During a guest's stay in the palace, all services will be provided by the nearby Austria Trend Parkhotel Schonbrunn, which itself used to function as the emperor's guest house.

"Ant Smith says telling the truth about the size of his manhood was 'liberating' New statistics reveal that the average sized penis is only 5.16 inches, smaller than originally thought, but what's it like if you don't measure up to the norm? One man with a with a  small member (only four inches erect) recently blogged about the perils of having a tiny todger - and his post went viral. Here, writer Ant Smith, a 47-year-old engineering manager from London, explains why he decided to share his vital statistics and explains what it's like to be a few inches short. 'Last year I wrote a poem and blog post about penis size anxiety. It was painfully autobiographical, but the harder it was to write, the more important it seemed to be. 'I'm 48 now, and I've been struggling with this anxiety for decades, even though I'm very happily married. 'Men have a great capacity for emotional deniability. As long as we're not confronted with our vulnerabilities we can pretend they don't exist. 'It was a drunken evening talking to a new, but good friend, when somehow or other the question of size came up and I admitted I had such worries. 'I was very drunk, and just couldn't face lying once again. To my surprise, he said he did too. A comrade in arms I thought, as we sheepishly swapped statistics - he went first and admitted to only possessing 6"". I told him I had 4, and his relief was palpable. 'Telling this truth was truly liberating, and being able to reassure my friend was rewarding. This is when I realised how pervasive, and pointless, size anxiety is. I realised my own perspective could help many others too. 'So I published the blog in the hope that if more smaller guys were open and honest we could establish a more realistic view of what average is - rather than only ever seeing the behemoths that porn and advertising presents to us. Ant says men should be more open and honest to establish a more realistic view of what average is . 'For the next few months I performed the poem at various venues around London. There was always at least one warm handshake afterwards from a guy who seemed particularly glad that I'd openly discussed the question of size, from my perspective. 'Then in September last year the world's media took notice and I found myself giving interviews around the globe. It seems like I'd found some kind of magic formula. A way of talking about the issue that was neither too puerile nor too painful. Suddenly everyone was talking about my small, but perfectly functioning, willy! 'And I was personally responding to thousands of men (by Twitter and e-mail). So much so that it became impossible to keep up. I felt tremendously proud to have achieved this through poetry, to be able to make poetry relevant in the mainstream. 'At this point RiotTV asked if I'd like to make a short documentary - and I thought if I can't reply personally to everyone this was an opportunity to spread my positive take to so many more people. 'With the promise of being able to make something enduring I was able to garner the support to organise The Big Small Penis Party. 'This meant I had to really think through the issues - remember, I'd spent most of my life in denial so this was a journey of discovery for me too. Ant says he first experienced penis size anxiety while getting changed for sports at school . 'First I remembered a time, age 13, in the school changing room putting my shorts on while I was still wearing my long winter coat. I didn't even know what penis size anxiety was then, or why I was doing that, but I did. 'Growing up I realise more girls asked me out than vice versa, I must have been reasonably attractive - but I never knew it. 'By age 18 I was suffering openly from other (young) men laughing at me in the locker room or at the urinal. I became very shy to the extent that I'd find reasons to put off ""that first time"" with girlfriends that I did have. 'I worked hard and I was successful in every other way, but I had zero self respect. And I was very, very bad at sex. Not at all because of my small member, but because I never dared practice enough and I never believed I could be anything other than abysmal in that department. 'Thankfully, after only 17 years my wife has taught me differently! 'The party was an attempt to head off these, needless, difficulties for others. In and of itself, on the night it certainly worked. We got a great cross section of people attending, including guys of all ages and sizes (we surveyed the audience). 'I know there were smaller guys there taking a moment of relief. One gentleman travelled from northern Italy specifically for the party. And I heard others talking about how they would never again shout ""Small Penis!"" when they see particularly bad driving. 'But the party is just the beginning. Already others around the world are asking my advice on how to do something similar, and of course soon we will have the short documentary ready too. 'I do believe, in some small way, The Big Small Penis Party has made the world a little better place.'","Ant Smith shares his vital statistics and speaks of penis size anxiety .

"Everybody likes to believe that they will leave some kind of mark on this earth when they die, but for some, nobody will ever even know they are gone . In the US, there are more than 2,000 unidentified women lying in morgues and unmarked graves across the country. Artist Sarah Honan, 19, from Waterford, Ireland, has now painted the portraits of several of these females alongside the limited details of their deaths, and any other information that is known about them in a project called Blink. An Irish artist has painted a series of portraits of some of the 2,000-plus 'Janes Does' in morgues and graveyards across America who weren't identified after their deaths. Now on show in Waterford City, Ireland, the Blink exhibition hopes to build a legacy for the forgotten women (Pictured left: A victim of a 'sex party' gone wrong  was found laying dead between two parked cars in April 2004, in New York, pictured right: A woman found naked on a street in Mount Vernon, New York, in 1988 . Explaining why she decided to do the portraits, Sarah said: 'I decided to do the project because after originally searching for one Jane Doe to paint and then uncovering thousands, I realised that this was something very important.' While the information held on each woman varies greatly in detail, some clearly suffered violent deaths. One woman (pictured above right), was found on 14 February 1988, naked and lying on the street in an industrial area in Mount Vernon, New York. There were clear signs that she had been bound at the hands and ankles prior to her death. Another (pictured above left), was the victim of a 'sex party' gone wrong, and was found laying dead between two parked cars on 27 April 2004 in New York city. While some of the women portrayed died in apparently violent circumstances, others, such as this elderly woman found unresponsive outside 145 West 55th street in New York, in 2010, are shrouded in mystery and speculation . Sarah was so touched by the stories of these women that she wanted to create a lasting memory for them on this earth, as they had been forgotten by those who knew them when they were alive. She said: 'I think that everyone deserves some form of legacy and in a way when these women died and went unidentified it was as if their slates had been wiped clean. 'No name, no memories, no legacy. 'I thought that once I was aware of this information it would be wrong of me to ignore it. Sarah painted the women from their morgue photographs, which she found on the Unidentified Persons Database. From gender based violence to the representation of women in society past and present, the Blink project hopes to raise questions about the way women and their identity have been treated throughout history . Sarah believes that it is important these Jane Does are remembered because of the what they say about the way women are treated in society. She said: 'They had so much to say about gender based violence, the representation of women in society and lack of female identity throughout history. 'These were all issues I'd long wanted to explore and this became my way of entering the dialogue.' The woman pictured above is a typical example of the many women, who were most likely abused, that Sarah is so keen to bestow a legacy on. Found dead in an alley in Detroit wearing fishnet stockings and a red mini dress, this woman, thought to be no more than 22-years-old, was the victim of murder in September 1967. The woman pictured below was first found lying in lying in a field in Howard County, Maryland on 15 July 1971. She was wearing nothing but a 'half slip and panties' when she was discovered, and  died two months later on September 7. This middle aged woman was found in July 1971, lying in a field in Howard County, Maryland, . Although very little is known about any of these women, some of the horrors that were experienced by them shortly before they died are clear from just a couple of lines of information on how they were found. The woman pictured below was found nude inside a metal cabinet that was placed on the sidewalk, in March 1988. Her head had been 'wrapped in duct tape and multiple layers of plastic wrap'. This woman was found nude inside a metal cabinet that was placed on the sidewalk, in March 1988, in the Bronx, New York . The woman pictured was discovered in a motel room in July 1991, with no information to identify her . Another women, pictured above, was found dead in a motel room in Eldorado, Arknsas, on 10 July 1991, wearing a pair of white socks , some acid wash blue jeans, a black belt and a white T-shirt. While the circumstances of many of the women are mixed with signs of violence and troubled lives, others are heartrendingly sad in other ways. One such story is of the woman pictured below. Thought to be between 55 and 60 years old, the lady was found 'slumped over in a stall in the ladies' restroom inside the Greyhound Bus Terminal at 200 S. Main St. in Las Vegas.' Dressed in a floral blouse, blue trousers, and wearing a wedding ring, the woman had no personal identification about her, even in the handbag that was hanging next to her on the back of the door. Found on 10 July 1982 slumped over in the bathroom of a Las Vegas bus station , this woman, thought to be near 55 years old and wearing a white metal wedding ring, but carried no personal identification whatsoever . When faced with how to represent these lost women, Sarah, who currently lives in Waterford herself, decided that an honest portrayal was the only way. She said: 'I didn't want to imagine lives or faces for these women that they never had - I thought this would be disrespectful. 'So I was brutally honest, I represented exactly what I had before me, no retouching or editing. 'With what faced me honesty was the only real option.' Artist Sarah Honan (pictured) hopes her Blink project will help some of the 2,000 Jane Doe women in America be appreciated and remembered, despite the lack of information about who they were and the lives they led .","US records currently have over 2,000 dead women recorded as Jane Does .

"Pet lovers have raised £4,000 to rebuild the face of a tomcat affectionately nicknamed 'the Purr-minator' after he was left with horrific injuries when a cabinet fell on him. Five-month-old Thomas was left unable to eat and in need of a major operation after his jaw was fused shut in the accident at his owner's home on Merseyside.

Thomas' face will need to be reconstructed after the two hour surgery as the 'super-vet' in Surrey may have to take out part of his cheek bone. Administrative assistant Elaine Clarke, 50, from Warrington, Cheshire,  sacrificed her 50th birthday celebrations to lead the campaign to save the cat on behalf of a friend, Thomas' owner. She said: 'We have been told by the vets to bulk him up and bring him back. 'We need to feed him up every three hours, get him exercising and get him some muscles. Thomas will need to be bulked up like a mini Arnie for him to survive the surgery.' Elaine first became aware of Thomas when his owner posted some pictures of him on a Facebook site asking for advice. She said: 'She posted a picture of him after a cupboard had fallen on him and a few weeks later a video of him trying to eat and you could see he was struggling to eat the meat and could only drink the milk. So everyone commented 'go to the vets,' which she did do.' Funding: Thomas' owners are desperately trying to raise money to fund the crucial treatment . Happier times: Thomas,  before his head was partially crushed by a falling cabinet . Thomas was then taken for an X-ray and it was thought he had a broken jaw which only allowed him to open his jaw 2mm and Elaine offered to take the cat in. 'After various treatments of steroids and antibiotics there was no improvement in his condition,' she said. 'The vet then suggested taking biopsy's from the top of his head and either side of his jaw. The results came back and the left side of the jaw and top of the head were clear, regrettably there is tissue and muscle damage to the right side of the jaw.' Thomas then had a nasal feeding tube placed to allow him to eat but having pulled it out, a vet refused to replace it fearing it was unethical and that he should be put to sleep. Elaine and Thomas' owner were referred to a veterinary specialists in Surrey. Elaine, an administrative assistant, said: 'After a consultation they told me his jaw was fused but right were the joint is. The jaw had fused right where it meets the skull. They said, 'we want you to bring him back a miniature Arnie, really feed him up and we will weight him in a few weeks to see if we can operate.' When Elaine first took Thomas in he weighed just 1.1kg but has since put on half a kilo. She said: 'He is tiny. He is about 5-months-old but the size of a 12-week-old kitten. We have to body build him up with loads of food which being fed through a stomach tube. We need to exercise him too.' 'I have to get up at 6.30am every morning and feed him every half an hour. My mission is to get him strong enough for surgery.' Recovery: Thomas, left and right with a friend, has been lucky to survive but needs surgery to improve his chances of survival . 'I missed my 50th and everything because I had to feed him. I was also supposed to go on holiday to celebrate it but we needed to be here for Thomas.. It's worth it though. I was a lost cause and doctors told me I was in a worse state that they had seen for a long time. But I made it though and Thomas is the same. If there is a chance, you have to fight, whether it is for your cat, your dog or you family member.' 'He is so adorable. I will be sad when he has to go back. He is part of the family now.' The Go Fund Me page reads: 'He is such a loving, strong and very brave little cat and deserves a chance to live. We were looking to raise up to £2000 but now need to raise £5000 and any donations big or small would be gratefully received and very welcome. 'Thomas has now been referred to the best vet in the country to see if there is any way that they can help him. We know that the treatment does not come cheap hence the reason we have now increased the fund requirements. Please help us to give Thomas a fighting chance to live a normal life.'

"Martha Stewart found herself in hot water this morning after she posted a completely nude photo of her four-year-old granddaughter Jude to her Twitter account from their family vacation. 'Jude looks great with her long blond hair braided - art session at 8.45,' the 73-year-old lifestyle mogul wrote with the image, which depicts Jude sitting on the floor with her back turned to the camera. The image quickly became a source of outrage among her followers, with many tweeting their horror at the image’s content, prompting Martha to remove the offending image just 15 minutes after it was posted. Scroll down for video . Posted: Martha Stewart found herself in hot water this morning after she tweeted a completely naked photo of her four-year-old granddaughter Jude from their family vacation, which Daily Mail Online has censored . Eldest granddaughter: Martha, pictured with Jude last May in New York, deleted the post 15 minutes later claiming she thought she had cropped the image . 'Martha why is this child naked??' one response read, while another added: ‘Is there a specific reason she is naked?’ Martha quickly issued an apology for the error, saying: 'Sorry I thought I cropped the photo - we are on vacation!' That tweet has now also been removed from her account. Jude is the eldest of Martha's two grandchildren, the other being three-year-old Truman. Both were born via a surrogate  to Martha's only daughter Alexis Stewart, a 49-year-old TV host and radio personality, who has spoken publicly about her struggle to conceive a child naturally. Martha's Twitter followers were unified in their immediate responses following the nude snap. 'Really? Posting naked pictures of a child on Twitter? Really???' wrote one. 'I agree. Any idiot knows you can't put naked pics of kids on the internet', stated another. A third commented: 'Please place proper clothing on this child and repost. Thank you'. Backtracking: The 73-year-old lifestyle guru, who is on vacation in an unknown location, soon issued this apology (pictured), but deleted it less than an hour later . Outrage: Martha's followers were unified in their knee-jerk responses following the nude snap . Twitter's guidelines mention that they 'do not mediate content', and suggest, in regards to 'sensitive content such as nudity', that: 'For the most part, using common sense won’t steer you wrong.' Following Martha's removal of the photo, one follower replied: 'Thank you dear', while another stated, 'I'm calling bulls***'. Martha has since deleted her apology tweet too, and her latest post is now a snap of her vacation view. 'Resting with this view after a marathon Comedy Central taping the roast of justin bieber!!! You will see it 3-30'.

Speaking ahead of the spectacle, Martha admitted to Entertainment Weekly: 'I have many, many reservations [about my jokes].' 'Please, everyone who knows me: I didn’t write this stuff. I’m going to say some raunchy stuff, but I just worry about what they’re going to say about me.'","The 73-year-old lifestyle mogul shared the inappropriate snap of her eldest grandchild Jude seated with her back to the camera enjoying an 'art session'

"Nick Clegg has revealed plans for a career after politics as the new David Attenborough . He has often complained about the animal antics of MPs in Parliament. But it seems Nick Clegg might not want to leave that all behind if he loses his seat at the election. The Deputy Prime Minister has revealed plans for a career after politics as the new David Attenborough. Asked about his future away from Westminster, the Lib Dem leader told Attitude magazine: ‘I’ve always wanted to make wildlife documentaries.’ Mr Clegg, who is already good friends with documentary maker Louis Theroux, faces a tough fight to keep hold of his Sheffield Hallam seat and polls have predicted his party could lose more than half of its MPs. The Lib Dem leader demonstrated his love of the animal kingdom when he revealed one of this favourite moments in power was getting to feed a seal in Cornwall. ’It was brilliant,’ he told MailOnline last month. He sent a picture of his moment with the seal to his children, his parents, his whole family. His baffled sister asked: ’Why is this the only picture you've emailed me of yourself in the last several months”. But he insisted: ’I was so excited about that.’ David Cameron told Attitude, which conducted interviews with the all the main party leaders, he is a fan of the American indie rock band The War on Drugs. He said: ‘[My wife] Samantha got me listening to a new thing called The War on Drugs. I can recommend it. They’re a band, you can find them on Spotify or iTunes – anyway, they’re good!’ Ed Miliband boasted of how singer Ellie Goulding last year asked him to one of her gigs. He said: I’m an Ellie Goulding fan. She invited me to this benefit concert she was doing for the homeless just before Christmas. I really like her.’ Mr Cameron revealed that the LGBT figure he most admires is television presenter Clare Balding, who he said is a ‘wonderful human being’. He said: ‘Everyone says [Enigma codebreaker] Alan Turing, and of course he was an amazing man and I’ve seen The Imitation Game and I thought it was brilliant, but I’m going to go with Clare Balding. ‘I’m a big fan. I love her enthusiasm; her zest for life. It doesn’t matter what sport she’s talking about, she can make it interesting. She’s a wonderful human being.’ Scroll down for video . As Deputy Prime Minister for the last five years he has toured the world, met the great and the good and been at the heart of an extraordinary experiment in coalition government but the thing he is most pleased to have done is feed a seal in Cornwall this month . The Prime Minister also told how he had raised the issue of gay rights with Russian President Vladimir Putin at 3am. He said: ‘We raise these issues with every country, and I personally remember raising it in the middle of the night in a meeting with Vladimir Putin, at about 3 in the morning at the G20 he was chairing. ‘So we don’t hold back from raising... We recognise that some countries take a radically different approach, but we should tell them why we think we’ve got the right one.’ Nigel Farage talked about how he has spent time with ex-boxing promoter Kellie Maloney, formerly known as Frank, since she has been living as a woman. The Ukip leader said it was ‘very interesting’ talking to the former Ukip candidate. He said: ‘I was friendly with Frank for a long time. ‘Since he’s changed to be Kellie, we have met, talked – very interesting conversation. Very interesting. It’s not a subject I know a huge amount about, but it was very interesting talking to Kellie. ‘There are lots of things in life that we’re curious about, and it’s not until you’ve talked to someone who’s been there that you get an inkling of how you might feel in a similar situation. ‘I think the Kellie story is a very interesting story which has caught the public imagination in a very big way. Quite unlike I’ve ever seen before.’ Mr Clegg revealed his dream to make wildlife documentaries like David Attenborough, who famously met gorillas in Rwanda in 1979 . In a separate article for Countryside Alliance magazine, Mr Clegg told how spending time among wildlife in rural areas ‘lifts your heart’. He wrote: ‘Rural Britain is what makes this country the envy of the world. From the beaches of St Ives to the rolling hills of Inverness, we are privileged to have on our doorsteps areas of outstanding natural beauty brimming with wildlife and warm communities who lift your heart whenever you visit. ‘There is no doubt that the British countryside has provided wealth, health and happiness for generations of Brits and tourists.’ Mr Cameron has often boasted about how his music collection is packed with trendy new bands and obscure artists, such as Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit. But in January, he was left embarrassed after folk singer Nick Mulvey said he felt a ‘bit sick’ when he received the Prime Minister’s approval.","Lib Dem leader reveals his dream job if he leaves politics behind him .

The Amazon-owned website lets users live stream games as they play, with fellow users able to watch and listen in. It confirmed the site had been targeted in a blog post (pictured) - although resisted calling it a hack or cyber attack - and told users that all passwords had been reset . Amazon bought the website in 2014 for $970 million (£650 million), outbidding internet giant Google for the company. Twitch now receives more than 50 million unique visitors a month. In a post on the company's official blog, Twitch said: 'We are writing to let you know that there may have been unauthorised access to some Twitch user account information. 'For your protection, we have expired passwords and stream keys and have disconnected accounts from Twitter and YouTube. The suspected cyber attack on Twitch joins the growing list of notable breaches in recent months. Following a compromise of eBay usernames and passwords last year, there was the celebrity nude photo leak that affected A-list stars including actress Jennifer Lawrence. Thousands of photos were posted online after iCloud accounts were attack by hackers, who used brute force password-guessing software to breach security. Then in December, Sony Pictures was hit by a large-scale cyber attack that saw employee records posted online, as well as upcoming movies from the studio. Reports suggested that the hack was the work of North Korea in response to the Sony movie The Interview, which depicted the assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong-Un. Sony's Playstation Network was also affected by the breach, suffering service problems over the Christmas period.

However, it added: 'Twitch does not store or process full credit or debit card information, so your card number is safe.' The site has so far declined to comment beyond the official blog post. Commenting on the attack, Mark James, security specialist at ESET said: 'Gaming sites have always been a lucrative target. 'Not only do they represent gamers that may use the same login and passwords as similar sites but they also enable the possibility of other electronic goods to be stolen and sold elsewhere, in game items, in game gold. 'There’s no perfect advice for when your details are stolen but changing your password is certainly one of the best.

"A rising YouTube star who invited her legion of fans to share photos of themselves, using the hashtag #bodypositive this weekend had her seemingly good intentions backfire when thousands of girls - many of them apparently in their early teens - submitted half-naked photos. Lindsay Demeloa, who moved from her New Jersey hometown to Los Angeles a few years ago, where she later dropped out of college, shared her own scantily-clad selfie to Instagram last week, captioned: 'I love my tiny booty and stick legs, and you should love every single inch of you as well.' Concerns have arisen over two aspects of the movement; the first being the safety issues associated with potentially underage girls exposing themselves on social media, and the second being the glorification of Lindsay's tiny frame.

Matthew added: 'How will this work if it's only going to make them feel more insecure? And... why the internet? They're showing off their bodies on the internet. Not a very safe place.'

"Brittany Maynard's widower has described their final moments together in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. Dan Diaz was lying in the bed beside his 29-year-old wife when she drank medication to end her life last month. Having been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer just six months before, Maynard became the face of America's Right To Die campaign after moving from California to Oregon and setting a date for her own death. Now, her widower is continuing that battle calling for all states to approve legislation that supports life-ending options for people with terminal illnesses. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'It was peaceful and loving': Dan Diaz has spoken to Oprah about his final moments with Brittany Maynard . Passed away: Diaz's wife controversially chose to end her life with lethal medication last month . Campaign: Maynard documented her final six months and fought for relaxed laws on the right to die . Launching his campaign, Diaz met with Oprah and explained how Maynard chose seven of her closest friends and relatives - and their dogs Bella and Charlie - to stand around the bed in her final moments. 'The mood in the house was very peaceful, very loving,' he said in an interview that will be screened on Sunday. Glassy-eyed, he said each person recited a memory to her before she said her own goodbyes. 'She actually wrote on Facebook a message to her friends and said ""I love you"" to everyone, to me. 'The medication, we brought it in. She was ready.' Love: The couple married in California but later moved to Oregon where Maynard could end her life . Memories: Diaz said Maynard got seven friends and relatives to each tell her a memory . Diaz is continuing the campaign that Maynard started as he lobbies for new legislation . Maynard's two dogs were in the bed with them when she drank the lethal medicine, Diaz said . Then, she drank the lethal cocktail prescribed by her doctor. 'Within five minutes, she fell asleep. It was very peaceful.' It comes after Debbie Ziegler, Brittany Maynard's mom, wrote an article for DailyMail.com describing the moment she watched her only daughter die. 'Brittany, my beautiful, brave girl, had passed away purposefully and peacefully just as she planned. Death had been kind, graceful even, and spared Brittany a great deal of physical pain and mental anguish. 'It was a good death.' A mother's tears: Debbie Ziegler, Maynard's mother, is also campaigning to change laws . Joining Diaz in the campaign for euthanasia, she added: 'But what does a good death look like in America: the land of death phobia? Americans do not like to talk about death. Some say a good death is a natural death, but they often mean dying “in their sleep.” 'Modern medicine has made death seem like a medical failure instead of the natural end of life. The death of a 29-year-old is unthinkable. All of life looms ahead, full of promise. 'We found ourselves as a family: choosing between no more treatment and death – or a treatment plan that felt like torture and then death anyway only a few months later.' Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act in 1994, but opponents persuaded a federal judge to issue an injunction temporarily blocking the law. Voters in November 1997 overwhelmingly reaffirmed the nation's first aid-in-dying law and it's been in place ever since.

"An endoscopy revealed MP Mike Weatherley's heartburn was in fact oesophageal cancer . MP Mike Weatherley was out for dinner with friends when, inexplicably, he found himself struggling to swallow. ‘It felt as if the food was catching on the way down,’ says the Conservative member for Hove and Portslade in East Sussex. ‘After a few mouthfuls I realised it wasn’t going to budge and I had to run to the toilet and throw up.’ Initially, he put it down to a bug, but over the next week it happened again and again. ‘Soup was fine but anything tougher, such as steak, would feel as if it was catching,’ says Mike, 57, who is divorced and has three children aged 27, 25 and 22. ‘I was not overly concerned; I thought I was a relatively healthy person, I don’t smoke and I play sport. 'Being a Parliamentarian, however, brings with it an unhealthy lifestyle — I often would not eat until midnight and I drink a bit more than the official guidelines. But I thought, on balance, I was in pretty good shape.’ His only complaint was the odd bit of heartburn. But he thought that was a common problem and nothing to worry about. However, in December 2011, after three weeks with no improvement, he realised it was time to see his doctor. She thought it might be acid indigestion or reflux and prescribed some strong antacids, which didn’t help. She also referred Mike for an endoscopy, when a camera attached to a tube is fed down the throat. He had the investigation five weeks later which found he had a growth bulging across his oesophagus, the pipe that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Tests revealed it was cancer. ‘I felt as if the floor had dropped away,’ he says. ‘I thought: “That’s it, I’m going to die.” 'I was thinking of my three children, and how I wouldn’t see them go on to establish their own families and I’d never meet my grandchildren.’ Oesophageal cancer is becoming increasingly common. Between 1977 and 2011, the number of cases soared — by 65 per cent in men and 26 per cent in women, according to Cancer Research UK. ‘No other country in Europe has a higher incidence of this cancer than we do,’ says Michael Griffin, professor of gastrointestinal surgery at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle. We have the highest incidence of the most common form of oesophageal cancer — called adenocarcinoma — in the world, he adds. This is thought to be linked to our high rates of obesity and alcohol intake. The prognosis is often poor: only 40 per cent of patients are alive 12 months after their diagnosis. ‘There is a very low survival rate for this cancer,’ says Tom Stansfeld, health information officer at Cancer Research UK. ‘After ten years, there is only a 10 per cent survival rate, whereas with breast or testicular cancer the rate is 80 to 90 per cent.’ One of the main problems is that people aren’t aware of the symptoms, so the cancer is not picked up until it is too late. Research for Public Health England found 70 per cent had no idea that food sticking in your throat could be a sign of oesophageal or stomach cancer; 59 per cent were not aware persistent heartburn was a sign, too. In fact, heartburn isn’t just a symptom of oesophageal cancer, it’s also the cause in most cases. Heartburn occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach splash up the oesophagus; being overweight encourages this, putting pressure on the stomach. Over years the splashed acid can cause changes to the type of cells lining the oesophagus and they become pre-cancerous, known as Barrett’s oesophagus. About 6 per cent of those with Barrett’s go on to develop oesophageal cancer. Heartburn isn’t just a symptom of oesophageal cancer, it’s also the cause in most cases (file picture) Oesophageal cancer is also linked to a diet low in fruit and vegetables, and to smoking and drinking — possibly because these irritate the cells that line the oesophagus. It can also run in families. Men are three times more likely to develop adenocarcinoma — the most common type — than women. Why is unclear, but one theory is the female oesophagus is more resistant to damage, says Professor Griffin. The problem is that many people, like Mike, think heartburn is ‘just one of those things’. ‘I had it once or more a week for a year before my diagnosis and thought everyone got a bit of heartburn. I would take Gaviscon and not think any more of it,’ he admits. Professor Griffin says occasional heartburn a few times a month is acceptable, but adds: ‘Persistent heartburn is not normal.’ Public Health England has launched a campaign encouraging people to visit their GP if they have heartburn most days for three weeks or more. Oesophageal cancer, pictured, is becoming increasingly common. Between 1977 and 2011, the number of cases soared - by 65 per cent in men and 26 per cent in women . Yet, Mike believes the situation could be helped by improving access to GPs. Last month, he made a speech to the Commons asking the Health Minister to consider this. ‘If I need to see a GP I have to ring during this narrow window between 8am to 8.10am to try to secure an appointment for that day,’ he says. ‘I think that means people put off going and getting their symptoms checked, as I did.’ If the disease is caught at an early stage, pre-cancerous or even cancerous cells can simply be burned or cut away. However, when it is more advanced, the usual option is to remove the oesophagus almost in its entirety. The stomach is then moved up and a section of the oesophagus that is left will be attached to it. ‘It is the most high-risk elective surgery there is, as you have to open the abdomen and the chest, which is major trauma for the body. It’s like going through a car crash,’ says Professor Griffin. He says only a third of the patients referred to him are eligible even to try ‘curative’ treatment as, once diagnosed, their cancer is often too advanced and they are too frail. Mike’s biopsy was not conclusive, but the fact he had a mass there convinced surgeons it was best to remove most of his oesophagus. He had the operation in April 2012. ‘I was happy to trust the surgeon’s advice, although I didn’t realise just how major an operation it would be,’ says Mike. ‘Afterwards they give you a button you can push to administer yourself some morphine and their notes showed I pushed mine 535 times the first day.’ For three weeks, he was fed through a tube directly into his stomach. A week after the operation he was told the mass was a grade III cancer, meaning it was aggressive and had spread to nearby lymph nodes. ‘I’d wanted to delay the operation until July. Thank goodness I didn’t, as if I had, I’d be dead now,’ says Mike bluntly. He needed six weeks of radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy for five months. Mike now wishes he had gone to his GP sooner as he might not have needed such major treatment. Yet, Professor Griffin says, even those who do go to their GP may have their diagnosis held up because they will not get an endoscopy soon enough. ‘If someone is suspected of having cancer then they should have one within two weeks. But often these people aren’t referred with suspected cancer, as it might be heartburn, and they can wait for up to 18 weeks,’ he says. For Mike, life has changed. He gets tired easily and whereas he used to look forward to meals out with his girlfriend, Niki, much of the joy of eating has gone for him. Certain foods such as risotto or anything stodgy are off-limits as it can get caught in the new connection between his stomach and what remains of his oesophagus. He is more prone to reflux, so takes omeprazole — which reduces stomach acid production — every day, and has regular scans. ‘I had my last one on Thursday and it came back all-clear, so I am now officially in remission,’ he says, relief evident in his voice. Mike is optimistic about the future and is standing down as an MP in May. But he is certain of his commitment to help others avoid what he’s been through: ‘If I can at least get one person to go to the doctor sooner than they would have done, then I will be pleased.’ For more information, visit nhs.uk/ogcancer .","Mike Weatherley struggled to swallow and felt food catching in his throat .

"Nervous postmen are refusing to deliver to a block of flats unless they are escorted by a band of female pensioners. Royal Mail will only bring post to the 100 flats on three days a week – instead of the usual six – and even then, will only deliver through letterboxes if a 69-year-old female councillor is stood at the postman’s side. His van downstairs, meanwhile, is watched by two ageing female residents of the block in case its tyres are slashed. A postman begins his round near Waterloo while elderly residents stand and guard his delivery van . Councillor Maria Linforth-Hall, 69, escorts the postman around the building after Royal Mail refused to make deliveries at the block of flats . The bizarre arrangement began six months ago after a 34-year-old woman living in the flats was accused of assaulting a postman, as well as sending threatening emails to Royal Mail. Ironically, the building – Rowland Hill flats near Waterloo in central London – has the same name as the man who invented the penny black stamp and effectively created the modern postal service. Royal Mail initially refused to deliver there at all, forcing residents to take a bus to the nearest sorting office. Maria Linforth-Hall, a local Lib Dem councillor, complained – and eventually offered to act as a guard three days a week along with volunteers from the flats. Now every Monday, Wednesday and Friday a band of pensioners waits outside to ‘police’ the deliveries. Southwark Council has complained to regulator Ofcom in the hope of forcing Royal Mail to reinstate a proper service. Mrs Linforth-Hall said: ‘We are hoping that it will be back to normal, but they are saying that it is unsafe without me or my fellows there to assist.’ The arrangement of being chaperoned began when a 34-year-old woman living in the flats was accused of assaulting a postman, as well as sending threatening emails to Royal Mail . Her husband Tony, a former advertising boss who is also 69, sometimes helps with the escort. He said residents are angry about the reduced service, adding: ‘I spoke to a guy waiting for a hip operation who could miss it as a result of not getting his post immediately.’ The woman at the centre of the row, council tenant Rachel O’Connor, alleged that it was the postman who attacked her in a lift rather than the other way round. Police took no further action due to a lack of evidence. But a source claimed the ‘assault’ involved nothing more than Miss O’Connor pushing the postman and the postman pushing her back. Southwark Council said it was ‘working with’ its tenant, who had apologised and signed an ‘acceptable behaviour contract’. Nicola Blake, the local delivery office manager, wrote in a recent letter to residents: ‘Royal Mail are unable to recommence a full mail delivery service. Rowlands Hill House near Waterloo. Southwark Council say they are working with the tenant to allow deliveries to begin again . ‘In November 2012 a resident sent a series of complaints to the Royal Mail which became increasingly abusive and threatening ... in June 2014 the resident assaulted our delivery officer in the lifts. In December the tyres on our vehicle were slashed ... whilst this may be coincidental I am sure you will understand our concerns.’ A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police confirmed it had investigated assault claims but that no one was charged. Miss O’Connor was unavailable for comment.","Royal Mail have refused to deliver post to a block of flats near to Waterloo .

"A mother has locked herself in the bathroom of a busy Midtown Manhattan restaurant and smothered her  20-month-old son to death with her bare hands before shocked employees could burst in and stop her, police say. As Latisha Fisher was being led away from the 5 Boro Burger joint on West 36th Street about 2.30pm on Monday, she blamed the devil for killing Gavriel Ortiz and then trying to stop workers who attempted to resuscitate him. 'I would describe her as soulless. She put her hand over his mouth and smothered him,' a police source told the New York Daily News. Witnesses said Fisher was emotionless after the death of her child. She claimed that she had put her hand over the boy's nose and mouth to put him to sleep, police say. Unthinkable: Latisha Fisher (left) was arrested Monday after allegedly smothering her 20-month-old son Gavriel Ortiz to death in a bathroom at a Manhattan restaurant . Horrific: The 35-year-old mother allegedly locked herself in the bathroom of 5 Boro Burger  in Midtown where she was later found holding her unconscious baby boy . Workers at the restaurant became alarmed Monday afternoon when a line grew outside the restroom. When employees burst in to see what was wrong, they found Gavriel in his mother's lap - unconscious and foaming from the mouth. A male employee performed CPR until paramedics arrived - despite the mother swatting help away. Unfortunately the aid was too late for the little boy who was later pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital. Police immediately took Fisher into custody and transported her to the Midtown South Precinct. A woman who walked into the bathroom Monday afternoon says she saw Fisher with her hand over the baby's mouth, saying she was trying to 'make him go to sleep'. Above, investigators inside the restaurant on Monday . Baby Gavriel was found unconscious and foaming from the mouth when restaurant workers broke into the bathroom . Gavriel was rushed to Bellevue Hospital but doctors could not revive the young boy . Marcus Comeau told amNY that he was standing down the block when he saw Fisher being led out of the restaurant by police. 'The mother was coming out in handcuffs,' he said. 'She didn't seem too distressed, kind of had her head down. 'She didn't make a lot of noise. Not a big fit,' he added. A law enforcement official described Fisher to the Daily News as 'soulless'. Recent posts on Fisher's Facebook page appear to show her going through an emotional period. 'How did everything change on me. I went to sleep feeling well,' she wrote on March 27, one day after posting a thank you to 'everyone for supporting me'. Neighbor's in Fisher's (left) Lower East Side apartment say she lived there with her boyfriend and father of her son Luis Ortiz (father and son pictured on the right) Fisher's neighbors in the Lower East Side housing project where she lives told the New York Times that she and her boyfriend, Gavriel's father Luis Ortiz, had started fighting around Halloween. Other neighbors told the Daily News that she was 'violent' and that they could often smell marijuana coming from her unit. Some remembered an older child being taken away from Fisher, and an incident in which she stabbed another family member. Fisher's older son is reportedly a preteen. 'I think she just went cuckoo on whoever was up there,' neighbor Carolyn Lawson, 47, told the Daily News of the alleged stabbing. 'She needs help. It doesn’t make sense. I think she was on medication for whatever problem she had, but I’m assuming she wasn’t taking her meds.' Following the incident, family and friends started pouring out condolences on Luis Ortiz's Facebook page.","Latisha Fisher, 35, allegedly locked herself in a bathroom at 5 Boro Burger in Midtown Manhattan Monday afternoon with son Gavriel Ortiz .

"Albert Carter (above) has been banned from entering any Sainsbury's store in Britain - because he accidentally drove his red mobility scooter into another shopper . A grandfather has been banned from entering any Sainsbury's store in Britain - because he accidentally drove his mobility scooter into another shopper. Albert Carter received a letter from the supermarket chain stating police would be called if he is seen in any of its 1,200-plus stores again as he would be  a 'trespasser'. The 80-year-old had gone into a branch of Sainsbury's in Newcastle-under-Lyme to buy a packet of cigarettes on March 7. He accidentally hit a woman with his scooter after paying and paramedics were called to the store. They took the shopper to hospital as a precaution. Mr Carter also struck a customer service desk with his scooter as he panicked following the collision with the female shopper. He received the letter outlining his ban less than a week later. The former truck driver said he has been made to feel like a 'shoplifter' following the mishap and added that it was the first accident he has been involved in on his scooter. He said: 'I understand that they might be concerned about me coming into the shop after what happened but I have never had an accident on it before so why would they ban me forever? 'It was my fault. I take the blame completely. After I paid at the front kiosk I turned to leave and then don't know how it happened. 'I didn't do it on purpose but it was that quick I'm not sure how I hit the women. I was really upset that I hurt someone. 'The staff and paramedics were nice at the time so I don't understand why I have been sent this letter. I have never been a shoplifter so why are they treating me like one? A letter sent by the store manager to the 80-year-old a week after the incident said that if he did enter a Sainsbury's he would be treated as a 'trespasser' 'I want to apologise to the lady. I am really upset to have hurt her. 'Even if I was let into Sainsbury's I'm not sure I would want to go in again after the way they treated me. I have barely left home since the incident.' The letter stated: 'The invitation to enter and shop at all Sainsbury's stores is permanently withdrawn due to the incident you were involved in. 'Should you enter any of our premises, you will be treated as a trespasser and the police will be called as necessary.' The father-of-three's daughter Jayne Taylor, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, has hit out at the supermarket for the ban, which she claims is normally reserved for shoplifters. The 50-year-old, who works as a security guard, said: 'Dad was so upset and distraught at what happened. Mr Carter said: 'Even if I was let into Sainsbury's I'm not sure I would want to go in again after the way they treated me. I have barely left home since the incident' 'We are not denying that he was in the wrong but it was a complete accident, he didn't go into Sainsbury's to plough customers down. 'I'm just flabbergasted he has been treated like a criminal. It's ridiculous. How will they enforce it? 'It's just out of order. He has now lost his confidence and won't go out on the scooter.' A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'Our teams in store have a duty to consider the safety of all of our customers and this decision was reached after reviewing CCTV footage and other reports. 'We will, of course, be happy to discuss this further with Mr Carter and his family, to ensure that we maintain a safe shopping environment for everyone.' A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added that the female patient was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Hartshill as a precaution and had non-serious injuries.","Albert Carter received letter  after the incident in Newcastle-under-Lyme .

"Vienna’s famous palaces and opera houses are set to be joined by a new tourist attraction – the tallest wooden skyscraper in the world. When it is completed in 2017, the timber-framed tower will be 24 storeys high with more than 200,000 square feet of commercial and residential space. Designed by architects at RLP Rudiger Lainer+Partner, the €65million (£45million) HoHo Vienna project is expected to include a hotel, offices, flats and wellness centre. When it is completed in 2017, about 75 per cent of the 24-storey tower will be made from wood . It will be located in Seestadt Aspern, a massive urban development site in north-east Vienna, about 75 per cent of the building will be made of wood. The 275-ft tower will be a hybrid: it will have a concrete core with a self-supporting timber shell secured to it. Inside, flats will have exposed wood ceilings, columns and walls to create a natural atmosphere, according to renderings released by the design firm. Wood was chosen because the popular building material in Austria is affordable, high in quality and environmentally friendly. Inside, the flats will feature exposed wood ceilings, columns and walls to create a natural atmosphere . With three-quarters of the building made of wood, it is expected to save 2,800 tonnes of CO2 emissions. But the plans have sparked concerns from local fire officials as the developers, cetus Baudevelopment Gmbh, prepare to begin construction this autumn. Vienna fire service spokesman Christian Wegner told the Guardian: ‘The main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings. ‘An 84-metre-high building in Europe is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realised. ‘A few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet.’ Forte in Melbourne, Australia is currently the tallest timber-framed residential building in the world . He said special tests must be conducted on the hybrid model and a fail-safe sprinkler system. The architects said: ‘The timber construction system provides high efficiency in terms of thermal insulation and serviceability. ‘Wood composite floors are secured to the central concrete supporting cores, and extend out to the building edge. ‘These floor panels are supported by a wooden column system around the outline of the building. This structure then supports pre-fabricated external wall modules that combine solid wood panels with an “earthy” concrete shell to form the building's facade.’ When it opens in approximately two years HoHo Vienna will be nearly three times as tall as a current record holder.

"While driverless cars won't be cruising down the motorway anytime soon, they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses. Ten US cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year, with the first being unveiled in Tampa Bay, Florida in the spring. Meanwhile, trials will launch in another 12 to 20 US locations by the end of next year, which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 US cities by 2017. Scroll down for video . Ten US cities will roll out automated vehicle projects this year, with the first being unveiled in Tampa Bay, Florida in the spring. Meanwhile, trials will launch in another 12 to 20 US locations by the end of next year. Greenwich in the UK will also be trialling the technology (artist's impression pictured) The trials use vehicles developed by France-based Veeo Systems, according to a report in the New York Observer. These vary in size from two-seaters to large buses. 'Some will be on the roads where it's legal,' Corey Clothier, a strategist for automated transportation systems who runs the firm told DailyMail.com. Elsewhere, he said the focus will be on college campuses, theme parks, airports and downtown areas. 'The whole goal is to launch pilots so we can collect data to help with the regulations that will legalise the cars,' he added. For instance, in the U.S. Army's Fort Bragg in North Carolina, automated pod-like cars will transport wounded troops from their barracks. 'It's a wounded warrior campus, and we're going to start pretty small with two essentially big gulf carts to take the soldiers from living quarters to the hospital next door,' said Clothier. Pictured are the locations who have publicly agreed to pilot projects under the Comet programme.  Comet's ultimate goal is to have the project running in 30 states, but said that some are not yet ready to announce plans . 'Starting with two vehicles our goal is getting up to six to eight.' The programme, run by Comet LLC, is also planning a pilot project at the United States Military Academy at West Point, at the Stanford SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, as well as two more projects in Florida. Meanwhile 70-person automated vehicles will operate in Greenville, South Carolina and Seattle, Washington. Comet's ultimate goal is to have the pilots running in 30 states, but said that some areas are not yet ready to announce their plans. As well as the US, the UK will also be trialing the vehicles in Greenwich as part of the $9 million project called Gateway, shuttling people to the O2 Arena. Clothier explained that the technology works in the same way as Google's driverless vehicles. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Corey Clothier, who is co-ordinating the trials told DailyMail.com that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots. 'Systems will fail, people's judgements will fail,' he said. 'If someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle, if it can't stop, it can't stop.' 'It's interesting to see people's reactions', said Clothier. 'Very few are nervous, or noticeably nervous. 'Most of them are curious, excited intrigued and many of them are very comfortable – or they soon get comfortable.' 'We've had interesting reactions from non-riders too. We were in the Silicon Valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen.' 'The vehicles stopped. We've never had an accident.' A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars. Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly. However, many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans. Software that guide and control the cars will have to be written with a high degree of accuracy and contain fail-safes, while cars will need to be regularly maintained to ensure there are no faults. Google has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on 'defensive driving' styles. They have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles 'body language' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are. Passengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands. A combination of radar, lasers gives the car a 360-degree 'view', with sensors linked to computer software able to 'see' and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. 'It's interesting to see people's reactions', said Clothier. 'Very few are nervous, or noticeably nervous. 'Most of them are curious, excited intrigued and many of them are very comfortable – or they soon get comfortable.' 'We've had interesting reactions from non-riders too. We were in the Silicon Valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen.' 'The vehicles stopped. We've never had an accident.' But Clothier says that an accident is probably not far off. 'Systems will fail, people's judgements will fail. If someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle, if it can't stop, it can't stop.' 'It's important we figure out alleviate the problem, to keep moving forward'. Research shows human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars.

"Rachel Treweek, the Archdeacon of Hackney, will become the most senior woman bishop in the country . The House of Lords will get its first ever female bishop when Parliament returns after the election, it was announced today. Rachel Treweek, the Archdeacon of Hackney, will become the most senior woman bishop in the country after being named the next Bishop of Gloucester. While she is only the third woman to be made a bishop since the Church of England broke with centuries of tradition earlier this year, the Venerable Treweek will become the first to become a peer. The Church of England peers – known as 31 'Lords Spiritual' – which are usually decided on seniority but the Government has introduced new rules to fast-track women bishops into the Lords. The new bishop has been Archdeacon of Hackney in north east London since 2011. She was raised in Hertfordshire, studied linguistics at Reading University and worked as a speech and language therapist before entering the church. The 52-year-old – who is married to a priest-in-charge of two parishes in the City of London – then attended Oxford University's evangelical theological college Wycliffe Hall and was ordained in 1994. The Venerable Treweek today revealed she was 'surprised' at her appointment but said it was 'an immense joy and privilege'. She said: 'I have to admit, even a little daunted by the prospect, but my overwhelming feeling is one of excitement to be coming to join with others in sharing the love of Jesus Christ with the people of this diocese.' The appointment means she is the first woman to run a diocese and is one rank below an Archbishop. She said: 'I am looking forward to encouraging Christians to speak out with confidence about their faith and the good news that the Gospel brings. It will be my privilege to work with churches as we connect with people, wherever they are and whatever their concerns. 'My calling to the role of bishop has been shaped by human encounter. I believe profoundly that relationship is at the heart of who God is. I have been with people through the joys and pains of their lives and it is these experiences that I will reflect upon as I take up this new role.' The Venerable Treweek was a curate at St George and All Saints in Tufnell Park before becoming Vicar of St James the Less in Bethnal Green in 1999. She was appointed Archdeacon of Northolt in 2006. While Rachel Treweek will become only the third woman to be made a bishop since the Church of England broke with centuries of tradition earlier this year, she will become the first to be made a peer . Her formal enthronement as bishop of the diocese, home to 600,000 people and 305 parishes, will take place at Gloucester Cathedral later in the year. The appointment was welcomed throughout the Church. The Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, said: 'What fantastic news. Wow, how wonderful so soon after Bishop Libby. 'I'm thrilled for you, dear Rachel, and I'm thrilled for the Diocese of Gloucester, for the Church of England, for the Church of God and for all of us. Yippee.' And the Right Rev Lane said: 'I congratulate Rachel on her nomination as Bishop of Gloucester. She is an exceptional priest whose leadership is well proven. She is both genuinely caring and deeply insightful. 'Her experience as an Archdeacon, in General Synod, and the national church will equip her well for her future ministry. 'It has been an honour to serve alongside Rachel as Regional Representatives in the House of Bishops, and I rejoice that she takes her place there as of right. Rachel and Guy are in my prayers as they prepare for this exciting change in their lives.' The Bishop of London Richard Chartres, said: 'As Richard of Gloucester is reinterred, Rachel of Gloucester is revealed. Rachel has served her entire ministry in the Diocese of London, excelling wherever she has been.' He added: 'While we are very sorry to see her go, Gloucester has appointed someone with real quality and distinction. We look forward to continuing to support her in the years to come.'","Rachel Treweek will become the most senior woman bishop in the country .

"A Russian woman has been jailed after trying to hire a hitman to kill her daughter-in-law after she got fed up with her jokes. Tatiana Kudinova, 50, told police daughter-in-law Roxanne, 30, kept making fun of the fact that she was less well off, and decided she wanted her dead. However, the man Kudinova paid to kill Roxanne turned out to be an undercover police officer, and she was arrested. Murderous mother-in-law: Tatiana Kudinova, left, hired a hitman to kill her 30-year-old daughter-in-law Roxanne after she got tired of the latter making fun of her financial situation . Kudinova claims she fell out with her daughter-in-law after a party when the pair started arguing about who should pay for the food for the guests. After this, she says Roxanne kept making jokes about her being a 'skinflint mother-in-law', which irritated her so much she wanted her dead. Kudinova, from Rostov, southern Russia, then contacted a local criminal gang, offering them £1,200 to kill Roxanne. According to police, Kudinova told the gang; 'I don't care how she dies, I only want you to kill her' What she did not realise was that the man she paid a £600 deposit to was in fact an undercover policeman. Caught: The 'local criminal' Kudinova paid to kill her daughter-in-law was, in fact, an undercover police officer . Officers then devised an elaborate sting to catch Kudinova by faking Roxanne's death and taking photos of her 'corpse'. A police spokesman said: 'We needed to catch her in the act of paying for the murder and giving an advance payment was not enough. 'So we arranged for it to appear as though the daughter-in-law was dead, covered her in fake blood and took photos to convince the woman that the hit had taken place. 'She was arrested after handing over the rest of the money to one of of our undercover officers.\n\n . Appearing in court, the judge told her: 'You are an evil, callous woman who sought to destroy someone's life and ruin the happiness of your son. 'You did this because of a few jokes.' Kudinova was sentenced to nine years in prison.","Russian woman, 50, hired 'thugs' to kill daughter-in-law, 30 .

"The number of immigrants coming to Britain to work has fallen by 100,000 under the Coalition, new figures have revealed. Between 2010 and 2014 just over 600,000 foreigners came to work in the UK, down from 725,000 between 2005 and 2009 under Labour. The revelation, from the respected Oxford-based Migration Observatory, comes despite a recent surge in migration which has blown apart David Cameron's election pledge to slash the number of immigrants coming to Britain. Between 2010 and 2014 just over 600,000 foreigners came to work in the UK, down from 725,000 between 2005 and 2009 under Labour . Mr Cameron pledged to reduce net migration – the difference between people moving to Britain and those leaving each year – to less than 100,000 a year by 2015. But Britain's booming economy has seen a sharp increase in the number of migrants from the EU coming to work in Britain – with net migration surging to almost 300,000 according to the latest official figures. However, the Migration Observatory has revealed that taken across the five-year parliament there has been a 16 per cent fall in the number of foreign workers moving to the UK . Madeleine Sumption, director of the independent observatory, said the migrant workforce was 'considerably smaller' now than five years ago. The data, revealed in the FT this morning, also shows that since the coalition took office there has been a rise of 40 per cent in workers from recession-hit nations in the 'old EU', such as Italy, Spain and Portugal. However, at the same time there has been a 35 per cent fall in migrants from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004. There has also been a drop of more than a quarter in those arriving from beyond Europe. The observatory's data show that migrants' wages have risen on average by 17 per cent under the coalition, compared with the previous five years — a significantly higher wage boost than British workers have enjoyed. David Cameron pledged to reduce net migration – the difference between people moving to Britain and those leaving each year – to less than 100,000 a year by 2015 . London meanwhile has taken a much larger chunk of immigrants - in professions such as financial services, and away from lower-skilled roles elsewhere in the country. David Hanson, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said that while highly skilled foreign workers made positive contributions to the UK economy, there needed to be better training so that British workers could take on skilled roles. 'Labour has a strong plan to build the skills of the next generation.' But Ukip's Steven Woolfe said: 'There are now close to 2m EU workers in the UK, and their numbers have more than doubled since [the accession of eight eastern European countries in] 2004.'","Between 2010 and 2014  608,000 foreigners came to work in the UK .

"A woman who was caught on CCTV performing a sex act on a man in a lift has had her privacy complaint rejected by Ofcom after it was shown on television. The mother, who was drunk at the time, was seen in footage on Channel 4 show CCTV: Caught on Camera – Lift Watching, in a lift in a Southampton tower block. One clip showed, briefly, the complainant, Ms K, performing a sex act on a man. Show producers said she and the man's faces were heavily blurred and neither of them were named. A woman who was caught on CCTV performing a sex act on a man in a lift has had her privacy complaint rejected by Ofcom . The mother, who was drunk at the time, was seen in footage on Channel 4 show CCTV: Caught on Camera, in a lift in a Southampton tower block (stock image) But the woman, who later became pregnant, complained that her loved ones were still able to recognise her and she claimed the stress caused by her embarrassment had prompted a premature labour. However, regulator Ofcom has ruled that the public interest in anti-social behaviour outweighed her expectation of privacy. The programme began with an montage of clips taken from the CCTV footage. Accompanying footage of Ms K performing a sex act on a man in a lift., one CCTV operator said: 'Us humans, we are disgusting sometimes'. Further on in the programme, more CCTV footage of Ms K in the lift was shown. This part of the programme began with the CCTV operators discussing the drunken behaviour that they witnessed, particularly on Friday and Saturday night, when a second CCTV operator said: 'Every Friday night, there will be couples going out of the lift dressed up. 'And they will be coming home at some point. 'And they'll be coming home in a state, whether that's drunk, angry, cuddly, loving, sex. It, there is always some sort of state'. In response, Channel 4 said that this was not a private occasion, as it had occurred in a lift . CCTV footage of Ms K and a man entering a lift and then Ms K performing a sex act on him was shown. The CCTV operator then said that when people are having sex in a lift: 'they don't give a s**t about the camera, they don't care about the camera. He's got his leg up and he's as happy as Larry'. The CCTV footage then showed the man leaving the lift and fastening up his trousers. A third CCTV operator was shown at this point admitting that she herself had been caught having sex in public. The Ofcom ruling said: 'Ms K complained that her privacy was unwarrantably infringed in the programme as broadcast because CCTV footage of her engaged in sexual activity with a man in a lift was included in the programme without her consent. 'Ms K's face was obscured in the programme; however, she said that friends and family had recognised her from the footage and that the programme had negatively affected her social relationships and her employment prospects. She said that the stress of being recognised in the programme had caused her to go into premature labour. Ms K also said that at the time the CCTV footage was filmed, she had been very drunk and that she had not been 'at the best point in her life'. In response, Channel 4 said that from the outset of the CCTV: Caught on Camera series it paid careful attention to the issue of contributor privacy, but that this was not a private occasion, as it had occurred in a communal lift.","Clip aired on Channel 4 show CCTV: Caught on Camera – Lift Watching .

"A woman who accused Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of groping her breasts has been identified as a 22-year-old model who witnessed an orgy involving disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Weinstein, 63, was questioned by the NYPD this weekend over the alleged fondling of former beauty queen Ambra Battilana, who was identified by Page Six on Monday. The movie producer allegedly put his hand up the model's skirt and asked for a kiss at a business meeting on Friday, said the Post. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Battilana previously told Italian authorities about witnessing a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party.

In 2011, Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, reported that Miss Battilana  told police during interviews that she attended a party at Berlusconi's mansion when she was 19 where girls were performing stripteases and topless dancing after being paid to attend. The Manhattan District Attorney has yet to decide whether charges will be filed against Weinstein. The DA's office declined to comment to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Tuesday.

"A St. Patrick's day segment on a Chicago morning news station was turned upside down last week when a woman took a power tool to her crotch live on air. In a video of the segment aired on WGN-TV March 13, the host himself seems to have no clue what is about to unfold as he introduces Shana Vaughan-Gabor, a dancer with Cirque De La Femme -- a Chicago burlesque troupe. '[Shana] explained to me what exactly she's going to do,' the host says. 'I'm not entirely sure what it is but I know it involves a power tool.' News: A St. Patrick's day segment on a Chicago's WGN morning news station was turned upside down last week when a woman took a power tool to her crotch live on air . Within seconds, sparks are seen flying as Vaughan-Gabor stands en pointe and takes a power saw to a small, metal box that is fastened to her pelvic area. As musicians and children look on in the background, a WGN anchor is heard saying 'What? Oh no, stop! What is going on?' Vaughan-Gabor then climbs onto a chair and, upside down, she spreads her legs and continues to use the power saw. 'I've been waiting my whole life to meet a woman like this,' the host says. Burlesque: Sparks flew as Shana Vaughan-Gabor, a dancer with Cirque De La Femme -- a Chicago burlesque troupe, took a power saw to a small, metal box fastened to her pelvic area . Soon the camera briefly cuts to sports coverage before showing the host surrounded by a group of children in green St. Patrick's Day shirts. 'What did you guys think of the lady shooting sparks out of her midsection?' the host asked the children. The kids yelled 'mind blowing,' 'creepy,' and 'stinky.' Shortly after the segment aired, WGN news anchor Larry Potash took to Twitter to apologize on behalf of the station for, what he called, the 'unintentional porn.' Vaughan-Gabor uploaded a photograph of her shocking performance to her Instagram account noting that the station cut to hockey during her performance and urged the station to 'Save the children from boring!'

"Adam Joseph Barney admitted 'lashing out' at the baby girl because of his frustrations over the fact she wouldn't stop crying, the dirty living conditions and her siblings misbehaving . A man has admitted killing his girlfriend's 14-month-old baby daughter by punching her with 'everything he had' in the head and stomach. Adam Joseph Barney told investigators he was caring for Kenzie Rose La Buy when he became frustrated that she wouldn't stop crying. The 24-year-old was living with his girlfriend and her children at the Western Colony Inn in Ogden, Utah, at the time of the incident in late August last year, according to Deseret News. He had been looking after the the baby girl while her mother was at work when he lost his temper and repeatedly punched her. Barney gave the attack 'everything he had', he reportedly told detectives who testified in the case, but also claimed he did not kill her on purpose. According to the prosecution's case 'Barney admitted that due to his increased frustration over the dirty living conditions, the victim crying and other two children misbehaving, he lashed out at (the girl).' He reportedly left Kenzie lying on a bed while he cleaned up, then when he placed her in a buggy he noticed she seemed lethargic and was having trouble breathing. An autopsy concluded Kenzie died of blunt force trauma to the abdomen. She had for some time before Barney called 911. He pleaded guilty in 2nd District Court on Wednesday to aggravated murder, a first-degree crime. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors will not seek the death penalty and will recommend a sentence of 25 years to life with a possibility of parole, according to court documents. Barney will be sentenced on May 13. Kenzie's father, James La Buy, told reporters at a hearing last month that he would prefer to see Barney behind bars than on death row. 'I think (the death penalty) is an easy way out, to tell you the truth,' he said.","Adam Joseph Barney was caring for Kenzie Rose La Buy in Ogden, Utah .

"A 13-year-old girl who underwent gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs and barely being able to move her body has completed her first 5K race a year after the life-saving weight loss procedure. Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, who suffers from hypothalamic obesity, a condition that leaves her constantly hungry and unable to lose weight, weighed 203lbs in 2014 despite being only 4'7. After she was denied weight loss surgery by her health insurer because she was 'too young', her parents started an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $86,000 to cover the medical costs. 'I still really believe the surgery saved her life,' her 35-year-old mom Jenny Shapiro told People. 'I don't even know if we would be here. Seeing her do a 5K was just icing on the cake.' Scroll down for video . Making strides: Alexis Shapiro completed her first 5K race this month (pictured). Last year, the 13-year-old underwent gastric sleeve surgery to help her lose more than 50lbs . Last year, competing in a race would have been impossible for Alexis, who was almost always in pain because of her size. She began rapidly gaining weight after she sought treatment for her rare brain tumor in 2011; the surgery to remove the benign tumor caused damage to her hypothalamus and led to the development of hypothalamic obesity. After gaining 150lbs over the course of two years she developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems. Alexis had the life-saving surgery last March, but due to complications doctors were forced to perform a gastric sleeve surgery instead of the scheduled gastric bypass. Feeling better: Alexis, who suffers from hypothalamic obesity, a condition that leaves her constantly hungry and unable to lose weight, posed for the camera in a light pink crochet sweater last August . Puppy love: Alexis can be seen cuddling on the couch with her dog last month . She returned to school six months later after she lost more than 60lbs. But managing Alexis' weight is still a constant struggle. Her mom, who said 'hypothalamic obesity is a beast', admitted to the outlet that her daughter had since put eight to 10lbs back on her frame. Alexis continues to take steroids and growth hormones every day because her brain tumor surgery also left her with panhypopituitarism, a syndrome marked by decreased secretion of most pituitary hormones. Getting stronger: The teen was photographed working out in the gym last May . Vacation time: Alexis was all smiles during a trip to the beach . Although the treatments make her feel ill and cause her to miss school at least once a week, Alexis is happier than she has been in a long time. 'Alexis has a confidence about her that she didn’t have before,' Jenny said. 'She's gaining independence little by little and becoming her own person.' Jenny also noted that her daughter, who was once home-schooled, now has friends in her class. She maintained that, despite the ongoing complications Alexis is forced to deal with, the surgery was 'really good' for her. 'I'm baffled by how well she does, especially at her age,' Jenny said. 'She's such a tough girl.'","Alexis Shapiro was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and the treatment left her with a condition called hypothalamic obesity .

"Geelong football player Mathew Stokes has slammed Prime Minister Tony Abbott in an open letter for 'isolating' Indigenous Australians with his remark about the 'lifestyle choices' of remote communities. In his comment, published on his Victorian club's website on Friday morning, the 30-year-old  noted that while he did not think Mr Abbott was 'deliberately being racist', he believed that 'one comment from someone in such a powerful position can cause so much damage'. 'His words have isolated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders even more than they are already,' Stokes wrote. Geelong football player Mathew Stokes  slammed Tony Abbott for isolating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders 'even more than they are already' The letter comes after Mr Abbott voiced his support for the closure of over 100 remote Aboriginal communities across Western Australia earlier this month. 'It's the job of the taxpayer to provide reasonable services in a reasonable way, indeed to provide high quality services in a reasonable way,' he told ABC Radio in Kalgoorlie. 'What we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.' The comment sparked a furious response from the Labor Party, The Greens and Indigenous leaders such as Noel Pearson who branded it 'racist', disrespectful and 'ignorant'. His open letter was a response to the PM's remark that taxpayers shouldn't fund the 'lifestyle choices' of Australians living in remote communities . Mr Abbott was voicing his support for the closure of over 100 remote Aboriginal communities across Western Australia earlier this month . Stokes has now added his voice to the debate after being disappointed by discussions amongst his own teammates following the highly controversial remark. 'The comments from my circle of mates ranged from ignorance, misinformed and that old Australian way of using humour to get away with some pretty offensive statements,' Stokes wrote. 'I thought to myself at the time, if that is coming from the mouths of my mates – many who are educated and have some understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues - imagine the conversations going on at smoko all over the country!' 'So my open letter today is not about politics, or a commentary on what we as a country do right or wrong. It's not about past decisions made, dollars spent or programs funded. It's about the damage caused by one single statement. It's about the disharmony that can come from one man's words.' He went on to question how the comment would reflect back on Australia, saying 'for him to make the remarks he did, as the leader of our country – what must the world think of us?' Stokes also reflected on his own experience of growing up as an Indigenous Australian, admitting that while he had not been on the receiving end of much racism, he empathised with those who had . Stokes reflected on his own experience of growing up as an Aboriginal Australian, admitting that while he had not been on the receiving end of much racism, he empathised with those who have been. 'We have such a divide from our First Australians and comments like this have ability to drive us further apart. 'I am a strong supporter of the work being done to close the health gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous Australians and there is much great work being done, but comments like those made recently by our PM only serve to empower the ugly side of our society.'

"Labour rounded on more than 100 of Britain's top business leaders today after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. But Ed Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Scroll down for video . Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa, (middle row)  and LK Bennett, (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland . David Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a 'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.' Mr Umunna went further dismissed it as a 'letter organised by the Conservative Party in a Conservative-supporting newspaper' after it was first published in the Daily Telegraph. But Mr Cameron, touring Marston's brewery in the Wolverhampton today, said the letter from business leaders was 'very powerful'. David Cameron and George Osborne visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton today on the second full day of the general election campaign . Mr Cameron said the letter from business leaders was 'very powerful' while the Chancellor claimed it was 'unprecedented' Tory officials said the number of signatories to the open letter (above) made it 'unprecedented' in the history of British general elections . He said: 'Today it is an unprecedented intervention by some of the business leaders in the best-known business, large and small, in our country saying the Conservative long-term plan is working, generating jobs. 'That is a very clear message from business leaders who, like me, care about jobs and wealth creation and prosperity and livelihoods in our country.' Chancellor George Osborne added: 'The warning from Britain's business leaders couldn't be clearer: a change of course will threaten jobs, deter investment, send a negative signal about our country and put the recovery at risk.' Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the letter was a tribute to the work of the Coalition government, and claimed an outright Tory win would ‘pose a very real threat’ to Britain’s stability. The Lib Dem leader said yesterday: ‘I read the letter carefully, it talks about what this coalition government has done, and I think the signatories to the letter are completely right in saying that about the last thing that this country needs, now that we’re emerging from this long shadow of the economic crash in 2008, is a great lurch in one direction or another.' However, the Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the signatories were 'not exactly representative' of the business community and should 'be careful what they wish for', accusing some of signing up 'naively' to a Tory stunt. The business leaders were particularly positive about Mr Osborne's strategy of seeking to encourage investment by slashing corporation tax, which fell to 20 per cent this week, having stood at 28 per cent when the Government came to power in 2010. 'David Cameron and George Osborne's flagship policy of progressively lowering corporation tax to 20 per cent has been very important in showing the UK is open for business. It has been a key part of their economic plan,' the business leaders said in the letter. 'The result is that Britain grew faster than any other major economy last year and businesses like ours have created over 1.85million new jobs.' The list of signatories includes senior executives of nine FTSE 100 companies. It includes senior figures such as Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg. The list includes five signatories who previously supported New Labour including Sir Charles Dunstone, chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk, who signed a letter backing the party before the 2005 election. Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne, who unveiled a 'seaside manifesto' with Gordon Brown before the 2010 general election, is also a signatory. Ed Miliband, speaking at engineering company David Brown Gear Systems in Huddersfield today, provoked another row with business by proposing further restrictions on zero-hours contracts . The Labour leader took a selfie taken with a worker as he arrives for a Q&A session at the factory in Huddersfield . Former Marks & Spencer chief Stuart Rose warned last night the Labour's plan to raise corporation tax would 'choke off the recovery'. Ed Balls yesterday confirmed Labour will raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years, despite warnings it could cost more than 100,000 jobs. The cash will be used to fund a £400 cut in business rates for smaller firms. But Lord Rose said: 'The more I hear from Labour, the more concerned I become. They don't get business. 'Labour talk a lot about spending money – but what about earning it? Ed Miliband and Ed Balls seem intent on pitting small businesses against large businesses, saddling the engine rooms of our country with higher corporation taxes and crippling entrepreneurs – all of which would choke off the recovery.' 1 Rooney Anand CEO, Greene King . 2 Surinder Arora MD, Arora International . 3 John Ayton Founder of Bremont Watches . 4 Alex Baldock CEO Shop Direct . 5 Lord Bamford Chairman, JCB . 6 Duncan Bannatyne Founder, Bannatyne Group . 7 Robert Bensoussan CEO, LK Bennett . 8 Lord Karan Bilimoria Chairman and founder, Cobra Beer . 9 Charlie Bradshaw MD, Matrix APA . 10 Baroness Brady Vicechairman, West Ham . 11 Graham Chipchase CEO, Rexam . 12 Zameer Choudrey CEO, Bestway Group . 13 Neil Clifford CEO, Kurt Geiger . 14 Steven Cohen CEO, Blue Inc. 15 Glenn Cooper MD, ATG Access . 16 Andrew Coppel CEO, De Vere . 17 Gerald Corbett Chairman, Britvic . 18 Peter Cullum Founder and Deputy Chairman, Towergate . 19 Ron Dennis Chairman, McLaren Technology . 20 Julietta Dexter Owner, Communications Store . 21 Annoushka Ducas Founder, Annoushka Jewellery . 22 Bob Dudley, CEO, BP . 23 Sir Charles Dunstone Chairman, Dixons Carphone . 24 John Elliott Chairman, Ebac . 25 Mark Esiri Director, notonthehighstreet.com . 26 Ralph Findlay CEO, Marstons . 27 Richard Glynn CEO, Ladbrokes . 28 Ben Gordon Chairman, Powerleague . 29 Julian Granville MD, Boden . 30 Peter Grauer Chairman, Bloomberg . 31 Philip Green Chairman, Carillion . 32 Michael Gutman President and COO, Westfield . 33 Wendy Hallet MD and Founder, Hallet Retail . 34 Jenny Halpern Prince Founder, Halpern . 35 Andy Harrison CEO, Whitbread . 36 Aidan Heavey CEO, Tullow Oil . 37 Oliver Hemsley founder and CEO, Numis . 38 Joe Henderson Founder and CEO, Henderson . 39 Vernon Hill Founder and chairman, Metro Bank . 40 Anya Hindmarch Chairman, Anya Hindmarch . 41 Brent Hoberman Founder, mydeco.com . 42 Cassie Hutchings CEO, GCH Capital . 43 Sir George Iacobescu Chairman and CEO, Canary Wharf . 44 Alan Jackson, Chairman, The Restaurant Group . 45 Peter Jackson, Former CEO, Travelex . 46 Nick Jenkins, Founder, Moonpig.com . 47 Neil Johnson, Chairman, E2V . 48 Luke Johnson, chairman, Risk Capital . 49 Richard Joseph, Co-founder, Joseph Joseph . 50 Ray Kelvin Founder and CEO, Ted Baker . 51 Nadir Lalani Founder and CEO, 99p Stores . 52 Ben Latham Jones Head of Ealing Studios . 53 Nick Leslau Chairman, Prestbury Investments . 54 Rhydian Lewis CEO, Ratesetter . 55 James Lipscombe MD and co-owner, The Chesterford . 56 Derek Lovelock, Chairman, Mamas and Papas . 57 Ron Mackintosh, Chairman, CSR . 58 Sir Cameron Mackintosh Founder, Cameron Mackintosh . 59 Edward Mellors, director, Mellors . 60 Tom Molnar CEO, Bread . 61 John Morgan, CEO, Morgan Sindall . 62 Matt Moulding, CEO, The Hut Group . 63 Stephen Murphy, Chairman, Wyevale Garden Centres . 64 Jonathan Neame CEO Shepherd Neame . 65 John Neill Chairman and CEO, Unipart . 66 Nick Newbury, CEO, Original Travel . 67 Jonathan Newhouse, Chairman & CEO, Conde Nast International . 68 Richard Nichols CEO, Instinctif Partners . 69 Mike Norris, CEO Computacenter . 71 Sir Dick Olver, Former chairman BAE Systems . 72 Alan Parker Chairman, Mothercare . 73 Tony Pidgley Chairman, Berkeley Group . 74 Thembalat Ramachandran, CEO&MD, Bristol Laboratories . 75 Nick Robertson Founder & CEO, ASOS . 76 Lord Rose Chairman, Ocado . 77 Richard Rose Executive chairman, Crawshaws . 78 Chrissie Rucker Founder, The White Company . 79 Sir Nigel Rudd, Chairman designate, Meggitt . 80 Rakesh Sharma CEO, Ultra Electronics . 81 Baroness Shields Chairman, Tech City . 82 Jasminder Singh Chairman and CEO, Edwardian Group . 83 Rob Templeman Chairman, RAC . 84 Tidjane Thiam, Group CEO, Prudential . 85 Sarah Thomson, Founder and CEO, Addictive Points . 86 Simon Townsend CEO, Enterprise Inns . 87 Michael Turner Chairman, Fullers, Smith & Turner . 88 Moni Varma, MD and Chairman, Veetee Rice . 89 Matthew Vaughn Owner, Marv Films . 90 Ollie Vigors, MD, Longshot Kids . 91 Robert Walker Chairman, Travis Perkins . 92 Malcolm Walker Founder, Iceland . 93 Paul Walsh Chairman, Compass . 94 James Wates Chairman, Wates . 95 George Weston CEO, Associated British Foods . 96 Nick Wheeler Founder, Charles Tyrwhitt . 97 Mike Wheeler MD, Auto Styling . 98 Charles Wigoder Executive chairman, Telecom Plus . 99 Paul Wilkinson Chairman,Thorntons . 100 Will Wyatt CEO, Caledonia Investments . 101 Sir Hossein Yassaie CEO, Imagination Technologies . 102 Steve Varley Chairman, UK&I, EY . 103 Richard Baker, Chairman, DFS .","Executives from companies with big brand names signed the open letter .

"A driver who accidentally killed his own step-sister during an illegal road race has been jailed for seven years. Aaron Bridgeman smashed into his step-sister Vicky, 40, after she was thrown off a motorbike she was riding and landed in the path of his car. Bridgeman, 35, who does not have a driving licence, could not stop his Peugeot in time and ran his step-sister over before she was hit by another car. Aaron Bridgeman (left) was jailed for seven years for accidentally killing his step-sister Vicky (right) during an illegal road race . Biker Jason Szalkowski, who also does not have a licence, was thrown from the motorcycle and left with brain damage after hitting floodwater on the lane near Caerphilly, south Wales. Bridgeman then fled the scene because he did not want to be caught driving a borrowed car without insurance. He pleaded guilty to driving without a licence and insurance, to fleeing the scene of a crime and of failing to report an accident. Bridgeman, from Caerphilly, was today jailed for seven years and banned from driving for six years. Bridgeman, from Caerphilly, was today jailed for seven years and banned from driving for six years . Sentencing him at Newport Crown Court, judge Daniel Willliams said: 'You never passed a driving test but that did not stop you from driving almost every day. 'You thought that the rules of the road did not apply to you. Your driving was terribly dangerous. 'Driving conditions that day were terribly hazardous but you knew that would make the race even better and you used that narrow lane as a race track. 'You were driving at a grossly excessive speed, driving the car at its limit to keep up with the motorbike. 'You drove into your sister - driving so close to the bike it could not be avoided. 'You took a cursory look at your sister and Mr Szalkowski and calmy drove off.' At a previous hearing, the court heard that Bridgeman was 'right behind' the motorcycle when his step-sister fell into the road. Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said: 'Bridgeman simply wasn't able to avoid his own step-sister as she went over the front of his car.' Bridgeman briefly stopped his car before fleeing the scene of the accident in December 2013, the court was told. Ms Bridgeman was riding on the back of Jason Szalkowski's (pictured) motorbike when it hit a puddle, flinging her off the bike and into the road . Mr Bennett added: 'He looked briefly at Jason Szalkowski, who he knew well, and at the body of his own step-sister. 'He then got promptly back into his car and drove off.' Ms Bridgeman was run over by another car as she lay in the road. The driver thought he had hit a sheep because of her white jumper. Mr Bennett said it was 'impossible' to say which impact killed Ms Bridgeman - also known as Claire - but that she died as a result of the race. Mr Szalkowski could have faced prosecution but it was decided it was 'not in the public interest' because he was so seriously injured.","Aaron Bridgeman killed his step-sister Vicky during an illegal road race .

"Friends say Pippa Middleton has decided against taking the full-time job in the U.S. It was billed as the dream job that would make Pippa Middleton a household name in America. But more than four months after the headline-grabbing announcement that she was to join the NBC network as a special correspondent in a £400,000 deal, she has yet to be seen on screen – and friends say she has decided against taking up a full-time job in the United States. The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister has shot a series of reports for the long-running Today show in rural Wyoming, but none has seen the light of day. And it was only when The Mail on Sunday asked why the footage had not been aired that a source close to Pippa explained that she was not ready to commit to the demands of a job in the US. The source said: ‘There were talks and Pippa did a test shoot which went really well. But for various reasons, a regular show with Pippa isn’t going to happen. Ultimately she didn’t want to commit herself to a big job in the US. She’s got a boyfriend in Geneva and her family in the UK. It was too much for her to pack up and leave them behind. ‘She will be working with the network on an ad hoc basis. ‘NBC were really pleased with the test shoot, but she is not going to be signing a major deal to be a special correspondent, which is what NBC wanted. It was Pippa’s decision not to go ahead. It’s not where she sees her future.’ One NBC insider said: ‘Pippa – or the lack of her – has been the talk of the company. Everyone is wondering what has happened to her? ‘There was all that fanfare when she went off to Wyoming, and the word then was that she would start doing segments as a roving reporter here and occasionally appear in the studio. But there’s been nothing but silence for months. It’s clear that someone has had reservations – but whether that’s from NBC’s side or her side, who knows? ‘It seems odd that they should make such a fuss of her and be so public and then go so silent. ‘Normally, after a big build-up like that, you’d get the talent on air fast and give her a big push. It doesn’t feel right at all.’ In Wyoming, Pippa donned tight jeans, a flannel shirt and cowboy boots to twirl on the dance floor of a Western bar, rode a horse in the shadow of the Teton mountains, and visited tourist sights in a cowboy town. Interviewees were told the story would air within about ten days of the shoot last November – but have been left disappointed. ‘We’re wondering what happened to the report,’ says Jim Waldrop, manager of the Wort Hotel in Jackson Hole, where Pippa filmed. ‘I contacted the producer, but they don’t have any information about when it might air.’ Scroll down for video . In Wyoming, Pippa donned tight jeans, a flannel shirt and cowboy boots to twirl on the dance floor of a Western bar (above) Angus Thuerman, former editor of the Jackson Hole News & Guide, added: ‘I was told it was like a pilot episode, an experiment to see how she did. She seemed quite at home, relaxed and enjoying herself.’ Novelist Nanci Turner Steveson, who attended Pippa’s filming session, says: ‘Pippa seemed tiny and sweet, but maybe a bit overwhelmed There were so many people there – two or three cameramen, producers, sound technicians and bodyguards, all on a fairly small dance floor, dancing to the band One Ton Pig. A cowboy taught her to dance a two-step and she picked it up pretty quickly. But NBC seemed to be making a lot of fuss over a very small story.’ Chris Koch, 66, a regular at the Silver Dollar bar, said: ‘I was asked by NBC if I’d be filmed dancing with Pippa Middleton. I had no idea who she is. My daughter told me, “She’s Kate Middleton’s sister!” and I said: “Who’s she?” I don’t know what happened to the Today story, and I don’t much care – I don’t have a TV.’ Pippa’s NBC deal was initially touted as ‘provisional’, although the network has a history of signing those related to the great and the good. Other NBC correspondents have included Sarah Ferguson, Bill Clinton’s daughter Chelsea, and Princess Diana’s brother Charles Spencer. The abortive American TV career is another false start for Pippa, after her party-planning book Celebrate and column for the Daily Telegraph both flopped.","Four months ago it was announced Pippa Middleton would join NBC .

"Two schoolboys were forced to fight and perform sex acts on each other by a teenager, pictured is a black male wanted in connection with the incident . Two schoolboys were forced to shoplift, fight and perform sex acts on each other by a teenager who made them get off a bus by claiming to have a knife, police said. The two boys, aged under 16, were approached by an unidentified male teenager on the top deck of a bus departing from  Brixton, London, just before 8pm yesterday. He forced the pair off the route 133 bus in Elephant and Castle after claiming he had a knife and led them to a park in Newington Butts, where he made them steal from a nearby shop and fight each other. The pair where then taken to the stairwell of a block of flats in Walworth, where police said he forced one of the boys to perform a sex act on another before walking away in an unknown direction. Scotland Yard has  released a CCTV image of a black teenager wanted in connection with the incident. He was seen wearing a dark blue or black Nike hoodie. Trainee Detective Constable Amy Beautridge said: 'This was a most unusual crime and distressing crime, during which the two young victims were terrified by threats made by the suspect, who intimated he was in possession of a knife. 'He used their fear to control them and force them to effectively do as he said.' She added: 'Despite their young age, the victims have been incredibly brave in coming forward and providing information to the police and I would praise them for this.' 'I am very keen to identify and speak to the person in the CCTV image we have released today, and I would urge anyone who recognises him to call the police or Crimestoppers as soon as possible. 'I would also like to reassure anyone concerned about contacting the police that they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity.'

"Netflix has officially launched in Australia but it has been revealed the online streaming service's local offering carries  7,000 fewer titles than its U.S. version. Tech blogger Kenneth Tsang extracted all the movies and TV shows on offer in each country and put them in a spreadsheet, finding 1,116 titles in Australia compared with 8,499 in the U.S. A Netflix spokesman said the libraries vary from country to country, adding that they change every day. 'Our aim in Australia is not to replicate the American library,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Netflix has officially launched in Australia but its local offering carries 7,000 fewer titles than its U.S. version . 'As our library grows, we're collecting data and we can tailor our content as we spend more time in market because we understand what Australians are watching.' The spokesman added that content distribution deals prevented Netflix from carrying certain titles in Australia. 'That's purely down to distribution rights, many programs get snapped up by other services. 'Our goal is to work towards a global model, when that happens we will be negotiating rights on a global scale.' Mr Tsang also found that Netflix has 693 titles available only to Australian viewers. On Monday Netflix officially outlined its pricing scheme, and confirmed  House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black would be among its key TV shows on offer. The service launches on Tuesday charging $8.99 per month for a single screen (standard definition), $11.99 for two screens (high definition) and $14.99 for ultra definition on four screens.

Around one in five are willing to pay up to $20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see. But this could change in future, with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young Australians are already utilising online streaming services like Stan, Presto, Quickflix and Netflix.

"Dolce & Gabbana have come under fire again, this time for an ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman. Just days after designers Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce called children born through IVF 'synthetic,' critics of the brand have publicized the brand's highly controversial Spring/Summer 2007 campaign ad that showed a woman being restrained by a bare-chested man as a group of men in various states of undress look on. The advertisement was banned from being used in Italian publications after it ran several times when it was determined that it 'offended the dignity of the woman,' and pulled in the United States after running just once in an issue of Esquire. When the ad was first pulled in Spain, the design duo referred to the people of that country as 'a bit backward.' Scroll down for video . Dolce & Gabbana have come under fire again, this time for a 2007 ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman who is being restrained as a group of men look on (above) The duo also depicted a group sex scene featuring all men in another ad that was slightly more graphic, though the man was not being restrained (above) An ad from the same campaign shot that featured the men dressed and in which the woman was not restrained did run in magazines (above) Publicist Kelly Cutrone posted the ad to her Twitter account on Sunday, writing; 'I GUESS SIMULATING GANG BANGS ARE FINE - BUT IVF AND SAME SEX MARRIAGE ARE NOT - LIFE ACCORDING TO @dolcegabbana.' The ad actually features one of Cutrone's former costars on the MTV reality series The City, model Adam Senn. The duo also depicted a group sex scene featuring all men in another ad that was slightly more graphic, though the man, unlike the woman, was not being restrained. Dolce said in the most recent issue of Panoroma magazine; 'You are born and you have a father and a mother. At least it should be like that. 'That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies. 'They are wombs for hire, semen chosen from a catalogue. And then you have to explain to these children who their mother is.' This after the men chose motherhood as the theme of their Fall/Winter 2015 fashion show held earlier this month in Milan. Parents of IVF babies, among them Elton John, Al Roker, and Ricky Martin, came out against the two following these statements, as did celebrities including Victoria Beckham and Courtney Love. Kelly Cutrone (left) posted the old ad on her Twitter, attacking Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce (right) John wrote on Instagram following then incident; 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as ""synthetic"". And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again.' Now many have publicly declared they will boycott the duo's designs. Dolce and Gabbana meanwhile have said their statements were taken out of context, with Dolce saying; 'I am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one I've known.'","Dolce & Gabbana have come under fire  for a 2007 ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman who is being restrained as a group of men look on .

"A girl of seven was secretly bitten by a tour guide in Thailand when she refused to let him kiss her. The girl's mother is suing her travel agency in China over the attack, which occurred during a six-day trip to Thailand that was a reward for the girl's good grades in school. Chen Ting, 36, said daughter Chen Yin had seemed unusually quiet during the trip, and on the final day as they waited at the airport before flying home, the girl began crying and complaining that her arm and stomach were hurting. Injury: The girl's mother holds up a picture of the alleged bitemark on her daughter's arm . Mrs Chen then found bite marks on her daughter, and discovered that Chinese tour guide Zhou Fang was allegedly responsible. 'At the time I clearly saw some teeth marks on my daughter's left arm, the skin in the area was abraded, the same with her belly,' she told People's Daily Online. When Ms Chen complained to the guide, she claimed he refused to apologise and simply walked away. Once she returned to China she complained to the travel agency, and an investigation in Thailand allegedly found that another tourist saw the the guide ask the little girl for a kiss. In her complaint letter, the mother said: 'When I saw my daughter in tears and listened to her story, I checked and found obvious bite marks in places where she couldn't have done it herself. 'She said the guide had bitten her after telling her: ""You are very pretty. You're leaving soon and it's hard to see you go. Come here and let me give you a kiss"".' When she refused, he had grabbed her anyway and then bit her on the stomach. She managed to break free and run behind some luggage where he grabbed her again, and this time bit her on the arm. The girl's mother has had her daughter tested in case she was infected with any diseases by the bites . Other passengers questioned in the investigation confirmed that they had often seen the guide pestering little girl when he thought her mother was not looking. She added: 'I was particularly worried that he might have some disease and my kid would be infected. 'My child is introvert. She has hidden in her bed and cried [because of the bites].' She added that the girl even said she regretted getting good grades at school – because without them she would not have gone on the trip and met the man. The daughter also mentioned she 'never wanted to travel with groups anymore.' Chen has now taken the local Chongqing travel agency to court where the agency confirmed that the guide been fired, but they said they were powerless to force him to take a medical test to prove he did not have any diseases.","Chinese girl was on trip as a reward for good grades at school .

"Savers should be stopped from cashing in their pensions until the age of 60 to prevent them running out of money, MPs have warned. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee warned that rules allowing people to dip into their pensions from the age of 55 could create 'unrealistic expectations' about the age at which they can afford to stop work. Reforms of pensions, which take effect next month, give savers discretion over their pensions from the age of 55, rising to 57 in 2028. Government officials warn that allowing people to start dipping into their pension by the time they reach 55 will create unrealistic impressions about when they can afford to stop working . But the committee recommended that access to retirement funds should only be granted 'five years before the state pension age'. Under the proposals, men would not be allowed to withdraw their cash until they were 60, while women would have to wait until they were 57. Dame Anne Begg, the Labour chairman of the committee, said savers would waste the tax breaks provided by the Government unless they were forced to wait until their 60s. She said: 'Our view is that, given the significant tax relief provided to pensions, increased longevity, and the importance of ensuring people do not underestimate the income needed in retirement, the minimum age at which people can access their pension saving, except on ill health grounds, should rise to five years below the state pension age.' In the report, MPs warned that the Government needs to establish a powerful new pensions watchdog to ensure people are not ripped off when they come to access their retirement savings. The Ccommittee said moves by the coalition to relax the rules on pensions meant it was more important than ever that proper protections were in place. It was scathing about the pensions industry saying it had a 'poor record' when it came to acting in the best interests of savers and needed to rebuild the trust with the public. Dame Anne Begg said savers would waste tax breaks provided by the Government unless they were forced to wait until their 60s . As a result of reforms announced by Chancellor George Osborne in his last Budget, from next month savers will no longer be required to buy an annuity - providing a regular annual income - when they cash in their pension pot. The committee said that while the measure had the potential to encourage more retirement saving by making it more attractive, there were also dangers involved. 'There are also significant risks for individuals from the new freedoms,' it said. 'These include: failing to make provision for the whole period of retirement or making decisions resulting in insufficient income in retirement; and exposure to fraudulent, mis-sold or detrimental financial products.' It said that it was 'questionable' whether Government plans to establish a guidance service, known as Pension Wise, were sufficient to offset the potential risks - particularly given the low level of understanding of pension products which had, in turn, given rise to a lack of trust in the industry. 'This lack of trust has been exacerbated by the pensions industry's poor record on acting in savers' best interests when they access their pension pots, particularly in relation to annuities,' the report said. 'Savers have previously suffered detriment because some providers did not do enough to ensure that they purchased the right annuity product from the right company. This is unacceptable. 'Pension providers need to do more to save consumers from taking poor decisions, by focusing on consumers' best interests rather than their own.' The committee expressed concern about the ability of the Financial Conduct Authority to regulate pensions effectively, after it was told by one FCA witness that they cannot 'stop fools acting like fools'. It said that the creation of single regulator specifically for pensions, would ensure that it had a 'clear focus' on the whole retirement saving process. 'The case for taking this step is even stronger now, given the greater risks to savers from fraud, and detrimental financial products, which accompany the undoubted advantages of the new flexibilities,' it said. 'Savers would have clarity on who was responsible for providing guidance and redress, and employers and the pensions industry would have a single body to advise and supervise them.' The committee chair, Dame Anne Begg said: 'Savers need to be properly protected from being ripped off in frauds or scams, or suffering financial loss from making the wrong decision about how to use their pension pots. 'The scale and pace of recent changes in pensions policy have completely changed the retirement saving landscape. It is necessary to draw breath and review the extent of the changes and their implications.'","From next month savers will be given control over pension from age 55 .

"Dozens of hardline Labour MPs will work with the SNP to hold Ed Miliband to ransom and stop him making any cuts to public spending, it was claimed today. The left-wingers have pledged to vote against any Budget that includes austerity measures to tackle the deficit. John McDonnell, chair of the Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs, said ‘a bloc of 30-40 left MPs’ in Labour will ensure Mr Miliband will not be able to ‘ignore’ their demands. Scroll down for video . Former First Minister Alex Salmond - who is standing for the SNP in Gordon, was out campaigning today . Mr Salmond has boasted that the SNP will hold the balance of power in the Commons after the next election . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has said that she has already been in contact with MPs on the left of the Labour Party to plot how they could work together. Former First Minister Alex Salmond, meanwhile, has boasted that the SNP will hold the balance of power in the Commons after the next election and will be able to force Labour to increase spending, borrowing and debt. Mr McDonnell has held talks with Mr Miliband and said he has already ‘moved the party on to our agenda’. In a recent meeting, he told Mr Miliband that any government he leads could be ‘the most radical’ and ‘perhaps more radical’ since Clement Attlee. He claimed Mr Miliband had agreed. Mr McDonnell said that if Labour falls short of a majority it would have to abandon its pledge to impose spending cuts because of the pressure from left in the party. Ed Miliband will struggle to stop dozens of hardline Labour MPs from working with the SNP to stop cuts to public spending, it was claimed today . He told the New Statesman: ‘The first row will be around austerity unless we get this right... I think it will change, inevitably it will change. ‘I think it will be clear from pressure coming back from constituencies and individual MPs that we need a Labour government quickly making a change.’ Mr McDonnell said there has already been ‘a shift in terms of the Labour leadership’s thinking and even in terms of Ed Balls’s thinking’. He added: ‘You’ve got to offer an alternative. You can’t come in with austerity-lite, it won’t work. John McDonnell said ‘a bloc of 30-40 left MPs’ in Labour will ensure Mr Miliband will not be able to ‘ignore’ the hard-left in the party after the election . ‘Coming in with arguments that you’re going to cut services, not necessarily as much as the Tories, but you will still be cutting services, I think that argument is beginning to creak, I think that argument is beginning to fade. ‘Increasingly now, the Labour leadership has recognised that, actually, you can tackle the deficit over a longer period of time, that way you avoid any cuts whatsoever.’ Mr McDonnell said that a ‘large number’ of Labour’s candidates for the General Election were on the left and could help vote against the renewal of Trident. He added that he is ‘more optimistic now about the role of the left in the Labour Party than at any time in the last 20 years’. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘This is the true face of Ed Miliband’s Labour Party: they’re addicted to more wasteful spending and more taxes. 'If Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister he’ll be carried there by Alex Salmond, bankrolled by Len McCluskey and pushed around by his own backbenchers. It would cause chaos for Britain.’ Mr Miliband has ruled out the possibility of going into a formal coalition with the SNP, but the two parties could agree a post-election deal. Labour peer Baroness Prosser today said that the two parties could work together on an issue by issue basis. She told the BBC’s Daily Politics: ‘I think that is just how pragmatic politics works.’ On Sunday, Miss Sturgeon said the SNP could be in a 'very powerful position' at Westminster after the election.

In 2010, he announced his intention to stand for the party leadership following the resignation of Gordon Brown, but later decided instead to back Miss Abbott’s unsuccessful leadership bid.

Mr McDonnell, who left school at 17, served as a National Union of Miners and TUC official, before being elected to the Greater London Council in 1981, where he served as Ken Livingstone’s deputy. In November last year he was criticised after he joked about how people in Tory minister Esther McVey’s Wirral West constituency had asked why they were not ‘lynching the b******’.","Left-wing MPs pledge to vote against any Budget that includes austerity .

Worse still, temperatures seem unlikely to increase above 13c although the Met Office said that rain should clear in the early afternoon leaving a mix of sunny spells and blustery showers. The change meant the nation lost an hour's sleep, but it marks the start of the evenings getting longer. Scroll down for video . Clocks went forward one hour overnight marking the start of British Summer Time . Bury's crunch League 2 with Southend only featured six-minutes' play due to a torrential downpour . The referee was forced to abandon the game due to a waterlogged pitch after calling the players inside . Parts of the pitch had large standing pools of water which made it too dangerous to continue . Bury's crunch League Two fixture with Southend was abandoned after just six minutes when the referee Tony Harrington decided the pitch was waterlogged. Mr Harrington led the players inside but soon called off the game when the conditions worsened considerably. Forecaster Nicola Willis said: 'Sunday's rain will clear away overnight and we will see clearer conditions and a north westerly breeze and continuing into Monday. 'But further south we will see another band of rain pushing west to east during Monday, with rain coming in from the west.' The rain could turn to sleet and even snow on higher ground. She said that rain will hit all parts of Britain tomorrow, starting in Northern Ireland, Wales and the south west of England, moving eastwards. There will also be 20mph winds with gusts of up to 55mph. The bad weather is expected to continue on Monday with further rain arriving from the west. Although some sunny intervals should break through on Tuesday and Wednesday. Luckily, for many people, their smartphones and computers automatically update the time, but many watches, cars, cookers and traditional clocks have to be changed manually. Despite the start of British Summer Time, the first three days look particularly grim with rain and strong winds .

"David Cameron's former 'back to work tsar' Emma Harrison founded the company A4e . Ten workers at a controversial company used by the Government to get people off benefits forged signatures in a £300,000 fake jobs fraud, a court heard today. The group were employed by the  firm A4e which was paid millions of pounds to help people from difficult backgrounds get a job. The company was founded by David Cameron's former 'back to work Tsar' Emma Harrison, who was forced to step down from her role after fraud allegations first came to light in 2012. During a 13-week trial at Reading Crown Court it emerged that 10 staff at the company falsely claimed they had helped people find jobs to hit bonus targets. Some even falsified files using the names of family members, while others offered bribes in the form of vouchers to get people to fill out false forms. Four defendants were convicted in connection with the fraud after six of their colleagues had previously pleaded guilty. Ines Cano-Uribe, 39, of Madrid, Spain, was found guilty of two counts of forgery, while Zabar Khalil, 35, Matthew Hannigan-Train, 31 and Hayley Wilson, 27, were each found guilty of one count of forgery. Summing up for the prosecution, Sarah Wood said that between them they had created 167 false claims, a fraud which cost the Department for Work and Pensions - which contracted A4e to carry out the work - around £300,000. The court heard that A4e ran the Aspire to Inspire lone parent mentoring programme between 2008 and 2011. The contract covered Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire and was funded by the European Social Fund. A4e was paid £1.3million for the contract and £10,500 a month to implement it. The company received payments for each person it helped gain employment. The court heard that while A4e helped 558 people find jobs, staff lied about others. Ms Wood said: 'The total amount of fraudulent claiming was 167 files, for a total loss of £288,595.' During the period one of the workers falsified a 'successful job' in her nephew's name and another supposedly for her husband. Another worker bribed a man with £150 of vouchers to sign forms saying he had been through A4e training. Ten workers at the firm A4e - which was employed by the Government to get people off benefits - are being sentenced for ripping off taxpayers in a £300,000 fraud . The crimes came to light when an employee at A4e blew the whistle on the scam. A4e was founded in 1991 by Emma Harrison, who was later appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron as the Government's 'families champion', an advisory role on troubled homes. The firm signed the £1.3 million, three-year Inspire to Aspire contract in August 2008. The sentencing, before Judge Angela Morris, at Reading Crown Court, continues.","Group employed by the back-to-work private contractor A4e .

"High social status has its privileges - even in wild animals. Researchers studying spotted hyenas in Kenya found that high-ranking members of a clan live longer, are healthier and even have more offspring. The discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres - caps at the end of each strand of DNA - regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species, including humans. Researchers studied the status and health of spotted hyenas in Kenya (stock image). They found high-ranking members of groups live longer and are healthier and these alpha females were also found to have more offspring. The discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres . Nora Lewin from Michigan State Univerity's zoology department  said: 'If you want to see the hierarchy of spotted hyenas, throw down some fresh meat near them. 'It's quickly apparent who's dominant and who's not.' But she wanted to know if these long-accepted biological markers would support what she was seeing in the field. Ms Lewin worked with fellow lead author and MSU zoologist Kay Holekamp to study more than 25 years of data on hyenas across the African country. Telomeres are caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect chromosomes from deterioration. These biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species, including humans. Shrinking telomeres are a signal that cells are sliding into 'defensive mode', stressful actions that could soon lead to cells' - and to the person or animal's - death. High-ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers. In young humans, telomeres are about 8,000-10,000 nucleotides long. They shorten with each cell division, however, and when they reach a critical length the cell stops dividing or dies. This internal 'clock' makes it difficult to keep most cells growing in a laboratory for more than a few cell doublings. She also spent a summer in Kenya observing hyenas' social structure. The team of researchers focused on telomeres, caps that protect chromosomes from deterioration. These biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species, including humans. Shrinking telomeres are a signal that cells are sliding into 'defensive mode', stressful actions that could lead to cells' - and to the person or animal's - death. High-ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers suggesting they were healthier. Group membership significantly predicted telomere length of those female hyenas that sat at the top of the social hierarchy. But Ms Lewin also noted a couple of interesting twists. The alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres. However, the length was relative to each individual clan. This meant that if researchers found a lone hyena wandering the savanna they couldn't simply identify it as an alpha female based solely on telomere length. Also the team was able to rule other factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food - which could be linked to better overall health. Telomeres are caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect chromosomes from deterioration. These biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress. High-ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers and clan membership predicted telomere length of those that sat at the top of the hierarchy . Although the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres, the length was relative to each individual clan so telomeres couldn't be used to identify leaders when on their own. The team was able to rule out factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food . Its research found no correlation between the amount of food and the size of the biological marker. 'This work shows, for the first time, the effects of social rank on telomere length in wild mammals,' Ms Lewin said. 'This enhances our understanding of how social and ecological variables may contribute to age-related declines of hyenas, and in organisms in general.' 'The fact that there is variation in telomere length when prey abundance is constant means that there are other factors we need to find. 'We think it's less about genetics and more influenced by the environment, but we just need to keep searching for the right environmental factors.' The results are published in the journal of Biology Letters.","Researchers studied the status and health of spotted hyenas in Kenya .

"A drug addict who mugged frail pensioner Alan Barnes wept today as he heard lawyers will argue his attack was a 'hate crime'. Prosecutors say Richard Gatiss deliberately targeted his 4ft 6in, visually-impaired 67-year-old victim out of hostility towards the disabled. The cowardly attack on Mr Barnes, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, shocked Britain in January and a fundraising campaign to buy him a new home made £330,000 in just a few days. Alan Barnes - who suffers growth problems and is partially sighted - was attacked by drug addict Richard Gatiss (right) in January. Prosecutors today called for the offence to be categorised as a disability hate crime . Gatiss, 25, also of Gateshead, appeared briefly at Newcastle Crown Court via a videolink from Durham Prison today, where he is being kept in segregation for his own safety. He will be sentenced on April 2. The mugger sat hunched in his chair today as he followed proceedings and broke down in tears at one point. Nick Dry, prosecuting, said Gatiss struck in an area of sheltered accommodation for disabled and elderly people. He also made a partial admission to police that he knew of Mr Barnes prior to the attack. The court heard that, in Mr Barnes's opinion, he was attacked due to his disability. Mr Dry said if it was agreed that Gatiss specifically targeted Mr Barnes 'it can be inferred there is a general hostility towards people of disability'. That could mean Gatiss was guilty of a disability hate crime, which would aggravate the assault with intent to rob charge that he admitted last month. Mr Dry added: 'It is pure inference that is sought by the crown.' The attack on Mr Barnes sparked outrage around Britain and led to his neighbour, beautician Katie Cutler, organising a fund to help the 67-year-old . Donations flooded in from around the world and saw Mr Barnes given £330,000 to buy him a new home . But Judge Paul Sloan QC suggested the claim of a general hostility towards disabled people was 'hollow' and told the court the aggravating circumstances would be factored into the sentencing anyway. He said the prosecution must serve evidence to back up their claims within a week. Judge Sloan told Gatiss at the end of the 10-minute hearing he would continue to be remanded in custody and 'an immediate sentence of imprisonment is pretty well inevitable'. It has previously been said in court that Gatiss was trying to get money to buy legal highs when he mugged Mr Barnes. His victim was shoved over and broke his collar bone but Gatiss fled empty-handed when Mr Barnes called for help.","Disabled pensioner's mugging shocked Britain when it emerged in January .

"Whether it was a Druid temple, an astronomical calendar or a centre for healing, the mystery of Stonehenge has sparked endless debate over the centuries. Now a dramatic new theory suggests that the prehistoric stone circle monument was in fact 'an ancient Mecca on stilts'. The megaliths would not have been used for ceremonies at ground level, but would instead have supported a wooden platform on which ceremonies were performed to the rotating heavens, according to new research. Scroll down for video . Historian Julian Spalding has provided a new theory on Stonehenge. He says the stones were pillars used to support a raised platform during ceremonies. As shown in this illustration, steps or a ramp would have led to the top of the platform, where figures of importance would have stood, perhaps addressing a crowd below . Julian Spalding, former director of some of the UK's leading museums, argues that the stones were foundations for a vast platform, long since lost - 'a great altar' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers. 'It's a totally different theory which has never been put forward before,' he said. 'All the interpretations to date could be mistaken. We've been looking at Stonehenge the wrong way, from the earth, which is very much a 20th-century viewpoint. We haven't been thinking about what they were thinking about.' Part of his evidence lies in ancient civilisations worldwide. As far afield as China, Peru and Turkey, such sacred monuments were built high up, whether on manmade or natural sites, and with circular patterns possibly linked to celestial movements. 'In early times, no spiritual ceremonies would have been performed on the ground,' said Mr Spalding. No-one is exactly sure why - and how - Stonehenge was built more than 4,000 years ago. Experts have suggested it was a temple, parliament and a graveyard. Some people think the stones have healing powers, while others think they have musical properties when struck with a stone. They could have acted as a giant musical instrument to call ancient people to the monument. What is clear, is that the stones were aligned with phases of the sun. People were buried there and skeletal evidence shows that people travelled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge - for whatever reason. Experts think that the route was a busy one and that Stonehenge could be viewed differently from different positions. It seems that instead of being a complete barrier, the Curcus acted as a gateway to guide visitors to the stone circle. 'The Pharaoh of Egypt and the Emperor of China were always carried - as the Pope used to be… The feet of holy people were not allowed to touch the ground. We've been looking at Stonehenge from a modern, earth-bound perspective. 'All the great raised altars of the past suggest that the people who built Stonehenge would never have performed celestial ceremonies on the lowly earth… That would have been unimaginably insulting to the immortal beings, for it would have brought them down from heaven to bite the dust and tread in the dung.' However, he says the wood that would have been used for the platform has long since rotted away, leaving only the stone pillars that support it behind. Mr Spalding's museum directorships include Glasgow, which boasts world-class archaeological collections within a complex of institutions that exceed the British Museum in size. Today, he published his theories in a new book, titled Realisation: From Seeing to Understanding - The Origins of Art, published by Wilmington Square Books. It explores our ancestors' understanding of the world, offering new explanations of iconic works of art and monuments. Shown is an illustration of a Druid ceremony at Stonehenge more than 4,000 years ago. This depiction does not take the new wooden platform theory into account . Stonehenge, built in stages between 3000 and 2000 BC, is England's most famous prehistoric monument, a Unesco World Heritage site on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire that draws more than one million annual visitors. It began as a timber circle, later made permanent with massive blocks of stone, many somehow dragged from dolerite rock in the Welsh mountains. Dolerite has a bluish tinge and is dappled with white spots that look like stars, according to Mr Spalding. 'These megaliths, weighing between two and four tons each, were transported 250 miles [400km], an extraordinary achievement in those times, which indicates that building Stonehenge was a massive communal enterprise,' he said. Sacred circle: Julian Spalding, former director of some of the UK's leading museums, argues that the stones (aerial view shown) were foundations for a vast platform, long since lost - 'a great altar' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers . Mystery: Previously it had been thought the arrangement of the stones was solely to align with the sun (shown), but Mr Spalding's new theory suggests they had another purpose as well . He believes that ancient worshippers would have reached the giant altar by climbing curved wooden ramps or staircases, moving in the direction of the slowly circulating stars for ceremonies dedicated to, for example, a dead king's soul or midsummer and solstice celebrations. His theories have been shaped by visits to ancient sites like the stone circles of Göbekli Tepe in southern Turkey, reminiscent of Stonehenge but predating it by around 6,000 years. Only a fraction of the site has been excavated, and the purpose of its T-shaped pillars is a mystery, Spalding said: 'These must have supported some sort of raised platform.' He also points to the Nazca Lines in Peru, vast drawings apparently etched into Earth's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived: 'They went up to the sacred place. These lines were a processional way, which followed the movement and shape of the stars. 'The great mystery of early man was that we all thought the world was flat. Everyone did until very recent times. All the major religious ceremonies, as the Haj still does in Mecca, always ends in a circular motion, going round and round, which imitates the stars.' Holy: 'All the major religious ceremonies, as the Haj still does in Mecca, always ends in a circular motion, going round and round, which imitates the stars,' said Mr Spalding. Shown is Mecca in Saudi Arabia during Laylat al-Qadr, on the 27th of Ramadan, one of the holiest nights of the Islamic calendar . Professor Vincent Gaffney, principal investigator on the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project at Bradford University, responded with 'a fair degree of scepticism.' He said: 'At Stonehenge, there are other structures which are clearly designed to be viewed from the ground, along astronomic alignments, and you can see the sky from pretty much anywhere.' Sir Barry Cunliffe, a prehistorian and Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology, Oxford University, said: 'He could be right, but I know of no evidence to support it… There are a large number of stone circles around the country which clearly didn't have a platform on top. So why should Stonehenge?' But Aubrey Burl, an authority on prehistoric stone circles, said: 'There could be something in it. There is a possibility, of course. Anything new and worthwhile about Stonehenge is well worth looking into, but with care and consideration.' Mr Spalding also points to the Nazca Lines in Peru ('hands' design shown), vast drawings apparently etched into Earth's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived, as being similar in purpose to Stonehenge . Mr Spalding is fully expecting resistance from fellow academics. He draws parallels with the 1868 discovery of magnificent prehistoric ceiling paintings in the Altamira Cave in Spain, by a geologist and archaeologist. 'He went in there and looked on the ground - because he assumed all the evidence for early man would be on the ground,' he said. 'It never occurred to him to look up. It was his young daughter who said, papa look on the ceiling.' Experts at the time denounced those paintings as forgeries. It was not until the end of the 19th century that they were accepted as genuine.","Historian Julian Spalding has provided a new theory on Stonehenge .

"A father of a 12-year-old girl who he married off in an Islamic ceremony told his daughter that Australian laws forbidding her from marrying were 'stupid'. The father, who cannot be named legally, is on trial at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court charged with procuring a child for unlawful sexual activity and with being an accessory before the fact of sexual intercourse with a child. The girl told a Sydney court her father said Australian law was 'stupid' and girls her age should be allowed to get married and have sexual intercourse. Scroll down for video . A father of a 12-year-old girl who he married off in an Islamic ceremony told his daughter that Australian laws forbidding her from marrying were 'stupid' The girl's interview with a child protection worker was played as part of her father's trial. She said days after her wedding, her father began to panic that her husband might be jailed. 'He was upset because we might be in trouble,' the girl said. '(My father) knows no marriage under the age of 16. 'Because he says to me the law here is stupid, girls your age should be allowed to get married and have intercourse. 'He said we didn't do anything wrong, we were just following religion.' Her father said her husband, now 27, 'shouldn't be put away', and that they were 'just following religion'. The girl, now 14, said in her father's religion, marriage was allowed once the girl got her period and having sex before marriage was punishable by stoning or death in Islamic countries. '(Premarital sex) is actually one of the worst things you can do,' she said. A 27-year-old man (pictured) has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars for marrying and sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl. Now her father is on trial for agreeing to the arrangement because he discovered that his daughter was' menstruating and interested in boys' a court heard . The court also heard the girl and her husband had sex 'once or twice' a day after they were married. They also spent five nights staying at her father's house. The girl also detailed the motivation for the marriage being organised, which was her reaching puberty. In the video interview shown to the court, she said she understood puberty to be 'blood...when I got my period'. She also said her father told her not to take birth control pills, and that her father reminded her not to let her husband wear a condom. 'Don't use pills or condoms - don't let him use anything,' she said. 'He always said that - I think the first time was just after we got married.' The court also heard her 'husband' approached her father about the marriage after he had been refused by leaders at her usual mosque. 'They said no because of my age and because I was Aussie,' she said. 'After he went to sheiks, after a while he came back and asked my Dad.' Her comments come after her mother said she had pleaded with the father to stop the wedding. The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney she strongly opposed the marriage. She said her former husband - with whom she had split before the incident - called her on what she believed to be the night of her daughter's wedding. 'He said (my daughter) is going to get married; they wanted to bring the man to meet me,' the mother told the court. 'I said no. I did not want anything to do with (my daughter) getting married.' The woman said she then spoke to her daughter and told her not to get married and the girl said she wouldn't. 'He wanted her to be married or he wouldn't have married her,' she said. 'I didn't agree with it, I had nothing to do with it.' The woman's former partner, a 63-year-old man, allegedly married his teen daughter off to a 26-year-old man so she did not commit the sin of extramarital sex. The father allegedly gave his daughter's mobile phone number to the 26-year-old man who wanted to marry her and then hosted an Islamic ceremony at his home in the Hunter region. The court heard the mother received a second call from her former partner that night, during which he used his 'angry voice'. The woman, who legally cannot be named, told the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney, she strongly disagreed with the marriage to a 26-year-old man (pictured) 'He said she was going to get married no matter what, that next time I saw her she would be married,' the woman said. 'I just didn't agree with them getting married. 'I know it was him on the other end of the phone; I know his voice because I had to put up with it for 20 years.' The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct. 'I don't have any trouble remembering the conversations,' she said. 'They did not have my consent. I was not at the wedding. I did not allow it. '(He's) a liar; he is not going to admit to anything. 'What he said is what he said - I didn't add anything or forget anything.' She said she found out they couple had been married under Sharia law when the Department of Community Services got involved after the girl's husband tried to enrol her in a Sydney High school. The woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory, but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter's marriage were correct . The mother also told the court she briefly converted to Islam during their relationship, the religion of her husband, because she 'was interested in learning about God, and that was the only one he would let me learn about'. She also lashed out at the father's barrister after it was suggested her memory issues caused by her learning difficulty may have led to her remembering a conversation that never took place. 'Who's going to forget that,' the mother said. 'I'm not happy about my daughter being married in the first place so don't have a go at me.' When Judge Deborah Sweeney attempted to calm her and said the barrister was just doing his job asking questions, the woman asked if the barrister was a Muslim. 'Because if he's Muslim then you got to do what the man says, because the woman is always a liar.' Crown prosecutor ­Siobhan Herbert earlier told the court the father hosted the couple at his home, where they allegedly had sex on a specially set up mattress. The father's trial comes after the husband, now 27, was jailed for seven and a half years earlier this month for persistent sexual abuse against the young girl. 'By her getting married he was stopping the sin of extramarital sex,' Ms Herbert said. 'His actions brought about or caused the unlawful sexual activity.' On the wedding day, he allegedly instructed the girl that neither she nor her partner were allowed to use contraception. On the first weekend after the wedding, the court heard the father hosted the couple at his home where he allegedly arranged a marital bed. The 27-year-old Lebanese student and the 12-year-old Australian girl spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region of NSW where they had sex several times . The following morning, he asked his daughter if she needed to shower before prayers, in line with Islamic practice after sexual intercourse, the court was told . The father allegedly consented to the wedding, in January 2014, after discovering his daughter had begun menstruating and becoming interested in boys. Judge Deborah Sweeney said on Friday the 27-year-old Lebanese man, who cannot be named, had persisted in pursuing his Australian victim despite her initial reluctance. The  girl was pregnant when her 27-year-old Lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. However, she miscarried in February after complaining of abdominal pain . The pair held their 'wedding', which was allegedly arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW, in January last year. It is alleged the man gave the child $500 as a wedding gift. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, court papers stated. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013  after he approached her father and asked to meet her. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The Imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states. His trial will continue next week.

"An ex Queensland health employee has broken down in court after being sentenced to two years prison after stealing nearly $40,000 in overtime. 36-year-old Karma Elms faced the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday and pleaded guilty to the offence before becoming defensive about the course of events. Magistrate Wendy Cull handed down the two-year prison sentence which is to be suspended after three months saying that the fraudulent behaviour was planned and systematic. 36-year-old Karma Elms has been sentenced to 2 years jail after stealing nearly $40,000 in overtime . The offence saw 36-year-old, Karma Elms scam the Health department out of $39,352 over 15 months. According to the Magistrate, Elms showed a 'degree of defensiveness' despite pleading guilty and made note of the fact that she had travel a long way to get to work. She has not yet repaid the debt and is on the brink of bankruptcy after spending all of the stolen funds on credit cards, rent and gift hampers. 'Clearly you are a poor manager of your personal finances and have spent money that far exceeded your income,' The ABC reported Magistrate Cull said. Elms was hired by Queensland health in 2010 to help with the large workload after the department's flawed payroll system was introduced that left 1800 employees with little or no pay. The Caboolture woman pleaded guilty to the charges and is still to repay the $39,352 as she has spent it all . The court was told that the Caboolture woman may have been suffering from anxiety from work demands .

The Crime and Corruption Commission hope to use Elms as an example to other public servants. 'It is totally unacceptable that public money was diverted from other essential health services which should benefit all Queenslanders,' acting director Paxton Booth said.

"Britain could be linked with America by road as part of an ambitious project to create the world's longest superhighway spanning half the circumference of the globe. Proposals have been put forward to build the mega route stretching about 12,400 miles from the western edge of Russia to the Bering Strait where the country nudges Alaska. Linking into existing road networks in Europe and Asia, for the first time it would allow travellers a proper highway to drive all way from the UK to the United States. A Trans-Siberian rail link as well as oil and gas pipes would run alongside the highway, and plans have been mooted already for a rail tunnel connecting the far flung Russian region of Chukotka - where football tycoon Roman Abramovich once served as governor - and Alaska. By jumping on the Channel Tunnel you could get all the way from London to Alaska by road under plans for a more than 12,000 mile superhighway linking Europe and western Russia to the Bering Strait . While roads exist across much of Russia some are of dismal quality, especially in the east of the country. Among these is the notorious Road of Bones built by Stalin's political prisoners. This new scheme is seen as a way of turning Russia into a global transportation hub, a bridge between Europe, Asia and North America, so revitalising the Russian economy and attracting new tourism. Vladimir Fortov, the Head of the Russian Academy of Science, recently put forward the uncosted plan dubbed the Trans-Eurasian Belt Development (TEPR) to President Vladimir Putin. 'The project is very ambitious and expensive, but it will solve many problems in the development of the vast region,' he said, according to The Siberian Times. The current longest continuous road in the world is found in Australia, where Highway 1 runs around the entire country and spans some 9,000 miles. In Russia the Trans-Siberian Highway network is more than 6,800 miles long, meaning the new road would become the biggest and longest ever built, with additional sections in the west and east. Plans for the Trans-Eurasian Belt Development have been presented to President Vladimir Putin (left) by Vladimir Fortov, the Head of the Russian Academy of Science (right). It is as yet uncosted . The notorious Road of Bones R504 Kolyma Highway, named because the skeletons of those who died during its construction were used in its foundations . Plans for the TEPR were unveiled by the head of the Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin - who has been hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine - at a meeting of the Russian Academy of Science. Using tunnels or ferries from England the continent, and Russia to the US, a driver could use the highway to travel from Britain to the US for the first time. Its development is viewed as a 'powerful and versatile' corridor that would allow massive investment and the construction of pipelines for oil and gas, the laying of facilities for electricity and water supplies and the opportunity for new cities to be created. While roads exist across much of Russia some are of dismal quality, especially in the east. Among these is the  Road of Bones, built by the political prisoners of Joseph Stalin (pictured) The team behind the project say they estimate it will require trillions of dollars but insist its economic benefits would far outweigh any cost. What is unclear is how a cash-strapped Russia could afford it. Giving a presentation on the scheme, Yakunin - a close friend of Putin - described it as 'an inter-state, inter-civilisation project'. He also said it would lead to Russia becoming the new world centre for the creation and development of high-tech industries because of its central position in the new global transport network. Five years ago Vladimir Putin travelled along some of the existing roads in the Russian Far East as part of a tour to meet voters before the presidential elections. Behind the wheel of a yellow Lada, he drove 2,000 kilometres across Siberia in a stunt intended to boost his ratings and the Russian car industry. But it backfired when he discovered much of the route was in a bad state of repair and his car was photographed on the back of a tow truck. The R504 Kolyma Highway - better known as the Road of Bones after the skeletons of those who died in its construction were used in its foundations - is the only main road through the remotest parts of the Russian Far East. Connecting Magadan with the town of Nizhny Bestyakh, much of the route is unmaintained and about 200km is completely abandoned and a challenge even for motorists in 4x4 vehicles. The rail network in Siberia was recently extended with the construction of a new line to a station across the Lena River from Russia's diamond capital of Yakutsk. Potentially this line could be extended further east to Magadan and the northern Pacific.","Trans-Eurasian Belt Development would span half globe's circumference .

"Mike Baird was met with cheers of ‘four more years’ as he took the stage at the Liberal party’s State Election campaign launch at the City Recital Hall in Sydney’s CBD on Sunday. Mr Baird made several new policy announcements including a promise to introduce scholarships for 25,000 TAFE students, new incentive payments that encourage small businesses to take on more staff and an early roll out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. He also promised to create 150,000 jobs for his constituents if his government is re-elected next weekend. Premier Mike Baird is currently leading Labor in the two-party preferred polls . While the Liberal Party outlined its plan for New South Wales in the next term they also commenced an unorthodox smear campaign designed to undermined the Labor’s party move to stop the privatisation of the state-owned electricity network. Media and supporters were handed decks of playing cards that featured ‘facts’ to counter the ‘lies’ ALP are purportedly spreading in an attempt to thwart the power sale. They claim New South Wales consumers have been hit with ‘some of the highest power bills in the Western world.’ Opposition leader Luke Foley features as the deck’s Joker, his scathing blurb accuses him of being the ‘chief beneficiary’ in the ‘campaign of deceit.’ The cards claim New South Wales consumers have been hit with ‘some of the highest power bills in the Western world.’ The 'Poles and Liars' cards were distributed on Sunday to media and supporters at the campaign launch . The deck continues to mock the Labor party’s campaign by citing twelve ALP members who allegedly support the sale, including former Prime Minister Paul Keating. Kristina Keneally, former New South Wales premier, has also been caught up in the controversy appearing as the Queen of Hearts and being labelled a supporter of the sale. She was quick to hit back on twitter saying the claim was unfounded as she ‘never supported the sale.’ In the meantime Luke Foley attempted to rally his supporters with claims that a win for him would be the first nail in the Prime Ministers coffin. Luke Foley was seen in Burwood on Sunday rallying his voters as the election draws nearer . ""If Mr Baird goes next Saturday, Mr Abbott goes on the Monday,"" the Labor leader told a crowd in Burwood on Sunday. Relying on the public's apparent disdain for Mr Abbott may not be enough to turn the election around for Mr Foley the polls show the Coalition leading Labor on a two party two-party-preferred basis. Labor has vocally opposed Mr Baird plans to privatise the State-owned electricity network . The Liberal’s are tipped to get the chance to implement their $20 billion infrastructure program however it’s likely they'll lose the majority power they wield.

"She was frustrated at how complicated her children's baby grows were to do up. So, Melanie Chiknagi came up with an alternative - to create her own range of 'parent-friendly' suits. The mother-of-two, a former commercial property surveyor from London, developed a new design of baby grow  that does not include traditional leg poppers, which she found  'difficult' to use. Instead, her design, dubbed the Picklesuit, features plastic zips on each leg, with concealed flaps to protect the infant's limbs. It also includes wide arms and non-slip soles from size '6 months' up. Creative mother: Melanie Chiknagi (pictured with her son, Samson, dressed in a Picklesuit) has developed a new design of baby grow that does not include traditional leg poppers, which she found 'difficult' to do up . Innovative: Instead, her design, dubbed the Picklesuit, features plastic-moulded zips on each leg (pictured), with concealed flaps to protect the infant's limbs. The suit also includes wide arms and non-slip soles . 'Easy-to-use': While the suit (pictured) can be fully opened 'so that it is easy to dress little ones', its zips also allow parents to undress only their child's lower half during nappy changes, Mrs Chiknagi told DailyMail.com . While the suit can be fully opened 'so that it is easy to dress little ones', its zips also allow parents to undress only their child's lower half during nappy changes, Mrs Chiknagi told DailyMail.com. 'The design means that the baby's top half stays nice and warm,' she said. 'It's an innovative baby grow that is easy, practical, and hassle-free to put on, take off, and open for nappy changes.' And despite Mrs Chiknagi having launched her Picklesuit range only last year, it has already become a great success with British parents, with many deeming it an 'easy-to-use' and 'thoughtful' innovation. The mother said she was first inspired to create the Picklesuit - which is now available in three star designs (red-and-white, grey and white) - after struggling to do up her baby son Samson's baby grow. 'Our second child was born and we still couldn't do up his baby grows,' said Mrs Chiknagi, who lives with her son, daughter, Matilda, and husband, Pascal, in an old Victorian house in the capital. 'Frustrated at the fiddly design on most, Pascal and I decided to design our own, parent-friendly one. We replaced leg poppers with a zip up each leg. Then we fitted a fabric flap inside the YKK zips. Contrast: 'The design means that the baby's top half stays nice and warm,' she said. Left, a red-and-white star version of the Picklesuit with zips on the legs, compared to a normal baby grow with leg poppers, right . Son: The mother said she was first inspired to create the Picklesuit - now available in three star designs (red-and-white, grey and white) - after struggling to do up her baby son Samson's (pictured today) baby grow . 'This ensures the zips never have any contact with baby's' legs and will not pinch the skin when done up.' She added: The Picklesuit took us a year to design, and getting this flap right was laborious.' Another flap on the baby grow's front 'prevents the baby from playing with the zips, and means that when a parent is carrying their child, the zips won't dig into the carrier's skin', said Mrs Chignaki. The Picklesuit, which is produced in a British factory that Mrs Chiknagi visits on an almost daily basis, was perfected after 'many, many prototypes', all of which the mother tried out on her two children. 'The result is the easiest, most straightforward babygrow to put on - even in the middle of the night, she said. 'Parenthood is hard enough without having to struggle with complicated clothes.

Although she replaced leg zips with poppers, Mrs Chiknagi decided to keep poppers on her baby grow's front to enable parents to fully open it if they wish - or keep it shut during nappy changes. Mrs Chiknagi monitors her business, Picklebee, and customer's orders from her family home. She also creates other 'fun, practical' products for infants, including silicon bibs and reusable food pouches. She recently exhibited her work to great acclaim at The Baby Show at ExCel London.

"She credits her as her ‘greatest inspiration’ – yet the one person model-turned-artist Tali Lennox has never painted is her popstar mother Annie. The 22-year-old, who is preparing for her first solo art exhibition in New York, has received critical acclaim. But in an exclusive interview with The Scottish Mail on Sunday, she revealed she had still not plucked up the courage to capture the Eurythmics star on canvas. Scroll down for video . Tali, right, pictured with her Eurythmics singer mother, Annie Lennox, is preparing for her first art exhibition . She said: ‘She is one of the only people I haven’t painted. I haven’t built myself up to it yet. ‘I am such a perfectionist and I worry that it might not turn out as amazing as I would want it to. She is so important to me and I want it to be just right.’ Last week the 22-year-old faced criticism for posting self portraits of herself as a bruised and bloodied victim of domestic violence online . She has painted her close friends, her sister, even her boyfriend, New York-based photographer Ian Jones: ‘I like to paint people I know rather than strangers, as I have a deeper understanding of their expressions and what each one means. ‘I will paint my mum at some point. The last time I was with her we were talking about it. I am thinking I might do a series, in different situations, that capture different sides of her.’ The youngest daughter of the Scottish singer and her second husband, Israeli film producer Uri Fruchtmann, Tali grew up in London’s Notting Hill. Yet despite her high-profile parents, she describes her upbringing as ‘sheltered’, saying: ‘People find it hard to believe, but my childhood was really quite normal. ‘My mum has always been so modest and grounded and didn’t really involve herself in the world of celebrity. First and foremost, despite being an incredibly successful singer, she was a parent. ‘I never felt we were under a spotlight and we didn’t have paparazzi trailing us all the time, which I am grateful for. ‘I think because we didn’t do anything out of the ordinary we were left alone and that helped me growing up. I didn’t really feel any different to anyone else.’ It was only when Tali and her older sister Lola first accompanied her on a world tour that they realised just how fêted their mother was. ‘I remember, during her performances, seeing people crying in the crowd and I was like: “Woah, they must really love her”. Thousands of people would be singing along to her music – I think it was then that it hit home to me how famous she was.’ Tali would later go into modelling, starring in big budget campaigns for Burberry and Prada. Two years ago, she put her modelling career on hold to move to the US and become a professional portrait artist. But still makes sure she speaks to her mother every day: ‘I love to talk to her about what I am doing. I don’t always listen to other people’s feedback on my art, but with my mum I do listen. ‘We are really similar and we think in the same way. I am so lucky to have someone in my life who I am so so close to in that way and who really gets me. I never feel embarrassed showing my mum my work, even self-portraits that are quite raw. ‘Both my parents have always supported me and encouraged me to do what I love.’ Her self-portrait show, Layers of Life, opens next week at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York’s trendy SoHo area. Tali has inherited her mother’s love of pushing the boundaries and some of her paintings have sparked controversy. Art Attack: Tali Lennox prepares for her first solo exhibition at the Catherine Ahnell gallery in Soho New York . Last week, she faced criticism that some of her self-portraits, which showed her as a bruised and bleeding victim of domestic abuse, were in ‘very poor taste’. Yesterday, speaking from her studio in New York, the young artist, whose mother actively campaigns for women’s rights, explained that she wanted to shine a light on ‘every trait of human nature’. She said: ‘It is so important that we do not hide away from important issues such as domestic abuse. We have to face up to it if we are going to stop it. ‘There is far too much abuse in the world. My mother campaigns on the issue and the most recent figures are really shocking. 'I know some people may find my work quite intense, but I want to make emotive art. I want to make people feel something and look inside themselves. I want to evoke compassion and discussion. ‘In a world where everything is instant and accessible, and people put out fragments of themselves on social media, I search for moments of authenticity and am inspired by those who strive to be who they are. I am not putting my work out thinking everyone has to like it. Art is in the eye of the beholder.’ Tali has been drawing and painting for ‘as long as I can remember’. While she admits she loves to sing, and would watch her mother with admiration as she belted out songs at the grand piano that took pride of place in the family home, her sketch book was always at her side. The model turned artists said that art has always been her passion since a young age . Her ‘unexpected’ move into modelling at 17 changed the way she looked at beauty. ‘I had singing lessons at school but my parents were never pushy,’ she said. ‘I love singing and am not bad at it, but I don’t think I have what it takes to make a career out of it. ‘Art has always been my passion, since I was very young – it is like meditation and the feeling of satisfaction and closure you get when you complete a painting cannot be beaten. I have always painted people. When I was younger I used to like drawing pretty girls from magazines but as I got older, after I started modelling and was in a world obsessed with looks, I started to prefer more distorted faces which have more depth.’ The 5ft 10in beauty admits it was the pressure to look a certain way that turned her off modelling full-time. ‘I still do some modelling, but not as much as I used to,’ she said. ‘I want to work on something I created, whereas when you are modelling you are part of someone else’s idea. ‘In modelling, your one main ambition is to look after the way you look. It is not something I felt I could immerse myself in full-time – plus I like eating nice food too much.’ She added: ‘A part of modelling is great and fun, but it is also about chance and whether someone wants you and that brings a lot of pressure. You can feel a bit insecure. Maybe in a way it is selfish, but I needed to find a better balance for me. Tali admits it was the pressure to look a certain was that finally turned her off modelling . ‘I had never planned to model. It was all quite bizarre how it happened and I was very young but it taught me so much about myself and I met some amazing people.’ Tali hopes her exhibition will show the world she is more than just a ‘privileged’ girl who likes to paint. She said: ‘I am not in this for the fame, that is not important to me, but I would like people to see my paintings and realise how hard I work. I know I have had a very privileged life, but it is important to me I am not put in a box and am seen as more than the daughter of a famous singer. Sometimes you hear people questioning why the children of actors and singers don’t just get “normal” jobs. But when you grow up in an artistic environment, this is normal. ‘I also think it is in your genes. People are pleasantly surprised when they see that I am not a cliché and I take my work really seriously. I felt it was important for me to fly the nest and come to New York on my own and be self-sufficient.’ But she has never felt she was in her mother’s shadow. ‘I am so proud of what she has done in her life. I am so grateful to have such an incredible, passionate, giving person in my life. I was talking to her the other day about all her humanitarian work. She just never stops and does everything with the best of intentions.’ The singer plans to be at the opening of her daughter’s exhibition. Tali said: ‘She is my greatest inspiration and I am so glad she will be there. All those closest to me will be – which means a lot.’ Tali revealed she has also been taking acting lessons, saying: ‘I love acting. It is similar to painting as you use yourself as the tool and it is scary because it all comes from within. To be successful you have to give your everything to it – so I don’t think I could commit enough time just now with my art – but I haven’t ruled it out.’ Wistfully, she adds: ‘I can’t see myself in a comedy. I like things that are honest and raw, so I think the best acting is method acting for me.’ l The Layers of Life exhibition will be open for a month from March 19 at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York.","Annie Lennox's daughter Tali is preparing for her first solo art show .

"Laboratory beef could surpass the real thing within 10 years to solve environmental and animal welfare problems, while remaining just as tasty, a Dutch scientist says. Mark Post, Professor of Physiology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, 18 months ago oversaw the creation of the first 'cultured beef' burger made of stem cells from cow muscle tissue. He says beef producers already recognise the looming obstacles for the industry, such as how to sustainably and effectively feed the world's population, including the growing Asian middle class, which is projected to reach 3.2 billion people by 2030 and to double the region's food consumption by 2050. Mark Post, Professor of Physiology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, 18 months ago oversaw the creation of the first 'cultured beef' burger made of stem cells from cow muscle tissue . 'They recognise the same problems, probably better than anybody else, and they see there could be alternatives,' Professor Post told reporters in Darwin on Friday, where he was a guest speaker at the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association annual conference. He says consumers will eventually drive the demand for laboratory beef and producers will have to fall in line. Initially, it will be considered a luxury product, with an appeal to those with environmental and animal welfare concerns. 'The more traditional meat consumer, and probably also richer and younger segment, will tap into this much sooner than people in India and China, who for the first time ever can afford meat and will go for the lower cost traditional meat sources,' he said. He told the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association annual conference in Darwin on Friday that he predicted lab-made meat would be competing with traditional beef in about 10 years time . The first cultured beef patty cost a whopping 250,000 euros, but within 10 years production could be scaled up to compete with traditional beef in cost, especially if beef prices continue rising, Professor Post said. One stem cell can make 10,000kg of beef, so the capacity is huge, he said. Farmers will be able to adapt production systems to incorporate cultured beef, which will eventually piggyback on the industry's resources, distribution networks and access to consumers. But the two forms of beef production won't really be able to co-exist, Professor Post said. He claimed it will initially considered a luxury product, with an appeal to those with environmental and animal welfare concerns . 'If this technology produces exactly the same product with less resources and... less animal welfare issues, then I think the consumer will eventually decide for us,' he said. Taste remains the biggest issue: the lab burger currently tastes 'okay, not great', but fat tissue is being added to improve the flavour. 'It's essentially the same tissue in the end, so the taste has to be similar,' he said.","Prediction was made by Dutch Professor of Physiology Mark Post .

"Australian businessman Peter Gerald Scully is 'remorseful' after being arrested in the Philippines for his role in a sickening international paedophile ring which has shocked the country and renewed calls to re-introduce the death penalty. Scully has been accused of running a child pornography business, charging fellow predators to watch children perform disgusting acts - but is promising to reveal all in the hope of getting a lighter sentence. The heinous business included live-streaming the sexual abuse of babies and children to clients in numerous countries, including Australia, according to The Age. Scroll down for video . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. 'I will make a very in-depth ... not just comment, but report. That's how remorseful I am.' Scully reportedly made similar comments since his transfer from Manila to a jail in Cagayan de Oro, where his alleged paedophile ring was based. Clients reportedly paid the between $US100 and $US10,000 to watch videos, some of which have been described as the most shocking seen by Filipino agents fighting human trafficking. One alleged video titled 'The Destruction of Daisyby' was uploaded to an online porn website, and reportedly shows sex acts and torture being carried out. Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show one the victims, a 13-year-old girl, being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five. 'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Janet Francisco, head of the anti-human trafficking division of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation, said that two people had been charged overseas in relation to the investigation. They are believed to be of European nationality, reported The ABC. The Australian Embassy reportedly met to convene on the case, and the UNICEF's chief of child protection in the Philippines, Sarah Norton Staal, said the case needed urgent attention. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme . Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . 'Well obviously the Australians don't want to see any perpetrators, any Australian nationals who are involved in this,' Ms Staal said. 'And even if there's one, you know, one is too many.' It is claimed the father of two abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers for his 'pay for view' online child pornography business. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, said he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully. 'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age. Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . 'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' The alleged crimes are so horrific and sparked such wide-spread outrage across the Philippines it has led to calls to reintroduce the death penalty. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.

"Angry customers criticised Marks & Spencer last night after Mother's Day flowers failed to arrive in time. They complained that the store used beleaguered delivery firm Yodel, which has previously come under fire for struggling to deliver parcels during busy times.

Marks & Spencer customers have been left without Mother's Day flowers after the courier firm employed by the chain failed to deliver . Marks & Spencer confirmed that the Courier firm Yodel was responsible for a 'small number of delays to orders' They have since had their money refunded. The retailer said Yodel was responsible for a 'small number of delays to orders', but insisted its delivery service had returned to normal yesterday.

Another tweeted: 'Whoever finds my M's Day flowers first can keep them', adding: 'According to GPS tracker, they were left in a layby.' Others questioned why M&S was still using Yodel following a catalogue of high-profile issues in recent months. One Twitter user said: '2.30pm and still no Yodel M&S flowers delivery. It rather ruins the surprise, having to let your mum know flowers were ordered but no sign.' Another asked: 'Why are M&S using Yodel to deliver flowers on Mother's Day?'. The delivery firm has been beset by claims of broken deliveries, and packages left in bins and hurled at doors. An M&S spokesman said: 'The vast majority of orders were delivered on time on Saturday. For the small number of customers who had orders postponed to today we have offered a full refund and a gesture of goodwill. We expect a normal delivery service today.' Yodel said it had handled over 400,000 Mother's Day flower deliveries for a number of retailers this year. Dick Stead, Executive Chairman of Yodel said: 'We’ve handled over 400,000 Mother's Day flower deliveries for a number of retailers this year. We started deliveries on Friday and we worked all Sunday up until 6pm to ensure mums across the country got their gifts.'","Customers who ordered bouquets to arrive yesterday were emailed and informed that 'something had gone wrong' with their delivery .

"A 34-year-old man from Brooklyn has drowned while trying to save his dog from a frozen pond in upstate New York this weekend. The Ontario County Sheriff's Office says Garvin Anthony Brown and his fiancee were renting a home in the Finger Lakes town of Naples, 40 miles southeast of Rochester. Deputies say Brown was walking his dog around 1am Sunday when the pooch went onto the ice of a pond and fell into the water. Scroll down for video .

Investigators say Brown was unable to get out of the frigid water and drowned. His dog survived the harrowing ordeal.

"This is the heart-breaking moment the grieving mother of a young whale killed by orcas returns to her offspring's corpse in a desperate bid to save it. Photographer Craig McInally, 40, caught the moment two orcas tore the young humpback whale to pieces when he was diving off the Revillagigedo Islands in the Pacific. In the remarkable photos, the orcas can be seen isolating the calf from its mother and killing it before its mother returns to its side having watched it being killed. The mother (left) of the dead humpback calf returns to the corpse of its offspring (right) after having watched it being killed by orcas . After having killed the young calf, the two predatory orcas set about tearing its skin off in a brutal display of aggression . Little was left of the calf after it was drowned and torn apart in the savage attack . Pictured is the baby swimming with its mother prior to being isolated, drowned and torn apart. The images were taken by photographer Craig McInally . Left, the baby swims with its mother prior to the attack. Right, its lifeless corpse floats upside down after being savagely attacked . Mr NcInally said: 'In fifteen years of expeditions to the remote Revillagigedo Islands, the crew of the boat I was on had never seen orcas there, much less witness the orcas' exhibit predatory behavior. 'The attack was chaotic and horrible to watch.' Mr McInally, a qualified technical diver from San Diego, California, had been diving with the humpback school the day before the attack. In the photos, the humpback calf can be seen swimming closely with its mother before the larger killer wales separate the pair before slowly drowning and killing the baby. Craig added: 'The first day we were diving with the humpbacks the mother was patient and comfortable with us. 'She allowed us to get extremely close and the baby seemed inquisitive, passing close to us whenever coming up to breathe every three minutes or so. Photographer Craig McInally, 40, caught the rare event when he was diving. Here the baby and mother are pictured swimming together . Fully grown humpback whales, such as the one pictured by Mr McInally, can grow to be 16metres in length . The baby calf cuddles up to its mother during a swim through a Pacific . 'The next day another diver noticed an odd fin breaking the surface. I looked over and was shocked to see the unmistakable fin of a male orca. 'We grabbed our cameras and dive gear and after a moment we realized the orcas were here for the baby. 'The battle was hard to follow. The baby was trying to escape and get back to its mum, but the orcas coordinated the attack to keep the baby separate. 'The next tactic was to injure the baby, perhaps to slow it down. Finally, the orcas succeeded in drowning the baby and then fed on the blubber. 'It was not until back onboard that I had the time to process the immensity of the event and reflect on the raw power of nature. It changed me forever.' Photographer Craig McInally, 40, caught the rare event when he was diving off the Revillagigedo Islands in the Pacific (pictured).

"Police have confirmed that a 911 call claiming to have been made from inside the Miami Beach home of rapper Lil Wayne on Wednesday reporting four people had been shot was a hoax. A major contingent of police and SWAT surrounded the expansive $9.4 million property at 94 Largorce Circle after the call was placed at 12.40pm. Officials said a man called Miami Police Department saying he had shot four people and 'requested assistance'. According to WSVN,  the 32-year-old performer - real name Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. - is in Miami today but was not at home at the time of the incident. Officers entered the 10-bedroom waterfront and inspected each room, soon declaring it all-clear and establishing the report a sham. Scroll down for video .

Officers arrived at the home and, after speaking with a man at the site, gave it the all-clear. Lil Wayne was not at home at the time and police did not find anyone on the premises. On the same day reports emerged on social media that Lil Wayne had been killed during a shooting at a club in Charlotte, North Carolina. He had been pictured at Label Club with fellow rapper T.I., however there was no further suggestion he was still there at the time of the shooting or that he was injured in the shooting.

"An anonymous artist and photographer has captured mundane objects in an entirely new way – making them very difficult to distinguish. Using a reverse lens macro technique, Pyanek has collated his extreme close-up shots in a series he calls ‘Amazing Worlds Within Our World’. Featuring an array of household items, foods and objects we use on an everyday basis, the images are striking. But can you guess what any of them are? Scroll down for video and answers... A honeycomb mesh? The product photographed in Pyanek's first image is found in most kitchens around the world . Wafer thin! Pyanek's second image is of a revolutionary item that has been used in this way as far back as AD 105 . Is that an onion? Object number three is a cosmetic product that has been used for centuries . The first image is of a super absorbent tool made from an organic compound,  but can you guess what this honeycomb mesh actually is? Second up looks like a piece of carpet or maybe a row of wafers? Could be both could be neither. The first use of this item in this way dates back to AD 105 and its continued production has helped shape the world, but just what is it? Number three is a cosmetic product that contains pigments, waxes, oils and emollients. The image itself looks like an onion but it’s a lot more refined than that. Any ideas? This item is both mundane and overlooked but it does serve a pretty useful purpose . Pyanek used the reverse lens macro technique to photograph this item in all its wiry glory . Created by a doctor and an advocate for vegetarianism, this item is enjoyed by people around the world . Image number four features a mundane and often overlooked object, but in this photograph it looks majestic. A type of fastener characterised by a helical ridge, but just what is it exactly? Number five features a small and porous bag used for its filtering properties. This item can be found in most homes around the country but we are pretty sure you have never seen it looking like rice noodles before. The sixth image features an item that was accidentally created in the 19th century by a doctor and advocate of vegetarianism. Today it is produced in significant quantities. Is that a cinnamon stick? Object number seven is something you would almost certainly overlook . A striking image! Just what exactly is this revolutionary phosphorus item? This image featuring a series of prisms is majestic, but can you guess what it is? Image seven captures an item you have almost certainly overlooked in the past, expect for the time you twisted it until it broke off. Any ideas what this cinnamon stick-like thing is? Photograph number eight is striking. This phosphorus item has been in existence for centuries and its purpose has revolutionised the world. Image number nine features a substance formed by trapping pockets of gas in a liquid or solid. The frames of the prisms in this image appear stable, but we assure you they are much more supple than they look. Smooth or sharp? The extreme close-up of this everyday household item is misleading . The scratches on this useful little item presents the amount of wear and tear it goes through . That looks familiar! This image provides an insight into how this useful everyday item works . Despite the individual lines that appear on the object captured in photograph ten it looks smooth and soft to touch. However, this tool has the capability of producing many small splits and then a large cut to a surface. The colour of image 11 really catches the eye, but it’s pitted surface and hard to distinguish edges make it a confusing image to... unlock. Image 12 is features another object that has revolutionised the world we inhabit. This photograph is perhaps easier to interpret but it provides an insight into how the item works. This object, which appears wiry up-close, is almost certainly something you would overlook . Majestic: This everyday, throwaway item would appear to command more respect than it actually gets . Just in case you were wondering, this is what a biotic material looks like up-close, apparently . A bit more difficult as object 13 is almost certainly something you would overlook, but it does have its purposes. Any idea what this wiry object is? Photograph 14 is perhaps the most enchanting image of the piece. The object is practically flawless but for the few pimples that appear on it. Can you guess what this single diamond-like grain is? Made from a biotic material, object number 15 is used for a variety of purposes and is associated with ritual and religious devotion in China and India. This long, thin and cylindrical item has been around since the 12th century . Pyanek captures the beauty of this overlooked item by utilising the reverse lens macro technique . X marks the spot! The dirty fingerprints ingrained on this object are a giveaway to what it is . Image 16 features an object traditionally made from durum wheat semolina. This long, thin and cylindrical item has been around since the 12th century and is now considered a staple. Any ideas? A slightly more difficult object to distinguish, image number 17 picks up the beauty of a naturally occurring solid aggregate of one or more minerals. And finally number 18. Something we use every single day with little consideration. This image brings to light a brick-in-the-wall object. The finger prints present are a clue here. 1) A kitchen sponge . 2) Pages of a book . 3) Lipstick . 4) A screw . 5) A teabag . 6) A cornflake . 7) An apple stalk . 8) A matchstick . 9) Soap foam . 10) A serrated knife . 11) A brass key . 12) A ballpoint pen . 13) Corrugated fibreboard . 14) A grain of white sugar . 15) An incense stick . 16) Spaghetti . 17) A beach stone . 18) The ‘X’ key of a computer keyboard .","The photographer named Pyanek used a reverse lens macro technique .

"A lying Yelp reviewer has been caught out by restaurant owners after they released surveillance footage showing he was in their restaurant for just 22 seconds. The user, known as Dan. W, posted a scathing, one-star assessment of wonderful in Millbrae near San Francisco, California, claiming staff refused to seat him as he was alone, and even said they turned him down because of what he was wearing. Owners of the venue saw the negative appraisal and decided to investigate. After looking over video captured at the restaurant's front door, they discovered that the disgruntled customer didn't speak to a single member of staff and quickly left after looking at the waiting list. Scroll down for video . Outed: Owners of Chinese restaurant wonderful in Millbrae, California, uploaded surveillance footage of Dan. W after he wrote a one-star review of the venue. Here he is entering the store at 19:07 . In response they uploaded the damning video to their website and barred Dan from returning - saying that he will be 'arrested for trespassing' if he comes back. The review was taken down by Yelp following a request by the restaurant, but has since been re-published by San Francisco Eater. It read: 'My experience was at around 7;30pm on a Wednesday. I was flying solo that night, after a particularly challenging day. The waiter came up and asked how many [sic]. 'I said one, I had planned to sit at the bar or get the food to go. She said 'one? no, one?' and then ran off. I waited a minute at the door, and then left. They were busy and potentially understaffed. It's not that classy of a place, but they refused to seat me. 'Sure, I was wearing jeans and a baseball cap with my flannel shift not tucked in. I had no intentions of taking a full table, just any corner I could fit in, or order off the menu to go once the guy next to me was done with it. 'Oh well, next time I go out in a group of three to six we'll take our business elsewhere. Fabrication: He claimed that staff refused to seat him. But the clip shows he doesn't speak to anyone else and only peers into the seating area of the restaurant . 'The key to a good business is to be consistent in the small things. That sucks, I just wanted food and I had cash, just as I sat down two people called me back and my entourage of 6 had an amazing dinner at Thai stick.' After his lie was uncovered, the restaurant posted a number of videos to their own website under the title: 'No the customer is not always right'. The accompanying message read: 'In this first video, you can see that you entered at 19:07, which is earlier than you quoted. 'You can also see that you did not wait a minute at the door. You spent a total of 22 seconds in the establishment. 'This video also clearly shows that there were other patrons waiting. We are sincerely sorry that we forgot to recognize your very, very 'VIP' status at wonderful, a status so special that you don't have to sign the waiting list like everyone else… I've never been to a restaurant where to refuse to seat people because they're wearing what you were wearing… You're dreaming if you think that's why you didn't get service. 'You can clearly see Dan walk into the picture from the outside at 19:07:00, and then he leaves the picture at 19:08:00. He does not communicate with any servers, and servers were cleaning tables to be able to serve the next customers in line on the waiting list posted at the door. 'Dan, we didn't refuse to seat you. You refused to wait in line like everyone else. You thought you were special, so special that you don't have to follow the rules. That's not true, we caught you. 'You are prohibited from returning to wonderful. If we catch you, you will be arrested for trespassing.' Quick exit: Just 22 seconds after walking into the restaurant, Dan. W is seen leaving. He insists he is not the man in the video and has demanded that the restaurant take it down . Busy: Another angle shows Dan surveying the seating area before deciding to leave. He claimed he was in the store for a minute . Dan. W then responded in another Yelp review, claiming the man in the footage was not him and ordered it to be removed as he was being harassed online and it was 'damaging his reputation' It read: 'Aftermath: the owner put an inflammatory response with video of someone else claiming it was me. I also did not give you permission to put video of me on the internet. 'After that people start harrasing [sic] me and threatening to tarnish my reputation online if I did not remove this review. 'I'd love a ceasefire, take down your BS and I'll gladly take down this review (which again is not fake). That response and situation of only further shows you character. Perhaps they cyberbully and threaten anyone who rates less than a 3?' The restaurant responded again, saying: 'In the interest of being fair to what you said, I am posting video of our service from 18:45 to 19:30 on 18 March 2015. 'If at any time you see yourself walk in and talk to the server, let me know, and I will gladly post a large banner that says 'I'm sorry Dan for calling you a liar'. 'Otherwise, you must be hearing voices, because I sure don't see you talking to anyone in the restaurant.

"Secret Service agents will now have to wait 10 hours to drive government cars if they've been drinking alcohol, according to an internal agency memo. The stricter policy comes weeks after a video surfaced showing two agents hitting a security barricade just outside a secured bomb-threat investigation scene at the White House. The two agents have been accused of operating the government vehicle after drinking at a nearby bar. Scroll down for video . Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said the agency has adopted a new policy requiring agents to wait 10 hours after drinking before they can operate a government vehicle . This screen grab from a police video from March 4 shows two allegedly drunk Secret Service agents hit a White House barricade while a suspicious package was being investigated nearby . Previous Secret Service rules barred agents from getting behind agency vehicles if they were drunk or impaired by alcohol, according to the Washington Post. According to the memo, obtained by the Post, any agents who violated the new policy could face 'disciplinary and adverse actions' that included 'removal from employment'. The memo also reminded agents that they were responsible for 'conducting themselves in a manner that reflects the highest standards of the United States Government'. This isn't the first time the agency's drinking policy has changed after a public incident. Special Operations Secret Service agents are now prohibited from drinking alcohol within 12 hours of reporting for duty and 24 hours before the president arrives during an overseas trip. The changes were enacted after three agents tasked with protecting President Obama in Amsterdam were put on administrative leave when a night of drinking caused one agent to pass out in his hotel hallway. Secret Service Director Joseph P. Clancy admitted before Congress last week that some agents were turning to alcohol to deal with the job. 'There's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses... by using alcohol,' Clancy said, noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress. 'We've got to find a way to help some of these people that are going toward alcohol as a coping mechanism.' Clancy revealed the new drinking policy  during a congressional hearing regarding the March 4 incident. DC Metropolitan Police video shows a car delivering a suspicious package to the White House perimeter . The House Oversight Committee heard testimony about how Clancy only learned about the incident after this message had already circulated among agents for several days . The director has come under fire since the accident, which occurred while on-duty officers and agents were investigating a suspicious package thrown near the White House  and an accompanying threat that it contained a bomb. The House Oversight Committee showed the video from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department during the Capitol Hill hearing. Clancy said he only heard about the allegation that the two agents were intoxicated after an anonymous email began circulating within the agency - five days after the incident occurred. The email described the off-duty employees as 'both extremely intoxicated' after another agent's retirement party. The email then claims uniformed Secret Service officers at the scene were 'going to arrest both of them' but were instructed not to by their commander. 'A lot of people got this email,' Maryland Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings told Clancy. 'But you didn't.' Clancy said it was 'unacceptable' that he had been out of the loop. 'Our mission is too important for this to happen,' he told the congressional panel. 'It undermines my leadership.' The video was shown to a crowded hearing room on Capitol Hill as a helpless Clancy watched . Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz said the Secret Service's 'litany of recent mishaps' was unacceptable and raised 'major concerns' about the agency's ability to protect the president. Legislation proposing reforms to the Secret Service was introduced in the House on Thursday, according to the Washington Post. The proposal asks that the Senate be required to confirm the agency's director. It also authorizes hiring 200 more officers and 80 agents, in addition to new methods for assessing threats against the White House. Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte said that, although Clancy has 'taken many steps to begin to reform the Secret Service', Congress believed it was 'clear that legislative action is needed'. 'After a series of embarrassing security failures and instances of poor judgement, the American people have lost confidence in the Secret Service's ability to protect the president,' he said in a statement. 'From threats from outside entities, and from within the agency itself.' January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.","Secret Service agents now have to wait 10 hours after drinking alcohol to drive government cars .

"Tech experts, analysts and customers alike have bemoaned Apple's Watch for needing an iPhone to have any real use. But the firm has since confirmed the device will ship with 8GB of storage, and at least 2GB of this will be free for music and photos. Although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs, it does mean the timepiece can be used independently for certain tasks. Scroll down for video . Apple has confirmed that all three models of its Watch will ship with 8GB of storage, and at least 2GB will be free for music and photos. Although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs, it does mean the timepiece (pictured) can be used independently for certain tasks. The remaining storage will be used for apps and iOS . The number of tracks it can store will also vary depending on the file sizes. Apple confirmed the storage rumours to fan site 9to5Mac but the company has not responded to MailOnline's request for more information. All three models of the watch will ship with 8GB of total storage. This will be used to run the Watch's iOS software and apps. To put this into perspective, the entry-level iPhone 5C came with 8GB of storage when it launched in 2013 and rival smartwatches typically only have 4GB built-in. Apple will then let users store 2GB of music and 75MB of photos on the Watch as well. This music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its iPod Shuffle. The photo limit equates to around 100 images. To put this into perspective, the entry-level iPhone 5C came with 8GB of storage when it launched in 2013, and rival smartwatches typically only have 4GB built-in. Users can additionally store 75MB images, or 100 photos. The music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its iPod Shuffle (pictured) Apple's Watch is available in three models: the Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition (shown) and all models will be sold in 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. Apple Watch is made of stainless steel, Sport is made of Aluminum and the premium Edition comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold . This music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them. The features of the Apple Watch rely heavily on pairing it with an iPhone. To connect to a phone it either has to be within Bluetooth range or connected to the same Wi-Fi network. It can't take photos because it doesn't have a built-in camera but it can be used to view pictures in the Photo Stream. With a phone: . 1. Use the phone's network to browse the web . 2. Make and receive calls . 3. Send and receive messages . 4. See notifications . 5. Use any installed app including Uber, Shazam and more . Without a phone: . 1. Tell the time . 2. Track steps using the built-in accelerometer . 3. Pay for goods using Apple Pay . 4. Dictate messages to be sent once the phone is connected . 5. Play up to 2GB of songs . Although they will still need to wear Bluetooth headphones. The low photo limit may be because Apple doesn't want wearers to use the device for looking at pictures. The Watch is meant to be a companion device and the photos will be more visible on the larger screen of an iPhone and iPad. It comes in three models: the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, and all models are sold in either 1.4-inch (38mm) or 1.7-inch (42mm) versions. It has been designed to be tethered to an iPhone and the pair communicate over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi which gives the Watch added computing power. But this relationship means that as soon as the iPhone is out of the equation, the Watch has limited value. The Watch also falls short of its rival’s Samsung Gear S that has an optional nano SIM card slot. The Apple Watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $549 and $1048 for the 1.4-inch model and $599 and $1099 for the larger 1.7-inch version. Watch Sport is made of 7000 Series Silver Aluminum and ranges from $349 to $399. The premium Edition has a similar build to the Apple Watch but comes in 18-Karat Rose Gold and Yellow Gold. Prices start at $10,000. In the UK, the Sport starts at £299, the standard Watch starts at £479 and the Edition model will cost from £8,000. This music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch (example app pictured) while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them. Although they will still need to wear Bluetooth headphones . Reviews of the Apple Watch have mostly been positive but while some have said it’s the best smartwatch on the market, the biggest criticism have been its lack of independent features - so this storage option will be a welcomed addition. Ernest Doku, technology expert at uSwitch.com told MailOnline: ‘The Apple reveal finally answered all of our questions on pricing and availability, but the all-important ""why"" remained elusive. ‘Apple is asking us to pay for a level of technical craftsmanship and prestige - but this is unchartered territory and Apple is stepping into one of the few arenas where it’s still outclassed.’ But Stephen Ebbett from Protect Your Bubble added: ‘Sales will be driven by the novelty factor as well as the draw of brand Apple. Plus it has an exceptional track record. ‘Apple made us buy into the tablet in our millions when sceptics questioned whether there’d be enough demand. There’s no reason it can’t do the same again.’","Apple has confirmed all models of its Watch will ship with 8GB of storage .
And at least 2GB of this will be available for storing music and photos .

"The family of Perth man Paul Weeks, one of the passengers on board Malaysian Airliines flight MH370, are urging the world not to forget their loved one and the other 238 people still missing. One year after the plane disappeared, Paul’s mother Prue Tomblin says the families are more desperate than ever to know the truth. ‘I think it's more unbearable now than it was a year ago because we're just totally in limbo,’ she told The West Australian. ‘You just don't know what to feel, what to think. You stumble through the days thinking how can this be possible?’ Scroll down for video . Paul Weeks, pictured with his sons Lincoln and Jack, was one of 239 people on board Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which went missing last year . Paul Weeks boarded the Boeing 777 flight from Kuala Lumpar bound for Beijing on March 8, 2014. The plane disappeared from radar over the South China Sea and to date, no wreckage has been found . On March 8, 2014, Paul Weeks  boarded the Boeing 777 flight from Kuala Lumpar bound for Beijing, along with 226 other passengers. An engineer, he was flying to Mongolia for work when the plane disappeared from radar over the South China Sea. His family have heard nothing since. Prue Tomblin’s plea comes a day after Prime Minister Tony Abbot announced in Parliament that he ‘could not promise that the search will go on at this intensity forever.’ Australian authorities have been leading the search for MH370 since Malaysia Airlines officially declared the loss of the plane an ‘accident’ on January 29. It has been the largest ever underwater search, so far combing more than 26,800 square kilometres of the Southern Indian ocean floor. But no wreckage has been found. A total of 26 countries have been involved in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 since it went missing. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the search, described as the largest, most expensive underwater search ever carried out, 'cannot continue at this intensity forever.' Flight Engineer Chris Poole of the Royal New Zealand Airforce helps  look for objects during the ongoing search for MH370 off the coast of Perth, Australia . The ADV Ocean Shield leaves  Rockingham, south of Perth, to continue trawling the Southern Indian Ocean seabed for remnants of MH370 . With the search efforts due to finish in May, Mr Abbott assured families on Thursday that he is confident the operation will succeed. ‘My pledge is that we are taking every reasonable step to bring your uncertainty to an end,’ Mr Abbott told the Parliament. It's little comfort to Paul's wife, Danika Weeks, who says she's not coping and she can't move on. Ms Weeks has told WHO Magazine that every morning is difficult. In fact, 'it's getting worse.' She spends 'a lot more time in bed', she's taking anti-depressants to help her cope and her youngest son Lincoln screams at her to bring his father back. 'How do you move on?': Danica Weeks, who lost her husband Paul on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, is in Canberra this week to attend a briefing on search efforts for the plane that has been missing for a year . In limbo: Mother-of-two Danika Weeks says she can't accept  her husband Paul has gone until she has proof. A year on, Ms Weeks says she's frustrated with Malaysian Authorities telling the families to move beyond MH370. 'How do you move? We don't get to move beyond! We will never get to move beyond. So how can they just move beyond this and forget about it?' she said in a candid interview with SBS's dateline program last month.

"The three ‘Jihadi brides’ stole family jewellery to pay for their flights out of the UK, it was revealed yesterday. Police have discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow last year. Scroll down for video . Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, left Britain to join ISIS in Syria last month . The former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to Syria and marry a militant fighter. One of the girls, Shamima Begum, used her Twitter account to try to contact her directly, asking for her to open a private line of communication. Friends suspect the girls were in touch with Mahmood and Islamic State recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before Christmas. Investigators are also examining whether the trio managed to exchange messages with their 15-year-old friend after she disappeared on December 6. Police revealed yesterday that two women, aged 20 and 21, have been arrested in North London over the latter’s disappearance. The suspects were held on suspicion of an offence under the Child Abduction Act and will answer bail next month. Former medical student Asqa Mahmood, 20, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow last year, left. Right, Kadiza Sultana, who is understood to have taken a piece of jewellery from her family to fund her plane ticket . Mark Rowley, who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism, said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the UK. ‘We have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences,’ he said. This hand-written list shows some of the vital items the ISIS recruits needed to buy . The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes. They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria. They are now believed to be in Raqqa, Islamic State’s stronghold and scene of some of its most barbaric atrocities. In an unfortunate turn of events, the Met had a counter terrorism officer based in Turkey but he was on annual leave when the girls touched down. At least 22 young women, the vast majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. Last night, the girls’ families insisted that someone else helped them with the cost of the air tickets as the missing jewellery was not worth £1,000. Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza Sultana, said: ‘My sister used to borrow a piece of jewellery off my daughters that was very sentimental to her and that’s what she’s taken. ‘I feel there is someone out there helping in terms of funding because there’s no way my sister has got the cash to fund herself.’ The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes . The jihadi girls’ shopping list has been found and it included details of prices for flights to Turkey, visa money, coaches, hotels, taxis and other supplies. Among items they were advised to bring were a £50 epilator, two sets of £12 underwear, socks for £4 and a phone for £75. Next to each item was as set of initials, appearing to show either who was to purchase them or who they were for. The list included tips as to how to cross over the Turkish border and into IS-held territory, written in different handwriting at the bottom of the page. The total cost of the items, which includes £1,000 plane tickets to Turkey, came to £2,190.","Girls aged 15 and 16 disappeared from their  London homes last month .

"President Barack Obama made jokes about himself and others at the 130th annual Gridiron Club and Foundation dinner . Getting older changes a guy, President Barack Obama says, and he admits he's getting crankier. 'Next week I'm signing an executive order to get off my lawn,' Obama joked Saturday night at the Gridiron Club and Foundation's annual dinner. On top of that, the nation's graying chief executive said he's having trouble now with his morning cup of joe. 'Coffee really disagrees with me these days,' he said, 'which is why John Boehner just invited coffee to address the joint House.' Obama's standup routine drew laughs from the audience of more than 650 journalists, lawmakers, administration officials, military officials and others at the Gridiron's 130th gathering. By tradition, Washington insiders put aside their differences for an evening of laughter, schmoozing and charity fundraising. With the president providing the gibes on behalf of his administration, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe sharpened their wits for the Republicans and Democrats, respectively. Walker is considering a run for the GOP nomination for president while McAuliffe's political connections extend to his work as Democratic Party chairman and Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton ally. Obama targeted himself — 'Just a few years ago I couldn't imagine being in my 50s. Given my approval ratings, I still can't' — as well as people in the government and the media that cover it. Noting that Walker remarked recently that he couldn't say whether Obama was a Christian, the president said his religion taught forgiveness and cracked, 'So, Gov. Walker, salaam alaikum.' Obama said he generally likes Boehner, the House speaker, and noted talk of unhappy House Republicans planning a coup — 'or as Bill O'Reilly calls it, ""reporting from the war zone.""' Walker got in his own digs. 'I believe that the President of the United States loves America and every American — except Rudy Giuliani.' He also joked about his failure to finish his college degree as he envisioned himself in the White House: 'If my first term is anything like college, I won't make it through four years.' McAuliffe joined others in needling the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton. 'If Hillary decides not to run... I decided not to finish that joke,' he said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (left) and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (right) sharpened their wits for the Republicans and Democrats, respectively, at the dinner . He also joked, 'Are any of the Secret Service sober enough to drive me home?' The Gridiron Club and Foundation, founded in 1885, has drawn every president after Grover Cleveland to its annual dinner at least once. Obama made his third appearance on Saturday, having attended in 2011 and 2013. An early script for the evening's musical send-ups included a jab at Republicans preparing presidential campaigns, sung to the tune of 'If I Only Had a Brain' from 'The Wizard of Oz.' One stanza singled out former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: 'He'd be talking to reporters, 'bout walling up the borders/ It'd be a fine campaign./And his head he'd be scratchin' while his thoughts were busy hatchin'/If he only had a brain.' To the tune of Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off' came this crack aimed at Hillary Clinton: 'First lady's second-rate/an' secretary-ya state/Those jobs don't satiate/this hungry candidate./Well Benghazi left not trace, those emails got erased/That's the Clinton way-ee-ya. What eye do is okay-ee-ya. Active membership in the Gridiron Club and Foundation is limited to 65 journalists based in Washington. Money raised through the dinner goes to college scholarships and journalistic organizations.","The 130th Gridiron Club and Foundation's dinner took place on Saturday .

"Whether taking a car for a spin on a Sunday or focusing on getting from A to B after a stressful day, driving can be fun and therapeutic. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will, instead, be controlled by robots. The entrepreneur claims that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply ‘too dangerous’ behind the wheel. Tesla CEO Elon Musk (pictured) believes humans will be banned from driving in years to come and cars will, instead, be controlled by robots. The inventor and entrepreneur claims that computers will do a much better job of driving and that human drivers are simply ‘too dangerous . ‘It would be like an elevator. They used to have elevator operators, and then we developed some simple circuitry to have elevators just automatically come to the floor that you're at ... the car is going to be just like that,’ he told NVidia’s CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang at the company’s annual developers conference. Musk said that the obvious answer to keeping humans safe on the road is to ban us from driving, because ‘it’s too dangerous…you can’t have a two-ton death machine,’ The Verge reported. Instead of taking the wheel, drivers and passengers could read a book or watch a film while their cars tackle the roads for them. However, Musk said that such a vision could take over 20 years to become a reality. Tesla is among many firms that have added self-driving features to its cars and joins the likes of BMW, Volvo and Google, which are developing cars that could drive themselves completely. Tesla’s Model S features an ‘autopilot’ mode, which uses sensors to stop drivers drifting accidently between motorway lanes, as well as moderate speed and brake when necessary. Tesla’s Model S (pictured) will feature an ‘autopilot’ mode, which uses sensors to stop drivers drifting accidently between motorway lanes, as well as moderate speed and brake when necessary . A recent study by eBay Motors revealed that 84 per cent of Americans want to continue driving their own cars and not rely on autonomous technology. Almost four in 10 people think self-driving cars might save them money and three quarters of respondents think it is important that the technology could reduce the amount of greenhouse gases belched out by vehicles. Approximately 56 per cent of Americans think self-driving cars will result in fewer accidents, while 15 per cent predict they will cause more crashes. Being able to do other tasks while travelling in a car, not having to park and lower insurance rates are popular reasons to buy one, but the largest worry is liability in the event of a crash. Last October, Musk said the Palo Alto-based firm is working on a model that will be 90 per cent in control. He noted that driving conditions between 15 and 50mph are the most challenging because this is when most unexpected events occur, such as children running out into a road, cyclists swerving or road closures. Visual computing company, NVidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, has developed a technology called Drive, which could advance autonomous systems, beacuse it can identify objects including people and road signs using sensors and up to a dozen cameras on a car. It's releasing a $10,000 (£6,815) developers kit so people can hone the technology for car manufacturers. As well as developments in on-board sensors and computers, Musk said security concerns must be addressed before fully-functioning autonomous vehicles become a reality on roads. Tesla is working on a way to stop people hacking into its cars and believes that frequent software updates will help. Musk  teased that Tesla would ‘end range anxiety’ in a tweet, which could mean that a software update could increase the car’s mileage. Tesla is competing with the likes of Volvo, which recently announced that it will put 100 of its autonomous vehicles on roads as soon as 2017 and members of the public will be able to try its Drive Me system (illustrated), which the company claims can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios . Despite a recent survey by eBay Motors revealing that 84 per cent of Americans want to continue driving their cars and not rely on autonomous technology, many companies are pushing ahead with self-driving projects. For example, Uber recently said it would be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University and is said to have opened a research facility in Pittsburgh with the intention of creating a self-driving car. Such a move would see it going head-to-head with Google's efforts, among others’. Days ago, a nondescript garage in Sunnyvale, California, was pinpointed as being where Apple is believed to be building its self-driving 'Titan' cars. While it may be early days, an industry expert said that Apple could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020, putting it in direct competition with rivals Tesla Motors and General Motors. Despite a recent survey by eBay Motors revealing that 84 per cent of Americans want to continue driving their cars and not rely on autonomous technology, many companies are pushing ahead with self-driving projects. Google's cute self-driving car is pictured . Days ago, a nondescript garage (pictured) in Sunnyvale, California, was pinpointed as being where Apple is believed to be building its self-driving 'Titan' cars . In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Volvo is the latest European manufacturer to announce big developments in self-driving technologies. It said last month that it will put 100 of its autonomous vehicles on roads as soon as 2017 and members of the public will be able to try its Drive Me system, which the company claims can cope with ‘even the most complicated scenarios’. The trial is set to take place on selected roads in Gothenburg, Sweden and is a collaboration between the auto manufacturer, transport authorities and critically, legislators. Volvo's Drive Me cars rely on 28 cameras, sensors and lasers as well as software rules to drive itself on busy roads. Dr Mertens of Volvo said: ‘Autonomous driving will fundamentally change the way we look at driving. In the future, you will be able to choose between autonomous and active driving. ‘This transforms everyday commuting from lost time to quality time, opening up new opportunities for work and pleasure.’ Elon Musk tweeted that he will reveal a way to cure drivers of Tesla's Model S' range anxiety. While no further details are known, it seems the smart money may be on either navigation software that shows the best route to a charging station or an update that boosts the car's battery power. Several outlets have been reporting that the answer may lie in some trickery with the car’s software that can boost the battery power. Elon Musk tweeted that he will reveal a way to cure drivers of Tesla's Model S' range anxiety. A promotional shot of the car is pictured . In a survey for Consumer Reports in 2012, 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars. The official range of the Model S at the moment is up to 310 miles (500km), which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers. Musk said that all Model S cars will get the update - if so, that points to battery optimisations, a power-saving mode or smarter navigation,' Engadget reported. Software updates to the Model S aren’t unprecedented, either; in January, an update increased the speed of the top-of-the-line P85D via use of ‘insane mode’ - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph (97km/h) in 3.2 seconds, compared to the usual 5.9 seconds. Musk has said more updates will be forthcoming to reduce the car's chances of being hacked when more autonomous driving features are added.","Tesla CEO claims computers will be better drivers than humans .

"Voters called on Ed Balls to come clean about Labour’s plans for higher taxes yesterday. Members of the public rounded on the Shadow Chancellor on live TV as he suggested Britain’s budget deficit could be filled by taxes on the rich – and refused to apologise for the economic crash. Mr Balls – who will today rule out a rise in VAT – was accused of ‘tinkering round the edges’ when he suggested that Britain’s problems could be solved by reinstating the 50p tax for top earners and bringing in a Mansion Tax. Scroll down for video . Voters called on Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls to come clean about Labour’s plans for higher taxes . Ed Miliband yesterday all-but guaranteed Mr Balls the Chancellor’s job if Labour win the election. He was accused of ‘tinkering round the edges’ after suggested that Britain’s problems could be solved by reinstating the 50p tax for top earners . But Mr Balls was forced on to the defensive while taking questions from a studio audience on Sky News. One member of the public called on him to apologise for crashing the economy. Another called on him to come clean about his plans for the economy, describing his plans for taxes on the rich as ‘tinkering around the edges’ and asking him: ‘When are you going to do the big stuff?’ And he came under fire over the Mansion Tax, with voters asking why a tax levied almost exclusively on homes in the south east of England would be used to pay for more nurses in Scotland. Mr Balls will attempt to get on to the front foot today by ruling out a rise in VAT if Labour seize power in May. Members of the public rounded on the Shadow Chancellor on live TV as he suggested Britain’s budget deficit could be filled by taxes on the rich . In a speech in Birmingham today, Mr Balls will make a ‘clear pledge’ that Labour will not raise VAT from its current level of 20 per cent. He will say: ‘We will not put up VAT. And we will not extend it to food, children’s clothes, books, newspapers and public transport fares. ‘We will not raise VAT because it’s the tax that hits everyone. It’s the tax that hits you every day. And it hits pensioners and the poorest hardest.’ But Labour last night refused to rule out raising other major taxes, such as income tax and national insurance. Tory sources said that, with Mr Balls apparently committed to a further £30 billion of deficit reduction, further tax rises under Labour were inevitable. A party spokesman said: ‘Labour have let the cat out of the bag. Ed Balls is confirming his real plan – big hikes in the jobs tax or tax on hard work. ‘Labour have already announced a raft of tax rises, but all but one of these would fund their spending pledges. Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have repeatedly said they will raise taxes. It is time that they came clean with the British public about which taxes they will raise – income tax or national insurance?’ Mr Balls refused to apologise for leaving Britain with one of the biggest budget deficits in the developed world when it left office. He apologised for Labour’s failure to regulate the banks – but said others had also failed to spot the looming dangers. Ed Miliband (right) yesterday all-but guaranteed Mr Balls (left) the Chancellor’s job if Labour win the election . Mr Balls said: ‘We should have been tougher (on the banks). I’m sorry about that. Actually, my opponent George Osborne continually criticised me because he said I was being too tough on the banks. He was wrong too.’ He said that Labour had started to reduce the deficit when it left office – a claim that is contradicted by the facts. And he said that raising the top rate of tax from 45p to 50p would raise £3 billion, despite analysis by the Treasury and HMRC which suggests it would raise almost nothing. George Osborne, who was also quizzed by voters on Sky, acknowledged that there was ‘a lot more work’ required to repair Britain’s public finances after five years in power. The Chancellor also admitted that continuing low interest rates were a problem for savers saying that was the reason he had made a cut in the savings tax the centrepiece of his Budget last week. Mr Osborne was challenged over Tory plans to hold an In/Out referendum on Europe, but insisted it was not deterring business investment. ‘I think we’ll achieve that reform, we will get a better deal for Britain in Europe,’ he said. ‘It’s not damaging business now because we are getting more investment in to Britain than any other European country. ‘So businesses are still voting with their jobs and their investment in to the UK.’","Mr Balls, who will today rule out a rise in VAT, was accused of 'tinkering'

"Technology now in use by the New York Police Department may be picking up stray conversations. Three hundred ShotSpotter microphones are being placed in high crime areas of the Bronx and Brooklyn, with the aim of alerting police immediately when they overhear the sound of gunshots. However, the devices pick up more that just the bang of shots being fired in potential crimes, and evidence from conversations they've listened in on has been used in court. Scroll down for video . New York City's pilot program using ShotSpotter's microphone technology began last week in the Bronx. Above, Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks about the system . The ShotSpotter system works by sending a few seconds of audio to police departments along with location information after a potential gunshot system makes it through a filtering process . Audio recordings from ShotSpotter have been used to corroborate testimony that led to convictions in a 2011 Massachusetts murder where a voice was heard shouting 'No Jason, no Jason!' before shots were fired. NYPD officials and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a pilot program for the microphones earlier this week. Sensors in seven districts of the Bronx have already begun working, and the devices will be turned on in ten districts of Brooklyn on Monday, according to the New York Times. 'This gunshot detection system is going to do a world of good in terms of going after the bad guys,' de Blasio said. The devices are thought to help police respond more quickly and help authorities pin point the exact location of shootings after potential gunshot recordings are sent through the company's headquarters in California. ShotSpotter says that its devices 'are specifically designed to be triggered by loud explosive or 'impuslive' sounds only.' Three microphones must be triggered to start an alert and triangulate a location. The company says that human voices, slamming car doors and loud music will not trigger the microphones, which then send summary data about a sound to the company. The ShotSpotter system (above) filters out noises such as car door slams and yelling before sending alerts to the police . Recordings of a human voice captured by the ShotSpotter system were used to get a conviction in a Massachusetts murder case . It states that there is no 'live streaming' of any microphones apart from the few seconds of regular audio sent to its employees for further analysis about whether the sound may have been a firecracker or a gunshot. An alert, location data and a few seconds of audio are then sent to local police. The restrictions on triggering events have not stopped some privacy advocates from saying that evidence procured by the ShotSpotters may violate the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 'If [ShotSpotter] is recording voices out in public, it needs to be shut down,' the ACLU's Jay Stanley told Take Part. He said his organization is 'always concerned about secondary uses of technology that is sold to us for some unobjectionable purpose and is then used for other purposes.' De Blasio has adopted a two-year pilot program for $1.5million after ShotSpotter was used in other US cities such as Washington and San Francisco . Concerns have also been raised about the intrusiveness of audio recording being combined with surveillance video, according to the South Coast Today. ShotSpotter's website said that '3 out of approximately 3 million incidents' have been latched onto by 'privacy zealots' and that the voices in those cases were yelling loudly in a public street during a shooting rather than having a private conversation. The company's technology is already being used in major cities such as Washington, Boston, Oakland, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Its use has revealed that the vast majority of verified gunshots it picks up are never reported to police. However, it has also been accused of wasting police resources. Seventy-five per cent of the alerts issued in Newark, New Jersey, were false alarm, according to WNYC. The two-year New York pilot program for ShotSpotter will cost $1.5million. Sensors are often placed on buildings and poles.","ShotSpotter microphones detect gunshots and triangulate location .

Mr Massey told officers before he lost consciousness that he thought he was being robbed. He died an hour later at the Hospital of Pennsylvania having owned the headphones for less than a day. Garcia was convicted of second degree murder, robbery and weapons offenses on February 17. But sentencing was delayed after a verbal altercation between Garcia and a sheriff's deputy turned violent. Garcia, 21, was trying to steal Mr Massey's $300 Beats by Dre headphones which he had owned for less than a day . Prosecutors at the Criminal Justice Center said Garcia told detectives in December 2013 that he and two men planned to rob Mr Massey but had no idea he would be killed, the Delaware County Daily Times reported. Brendan O’Malley, Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney, said: 'Garcia didn’t even get the proceeds of the robbery. 'He didn’t even get what he came there for. He took Chris’s life and left the headphones on the ground.' Garcia's lawyer argued he had nothing to do with the crimes.","Christian Massey shot twice in alleyway in Philadelphia in November 2013 .

"Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson has refused to comment on a federal report published Wednesday which found racial bias in his department - with officers routinely discriminating against African-Americans by using excessive force. The chief was asked about his future and that of his employees by CNN but would only say: 'I need to have time to really analyze this report so I can comment on it'. He avoided questions over whether he would step down but added he would 'take action where necessary'. Scroll down for video . When questioned by a reporter about the damning Justice Department report which found racial profiling present in the Ferguson police department, Chief Tom Jackson was unable to give an answer . Police Chief Thomas Jackson fields questions related to the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on August 13, 2014 in Ferguson. The police chief and his department have been widely criticized for their bungled response to teen's death which sparked national protests . The Justice Department report  found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices in the St. Louis County suburb that has come to represent the tension between minorities and American police nationwide. Most of Ferguson's police officers and top elected officials are white, but two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black. The report uncovered racist emails from three city employees, including some that belittled black residents or President Obama. All three employees responsible for those emails left their jobs on Thursday - it's not clear whether they were fired or resigned. However the Justice Department refused to prosecute white cop Darren Wilson who fatally shot unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson on August 9, 2014. Catalyst: The Justice Department began a civil rights investigation following the August shooting of Michael Brown (left), an unarmed black 18-year-old, by white police officer Darren Wilson (right) The shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown led to protests in Ferguson, Missouri (pictured) and across the country over racial bias in the police . A St. Louis County grand jury also found no evidence of a crime and announced in November that Wilson would face no state charges. President Obama  made his first remarks on the DOJ report on Friday saying the type of racial discrimination found in Ferguson, Missouri, is not unique to that police department, and he cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today's civil rights movement. 'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama told The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' Ferguson city leaders will meet with Justice Department officials in about two weeks and provide a plan for ways to improve the police department following the scathing report, Mayor James Knowles III said on Friday. Knowles said that the goal is to work out an agreement with the federal government. A specific meeting date has not been set. 'They want to hear what we will do,' Knowles said. 'We're going to hopefully work out some sort of agreement and we'll move forward. 'We've got to come up with solutions now,' Knowles said. Knowles said city leaders were still going over the report 'line by line' before determining reforms. Asked about Police Chief Tom Jackson, Knowles said he still leads the police force, but the mayor declined to discuss Jackson's future. Further messages seeking comment from Jackson were not returned. 'I'm not here to just chop heads,' Knowles said. 'We have to evaluate everything in the report, pick out what are the systemic issues and what are the things we can fix.' The mayor said he first learned of the emails on Wednesday after meeting with Justice officials in St. Louis. He said he was so incensed that he ordered the accounts of all three employees disabled while he was in the car returning to Ferguson after the meeting. Knowles said there was no evidence that Jackson or other police administrators were aware of those emails.","Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson would not respond to the Department of Justice report 'until he had time to analyze it'

"Madonna had confessed that her eldest child, daughter Lourdes, is 'horrified' by the sexually explicit content of some of her mother's new music. During the second half of an interview with the Today show's Carson Daly, the 56-year-old singer, explained that all four of her children - nine-year-olds David and Mercy, Rocco, 14, and Lourdes, 18 - react to her music in different ways, adding that her daughter Lourdes finds it the most difficult to deal with. 'At this point, Rocco doesn't care,' she said. 'It just goes over his head. He's like, ""Oh, mom. Mom's being mom."" The other little kids don't really — they're not tuned into that frequency yet. And Lo [Lourdes] is horrified by all of it. She just wants me to be her mom.' Scroll down for video . Parental advisory: During the second half of her Today show interview, Madonna admitted that she has found it tough at times keeping the more explicit aspects of her music from her children . Worry: The 56-year-old chart-topper told Carson Daly that she sometimes struggles to balance her work commitments with her role as a mother . Close call: Madonna joked that 'every time my kids would visit me in the studio, it would just so happen that I'd be working on a song like Holy Water or S.E.X.' She added: 'Every time my kids would visit me in the studio, it would just so happen that I'd be working on a song like Holy Water or S.E.X.' she said, referring to two of the tracks from her new album Rebel Heart, which is released today. 'And I'd be like, ""OK, just could - I’ll be - stay outside. I'll be right out.""' But, while her role as a chart-topping icon is clearly of great importance to her, Madonna insists that her number one priority remains her children and her family. And, looking at her social media accounts, it's clear to see how well she balances the two aspects of her life; in among all of the promotional pictures from her album and the star-studded snaps taken at glamorous events or behind the scenes on-set are dozens of heart-warming pictures of the singer's beloved children. Madonna doesn't deny that her work life balance can be tricky at times however - and she admits that keeping track of all of her commitments can be difficult, even at the best of times. 'The more kids you have, the more responsibilities you have, the more you have to really be aware of time, time management, and juggling lots of balls in the air, and thinking, ""Oh, my God, this is how am I gonna do this? How am I gonna promote my record and show up at my daughter's show?""' she said. 'You know what I mean? It's a tug of war.' Horrified: Madonna and Lourdes, pictured here in 2010, are incredibly close, however the singer admits that her daughter is embarrassed by some of the sexual content of her songs . Family ties: Madonna and her four children (from left to right) - David, nine, Lourdes, Mercy, nine, and Rocco, 14 - often go away on family vacations together . But no matter what pressures she is facing in her working life, the music veteran is still determined to create as many memories with her children as possible; in January the family enjoyed a fun-filled skiing trip together, while last November, Madonna took her kids to visit Malawi, where her youngest children, Mercy and David, were adopted from. 'I love taking all of my kids there,' she said. 'They walk into hospitals, and tell jokes and stories, and embrace children who are in some pretty extreme states health-wise. 'And they're not afraid. And I love that. And I love to see them behaving in a generous way towards human beings, you know, outside of their world.” Yesterday Madonna, who dropped out of the University of Michigan in 1978, revealed that she offered daughter Lourdes three key pieces of advice, before she enrolled at her mom's alma mater at the start of this school year. 'Try to do everything in moderation,' she said of the wisdom she imparted to her daughter. 'Try not to kill all your brain cells. And try to go to class.' And while to many, Madonna is a globally-successful super star, she added that - when it comes to her daughter - she worried and frets just like any other mother. 'I'm very, you know, worried,' she told father-of-three Carson. '[I always ask her]: ""Are you OK? Are you getting enough sleep? Are you eating right?"" Social media fun: Madonna often shares images of her children on her Instagram account, such as these pictures of Mercy (L) and David (R) Chart-topper: Madonna's newest album Rebel Heart (pictured) has just been released . 'You know, I set up a humidifier in her room with eucalyptus oil. I was worried about the fact that she didn't have enough towels, Q-tips, you know.' But, despite her constant worries about her teenage daughter, who is following in her mother's footsteps by studying performing arts, it doesn't look like Madonna will be allowed anywhere near the campus in the near future - at least if Lourdes has anything to do with it. 'I'm not allowed at [football] games,' she admitted. 'You think my daughter wants me at a game?' Luckily, the chart-topper isn't short of activities to help her take her mind off her daughter's college activities. The mother-of-four will release her 13th studio album, Rebel Heart, tomorrow, three months after someone leaked early versions of more than a dozen of the songs online. And although she is looking forward to the release - explaining that she is both 'excited' and 'nervous' - Madonna admitted that she is still 'frustrated' by the whole incident. 'I mean, it's a process,' she said. 'Music is really personal to me. A lot of the stuff is out there that I had no intention of ever finishing. 'They're, like, scribbles on a pad. You know what I mean? It's unspeakably embarrassing.'","The 56-year-old made the confession during the second half of an interview with the Today show's Carson Daly .

"New York cops gave two teens jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn. Beanca Moise and Jo-Anna Thiboutot, both 16, were rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center on March 14 suffering multiple fractures and bruises after being struck by a car as they attempted to cross the street mid-block in a section of Flatbush Avenue, according to the New York Post. Moise said she thought the cops standing near her hospital bed, as doctors swarmed around her, were there to see if she was okay. Tickets: New York cops gave Beanca Moise (photographed) and Jo-Anna Thiboutot jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn . Instead, they were there to give her and Thiboutot tickets for jaywalking -- illegally or recklessly crossing the street without regard for approaching traffic. 'It was very insulting,' Moise told the Post. 'I got hit by a car, and they came to the hospital not even checking if I was okay, and just gave us the ticket.' The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians. They told the teens' parents that the tickets were mandatory given the mayor's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy. Mandatory: The cops told Moise's (photographed) and Thiboutot's parents that the tickets were mandatory given Mayor Bill de Blasio's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy . Thiboutot's mother, Rose Benjamin, was handed the teen's summons as her daughter was being treated for deep bruises and gashes on a hospital stretcher. The accident reports and the girls' summonses blame the teens for running into traffic because the girls were attempting to cross the street mid-block, the Post reports. Each summons was signed by one 63rd Precinct cop, a 'PO Nagle.' The driver, Edwin Lawrence, did not receive a summons because a witness reportedly told police Lawrence had the right of way. Jaywalking summonses have risen to 2,000 a year since the mayor implemented the crackdown, according to the Post. The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor de Blasio's (center) Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians . 'Crackdown:' Wiley Norvell, a spokesperson for City Hall, took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown' The girls' families plan to fight the summons and sue the driver. They hired lawyer Michael Goldberg who questioned why the officers had to hand-deliver the tickets to the girls while they were being treated at the hospital, the Post reports. Weeks after the incident, Moise remains on crutches and reportedly needs two more months to recover from fractures and bone contusions. Though the officer's held that they were simply following orders in delivering the 'mandatory' tickets, Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for City Hall, told Gothamist that there is 'no such thing as a 'zero tolerance' policy on jaywalking.' 'Enforcement decisions are made precinct by precinct as commanding officers see fit, based on conditions they see on the ground,' he said. Serious Injuries: In 2014, an elderly man, Kang Wong, suffered serious head injures as NYPD cops attempted to arrest him after stopping the man for jaywalking in the city's Upper West Side . Norvell stated that five jaywalking tickets are issued each day adding that 100 are given for failure to yield. Norvell took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown.' The city saw an increase in jaywalking tickets shortly after the mayor implemented the Vision Zero plan in 2014. With Police Commissioner Bill Bratton embracing the mayor's plan, the New York Police Department issued more than 400 jaywalking tickets in the first two months of 2014 -- compared with just 50 the year before, the Post reports. The jaywalking 'crackdown' provided tickets to many New Yorkers last year, Meanwhile de Blasio and his security detail were caught on video jaywalking.

"Kenneth French glared Tuesday at the man awaiting his sentence for fatally shooting French's 2-year-old daughter in what authorities said was a revenge killing. 'I just want him to know he's a coward. He's a punk,' French told the court. 'If he'd have left my baby out of this, it would have been done a different way.' Minutes later, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Ulysses Boykin told Raymone Jackson, 25, that he would spend the rest of his life in prison without parole. The sentence was mandatory. Villains: Raymone Jackson (left) and Raphael Hearn (right) were sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without parole for the 2014 murder of a 2-year-old girl in a suburban Detroit revenge attack .

Mother's grief: Raphael Hearn, seated, listens as Erica Gross gives a victim's statement to the court during Hearn's sentencing in the courtroom of Judge Ulysses Boykin at the Frank Murphy Hall Of Justice . Kamiya Gross was shot in the head on July 1, 2014, outside a house in Inkster, southwest of Detroit. French and a 13-year-old girl, Chelsea Lancaster, were wounded in the attack. Kamiya was the intended target, police initially said, in retaliation for an earlier shooting in which Jackson held the girl's father responsible. Jackson also was sentenced to up to 45 years in prison for torture and assault with intent to murder. A jury convicted him earlier this month. Raphael Hearn also was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison for first-degree murder. Prosecutors say Hearn helped Jackson plan and carry out the attack. His attorney that the defendant played no part in the killing. Kenneth French had a harsh message for Jackson's co-defendant: 'Do yourself a favor and kill yourself because the world is not going to miss you.' Boykin called the girl's slaying 'one of the most heinous crimes' he's ever seen. River of tears: Following the sentencing of Raymone Jackson and Raphael Hearn, Wendy French, left, hugs Erica Gross outside the courtroom . Survivors: Kenneth French, Kamiya's dad (left), and family friend Chelsea Lancaster (right), 13, were wounded in the attack but survived . Erica Gross, Kamiya's mother, sneered at Jackson. 'Whatever happens to you, you will never know how I feel,' she said. 'Have a great life.' When given an opportunity to speak before being sentenced, Jackson apologized to the girl's families. 'I'd like to say that none of this was supposed to happen,' he said. Erica Gross brought Kamiya to her father's home at around 3.30pm July 1, 2014, before heading to work. About five hours later, Inkster police received a 911 call about shots fired outside a home in the 30000 block of Carlyle Street. Kamiya Gross was shot at a point blank range and was pronounced dead at the scene. She was just 10 days shy of her third birthday, which she had been hoping to celebrate with her many cousins at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant. The toddler was shot in the head and killed while playing on the porch of her father's Inkster, Michigan . All that's left: A pair of pink and black sandals sit on a blood-spattered porch where a toddler was shot dead and two others were wounded . Payback: Police said the fatal attack may have been in retaliation for a shooting at a nightclub in April that left the suspect wounded . Her father, Kenneth French, was taken to a hospital in stable condition, and family friend Chelsea Lancaster, then age 12, was hospitalized in critical condition. The victims were sitting on Kenneth French's porch when a man, later identified as Raymone Jackson, marched up to them and opened fire. Jackson was sentenced to 11 months in the Wayne County Jail in September 2013 in a drug case while on parole for a 2010 drug conviction. He was released in March 2014 for good behavior, about three months before Kamiya was slain. Before he left jail, the Michigan Department of Corrections had the option to pick Jackson up and return him to prison as a violation of parole in the 2010 conviction, but the state declined to do so, a jail spokeswoman said last year.","Kamiya Gross was shot in the head at point blank range in Inkster, Michigan, in July 2014 .

"Whether it be in the boardroom or on the hunting ground, male competition can cause a sudden spike in testosterone levels. Now a new study has found a link between testosterone and the caring side of men when they return home from the 'hunt'. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home. The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Pictured is a family who was involved in the study. Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle . The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer . The study was based on Tsimane people, who are an indigenous population of forager-farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of Bolivia's Amazon basin. Researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle which revolves around small, tight-knit communities that produce their own food. 'Our goal was to look at the interaction between different hormones in motivating behaviour in a naturalistic context,' said Adrian Jaeggi, co-lead author at University of California, Santa Barbara. The study revealed that the higher a man's testosterone has risen during the day, the more the 'love hormone' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home. The researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer, and linked with changes in testosterone (pictured) 'Hunting for subsistence and sharing meat is something people have done for hundreds of thousands of years.' Previous studies have shown that oxytocin makes people more cooperative while testosterone has the opposite effect. Jaeggi said he expected to see a trade-off between the two hormones and was surprised to find the positive relationship between them. When a man tells his wife or girlfriend she looks nice, it’s not because of her new haircut. Instead, it’s his hormones doing the talking. A study found that a whiff of the ‘love chemical’ oxytocin made men rate their partners as being more attractive. And German researchers recently said that oxytocin may also play a key role in monogamy, a trait that is rare among mammals, other than ourselves. The University of Bonn scientists showed 40 young men who claimed to be passionately in love pictures of their partners. They were asked how attractive they found the women after being given a placebo spray to sniff and a burst of oxytocin. Pictures of strangers and of long-term acquaintances, such as work colleagues were also shown. The men, who were in long-term relationships, also underwent scans to check how much the brain areas responsible for rewarding feelings lit up. Lead author Dirk Scheele said: ‘When the men received the oxytocin instead of placebo, the reward system in the brain was very active when viewing their partner and they perceived them as more attractive than other women. ‘We did not detect this effect with pictures of long-standing acquaintances.’ According to Jaeggi and co-lead author Ben Trumble, high testosterone while hunting could be attributed to a 'winner effect' experienced by men making a kill. It could also be related to the status competition that hunting represents for traditional societies such as the Tsimane. In either case, the increased oxytocin could serve as a balance to make the hunters kinder, more generous and more willing to share their bounty. 'Almost half a century ago, it was famously documented that successful Kung hunters were jokingly insulted by others in order to 'cool their hearts' to 'make (them) gentle,' lest pride or boasting disrupt the egalitarian social system common to many foragers,' said senior co-author Michael Gurven. 'Here we observe a potential hormonal analogue consistent with the type of levelling behaviour seen in hunter-gatherer societies.' Another use for both hormones may have to do with post-hunt recovery. Both are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity. 'These men are coming home, they're finished with work for the day, and they're about to eat and share food,' Jaeggi continued. 'So the need to be social coincides with the need to regenerate and it would make sense for the same hormones to facilitate both functions.' To conduct the study, Trumble joined the hunters as they went out into the jungle and attempted to make a kill to feed their families. He then took saliva specimens along the way, collecting them at exact intervals. The oxytocin was measured in the UCSB Human Biodemography Laboratory. Though the sample size is 'not huge,' he and Jaeggi noted, the study 'definitely adds to the current literature in which the interplay between testosterone and oxytocin is often overlooked.' 'I think the 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' effect could potentially be very widespread,' said Jaeggi. 'Reconnecting with their families after a day of separation would have been a very common challenge for men throughout evolutionary history, and oxytocin could help with that.' Another interesting correlation, Trumble noted, is that the average Tsimane hunt lasts eight and a half hours, roughly equivalent to a workday here. As well as helping partners reconnect after a day apart, oxytocin may have use in post-hunt recovery. Both the love hormone and testosterone are shown to assist with muscle rebuilding following physical activity .","Researchers  tracked hormone levels of Tsimane people in Bolivia .
A day spent hunting for food caused a spike in testosterone level .
The larger the spike, the more oxytocin a man produced on arrival home .
Increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer ."

"It brought thousands of cycling fans and a healthy dose of joie de vivre to the Yorkshire countryside. But the Tour de France has been blamed for leaving a much less welcome legacy – an accident blackspot. Before last summer's race, potholes and cracks in the village of Brockholes were smoothed over to provide the elite cyclists with the best surface. Before the race potholes in Brockholes were filled and smoothed to provide cyclists with the best surface. But now residents claim they have been left with an accident blackspot - and the road has been closed . Initially villagers were delighted, but after the cyclists left they  soon realised that the surface of Smithy Place Lane was so smooth cars were sliding across it as they rounded the bend. Now they say the lane has turned into an accident blackspot which they describe as 'deadly' and lethal'. And after a series of crashes highway chiefs seem to agree - as they have used emergency powers to shut the lane. Hairdresser Emilie McLean, 23, of Honley, wrote off her Ford Fiesta when she hit her brakes but failed to stop, smashing into a van. She said: 'It was horrendous. 'I was just driving down when I came round the bend and there was a van coming towards me. I slammed on the brakes but the wheels locked, it was just like being on black ice. There was nothing I could do.' Her car was written off and there was £1,500 damage to the van - but when she reported what happened to the council she received short shrift. After a series of crashes highway chiefs have used emergency powers to shut the lane . 'I just want to know what they are doing about it,' she said. 'What is taking so long?' Another driver, Serena McCluskey, is also in negotiations with her insurance company after the firm ruled she was entirely liable when she too ploughed into the side of a van. Dr McCluskey, a Huddersfield University researcher, described how she braked but her car kept going. She had her eight-year-old daughter in the car at the time and she has now lodged an official complaint with the council. Another local resident, Chris O'Brien, said he believed the road had been a problem since resurfacing work was carried out ahead of last year's Tour de France. 'I have a four-wheel drive but I have come out of there and gone sideways,' he said. 'It's lethal. There's been loads of crashes.' Another resident said: 'The road is deadly. The council smoothed it over and now it's like driving on ice.' A council spokesman said: 'The council is extending the emergency road closure, which expires on March 11, for four weeks. Further investigations are ongoing.'

Police homicide chief Michael Hughes told ABC radio on Friday: ‘I suggest to people, particularly females, they shouldn’t be alone in parks. Scroll down for video . Masa Vukotic who loved pink and 'Lolita Japapese fashion' was murdered at 7pm on Tuesday evening in a Melbourne park . ‘I’m sorry to say that is the case. We just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious.’ The service posted on its Facebook advice to people to try to stay safe that included warnings to stay in well-lit areas if travelling through parks 'late at night.' Victoria's Minister for Women and the Prevention of Family Violence, Fiona Richardson, led the criticism of Hughe's comments. She said he 'undoubtedly has the best interest of women in mind and made comments on radio this morning out of care and concern for women, who are all too often victims of crime.' 'However, hearing a senior police officer say that, as a woman you are not safe going about your leisure activities or daily business, is a sad indictment on our society. 'The community conversation needs to be about stopping men from committing these terrible crimes in the first place, not just about women need to protect themselves.' Community members were quick to point out that Masa was killed at 7pm on Tuesday evening. Meanwhile, devastated friends of Vukotic, who was stabbed to death while exercising in a park, have vowed to wear pink in her honour. Friends of murdered schoolgirl Vukotic have paid tribute to their 'beautiful Princess Marci' on Facebook and organised a picnic memorial in a park for the ‘beautiful, loving, sweet, smart, charismatic and hilarious young woman with a bright future ahead of her’. On Thursday, as 31-year-old man Sean Price was charged with Masa's brutal murder, Victoria Police homicide chief Michael Hughes told ABC radio: ‘I suggest to people, particularly females, they shouldn’t be alone in parks. ‘I’m sorry to say that is the case. We just need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more security conscious.’ ‘The safety of all members of our community is a priority to Victoria Police. We ask that everyone, male or female, take a common sense approach to their safety,’ the police Facebook post said. ‘If you’re walking through a park late at night, stay close to well lit areas or walk with friends where possible. Don’t shut yourself off to the world, keep one ear free when listening to music and keep your valuables secure. We simply ask that everyone stay alert and stay safe.’ Facebook user Pete Bannan replied: ‘It's purely sad that people innocently walking need to be reminded of this.’ Angel Egginton said: ‘This is all well and good but someone was attacked in Doncaster in broad daylight... It doesn't matter anymore we aren’t safe anywhere.’ Carla Regan responded: ‘I have a 6 year old daughter and it scares the hell out of me that one day I will have to let her take on this world alone. This poor girl was going about her daily exercise and was murdered in cold blood, it makes me cry.’ Victoria Police posted a warning on their Facebook page which asked people to try and not be alone in a park at night . 'Everyone who met you loved you marci, you're gone but will never be forgotten,' one of her friends wrote on Facebook . Masa Vukotic, 17, was murdered about 7pm on Tuesday while she was walking on a footpath near her Doncaster home - in Melbourne's east. Pink flowers and a pink rabbit were left at the scene . Erin Manderson said: ‘I understand the common sense safety message, but the timing of this message is wrong. It validates the victim blaming mentality that so many people already have. Thousands of people walk or run day and night with earphones in and should be able to continue to do so without fearing that the person jogging behind them is going to stab them. Awful. Love and strength to her family and friends.’ And Jade Eastwood blasted: ‘I'm sorry but I hardly consider 7pm late at night!’ Ms Vukotic was murdered just five minutes from her Doncaster home in Melbourne's east on Tuesday. Ms Vukotic, known affectionately by her friends as 'Marci', was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve just before 7pm in what police believe was a 'random attack'. On Thursday, Melbourne man Sean Price, 31, was charged with her murder. Police allege he went on a rampage of rape, assault and an attempted car-jacking in the hours after he is accused of killing the 17-year-old and before he handed himself into police. One of Marci's friends drew this beautiful illustration of her holding her pet rabbit Roger . Marci's friends have begun posting photos of themselves wearing pink on Facebook in a touching tribute to the murdered teen . In a Facebook event post for the memorial tribute, Ms Vukotic's friends wrote: ‘On the 28th of this month, we will be holding a memorial for our dear friend. Please, invite your friends to come. No alcohol or drugs are permitted as this is strictly a memorial event. Marci needs to be remembered - her name needs to be known. She was an amazing influence on so many lives.’ The memorial picnic will be held at Queen Victoria Gardens and will be called 'Princess Marci's Royal Picnic'. Her friends are asking people to wear pink or 'Lolita Japapese fashion' as an ode to Masa's style, or something 'rabbit-related' as she was so fond of her pet rabbit, Roger. 'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. On Wednesday night more than 100 mourners visited the crime scene, with her friends dressing in pink to lay flowers where her body was found. 'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' a friend said. Using the hashtag #pinkformarci her friends drew these touching tributes of Princess Marci. One friend wrote: 'I had no pink clothes to wear in her honour so here's a pretty pink piece for the friend we lost' One of her talented friends drew her as an angel with the caption 'rest in peace, Princess' 'She was so full of personality and passion and her sense of humour was incredible.' 'She inspired myself and so many others to love ourselves and be confident in who we are. She never missed a moment to remind her friends that she thought they were wonderful.' Friends spoke fondly of her love of the colour pink, her pet rabbit Roger, dressing up and Japanese fashion. Masa, who only just turned 17 in December, was one of three children from a Serbian family who had moved to Melbourne from Montenegro. Her distressed relatives were pictured arriving at the park following news of her death. Her body was found by police along a walking track when a neighbour called triple zero after hearing screams and saw a man fleeing the scene. She was in cardiac arrest when she was found, but paramedics were unable to save her and she died at the scene. Marci's friends have shared photos her with a bright smile on her face as she dressed up for 'Cosplay' Friends spoke fondly of her love of the colour pink, her pet rabbit Roger, dressing up and Japanese fashion . Police say she was wearing headphones at the time and may not have heard the attacker approaching. Ms Vukotic has been described as a bright girl who knew three languages and was focussed on her dream of becoming a lawyer. 'It's such a shame she'll never reach those dreams now,' a friend said. 'She never let anything or anyone stand in her way. She was passionate and driven and I love her very much.' 'She was an absolutely gorgeous girl and without fail would always make me laugh or smile,' said a friend. 'I can only wish her self-confidence and will to learn inspires others and her memories live on for the years to come.' The friends shared photos of Ms Vukotic with a bright smile on her face as she dressed up for 'Cosplay', where people dress up as fictional characters for conventions. Ms Vukotic has been remembered as a 'loving, sweet, smart' young woman with a zest for life and a bright future .

"A 3,000-year-old Armenian settlement believed they could predict the future by using sheep and cow bones - and what they revealed on one occasion caused them to suddenly flee their homes. In a series of three Bronze Age shrines, archaeologists have found knucklebones of animals with certain sides blackened - like the markings on dice - as well as stamp seals printed onto pieces of dough. Experts believe the artefacts were used by diviners to help leaders plan political strategies - but they were abandoned in place moments before the inhabitants fled the region. Scroll down for video . In three Bronze Age Armenian shrines, archaeologists found knucklebones of animals with certain sides blackened like the markings on dice as well as stamp seals printed onto pieces of dough (pictured). The experts believe the artefacts were used by diviners to help leaders plan political strategies . The reason for the sudden exodus remains unknown, but archaeologists believe the stones and bones suggested their demise was imminent. The bones were marked with burns and other engravings, and were small enough to roll. In one shrine, researchers found 18 pebbles. 'These stones appear to have been selected for their smooth, rounded shape and their colour palette, which ranged from black and dark grey to white, green and red,' wrote Professor Adam Smith, lead author of the study at Cornell University. The shrines were discovered in a hilltop fortress on the Tsaghkahovit Plain of central Armenia. Lithomancy: A form of divination by which the future is told using stones or reflected light from these stones. In modern practices 13 stones are cast and a prediction is made based on how they fall. Osteomancy: The use of bones for divination, or osteomancy, has been performed for thousands of years. In some cultures the bones were burned in a practice known as pyro-osteomancy. Aleuromancy: This is the practice of baking messages inside cakes or cookies, which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told. Dice-like knucklebones used for osteomancy and coloured stones used for lithomancy were found deep within the ruins of the fallen citadel of Gegharot. Aleuromancy  is a likely explanation for grinding implements found in another of three shrines. Aleuromancy was a practice in which messages would be baked inside of cakes or cookies, which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told. 'What is conspicuous about the grinding installation in the east citadel shrine is the lack of a formal oven for bread baking,' Professor Smith wrote. The shrine's basin 'was clearly used for burning materials and certainly could have been used to bake small balls of dough, but it is unlikely that it would have been used to cook loaves of bread.' The stamps may have been used to seal messages within the dough. The Tsaghkahovit Plain was sparsely populated until around 1500 BC when a nameless group of people began to build strongholds and new institutions of rule there. 'It was a time of radical inequality and centralised practices of economic redistribution,' Professor Smith added, 'and the political leaders were scrambling to hold on to their power. In particular, dice-like knucklebones used for osteomancy and coloured stones used for lithomancy were found deep within the ruins of the fallen citadel of Gegharot. Aleuromancy - divination through the use of flour - is a likely explanation for grinding implements found in another of the three shrines (pictured) The shrines were in use for a century until the area was destroyed. Divination paraphernalia appeared to have been abandoned before the inhabitants fled and experts said it's hard to know whether the citadel's demise was foreseen. A clay idol is shown left while the right image shows what is considered another idol . 'Knowing what the future held was critically important.' During the time these shrines were active, a written form of language had not yet emerged in this part of Armenia so there are no written records of its local rulers. The diviner, Professor Smith continued, would have been a kind of an early risk analyst, assessing strategies and advising on politics and finances. 'We call them 'shrines' because of two distinctive qualities of the spaces: they were quite intimate in scale, with not much room for public spectacle,' Professor Smith explained. 'Yet they appear to have been religiously charged places, designed and built to host esoteric rituals with consecrated objects - secretive rites focused on managing risks by diagnosing present conditions and prognosticating futures.' During the time these shrines were active, a written form of language had not yet emerged in this part of Armenia and so there are no written records of its local rulers. The diviner would have been a kind of an early risk analyst, assessing strategies and advising on politics and finances. The fortress remains are pictured . Elsewhere the archaeologists uncovered clay bowls filled with smaller ash and ceramic artefacts. They suspect that, as part of an ancient ritual, rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances. The altar and basin of a shrine excavated on the fortress' citadel is shown . The shrines were in use for a century until the area was destroyed by conflict. The group that controlled Gegharot was likely wiped out as a result. The Bronze Age in the Caucasus region can be divided into two parts - the Middle Bronze Age from around 2,500 to 1500BC, and the Late Bronze Age from 1500 down to 900 BC. The earlier part is famous for its rich burials from localised cultures. In the later Bronze Age a far more homogenous culture came into being. The Late Bronze Age also saw an increase in the number of hillforts sites. These had begun in the Middle Bronze Age and reached their peak in the early Iron Age. Their divination paraphernalia, meticulously unearthed by the archaeologists, looks as if it had been abandoned in place. Professor Smith added that without Bronze Age mystics to interpret the bones and stones, it's hard to know whether the citadel's demise was presciently foreseen. 'It doesn't appear to have been reoccupied,' said Professor Smith. 'It was probably attacked by one of its neighbours...but these practices probably went on in neighbouring areas. 'We're now trying to figure out what exactly happened to these ancient people.' Elsewhere, the archaeologists uncovered clay bowls filled with smaller ash and ceramic artefacts in these shrines. Archaeologists found two funnels (Figures A & B) ) that were used to burn substances at the shrine site . The shrines were discovered in a hilltop fortress in Gegharot on the Tsaghkahovit Plain of central Armenia. Gegharot is a town in the Aragatsotn Province. The Tsaghkahovit Plain was sparsely populated until around 1500 BC when a nameless gourp of people began to build strongholds and new institutions of rule there . The researchers suspect that, as part of an ancient ritual, local rulers would reach an altered state of mind by drinking wine and burning substances. 'Our best evidence of this comes from pollen washes,' Professor Smith told MailOnline. 'We take the pottery and wash with distilled water. We then capture the run off. From this we found residues of grape, and something similar to Ephedra which is a stimulant.' The shrines were found close together at Gegharot. Workshops dedicated to metal, bone and stone tool production were also found in this region .","Bronze Age shrines were found on Tsaghkahovit Plain in central Armenia .

"Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of running away from the leaders debates after he refused to take part in any during the election campaign . David Cameron tonight flatly refused to appear in televised leaders debates during the election campaign - despite Britain's biggest broadcasters threatening to go ahead without him. Number 10 said the Prime Minister's position was 'clear' – reiterating that he was willing to do one seven-way debate at the end of March but no more. Downing Street's response came after the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 rejected his 'final offer' – and threatened to 'empty chair' him if he did not show up. They said they would stick to their plan for three debates during April - including a head-to-head showdown between Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband - and urged Mr Cameron to 'reconsider' his refusal to take part in these shows. Downing Street had written to the broadcasters on Wednesday saying the PM's 'final offer' was a single 90-minute debate featuring at least seven leaders before March 30. But in a joint statement, the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven-way debate involving Mr Cameron, Labour's Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg of the Lib Dems and the leaders of the Greens, Ukip, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru on ITV on April 2. This would be followed by a second show on BBC featuring the same line-up on April 16 and a final one-on-one clash between the Tory and Labour leaders on Sky News and Channel 4 on April 30 - exactly a week before the May 7 election. In a letter to Mr Oliver, the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if Mr Cameron decides not to take part - effectively 'empty-chairing' the Prime Minister. They wrote: 'We very much hope that all invited leaders will participate in the broadcast debates. 'However, in the end all we can do - as impartial public service broadcasters - is to provide a fair forum for debates to take place. It will always remain the decision of individual leaders whether or not to take part.' Mr Clegg called on the Prime Minister to join the debates in a message on Twitter: 'Come on, David Cameron, you haven't got your own way so accept it and take part.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Prime Minister's was running scared of taking him on in leaders debates . The Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Prime Minister should accept the broadcasters' decision . Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel Four had called Mr Cameron's bluff . But Number 10 immediately hit back at the broadcasters tonight. Craig Oliver, Downing Street's director of communications, replied to the broadcasters: 'I made the Prime Minister's final position clear in my last letter – he is willing to do a seven-way debate in the week beginning March 23rd. 'Clearly it is disappointing that you are not prepared to take him up on that offer. 'I am ready to discuss at your convenience the logistics of making the debate we have suggested happen. Best wishes, Craig Oliver.' The Prime Minster's Director of Communications Craig Oliver has written to the broadcasters tonight . The standoff leaves the prospect of election debates hanging by a thread. In their statement, the broadcasters said: 'Today the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky confirm they will continue with the series of televised leaders' debates as planned in the general election campaign. 'The broadcasters welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has for the first time agreed to take part in a televised debate. 'However, the group believes there needs to be two seven-way debates of a minimum of two hours each, within the election campaign, allowing time to properly represent the views of all parties, covering a broad range of subjects. 'The broadcasters also believe that a head-to-head debate between the two individuals who could become prime minister - David Cameron and Ed Miliband - is important - something the Prime Minister has publicly supported.' They added: 'The broadcasters would like the Prime Minister to reconsider taking part in all of these debates. Twenty-two million people watched the leaders' debates in 2010 and there is a public desire and expectation for them to happen again in 2015 . 'The broadcasters' proposals have come after extensive work over the last six months to ensure the public have the opportunity to watch televised election debates once more. 'The group have worked in an independent, impartial manner, treating invited parties on an equitable basis. They have listened to the views expressed by all parties and adapted the proposals to take into account electoral support. 'The broadcasters will continue to work closely with all parties invited to take part in the televised debates to bring them to their millions of viewers across the UK. The heads of news of all four broadcasters would welcome the opportunity to meet Mr Cameron, or his representatives, to discuss the debates.' Following stormy exchanges on the debates at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons on Wednesday, Sky News and Channel 4 said they were ready to move the two-header debate to another date if Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband could agree on a preferred day. The new statement made clear that this offer remains on the table. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett and the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon have attacked the the Prime Minister's stance over the debates . In the letter to Mr Oliver, the broadcasters said elements of the debate he proposed had not been 'fully thought through'. They said his proposal involved 'an idea that you had not raised in the previous six months of discussions' on the debates. The letter said: 'We believe the proposal for just one debate of 90 minutes duration is insufficient to cover the main election issues with seven participants. 'Our two x two-hour debates format will allow all seven leaders sufficient time to discuss properly a good range of the main election issues. One 90-minute debate with seven leaders would inevitably lead to much less ground being covered, with much shorter contributions from all involved.' They added: 'We have given your proposal serious consideration but we don't think it achieves the goal of providing our viewers with election debates that can properly explore a reasonably full range of issues.' Nigel Farage has claimed the Prime Minister has set out from the start to ruin the leaders debates . In a sign that they will keep the door open for Mr Cameron to perform a last-minute U-turn, they said: 'The debates will go ahead and we anticipate millions of viewers will find them valuable as they did in 2010. 'Our invitations will remain open to all the invited leaders right up to broadcast. We'll set no deadlines for final responses. We very much hope all the leaders will participate.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he would 'accept the challenge' of taking part, even though he preferred the broadcasters' earlier proposal for a four-way debate featuring himself, Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg. He said: 'I'm pleased that the broadcasters have stood firm at last but it would have been far better had they stuck with their original proposal which included fewer parties. But nonetheless we accept the challenge.'","Number 10 said PM would do one seven-way debate at the end of March .

"One in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in, with more than £12 billion needed to sort out repairs, a new study has revealed. Emergency funding by the Government after last year's floods helped drive a 33% increase in pothole repairs, but there has been no reduction in the amount needed to bring the network in England and Wales up to scratch, said a report. The Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) said £12.16billion was needed to get the local road network back into 'reasonable' condition, adding that money spent on filling 2.7 million potholes in the past year had been 'wasted'. The estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years, said the report. One in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in, with more than £12 billion needed to sort out repairs, a new study has revealed . The annual survey also found a 'dramatic' increase in the amount paid in compensation to motorists in England, doubling to more than £20 million outside London. The staffing costs to local authorities for processing claims increased to almost £18 million, equivalent to 225 hours per month per authority, it was found. Alan Mackenzie, chairman of the AIA, said: 'The Government's emergency funding for pothole and flood repair following last year's wet winter has clearly contributed to the trends reported in this year's survey. 'Essentially, the money spent on filling the 2.7 million potholes reported is wasted - it is inefficient and short term in its effectiveness. 'So, while we understand that the Department for Transport is promoting permanent repairs, the point remains that money would be better spent preventing potholes forming in the first place. 'The £6 billion of funding pledged between 2015 and 2021 is welcome, and hopefully will be confirmed by an incoming government. But the truth is that although it sounds like a big investment, it will only be enough for local authorities to tread water and it will do nothing to tackle the backlog or prevent continuing deterioration.' Peter Box, transport spokesman at the Local Government Association, said: 'Councils fixed more potholes than ever before last year - one every 15 seconds - despite spiralling multi-million pound compensation costs and funding cuts. The estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years, a new report claims . 'It is hugely frustrating yet unsurprising that, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to make a dent in the £12 billion roads repair backlog. Patching up our crumbling road network is simply not the answer to tackle the roads crisis we face as a country. 'Councils need billions, not millions, to bring our roads up to scratch. Every mile of motorways and trunk roads will receive £1.4 million funding over the next six years compared with £31,000 per mile for local roads. This makes little sense given the Government's own traffic projections predict an increase in local traffic of more than 40% by 2040.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'Back in 2010 the top transport priority amongst voters was filling in the potholes. Five years later and an RAC Foundation poll shows fixing our roads and pavements remains the public's number one concern. 'The extra chunks of cash spent on road maintenance over the last parliament have been welcome but with a record number of cars on the road, rising traffic volume and routine resurfacing work taking place only half as frequently as in the 1980s, this issue is unlikely to slip far down the list of things people want ministers to tackle.'","One in six roads are still in poor shape even after millions of potholes fixed .

"An epileptic hospital patient was forced to sleep on the floor for four weeks while he was waiting to have a scan on his brain. Michael Collins was kept in a receiving ward, normally for short stays of no more than two days, after being admitted to the Royal Infirmary in Glasgow. He hit his head during an epileptic seizure, making him prone to violent outbursts - so hospital staff removed his bed from the room and made him sleep on a mattress on the floor. It took three weeks before Mr Collins, 54, was given a chair, and though he has now moved to another hospital he is still waiting for an MRI scan six weeks after the accident. Hospital: Michael Collins had to spend four weeks in a room without a bed while waiting for a scan . Relatives of the former roofer, from Glasgow, are desperate to find out what is wrong with him, but until he has the scan - which will take around 45 minutes - they are still in the dark. His partner Suzanne Brown, 50, said: 'We took him to A&E at the Royal and he was kept in overnight. 'He had another fit the next morning so they kept him in for another few days. But a couple of days later he walked out of the hospital at 3.30am. 'He threw all his medication away and walked out dressed only in his slippers, pyjamas and housecoat. 'Clearly, mentally he was not right. Before he banged his head he was fine. He had no mental health issues whatsoever.' Precaution: Mr Collins had to sleep on a mattress on the floor after he behaved violently . Waiting: He did not even get a chair in the room for his first three weeks in hospital . Ms Brown initially took Mr Collins to the GP after he hit his head, and was then referred to A&E. 'We waited seven hours in casualty,' she said. 'Then he was put in a receiving ward. You are supposed to be there for a maximum of two days. 'He was supposed to be going to the Southern to get an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture but they cancelled his appointments three times. 'They're sedating him because of his outburst in the waiting room but he's not that kind of man. It's terrible to see him like this. 'I know there is something wrong with his brain. If they would just give him the scan we could find out what is the matter with him. 'I thought they would at least have given him a bed with cot sides so he couldn't get out or do himself an injury. A&E: Mr Collins spent four weeks at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, pictured, before moving to another hospital . 'When he went in at first he was quite violent, throwing things about, so they took everything out of his room. 'He keeps going back to when he was a boy and still thinks his mum and dad are alive.' Ms Brown praised the way doctors and nurses looked after Mr Collins before he was moved to the Southern General Hospital, but criticised the NHS for failing to treat him promptly. A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'The patient presented with extremely challenging behaviour and for his own protection and personal safety had to be nursed with only a mattress in his room. 'We accept there were delays in transferring him to the Southern General. We also accept a delay in providing the appropriate tests which need to be undertaken with specialist clinical input. 'These have now been arranged to be undertaken this week.'","Michael Collins hit his head during a fit and was admitted to hospital .

"Anyone who has flown back from a holiday at night will have marvelled at the twinkling blanket of lights that cover towns and cities after dark. But the crew of the ISS has gone one better, by capturing this light show from the International Space Station's orbit around 250 miles (400km) above the Earth. The six-second Vine loop was posted at 9.32pm GMT last night and shows the station soaring over the UK and Scandinavia. Scroll down for video . The bright section of light in the east of the UK is London (pictured). Cornwall and Devon are in relative darkness. As the station moves towards Scandinavia, the bright lights of Brussels and Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in The Netherlands can be seen . The Vine was taken by Expedition 42 crew member Samantha Cristoferetti. During the clip, the ISS begins by approaching the UK from the south west hitting Cornwall first, the north west coast of France is visible in the bottom right-hand corner but Paris is just out of shot. The bright section of light in the east of the UK is London, while Devon and Cornwall are in relative darkness. And as the station moves towards Scandinavia, the bright lights of Brussels and Antwerp in Belgium and Rotterdam in The Netherlands can be seen.

The Italian astronaut then posted the same tweet in her native language . The team is due to return to Earth in May. Tweeting the Vine from her @astrosamantha Twitter handle, Ms Cristoferetti wrote: 'Of all the lights from UK to Scandinavia...which ones are yours? #spacevine'. The Italian astronaut then posted the same tweet in her native language. During her four-month stay on the station Ms Cristoferreti has filmed herself getting a haircut in space and released a collection of images called Nasa: Landscapes. One of the most striking images in this collection shows the lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January. The 37-year-old flight engineer - alongside her colleagues commander Barry Wilmore, flight engineer Terry Virts and Russian cosmonauts Elena Serova, Alexander Samoukutyaev and Anton Shkaplerov - has been on board the station (pictured) since 9 November last year . The current Expedition 42 crew on ISS recently created a collection of images taken from the station of landscapes on Earth. One of the most striking photos shows the glittering lights of the south coast of England and the north coast of France, taken above the English Channel in January (pictured). It shows concentrations of light in major towns and in the distance a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows . It shows concentrations of light in major cities and towns and in the distance, on the curvature of the Earth, a green light that looks like the Northern Lights glows. The entire International Space Station was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station. The remarkable manoeuvre saw a European spacecraft ‘slow’ the speed of the station. This changed the height of its orbit  by about 1.6 miles (2.5km), before the station was spun back again to its original position. This is the same location where this Vine was taken. The International Space Station is marking its 15th anniversary of continuous human occupation on 2 November this year and since Expedition 1 in 2000, the space station has been visited by more than 215 people. As of November 2014, there have been 100 Russian launches, 37 space shuttle launches, one test flight and three operational flights by SpaceX’s Dragon as well as a test flight and two operational flights by Orbital Science’s Cygnus. A total of 184 spacewalks have been conducted in support of space station assembly totaling over 1,152 hours, or approximately 48 days. The space station, including its large solar arrays, spans the area of a U.S. football field, including the end zones, and weighs 924,739 pounds. The complex now has more livable room than a conventional six-bedroom house, and has two bathrooms, a gymnasium and a 360-degree bay window. A second image in the Nasa: Landscapes collection was taken above the big island of Hawaii in the North Pacific Ocean. It was captured on 28 February and the peaks of volcanoes Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea can be seen in the centre of the 4,028 square mile (10,432 square kilometre) land mass. Mauna Loa is the world's largest, and one of its most active, volcanoes .","The International Space Station will celebrate its 15th anniversary of continuous human occupation in November .
